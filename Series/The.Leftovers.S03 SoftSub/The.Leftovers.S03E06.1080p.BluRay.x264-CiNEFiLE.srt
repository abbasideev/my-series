1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,253
I gave up.

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,174
After the four miscarriages, we tried IVF.

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,593
40 grand for three eggs.

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,056
We joked about
how we were gonna end up with triplets

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,600
and whether we should
make their names rhyme.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,770
But none of them stuck.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,066
Not the names, the eggs.

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,445
And that was that.

9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,199
I gave up. No baby for me.

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:41,791
And then five years went by and we finally
stopped bullshitting about adoption,

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,502
and then it just...

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,840
Happened.

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,218
I was pregnant.

14
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,555
And he was...

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,142
Perfect.

16
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,687
His name is Sam.

17
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,233
Six months later,

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,655
I walk into the laundromat
and I strap him into his car seat.

19
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,535
And he was crying, so I didn't kiss him.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,497
I knew that once the car was moving,
he'd calm down.

21
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,713
And then he was gone.

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,890
So, I sit in the parking lot
and wait all day,

23
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,477
because he could come back, right?

24
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,689
They could all come back.

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,194
And if they did, it'd be on the exact spot
where they disappeared from.

26
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,617
So, my son, who doesn't even know
how to crawl, I mean...

27
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,121
He didn't. It's been two years.
Maybe he's older now?

28
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,375
But he could just reappear
in a fucking parking lot.

29
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,880
And if I'm not there, if I'm not there
when he comes back, what happens?

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,551
Do you think he even remembers me?

31
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,012
I should stop.

32
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,265
That's what my husband said.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,519
I need to give up, right?

34
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,856
Right?

35
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,777
Are you gonna say something?

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,994
You know there are two of those bitches
in white standing out front right now,

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,538
smoking their fucking cigarettes?

38
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,706
They probably think your patients
are easy pickings.

39
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,585
If I asked them to tell me what to do,
they'd at least write it down for me.

40
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,673
Is that what I should do?

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,053
Tell me what to fucking do.

42
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,190
I don't know.

43
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,127
Tell me what to do.

44
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,026
Hey, Pop.

45
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,029
Hey, Lorelei.

46
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,033
What you got there?

47
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,245
Shoes.

48
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
That's one hell of a shiner.

49
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,713
You should see the other guy.

50
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,384
I take it your husband told you
we were here.

51
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,886
Which husband?

52
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,642
I heard you were with
the good Reverend Jamison.

53
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,353
He coming, too?

54
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,564
No.

55
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,984
He gave me something for you, though.

56
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,374
He says he's sorry
he didn't put you in his fucking book.

57
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,128
Who torched it?

58
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,256
Your son.

59
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,134
Is he here?

60
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,261
He was.

61
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,599
Right now,
he's off having himself a think.

62
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,684
A think about what?

63
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,396
We asked him to die.

64
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,733
Again.

65
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,329
Whatever is happening here,

66
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,582
I wanna be a part of it.

67
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,526
- What happened?
- Dog bit me.

68
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,529
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little rabies.

69
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,828
-Is it them?
-You tell me.

70
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,084
Oh !

71
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,046
Dr. Bekker and Dr. Eden.

72
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,758
Yeah, that's them.

73
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,722
-Told you it was the right house.
-They don't look like physicists to me.

74
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,099
What are physicists supposed to look like?

75
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,227
I don't know. Shouldn't they be wearing
lab coats or something?

76
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,486
So now what?

77
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,239
Now? Now we wait.

78
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,539
So, I wake up, and my leg is killing me.

79
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,834
I got a tube in my arm,
another one up my dick,

80
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,086
Christopher Sunday is dead,

81
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,924
and I don't know where I am
or how the fuck I got there.

82
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,929
And by there, I mean here.

83
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,269
So, I am discom-fucking-bobulated.

84
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,275
I'm lost. I'm in fucking agony.

85
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,656
I am in so much pain,
I can't fucking see straight.

86
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,620
So I got my hands
on some of the dog's pain pills.

87
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,873
I popped them and soon realized

88
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,168
they were a bit more powerful
than the human variety.

89
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,047
So, I passed out hard,

90
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,467
and when I wake up, I go outside,

91
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,222
and that is the first time
I lay eyes upon this young lady.

92
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,819
And she was drowning the police officer?

93
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,362
Mm-hmm.

94
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,197
Whose name is Kevin.

95
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Correct.

96
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,993
It was a horrible mistake,

97
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,328
and I will be taking responsibility
for what I've done.

98
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,252
I'm not sure she understands.

99
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,504
I understand.

100
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:28,802
You want to drown Kevin
so that he can go to this place

101
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,512
where the dead people are.

102
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,724
And while he's there, he's going to learn
a song from one of the dead people

103
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,851
and he's gonna bring that song back to you

104
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,688
so you can sing it and stop the biblical
flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.

105
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,482
That about covers it.

106
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,986
And you've...

107
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,865
You've told all this to Kevin
and he's actually considering it.

108
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,033
Yeah.

109
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,037
He got one of Grace's horses, headed out,
said he'd be back by sundown.

110
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,207
And you think that Evie...

111
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,504
That she's in this place, too?

112
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,590
Why wouldn't she be?

113
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,431
Well, so everybody wants something.

114
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,226
A brain, a heart, courage.

115
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,562
Kevin's in the Emerald City.

116
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,231
He's the one that's gonna give it to you.

117
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,778
All right, Dorothy, let's have it.

118
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,573
Tell us we're lunatics.

119
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,786
Yeah, it sounds crazy, but...

120
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,040
These are crazy times, huh?

121
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,424
So, when Kevin comes back,
you're not gonna jam us up?

122
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,427
No.

123
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,930
I'm not gonna jam you up.

124
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,769
You don't think he's coming back.

125
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,942
Well, it's a lot to put on someone,
asking for all that help.

126
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:12,114
I mean, if it were me,
I would just keep riding.

127
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,034
Get as far from this as possible.
But Kevin, he'll come back.

128
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,704
He always does.

129
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,150
G'day. Miss Playford?

130
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:49,985
No, sir.

131
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,863
And who might you be?

132
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,616
My name is Maria Carmen Rodriguez.

133
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,494
Date of birth, 8-30-80.

134
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,831
This is a copy of
this morning's Las Noticias.

135
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,794
This was my choice and mine alone.

136
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,046
I indemnify all others.

137
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,217
I'm of sound mind and body,
and give consent to go...

138
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,180
To go wherever they went.

139
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,850
Amen.

140
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,857
So, the two women in that house,
they recorded this?

141
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,692
One would assume.

142
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,863
And we're also assuming
they're just gonna lead us right to this

143
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,698
device they told you about?

144
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,202
You don't have to stay, Laurie.
You can go help Kevin.

145
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,746
Kevin's still at the airport.

146
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,499
Last I checked,
all the flights were grounded.

147
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,626
Well, Michael and John will call me
if they need me.

148
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,377
I'm happy to keep helping here.

149
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,379
You already helped
by finding me the address.

150
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,549
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna let me see this

151
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,760
suicide machine for myself?

152
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,096
-It's not a suicide machine.
-It's not?

153
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,891
'Cause it sure seems like an incredibly
elegant way to kill yourself.

154
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,728
If I was gonna kill myself,
I'd just go scuba diving.

155
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,900
What?

156
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,902
There are lots of ways to die when
you're scuba diving.

157
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,322
Your oxygen tank can break.

158
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,450
You can get a bubble in your blood
that gives you a stroke.

159
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,910
I know. I'm certified.

160
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,412
And Laurie Murphy was certified.

161
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,291
She'd logged hundreds of hours
underwater, but accidents happen.

162
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,960
What a senseless tragedy.

163
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,884
And then Jill and Tom and John
are standing there at the funeral,

164
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,095
and they're protected.

165
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,890
They'll never know that you twisted
the knob the wrong direction

166
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,433
because you wanted to.

167
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,019
And just like that, you were gone.

168
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,105
Clean, quiet certainty.

169
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,607
Fully explained.

170
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,194
Now, that's fucking elegant.

171
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,781
Can I have a napkin, please?

172
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,743
Or if you're going for inelegant,
you could just do it like Matt here.

173
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,955
Know your cancer's back, tell no one,

174
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,792
get no treatment,
pray for divine fucking intervention.

175
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,794
- That's not fair.
- Yes, it is.

176
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,881
-I deserve that.
-You...

177
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,966
You don't wanna kill yourself.

178
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,135
I know suicidal when I see it.

179
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,762
You know suicidal when you see it?

180
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,723
Is that one of your psychic powers?

181
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,184
- I don't have psychic powers.
- Mm !

182
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,478
Oh, that's right. It's John who's psychic.

183
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,481
Come on. You know how it works.

184
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,818
I don't, actually,
'cause I never got a reading.

185
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,654
Why don't you do me?

186
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,740
What?

187
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,327
If I came to your house
and John took my handprint

188
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,370
and I sat down across from him
at the table

189
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,332
and I told him
that I wanted to talk to my kids,

190
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,168
what would you tell him to say to me
in his little earpiece?

191
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,004
- We don't do departures.
- Uh...

192
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,423
Do our parents. They're dead.

193
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,008
Okay.

194
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,676
Um...

195
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, I'd start on the Internet.

196
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:08,433
Look at social media, pictures,
um, personal details.

197
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,352
Like, your parents, how did they die?

198
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,729
In a fire when we were kids.

199
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,648
I didn't know that.

200
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,733
No, fuck my parents.

201
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,361
I wanna talk to my kids.

202
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,988
I just told you, Nora.
We don't do departures.

203
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,699
You did departures when you and your pals
had life-size replicas

204
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,702
made of my family and then sat them down
at my kitchen table.

205
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,288
Come on.

206
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,999
Let me have it.

207
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,712
I can't, Nora. I'm sorry.

208
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,214
Why not?

209
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,342
Because we tried it and it doesn't work.

210
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,514
We had to stop after the third time
John was attacked.

211
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,891
Yeah.

212
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,394
Look, death is easy.

213
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,647
People just want finality,
an end to their grief.

214
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,066
But with departures, there is no end.

215
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,735
And if we indicated otherwise

216
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,990
by just saying we were able to communicate
with those individuals,

217
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,243
it made their loved ones very, very angry.

218
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,247
Because they didn't want closure.

219
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,752
I want fucking closure.

220
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,679
I know.

221
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,434
That's why we're here.

222
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,988
-He's gonna find that body.
-Well, let's hope he doesn't.

223
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,449
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

224
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,578
Matt gave this to you? Is he okay?

225
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,497
Yeah, he's fine. He's still with Nora.

226
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,292
And where is Nora?

227
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,920
Uh, sorry. I can't disclose that.

228
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,134
You can't disclose it?

229
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,429
Look, when we all found Nora in the hotel,

230
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,182
you said you were going to the airport
to be with Kevin.

231
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,642
And he wasn't there.

232
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:19,856
So I called him
and he actually answered his phone.

233
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,109
He said he was here
and that we should come.

234
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,904
-So why didn't you tell me?
-Because you don't believe in this.

235
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,947
-Hey, just calm down.
-No.

236
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,493
She just shows up.

237
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,537
She won't even tell us
how she even knew we were here.

238
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,042
You wanna disclose
how you got that black eye?

239
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,879
I got it from Nora.

240
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,260
She hit you?

241
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,182
Thought you were supposed to
be helping her.

242
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,685
-I did help her.
-And now she's helping us, right?

243
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,190
That's right. That's right.

244
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,198
Hey!

245
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,492
You wanna give us a hand?

246
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,750
What are those?

247
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,335
Steroids.

248
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,713
You got any painkillers?

249
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,008
-Headache?
-Nah. My uterus hurts.

250
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,971
Before you got to the hotel, I went to
a clinic and got my IUD taken out.

251
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,849
And they said it might be a little sore.
Told me to take a couple ibuprofen.

252
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,225
Jesus.

253
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,685
So you're trying again.

254
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,270
What?

255
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,814
Nothing. I just thought you would...

256
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,441
Might be done after you gave Lily back
to her mother.

257
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,734
I am done.

258
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,495
Still smoking, huh?

259
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,830
No, I quit.

260
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,749
I haven't had a cigarette
since John and I got together.

261
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,626
You stopped for him?

262
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:09,215
No. I stopped for myself.
It's an incredibly self-destructive habit.

263
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,426
That's what makes it so cool.

264
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,767
My lighter?

265
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,478
Can I have it back, please?

266
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,480
You said you quit.

267
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,816
-I did.
-Then you don't need it.

268
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,614
Please give it back.

269
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,658
Like I did with Lily?

270
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,371
Give me the lighter, Nora.

271
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,623
Come on, Nora.

272
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,626
-She said she doesn't need it.
-Give it to me!

273
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,545
Hey! Get off! Shit!

274
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,005
- Get off!

275
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,506
Shit.

276
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,967
Oh, God. Shit. Are you okay?

277
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,552
-They're leaving.
-What?

278
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,762
They're leaving !

279
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,393
Fuck.

280
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,572
Go down.

281
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,625
What the fuck?

282
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,629
You steal this thing?

283
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,299
Said the man who just assaulted
an officer of the law.

284
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,511
Eh, he'll be fine. I had no choice.

285
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,430
His chief's in a tarp
under the goddamn church.

286
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,099
He was heading right for it.

287
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,059
Where are you gonna take him?

288
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,689
Far enough away from civilization
to give us time.

289
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,941
You're just gonna leave him?

290
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,151
Well, here's the good news.

291
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,280
If this thing with Kevin doesn't work,
who gives a shit?

292
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,950
Officer Koala Fart here is gonna drown
in the flood tomorrow

293
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,451
along with all the rest of us.

294
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,622
But if it does work, sweet Lorelei,

295
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,293
I will be honored to spend
my remaining days

296
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,546
locked away from the world I just saved.

297
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,593
It's getting late.
I should be getting dinner ready.

298
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,762
I'll be back before it's on the table.

299
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,479
Storm's coming.

300
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,346
What you drinking?

301
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,265
Just some coffee.

302
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,934
Want some?

303
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,985
Oh, Jesus, that's good.

304
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:25,578
Remember when we went to coffee
for the first time, just you and me?

305
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,582
Of course I do.

306
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,543
I was hurting.

307
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,881
You reached across the table,
took my hands, and looked at me,

308
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,967
and I felt like
I could've told you anything.

309
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,887
But what I couldn't tell you...

310
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,265
I thought my daughter
might still be alive.

311
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,481
Erika never doubted it.
She took it in and moved on.

312
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,651
But me, I just...
I just couldn't believe it.

313
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,906
I should've told you.

314
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,621
Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked
you into helping people

315
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,957
talk to their dead relatives.

316
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,044
I thought I was helping you.

317
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,255
Should've taken the hint
when you shredded the money.

318
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,675
No, I shredded the money
because what we were doing wasn't real.

319
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,218
And this is.

320
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,178
Is it?

321
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,522
Do you want Kevin to ask Evie
why she left her family?

322
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,816
No.

323
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,652
I asked him to give her a message.

324
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,863
I want her to know that she was loved.

325
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,707
That's beautiful, John.

326
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,555
One of Grace's kids
was fostered out of a local tribe.

327
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
He loved boats.

328
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,186
When his family found out he died,

329
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,147
some of his cousins came down here
to leave a mark.

330
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,483
Grace told them to strip the church.

331
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,528
Took the wood from the church
to make a tombstone for the little boy.

332
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,863
A memorial.

333
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,073
Then that crazy old man got here

334
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,577
and became convinced
it was a part of his flood story.

335
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,413
I still believe him.

336
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,376
Because if I throw out his story,
that means I got to throw out mine, too.

337
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,423
Go ahead. Tell me I'm crazy.

338
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,386
Tell me we've gone too far.

339
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,976
Tell me, and we can go home right now
and forget all this.

340
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,315
Because I can still shred it.

341
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,618
I think you gotta see it through, John.

342
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,293
You're so close.

343
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,764
You're getting too close!

344
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,057
They're gonna see you !

345
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,643
Calm down. I know what I'm doing.

346
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,193
Is your eye okay?

347
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,237
Yeah, it's fine.

348
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,657
I wasn't trying to hit you.

349
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,492
C'est la vie.

350
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,997
Did you hear about the guy
on the French submarine?

351
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,456
- What?
- The one who fired the nuke.

352
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,208
Apparently, he thought
there was some big egg

353
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,168
in a volcano in the middle of the Pacific,

354
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,171
and he was convinced
that this giant seven-headed sea monster

355
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,507
was gonna hatch on the 14th
and eat us all.

356
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,759
He said he got the idea from Revelations.

357
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,386
That's ridiculous.

358
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,681
Revelations is not supposed to
be taken literally.

359
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,183
The seven-headed monster, it's a metaphor.

360
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,561
Oh... So it's only literal
when it's not ridiculous?

361
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,104
- That's right.

362
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,689
You would know.

363
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,525
So, let's say this guy comes
and sits on your couch

364
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,403
and he says, "Hey, Doc, I have access
to nuclear weapons

365
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,780
"and I need to destroy Godzilla."

366
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,658
What do you even say to someone like that?

367
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,494
"Don't miss."

368
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,499
Hello?

369
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,501
Laurie, hey. It's Michael.

370
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,046
Hi. Are you at the airport?

371
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,757
No. We're at...
It's a ranch outside of Melbourne.

372
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,967
You're at a ranch? What--

373
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:54,305
Kevin wasn't at the airport.
He was at this ranch. He's here right now.

374
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,973
His dad found him.

375
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,434
He's with his dad? Okay.

376
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,020
-Um... What--
-You've got to come now, Laurie.

377
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,396
- 5 Pigeon Run Road.
- Okay.

378
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,148
Outside Makarra.

379
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,442
5 Pigeon Run Road.

380
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,445
Is your dad there?

381
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,821
Just get here as soon as you can.

382
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,989
- Are you okay?

383
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,867
Hello?

384
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:19,955
What happened?

385
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,750
Kevin's at a ranch with his father.

386
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,254
That's good. Tomorrow's a big day.

387
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,006
We should all be with family.

388
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,846
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus

389
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,182
No, not one

390
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,018
No, not one

391
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,860
No one else could heal

392
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,445
Is this enough carrots?

393
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,199
That's plenty, love.

394
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,623
My husband, he used to do all the cooking.

395
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:08,129
I spent years trying to get the stew
to taste exactly like his.

396
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,257
I even got it right once.

397
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,009
Then I forgot what I did.

398
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,346
Well, it smells delicious.

399
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,102
Was he a good husband?

400
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,147
Kevin.

401
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,566
He was a great husband.

402
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,527
He saved me.

403
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,363
But you divorced him.

404
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,491
Yeah. Well, I joined a cult.

405
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,535
You know, it was just one of those things
they made you do.

406
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,162
Hmm.

407
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,671
I'm so sorry about your children.

408
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,387
Their shoes were missing.

409
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,973
Sorry?

410
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,641
When they found their bodies,

411
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,686
it was clear that they'd been walking
for quite some time,

412
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,063
but their shoes were missing.

413
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:13,068
They weren't here at the house,
they weren't with the kids.

414
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,489
I've covered the ground
in between a hundred times.

415
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:20,826
Looked through every pair donated
to charity inside 100 kilometers.

416
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,206
When Kevin talks to them,

417
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,918
he's gonna ask them
where they put their shoes.

418
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,048
I need to go set the table.

419
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,091
Mind giving it a stir?

420
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,803
Sure.

421
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,201
Not much of a last supper.

422
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,703
Well, you certainly
cleaned your plate for not liking it.

423
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,914
No, the food is scrumptious.

424
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,543
I'm just saying, not much of a last supper
without our Jesus.

425
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,175
I think I'm gonna go to lie down
for a bit.

426
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,304
Wake me when he comes back.

427
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:29,687
Truth is,
along with our missing fucking savior,

428
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,399
we also appear to be short some apostles.

429
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,279
Our friend Matthew, conspicuously absent.

430
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:43,617
Fortunately, I will play
the part of Peter.

431
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,080
You are already John.

432
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,418
What about you, kid?

433
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,338
You wanna be Simon, Bartholomew?

434
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,216
- Pass.
- Oh...

435
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,679
We all have to be somebody.

436
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,475
Somebody who was there
at Christ's last huzzah.

437
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,271
So that would make me Mary Magdalene.

438
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,814
Hmm.

439
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,232
That would be Nora.

440
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,611
Also conspicuously absent.

441
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,991
You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle
and one apostle only.

442
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,160
Thomas.

443
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,870
Doubting Thomas.

444
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,663
Mmm.

445
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,251
When I first started hearing voices
back in Mapleton,

446
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,255
everyone around me told me
I was fucking nuts. Everyone.

447
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,133
Except you.

448
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,802
You were the one person who believed me.

449
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,931
You said those voices were really there.

450
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,228
The next thing I knew,

451
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,275
I was locked up
in a fucking mental institution.

452
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,655
So you're wrong, Pop.

453
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:05,866
I'm not Thomas.

454
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm Judas.

455
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,961
Doubting is easy
because doubting costs you nothing.

456
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,755
But Judas,

457
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:27,721
he was surrounded by people going on
and on about how special Jesus was.

458
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,515
But he betrayed him anyway.

459
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:35,437
Because he was sure.
He believed in something.

460
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,440
And he acted on it.

461
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,735
And then he killed himself.

462
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,488
What, sweetie?

463
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,120
Judas collected his 30 pieces of silvers
and he hung himself.

464
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,581
You all right?

465
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,919
If he was so sure, why'd he kill himself?

466
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,384
Well, Michael, I was not aware
of that part of the story.

467
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,471
I have no idea why he killed himself.

468
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,599
Did he leave a note?

469
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,771
Hey.

470
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,108
Hey, are you...

471
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,778
Hey.

472
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,365
Are you all right?

473
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,162
When?

474
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:35,748
He's fine.

475
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,791
He's just sleeping.

476
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,424
I'm sorry.

477
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,260
It's true...

478
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,074
I borrowed your pills.

479
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,142
Looks real.

480
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,936
Indeed, it does.

481
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:51,573
So, is this the part where you call
the DSD and shut this operation down?

482
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,749
Do you remember when we were kids,
after Mom and Dad died,

483
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:05,212
when everyone at the church
wouldn't take their eyes off us?

484
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,882
And they'd take us to the movies
and bowling and putt-putt

485
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,384
just to keep us busy?

486
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,636
Of course I do.

487
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,306
And this one time,
they brought us to a baseball game,

488
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,935
and I was too young
to get the rules, so I...

489
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,272
I watched these people in another section
hitting a beach ball.

490
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,901
And the whole stadium was getting into it.

491
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,949
And when the ball came over to our seats,
you stood up and you just whacked it.

492
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,829
It was the first time
I'd seen you smile in forever.

493
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,958
But then the ball went into the aisle

494
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,337
and this usher ran down and grabbed it

495
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,883
and he picked it up,
and he just squeezed the air out of it.

496
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:56,096
And then everyone started

497
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:57,890
booing.

498
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:02,853
Not just the people in our section,
but the whole stadium. Booing.

499
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,232
He just ruined it for all of them.

500
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,612
They just wanted to hit the ball.

501
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,125
Why would he wanna do that job?

502
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,838
Why would anyone?

503
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,888
Because if he doesn't,

504
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,642
that ball is gonna go onto the field,

505
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,647
and it'll be fucking chaos.

506
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,181
You can take the van.
I don't need it anymore.

507
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,360
You wanna drive or should I?

508
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,197
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay here
for a while.

509
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,826
People should be
with their families, right?

510
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,370
Okay.

511
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,916
Can you, uh, give this to Senior

512
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:52,421
and tell him I'm sorry
I didn't put him in my fucking book?

513
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,507
And tell Kevin I'm sorry I did.

514
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,803
Thank you.

515
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,018
Do you have to tell them I did this?

516
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,274
Give me a dollar.

517
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,235
- I only have 100s.

518
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,696
Give me, um...

519
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,239
Give me your cigarettes.

520
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,165
Congratulations, Nora Durst.

521
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,500
You are now officially my patient.

522
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,050
Same time next week?

523
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,557
You're on.

524
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:37,984
Hi.

525
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,070
Hey.

526
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,990
John called you?

527
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,575
Michael did.

528
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,331
They said you were with Nora.

529
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,542
I was.

530
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,505
You help her find
what she was looking for?

531
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,675
I think so.

532
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,407
Where's everybody?

533
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,742
Inside, sleeping.

534
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,787
I drugged their food.

535
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,881
Jesus, Laurie.

536
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,092
Well, I wanted to talk to you.
Just the two of us.

537
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,095
I didn't think they would let that happen.

538
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,890
You know what they want me to do?

539
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,562
You came here to talk me out of it?

540
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,774
No. I'm here to say goodbye.

541
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,529
Want a cigarette?

542
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,365
Yeah.

543
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,638
"Don't forget me."

544
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,233
Is this the lighter Jill gave you?

545
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,280
I threw it in a sewer grate
and then went back for it.

546
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,616
- Don't tell Jill that.

547
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,117
That's nothing.

548
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,994
I killed her hamster.

549
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,539
-You what?
-Yeah.

550
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,751
When you guys went down
to that mock UN thing,

551
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,128
didn't fucking feed it.

552
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,173
I went up there about an hour before
you got home and it was dead.

553
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,013
Took it to the neighbor's trash
and threw it in there.

554
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,349
Told you guys it ran away.

555
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,522
Well, rest in peace, Mr. Fuzzy.

556
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,399
Mr. Funny.

557
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,068
It was Mr. Funny.

558
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,487
That's right. It was Mr. fucking Funny.

559
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:36,621
Remember that psychosomatic medical
conference thing I went to in Phoenix?

560
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,165
I lasted two hours.

561
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,918
And then I went to a spa
that cost $2,000 a night.

562
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,465
I hated our house.

563
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,050
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

564
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,346
I mean, I didn't say anything
because it was your money that bought it.

565
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,932
Well, you should've said something.
It was our house.

566
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,142
You loved it.

567
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,478
I wanted you to be happy.

568
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,069
I was pregnant.

569
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,115
What?

570
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,619
I was pregnant.

571
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,746
Sixteen weeks.

572
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,956
I don't, uh...

573
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,250
When?

574
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,881
Seven years ago tomorrow.

575
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,972
I was lying in the doctor's office,
staring at the ultrasound.

576
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,142
Looking right at it.

577
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,436
Then it was gone.

578
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,650
Why didn't you tell me?

579
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,408
I mean, we raised two beautiful kids.

580
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,665
It's the best thing we ever did.

581
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,041
The last best thing.

582
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,753
Did you want another baby?

583
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,256
No.

584
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,342
Me neither.

585
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,310
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to. And then...

586
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,062
Then I didn't have to.

587
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,368
Are you scared?

588
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:43,456
Scared of what?

589
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,460
Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw

590
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,463
and holding you under the water
until you drown.

591
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,718
The last time it happened,

592
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,139
where I went, that was so...

593
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,143
It was real.

594
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,859
Maybe I was dead,
but I had never felt so alive.

595
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,239
But no, I'm not scared.

596
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,165
Then I'm not scared either.

597
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,877
And it could work, so I could come back.

598
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,087
I really hope you do.

599
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,843
Will you stay?

600
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,306
I can't.

601
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,364
Wait, wait, wait.

602
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,867
Forgot your lighter.

603
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,287
Uh, you can keep it. I quit.

604
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,376
Thanks.

605
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,717
Is Nora gone?

606
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,723
We're all gone.

607
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,772
Goodbye, Laurie.

608
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,571
Goodbye, Kevin.

609
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,994
Far out as I can take you
with that storm rolling in.

610
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,705
If you're gonna go, you best go now.

611
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,292
Okay.

612
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,163
Hi, honey.

613
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,833
Mom, thank God you answered.
I have a very important question.

614
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,587
- She doesn't know!
- Shut up! She's gonna remember.

615
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:21,633
Mom, do you remember that one time
when I was, like, five

616
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,429
and you found this videotape at a garage
sale and I was obsessed with it?

617
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,349
Tell her she's making this up, Mom!
It doesn't exist.

618
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,809
It does exist! I remember it.

619
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,312
It had a mannequin that had this hat
that made it come to life

620
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,983
and there was a goose on a rainbow
and this creepy guy puppet

621
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,444
that, like, worked at a department store.

622
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,196
Today's Special.

623
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,823
Today's Special ! Yes! Oh, my God.

624
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,911
Fucking Today's Special.
Eat it, you fucker. Fuck, yes.

625
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,413
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- I knew you'd remember.

626
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,541
You know how many times
I had to listen to that theme song?

627
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,461
I'm really sorry I put you through that.

628
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,713
It was just a phase. I forgive you.

629
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,843
So, hey, Tommy said
Dad and Nora went to Australia?

630
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,179
I tried calling them. What's up with that?

631
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,597
Who knows?

632
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:12,976
What are you doing right now?
Where are you?

633
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,143
Oh...

634
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,854
I'm just hanging out.

635
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,232
By yourself? On the anniversary?

636
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,567
Yeah.

637
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,071
It's, uh, kind of nice, actually.

638
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,156
Okay.

639
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,451
Well, enjoy your solitude.

640
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,204
I love you, Mom.

641
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,248
I love you, honey.

642
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,125
Tell Tommy I love him.

643
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,127
Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.

644
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,546
I love you too, Mommy!

645
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:42,755
Bye, kids.

646
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,173
Bye. Love you.

647
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,759
Miss?

648
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,679
Now or never.

649
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,269
English-SDH
