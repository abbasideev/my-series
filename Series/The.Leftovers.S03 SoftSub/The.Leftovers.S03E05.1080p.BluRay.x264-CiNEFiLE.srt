1
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,412
-Reverend.
-I brought a casserole.

2
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,913
...islands in the Pacific.

3
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,750
And early reports confirm
it was uninhabited.

4
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,088
The French government is denying any
responsibility, and details surrounding...

5
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,215
God bless you, Reverend.
Thank you.

6
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,050
...the person or persons
responsible for the launch

7
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,095
are not being made available
to the international community

8
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,264
despite overwhelming pressure for answers.

9
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,599
- How is she?
- Still fighting.

10
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,353
We've all been praying for her.

11
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,897
Thank you.

12
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,154
Arturo, I need you to fly me to Australia.

13
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,323
What?

14
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,577
A cargo plane with the donated food
for El Salvador

15
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,205
is sitting on the tarmac in Austin,
fueled up and ready to go.

16
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,169
I need to get to Melbourne immediately.
I'm asking you to fly me there.

17
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,130
But the explosion.

18
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,466
They said all flights have been grounded.

19
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,969
All nonessential flights.
Military and foreign aid are exempted.

20
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,182
And you, Arturo, are not only
a valued member of our congregation,

21
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,477
but licensed
by an internationally recognized NGO.

22
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,104
Randy's available to copilot.

23
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,648
Reverend, I...

24
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,525
I can't leave my mother.

25
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,991
That's $20,000.

26
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,161
It should be more than enough
to compensate you for your time

27
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,080
and get excellent care for your mother.

28
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,334
Something incredible is gonna happen
in the next few days

29
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,671
on the seven year anniversary,
but only if we go now, right now.

30
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,675
You said that we needed to be
in Miracle on the 14th.

31
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,677
We will be. We'll be back.

32
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,808
But there's a man, a very special man,
and he's supposed to be here with us,

33
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,103
but he's in Melbourne.
And because of this unexpected event,

34
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,897
he's stuck in Australia. He's stranded.

35
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,069
God has placed an obstacle in our way,
but He wants us to overcome it.

36
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,239
He wants us to demonstrate our faith.

37
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,034
We need to go get this man
and bring him home.

38
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,206
-So it's a rescue mission?
-Yes, a rescue mission, exactly.

39
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,716
Okay. Okay.

40
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,010
Bless you.

41
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,889
All right, let's go.

42
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,058
I have some friends
meeting us on the tarmac.

43
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,269
-How many?
-Just the three of us.

44
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,147
Three wise men.

45
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,111
Hi, this is Kevin Garvey. Leave a message.

46
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,904
Hello. It's me again.

47
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,031
I... I don't know
if you're getting my messages,

48
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,411
but I'm sure you're aware there's been
a nuclear incident in the South Pacific,

49
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,331
but I've secured transportation.

50
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm coming to get you, Kevin.

51
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,766
What are you doing here?

52
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,477
I'm getting on your plane.

53
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,148
You invited her?

54
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,693
The only reason you even know
where Kevin is, is because he called me.

55
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,820
And we're immensely grateful
for that, Laurie.

56
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,073
-Oh, you're immensely grateful?
-Yes. But with all due respect,

57
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,203
I'm not sure you entirely grasp
what's happening here.

58
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,789
Okay, three years ago,

59
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,251
my ex-husband experienced severe delusions
and tried to kill himself.

60
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,545
And instead of acknowledging
his mental illness,

61
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,006
you turned it into fucking scripture.

62
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,382
And when he found out about it,

63
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,343
he relapsed
and ran halfway around the world,

64
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,844
probably to get the fuck away from you.

65
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,473
Is that what's happening here?
Am I grasping it, Matt?

66
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,643
Have you even talked to Kevin?

67
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,021
I left him a few messages.
He hasn't called me back yet.

68
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,190
What about Nora?

69
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,942
Nora?

70
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,487
Nora, your sister.

71
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,532
Yeah, she's not picking up the phone
either. But why would you know that?

72
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,286
Because you're too busy
chartering cargo planes to Australia.

73
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,830
Tell me, Matt,
does that seem reasonable to you?

74
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,959
Well, it must seem reasonable to you
since you're trying to get on it.

75
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,920
This is your fault,
you self-righteous shit!

76
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,713
Yeah, did you bring your whistle, Laurie,

77
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,091
'cause it sounds like
you need to blow off a little--

78
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,843
-Fuck you !
-Everybody calm down.

79
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,721
Look, this is my wife.

80
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,683
You want us to come, she comes, too.

81
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,519
We all want the same thing.

82
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,355
To make sure Kevin gets home safe.

83
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,065
Right?

84
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,693
Right.

85
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,862
Then let's get on the plane
and work this out like civilized adults.

86
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,950
When we find Kevin,
you don't speak to him, okay?

87
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,035
I will talk to him. He didn't call you.

88
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,205
-He called me.
-And what exactly did he say?

89
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,501
What did he specifically say
that leads you to believe he's delusional?

90
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,254
Did he see something or someone?

91
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,218
-Did she tell you?
-She said he was upset.

92
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,137
Upset about what, exactly?

93
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,390
Because I'm getting the feeling
we're not hearing the entire story.

94
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,893
No, the whole story, Matt,
is in your ridiculous book,

95
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,230
which somehow you convinced my husband
and my stepson to keep from me.

96
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,734
Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause
they knew this would be your reaction.

97
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,486
Do you think it's ridiculous, John?

98
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,449
It doesn't matter what I think.
We'll know in the next four days, right?

99
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,159
What happens in four days?

100
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,329
It's the seven year anniversary
of the Departure.

101
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,913
So?

102
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,251
This is my plane, my mission !
And I will speak to Kevin

103
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,254
because I absolutely refuse to believe
he's psychotic.

104
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,049
I was married to Kevin for 15 years.

105
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,092
He used to look
through all of our cupboards

106
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,053
before he found the wine glasses.

107
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,182
He has a tattoo that's misspelled,
and he shits four times a day.

108
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:28,062
So I refuse, Matt, to believe that he's
the goddamn second coming of Christ!

109
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,271
- Oh !

110
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,388
What are those?

111
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,182
For my allergies.

112
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,481
Michael,

113
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,859
I need to know you're with me.

114
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,361
-Where else would I be?
-No, no, no.

115
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,158
I need to know you're with me, that you'll
help me bring Kevin back to Miracle,

116
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,659
whatever it takes.

117
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,914
Maybe we should just ask him
what he wants to do.

118
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,960
We can't land in Melbourne.

119
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,838
What's happening?

120
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,591
The airport's shut down.
They're diverting us.

121
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,469
No, no. We're a relief mission.
We're authorized.

122
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,220
They don't care.

123
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,055
Where can we land?

124
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,099
Tasmania.

125
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,059
Tasmania?

126
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,645
Then how the hell do we get to Melbourne?

127
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,455
Is this where I get tickets
for the ferry to Melbourne?

128
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,373
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, thank God.

129
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,210
Our plane was forced to land,
and we're stranded here.

130
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,795
Not that Tasmania isn't lovely.

131
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,715
Uh, three tickets, please.

132
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,593
-Hey, fuck you, Matt.
-Come on, man.

133
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,846
Sorry. Four tickets.

134
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,849
-How long is the journey there?
-Eleven hours.

135
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,686
Okay, okay. Eleven hours. Not bad, huh?

136
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,773
Unfortunately, tonight's ferry is booked
for a private group.

137
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,528
I'm afraid our first available
is the day after tomorrow.

138
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,280
No, no, that's too late.
We need to get to Melbourne immediately.

139
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,159
This private group
must have a few extra seats.

140
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,203
They bought the boat, sir.

141
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,041
If you wanna get on, I'm afraid
you're gonna have to take it up with them.

142
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,268
Are they putting a lion on that boat?

143
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,103
Sure looks like it.

144
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,734
Hi. Nice to see you girls.
Come in, come in.

145
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,780
I know I marked you off. Right.

146
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,992
Hello. How are you today?

147
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,036
I'm 91 , and I'm having a son.

148
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,581
I'm sorry?

149
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,167
I'm 91 , and I'm having a son.

150
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,754
I think she wants you
to say something, man.

151
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,842
-Oh ! Uh, what is it you want me to say?
-Are you a member of our pride?

152
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,554
No, but if we could become members,
we're willing to pay.

153
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,723
Oh, no, no. No money allowed.

154
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,523
How come you didn't ask that guy
whether he's 91 and having a son?

155
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,442
Well, he's a friend of the captain.

156
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,446
Well, uh,
we're friends of the captain, too.

157
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,034
-Is that true?
-No.

158
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,957
Listen, we have a friend in Melbourne
who's in trouble.

159
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,252
He needs our help. Your boat
is the only way we can get to him.

160
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,964
I'm appealing to your sense of charity
to let us onboard.

161
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,216
No.

162
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,011
There's gonna be sex on this boat.

163
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,430
There's gonna be a lot of it.

164
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,184
Debased and sinful from port to port,
all without judgment.

165
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,979
-Is that gonna be all right for you?
-Absolutely. Yeah.

166
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,109
Well, then why don't you tell me
the filthiest joke that you know?

167
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,865
-A panda goes into--
-No, no, no. Not you.

168
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,242
Him.

169
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,249
What's the difference between a pimple
and a priest?

170
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,589
A pimple waits until you're 12
to come on your face.

171
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,221
Righty-o, then.

172
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,765
The lady has free reign.

173
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,142
No law can govern the lioness.

174
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,270
And as for you fellows,
there's only one rule, so learn it well.

175
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,524
When midnight comes,

176
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,860
let no man mention his name

177
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,863
lest that man become him.

178
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,450
Who's him?

179
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,579
Frasier.

180
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,750
Thank you.

181
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,086
Off you go now. Hello.

182
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,026
Terrorism? It was the French.

183
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,154
You think they're starting a war
with the English?

184
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,989
This is revenge for Agincourt?

185
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,701
Yes, you said that already,
but when will you--

186
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,456
No, no, I'm not at the airport. If I was
at the airport, why would I be calling?

187
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,333
Hello? Hello?

188
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,341
Flights are still grounded.

189
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,677
They refuse to sell tickets
over the phone.

190
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,766
I'm gonna go to the snack bar
to get some sandwiches. You want some?

191
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,310
I'm not hungry.

192
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,650
There's still time.

193
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,361
Even if we can't get a flight,
we can take this ferry back,

194
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,113
and Arturo can fly us home.

195
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,327
What?

196
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,040
We're not gonna make it back to Miracle
by the 14th, man.

197
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
Yes, we are.

198
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,753
Well, even if we find Kevin
right off the boat,

199
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,172
there's no guarantee
he's gonna come back with us.

200
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,970
I think we need to accept
that whatever's gonna happen,

201
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,056
is gonna happen here.

202
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,975
No, no. We're bringing him home.

203
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,229
He has to be in Miracle. You two
should know that better than anyone.

204
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,272
It was spared for a reason. It's special.

205
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,026
You know, it... It cured my wife.
It gave me my son.

206
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,072
And my wife left me,
and I lost my daughter.

207
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,617
It's got nothing to do
with where we live, man.

208
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,496
We've just got to let go
and see what happens.

209
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,414
We're not in control of this thing.

210
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,418
Yeah, well,
that's 'cause you gave control to Laurie.

211
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,551
Maybe if you'd given a little more control
to Mary, she wouldn't have left.

212
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,345
Mary leaving was a test.

213
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,640
A test of my faith in that place
to see if I'd leave.

214
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,102
So, if you think I'm gonna be in goddamn
Australia on the day of reckoning--

215
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,728
- Matt.
- What?

216
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,273
You're bleeding.

217
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,901
It's fine.

218
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,990
I'm fine. It's fine. I'm fine.

219
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,272
He hit you, huh?

220
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,526
-What?
-Your nose. God hit you.

221
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,820
No shame in it, mate.

222
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,573
I've seen God smite
many a man on this boat.

223
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,825
Ice bags in the infirmary if you need one.

224
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,453
Sorry.

225
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,831
Are you asking
if God punched me in the face?

226
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,499
Indeed.

227
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,003
The one true Lord, Yahweh. Holy of holies.

228
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,840
Voice of the Olympics.
Red hat and a beard. Likes the top deck.

229
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,509
But I'd steer clear if I were you.

230
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,113
Excuse me, sir.

231
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,662
Sir.

232
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,086
I'm sorry to bother you,

233
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,546
but are you telling people you're God?

234
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,233
"I am the one true God.

235
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,861
"I go by many names,
but Mr. Burton is fine.

236
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,989
"I will not take a photo with you.

237
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,492
"There was no big bang.
Just nothing, then light.

238
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,077
"Yes, I created you.

239
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,331
"No, I didn't create unicorns.

240
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,377
"Eve was not made from Adam's rib.
It was his tibia.

241
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,506
"I asked Abraham to kill Isaac
just to see if he'd do it.

242
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,343
"Yes, evolution is real,
but it doesn't work how you think it does.

243
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,929
"I won the bronze medal for decathlon,

244
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,765
"and the one you can't remember
is the hammer throw.

245
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,143
"No, I had nothing to do with the Crusades

246
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,397
"nor any type of genocide/holocaust."
Can you believe this guy?

247
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,940
It was just a joke.

248
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,442
It's blasphemy, is what it is.

249
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,277
You know he's not God.
Why does it bother you?

250
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,405
Because he's saying he is.
You know, he didn't even talk to me.

251
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:49,200
He just handed me a card and wandered off
like I was asking for an autograph.

252
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,954
I think you should tell Laurie
you're sick.

253
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,581
I'm not sick.

254
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,499
Yes, you are.

255
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,419
-You should tell her.
-Why would I do that?

256
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,007
My dad used to keep everything inside.

257
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,301
Even with my mom.

258
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,681
All that time, he was just pretending
he wasn't so angry.

259
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,977
Then he met Laurie,
and she made him better.

260
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,315
No, he got better because of us,

261
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,401
because of the work we've been doing,
because of the book.

262
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:27,155
Laurie gave him psychobabble.
We gave him faith.

263
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,867
She doesn't believe in the same thing
we do, but she wants to help Kevin.

264
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,162
I think she'd wanna help you, too,
if you just talk to her.

265
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,581
She's not part of this.

266
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,543
Matthew, John, Michael,
they were all disciples.

267
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,090
Maybe Laurie's one, too.

268
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,303
Hey, big boy. Wanna party?

269
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,056
Don't bother with those two.

270
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,939
-Hey, how's your nose?
-Oh, it's fine. It was nothing.

271
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,403
Do you mind
if I speak to Laurie alone for a minute?

272
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,074
Uh, sure. Of course.

273
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,535
I'll be inside with Michael.

274
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,752
That couple just asked me and John
to be part of a four-way.

275
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,047
How flattering.

276
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,384
Well, at least I learned about this pride
that we joined.

277
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,179
Yes. Apparently, back in the '70s,

278
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,766
there was a whole bunch of these lionesses
in some wild animal park in California

279
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,186
that refused to mate
with any of the males there.

280
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,937
They just... They wouldn't have it.

281
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,815
But then something amazing happened.

282
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,236
The park rescued
this old fleabag of a lion

283
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,072
from a bankrupt Mexican circus.

284
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,284
He was ancient. He was, like, in his 90s.
It was a charity case.

285
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,121
And they brought him to the park
so he could live out his days in peace.

286
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,457
By the next morning,

287
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,752
he had screwed each
and every one of those lionesses

288
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,463
and ended up fathering 35 cubs.

289
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,467
-Ah, the infamous Frasier.
-Ooh, be careful.

290
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,345
It's after midnight.
No man may speak his name--

291
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,472
Lest that man become him.

292
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,225
That lion that we saw
that they put on the boat

293
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,393
is one of his descendants supposedly.

294
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:07,815
They're taking him around the world to
different zoos so he can spread his seed.

295
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,985
Well, that is the foundation
of any respectable religion.

296
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,449
You know,

297
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,953
I think we should play it your way.

298
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,330
I'm sorry?

299
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,332
With... With Kevin.

300
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,252
I mean, letting him believe
that he's a messiah

301
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,837
might be our best chance
of earning his trust.

302
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,508
Let's be honest, you have a better story.

303
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,927
My story is true.

304
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,600
-Come on, Matt.
-It's all true. It's based on fact.

305
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,811
I just wrote down what Kevin experienced.

306
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,982
He experienced hallucinations.
He saw things that weren't there.

307
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,234
How do you know?
How do you know they weren't there?

308
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,695
Because Patti is dead.
Because Evie is dead.

309
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,697
If you wrote a book every time
somebody thought they saw--

310
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,031
Evie?

311
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,625
Is that what he said when he called you?

312
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,962
Did Kevin see Evie?

313
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,717
Please don't say anything.

314
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,429
John and Michael, they wouldn't...

315
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:23,558
-Just please, please, Matt.
-What kind of person do you think I am?

316
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,436
I...

317
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,191
-I think you're a good person.
-I think you're a good person, too.

318
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:41,242
-Can I buy you a drink?
-No, I'd just like a moment alone.

319
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,580
-To pray.
-Okay.

320
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,708
Well, we'll be at the bar.

321
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,213
If you can't find us,
just look for the orgy.

322
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,715
- Godspeed.

323
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,537
Stop! Stop!

324
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,257
Man overboard !

325
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,718
Man overboard !

326
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,475
I saw you.

327
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,352
I saw what you did.

328
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,906
There's a man in the water!

329
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,035
There's a man in the water!

330
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,594
I think he's jumped.

331
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,973
- Didn't he call?
- What are you doing, mate?

332
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,072
-What the hell were you thinking?
-I was trying to save a man's life!

333
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,743
You need to get the ship's manifest
and account for every passenger.

334
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,872
Whoever's not on the boat,
that's the man I saw go over.

335
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,124
There is no manifest, mate.

336
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,461
-Your people bought out the whole boat.
-My people?

337
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,589
I'm not one of those lunatics.
Listen to me.

338
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,633
There's a dangerous man onboard.
I can identify him.

339
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,470
He's wearing a red hat
and calling himself God.

340
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,972
You mean David Burton.

341
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,557
You know him?

342
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,060
That woman,
she said he was a friend of the captain.

343
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,897
I'd hardly call him a friend,
but I know him, sure.

344
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,399
We all do. He's a celebrity.

345
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,276
A celebrity?

346
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,071
He was a broadcaster in the Sydney Games.
Had quite the touch.

347
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,241
He was a decathlete back in the '80s.

348
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,786
-Medaled for Australia.
-Yeah ! Yeah, the bronze.

349
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,206
I read about it on the card he gave me.

350
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,083
Right after
he washed his hands of the Holocaust.

351
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,919
But what it fails to clarify

352
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,714
is how he went from being
a sports announcer to Yahweh.

353
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,010
It was after he died.

354
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,304
Yeah... What?

355
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,269
About three years back,
he went rock climbing with a mate

356
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,021
just outside Perth.

357
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,357
He fell 100 meters.

358
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,275
Broke his neck.

359
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,279
His mate dragged his body into the cave
so the dingoes wouldn't eat the corpse,

360
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,616
made his way back to civilization,
but when they got back there,

361
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,244
Burton was sitting
at the front of the cave,

362
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,120
not a scratch on him.

363
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,708
Said he felt absolutely fine
and that he was God.

364
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,885
People don't actually believe
this guy is God?

365
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,014
Some do, sure.
Most are just having a laugh.

366
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,977
I don't think he expected so many people
to be pestering him,

367
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,853
so he hands out those cards,

368
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,730
the frequently asked questions.

369
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,983
Spends most of his time in Tasmania.

370
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,111
He's got a little cabin down there.
He's quite a private sort of fellow.

371
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,699
Spends a bit of time on the ferry,
just to be amongst the people.

372
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,159
So he can murder them?

373
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,829
We don't have any other witnesses.

374
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,039
Nobody reported missing.

375
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:02,086
Well, those sex-crazed maniacs
wouldn't notice anyone missing.

376
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:07,300
Burton walks in here and confesses,
I'll be happy to contact the authorities.

377
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,428
We dock in Melbourne in a few hours.

378
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,471
Until then, mate,

379
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,391
I suggest you go and find some dry clothes

380
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,685
and enjoy the ride.

381
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,406
You believe me, don't you?

382
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,619
Yeah. Of course.

383
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,668
Like when I told you
I didn't molest my comatose wife?

384
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,141
Excuse me.

385
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,521
-What?
-Where's your list?

386
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,357
-What?
-When we got on the boat,

387
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,943
you had a list of your members.
Where is it?

388
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,487
Oh, I don't know. Somewhere.

389
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:55,616
One of your people has gone in the water.
We need to find out who he is.

390
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,159
Oh, no, thanks.

391
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,830
You don't care
that somebody's been killed?

392
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,915
No, not really.

393
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,293
Of course not. Why would you?

394
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,505
All you care about
is fucking each other and Frasier!

395
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,470
-What?
-You spoke his name.

396
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,562
He spoke his name!

397
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,523
He spoke his name!

398
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:32,945
He spoke his name! He spoke his name!

399
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,239
He spoke his name!

400
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,991
Become him!

401
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,118
- Become him!

402
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,580
-Become him ! Become him !
-Become him!

403
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:48,836
-Become him ! Become him ! Become him !
-Become him ! Become him ! Become him !

404
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,726
In darkest Tijuana,

405
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,771
at 91 years of age,

406
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,817
who, by the force of man,
was taken from his home?

407
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,195
Frasier!

408
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,781
Taken north across the border,

409
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,742
where the lioness awaits a worthy mate.

410
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,913
Who is the king that she awaits?

411
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,416
Frasier! Frasier!

412
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,878
Frasier! Frasier!

413
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:41,680
Become him. Become him. Become him.

414
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,216
What are you doing?

415
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:21,887
What are you doing?

416
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,735
- No!
- 91 and still in his prime!

417
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,780
-Please!
-91 to father a pride!

418
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,575
Who will give his seed?

419
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,994
Frasier!

420
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,580
No! Please. Please, no!

421
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,623
No!

422
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,295
No, no, no!

423
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,048
No!

424
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,386
You people are sick!

425
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,390
One of your people is out there murdered,

426
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,768
floating in the water,
and you're in here doing this!

427
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,730
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

428
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,170
Hey!

429
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,465
I saw you. I know what you did.
You think you can get away with this?

430
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,468
Don't ignore me. I'm talking to you.

431
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,700
Are you all right?

432
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,870
I heard what you said in there.

433
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,289
You're right. They're sick.

434
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,377
We're not all like them.

435
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,754
There's a plan.

436
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,882
When we dock, be sure you stay on the boat
until it's safe.

437
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,220
When we dock, stay on the boat.

438
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,945
-Jesus, Matt. You look terrible.
-I'm fine.

439
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,490
-I just need to speak to Michael and John.
-About what?

440
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,910
Please, Laurie. It's in your best interest
if you're not involved.

441
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,248
You know, whatever you got to say to us,
you can say to her.

442
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,378
No one seems to care
that I just witnessed a murder.

443
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,798
The man who perpetrated it
just assaulted me.

444
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,926
-He what?
-He hit me with impunity,

445
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,053
and he needs to be dealt with.

446
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,806
Dealt with how?

447
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,350
We need to compel him
to confess to what he did.

448
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,186
Be not deceived. God shall not be mocked.

449
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,940
For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

450
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,192
No, we're not reaping anyone, man.

451
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,407
You used to burn men's houses down
for pretending to be things they're not.

452
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,118
What happened to you, John?

453
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,038
What happened to your wrath?

454
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,836
He found peace.

455
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,132
He thinks his daughter's still alive.

456
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,259
That's not peace.

457
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,974
What?

458
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,018
Nothing.

459
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,396
What?

460
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,069
Kevin told her he saw Evangeline.

461
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,696
Here.

462
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,407
In Australia.

463
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,789
Is that true?

464
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,377
It...

465
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,047
It wasn't her.

466
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,591
What he saw was... Was, uh...

467
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,344
It was a manifestation of... It was...

468
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,096
She wasn't real.

469
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,598
And if I told you, you would've...

470
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,685
I didn't want to hurt you.

471
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,357
I understand.

472
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,402
I wouldn't have told me, either.

473
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,579
I understand, too.

474
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,040
She was protecting you.

475
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,127
That's what we're supposed to do
for each other. I'm sorry.

476
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,719
It's been a long day.
I haven't had any sleep.

477
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,392
We all need to get some rest
before we dock.

478
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,064
They've offered me a bed to lie down in
in the infirmary.

479
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,941
I... I think I'll take them up on it.

480
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,405
This is a distraction.
We need to focus on Kevin now.

481
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,781
Where's my book?

482
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,034
I threw it overboard.

483
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,162
Oh.

484
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,290
It was just getting good.

485
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,085
You know how it ends.

486
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,129
What makes you say that?

487
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,881
Because you know everything.

488
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,553
You're being sarcastic.

489
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,224
No. I was just wondering why I haven't
been struck down by lightning yet.

490
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:10,731
Why don't you transform those ropes
into serpents and free yourself?

491
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,608
I don't need to do that.

492
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,654
You're going to untie me
once you get what you want.

493
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,741
And what is it I want?

494
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,413
My attention.

495
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,750
I already have your attention.

496
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,628
No, not yet.

497
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,549
Not yet?
Well, you're finally talking to me.

498
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,428
Shh.

499
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,473
You're agitating him.

500
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,192
Admit what you did.

501
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,694
I've done lots of things.

502
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,281
You threw that man overboard.

503
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,658
Okay.

504
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,786
- Okay?
- Sure.

505
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,248
Say it.

506
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,085
I threw that man overboard.

507
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,551
You'll tell the captain
and the authorities?

508
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,969
No.

509
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,305
Why not?

510
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,808
Because I'm the authority.

511
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,977
Right, you're the authority on everything.

512
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,856
Creation, Isaac and Abraham,
the decathlon.

513
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,192
And yet you only won the bronze.

514
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,820
Well, that was before.

515
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,240
Of course. Because you weren't always God.

516
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,826
You had to die in a rock climbing accident

517
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:50,747
and come back to life
just like your son Jesus, who, strangely,

518
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,042
doesn't seem to get a mention here
on your little card.

519
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,794
He wasn't my son.

520
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,297
You're denying paternity?

521
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,716
Mary's word versus mine.

522
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:07,180
And yet you still see fit
to steal his story for yourself.

523
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,808
He was the one who died and rose again.

524
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:13,145
No, he rotted in the cave.

525
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,190
What?

526
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,193
Jesus had an identical twin brother.

527
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,196
That's who everyone saw a few days later,

528
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,240
thus the confusion.

529
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,743
So you take no responsibility

530
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,539
for your only son giving his life
for the sins of mankind?

531
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,500
Seems a lot to ask somebody.

532
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,087
Then what do you take responsibility for?

533
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,007
Dinosaurs?

534
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:43,675
The Black Plague?

535
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:46,052
Mount Everest? The Mona Lisa?

536
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,054
-The Sudden Departure?
-Yeah.

537
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,890
That was me.

538
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,522
The Sudden Departure was you?

539
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,773
Uh-huh.

540
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:03,612
Why?

541
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,532
Because I could.

542
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,413
You're gonna have to do better than that.

543
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,999
-No, I don't.
-You do.

544
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,419
-Why?
-Because there has to be a reason.

545
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,422
- Why?
- Everything in my life,

546
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,424
-I've done for a reason.
-Why?

547
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,010
To help people. To guide them.

548
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,597
To ease their suffering,
even though I suffered myself.

549
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,266
I sacrificed my happiness.

550
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,770
-I let my family abandon me.
-Why?

551
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,772
- For you !

552
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,078
Everything you've done, you've done
because you thought I was watching,

553
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,580
because you thought I was judging.

554
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,124
But I wasn't.

555
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,960
I'm not.

556
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,964
You've never done anything for me.

557
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,424
You did it for yourself.

558
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,684
Is that why you're killing me?

559
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,778
When I was a boy, I was sick.

560
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:31,825
And I prayed to you to save me,
and you did.

561
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,290
Why is it back?

562
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,210
I can save you again.

563
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,882
No, you can't.

564
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,179
Untie me.

565
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,785
Ta-da.

566
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,079
You're saved.

567
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,264
Ladies and gents,
we will be docking in Melbourne shortly.

568
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,434
Please dispose all rubbish
and collect your personal belongings

569
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,144
before you disembark.

570
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,856
Thank you for sailing with us.
We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.

571
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,949
There you are.

572
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,416
Fishing boat found a body.

573
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,127
Matches your description.

574
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,088
I've notified the police.

575
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,552
They'll be taking Burton into custody
when we dock.

576
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,557
They'd like you to go down to the station
and make a statement,

577
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,061
assuming you don't have
any pressing business in Melbourne.

578
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,317
No, I don't.

579
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,550
Relax.

580
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,745
Hey.

581
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,538
Did you get some rest?

582
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,791
Yeah, I did.

583
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,545
Thank you all for coming.

584
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:14,756
I'm glad you're here.

585
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,718
Are you okay?

586
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,308
Actually, Laurie,

587
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,895
I'm dying.

588
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,567
What?

589
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,513
David Burton, you are under arrest!

590
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,809
Out of the way! Out of the way!
All of you! Stay clear!

591
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,645
Get behind the barrier!

592
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,782
Ahh !

593
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,061
That's the guy I was telling you about.

594
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,583
