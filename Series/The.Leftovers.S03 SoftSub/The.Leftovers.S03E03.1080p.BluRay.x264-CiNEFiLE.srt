1
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,035
Help them.
Go and help them.

2
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,539
They're gonna drown.
Pull over. They're not coming up.

3
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,707
They'll come up.

4
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,751
Please, Dad?
Please pull over.

5
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,046
You know how long
ducks can hold their breath?

6
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,255
No.

7
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,300
As long as it takes
for you to stop looking at 'em.

8
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,719
Then pull over
and let's look.

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,183
Okay, let's look.

10
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,229
I think they're dead.

11
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,022
No, they're not dead.

12
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,774
But how do you know?

13
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:33,236
Ducks go down,
ducks come up.

14
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,947
This is the natural order of things, son.

15
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,949
There they are!

16
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,992
Yep. There they are.

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,078
They're okay.

18
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,663
They're okay.

19
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,832
And there you have it, folks.

20
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,750
The ducks are alive and well.

21
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,837
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

22
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,954
What are you doing?

23
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,751
Preventing the apocalypse.

24
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,336
What are you doing?

25
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,724
Don't smile.

26
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,441
This is a songline.

27
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,278
Is it?

28
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,044
You can go.

29
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,424
Uh, you don't get to keep that.

30
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,723
Well, the mic, okay, that's fine,

31
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,268
but the player,
can I have it back, please?

32
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,644
Please?

33
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,319
Oh, thank you. I...

34
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,239
Where's the tape?

35
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,242
What's on the tape is stolen.
You took it without permission.

36
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,870
No, no, not that one.
That's fine. The other one.

37
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,289
It says "Niagara '81 "?

38
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,669
Please. It's me and my kid
from a long time ago.

39
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,175
It's really important to me. Please.

40
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,309
Thank you.

41
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,312
Yeah. Go, get.

42
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,980
Yeah, thank you.

43
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,631
Why did
Travis wanna kill the President?

44
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,551
Travis didn't wanna
kill anyone. He's not real.

45
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,885
I don't get it.

46
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,388
Travis is pretend.
He's in a movie.

47
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,766
John is real,
and that's how he got the idea.

48
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,353
So, John killed the
President because he saw it in a movie?

49
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,105
He didn't kill the President.

50
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,149
He tried to kill the President.

51
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,025
- Why?

52
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,486
Because he's crazy, Kevin.

53
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,075
But the President's
okay, right?

54
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,579
Yeah, buddy.
The President's fine.

55
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,499
And there you have it,
folks. The President is just fine.

56
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

57
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,759
-Howdy.
-G'day.

58
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,096
Do you deliver mail
to the communities around here?

59
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,431
Yes, sir.

60
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,934
I'm looking for a friend,
Christopher Sunday.

61
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,936
Maybe you have an address for him.

62
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,317
If he's a friend of yours,
why don't you have his address?

63
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,111
I misplaced it.

64
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,449
You need to talk to Sharon.

65
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,993
Okay. Who's Sharon?

66
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,704
She's a liaison
to the indigenous community.

67
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,708
All due respect, friend,
I don't need a liaison.

68
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,669
I'm a member of the indigenous community.

69
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,676
Sharon's over at the cultural center
on Borland Circuit.

70
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,345
Anything else?

71
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,971
Yeah.

72
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,599
I had my mail forwarded

73
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,977
when I heard
how helpful you were down here.

74
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,646
Kevin Garvey.

75
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,658
May I see some ID?

76
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,327
Unfortunately, I lost it.

77
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,663
But I can tell you the return address.

78
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:46,043
One Matthew Jamison.
Miracle, Texas. US of A.

79
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,089
If that's not enough,
I can tell you what's inside.

80
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,010
You know
the best-selling book of all time?

81
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,764
I reckon it's the Bible.

82
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,517
You reckon right, my friend.

83
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,186
And that there

84
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,355
is the goddamn sequel.

85
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,828
Oof.

86
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,926
Bullshit. Where is it?

87
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,852
Motherfucker!

88
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,908
Oh.

89
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,619
Hi, Noah. Is your daddy home?

90
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,413
Let Mommy, honey.

91
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,207
Hello?

92
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:54,129
Uh, hello. This is Frank Johnson
from the Episcopal council.

93
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,173
Can I speak to Reverend Matt Jamison?

94
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,634
- Frank Johnson?
- Yes.

95
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,304
Are you sure this isn't the former
police chief of Mapleton, New York?

96
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,723
Because I know
Matt would wanna talk to him.

97
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,520
-Who is it?
-It's your buddy in Australia.

98
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,481
I'm taking Noah to the park.

99
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,857
You want me to come?

100
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,026
Not when you have
important work to do, Matt.

101
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,659
- Hello?

102
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,661
Mary seems pissed. What'd you do?

103
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,248
I didn't do anything.
We're just working through some...

104
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,708
We're fine. How are things down under?

105
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,338
Well, Matt, funny you should ask
about how things are going down here

106
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,632
because it seems like
you don't give a shit.

107
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,842
What?

108
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,343
I'm not in it, asshole.

109
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,139
-I'm sorry?
-I'm not in it.

110
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,268
I spent hours talking you through
what I'm doing down here

111
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,062
and there's not a word
in your goddamn book.

112
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,691
Well, the book is about
what's happening to your son.

113
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,319
-You know, if he were in Australia--
-I don't want him in Australia.

114
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,240
I don't want him
anywhere fucking near Australia!

115
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:09,204
Okay, since you clearly weren't listening
the first time I told you,

116
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,541
I am not a part of Kevin Jr.'s story.

117
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,877
He's a part of mine.

118
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,713
He's the one who guided me here.

119
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,423
Why isn't that in your book?

120
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,258
Well, I'm sorry. But...

121
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,051
W... When did this happen?

122
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,304
When he was eight years old.

123
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,600
Well, children don't
feature prominently in Scripture.

124
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,060
What about Abraham's kid?

125
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,729
Isaac? He was 36.

126
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,899
No, no.
When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.

127
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,776
He was a grown man.
Thirty-six years old.

128
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,114
That makes no fucking sense at all.

129
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,993
Did you uh--
Did you get the money I sent you?

130
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,662
Yeah, I did. Ha. What's it for?

131
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,539
Well, just to help you out.

132
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,249
Oh, really?

133
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,835
It's not so I'll keep my mouth shut

134
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:02,883
and not tell my son you're writing an
unauthorized fucking biography about him?

135
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,428
Kevin, telling him
would not be a good idea.

136
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,263
He needs to just go through his life.

137
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,850
Knowing any of this
would not be in his best interests.

138
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,605
It would be in your best interest
to pick up some scuba gear,

139
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,815
because if I fail down here,

140
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,778
you are gonna be under
a fuck of a lot of water, shithead !

141
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,115
Okay. Best of luck with that, Kevin.

142
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,284
Go fuck yourself, Matt.

143
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Hello.

144
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,719
Excuse me. Is Sharon around?

145
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,764
She's in the crapper.
You can wait in her office.

146
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,142
Oh, great. Thanks.

147
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,477
Do I know you, mate?

148
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,355
I sure hope not.

149
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,785
Oh !

150
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,831
Good afternoon. You must be Sharon.
I'm Frank.

151
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,207
Hello.

152
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,293
Is that snake Papunya?

153
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,837
It is indeed.
How'd you guess?

154
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,922
Oh, I'd know Papunya anywhere.

155
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,634
They have a very precise style.

156
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,886
Actually, I painted it myself.

157
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,388
- You did not.
- I did.

158
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,267
- Well, then you are incredibly talented.

159
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,936
So, what brings you here, Frank?

160
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,815
I'm looking for a clever man
named Christopher Sunday.

161
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,068
I was told
you might have an address for him.

162
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,694
Well, the name rings a bell,

163
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,030
but if you're making a documentary,
you have to go--

164
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,907
No, no, no. Documentaries are boring.

165
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,827
I'm just seeking enlightenment.

166
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,248
I'm only interested in his wisdom,
his counsel, nothing else.

167
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,084
I'd have to accompany you.

168
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,169
I wouldn't want it any other way.

169
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,548
Let me see
if I can get that address for you.

170
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,468
Uh, is this your son?

171
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:56,098
My grandson, Ollie.
He wants to be an astronaut.

172
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,144
My son wanted to be
an anchorman on the news.

173
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,105
Yeah? And did he?

174
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,940
Nah. He's a cop.

175
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,608
A good one.

176
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,777
And your wife?

177
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,698
She passed. Cancer.

178
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,491
Oh, I'm so sorry.

179
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,828
Thanks. It was a long time ago.
Did you find him?

180
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:22,582
It seems that, um,
Chris lives in a community just a few...

181
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,337
I'd like you to hear my side.

182
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,801
"Appropriation of sacred ceremonies
without permission,

183
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,763
"theft of creation songs,
misrepresentation of identity.

184
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,767
"Under no circumstances should this man
be given access to tribal elders."

185
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,062
Shame on you.
You've stolen from these people.

186
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,605
Really, I've stolen?

187
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,901
Same way your government stole
a whole generation of their children?

188
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,319
We apologized for that.

189
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,488
Shame on you, Sharon.

190
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,824
I have lived among these people.

191
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,785
I am trying to fucking save these people.

192
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,829
Save them from what? Oi !

193
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,701
I'm sorry if I mispronounced.

194
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,954
Are you Christopher Sunday?

195
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,081
Chris.

196
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,417
Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.

197
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,170
I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.

198
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,175
I've come a long way to find you.

199
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,097
You're scared.

200
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,269
I am, yes.

201
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,606
Of what?

202
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,613
I used to hear voices.

203
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,662
They started about five minutes after
it happened, after people disappeared.

204
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,791
So they put me in an institution.

205
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:15,964
And there I stayed, arguing with something
nobody else could even see, fighting it...

206
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,758
And then I stopped fighting.

207
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,346
And I started doing
what the voices told me.

208
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:30,312
The last thing they told me
was to leave, to go to Australia.

209
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,483
It's a pretty big country
you got here.

210
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,111
A little specificity would've been nice,

211
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,032
but I figured
instructions were forthcoming,

212
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,578
and I always wanted to check out
the Opera House, so I flew to Sydney.

213
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,498
Bought a ticket for Verdi,
put on a nice suit,

214
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,585
and I'm on my way from the hotel

215
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,172
when this guy,
this hippie with a red headband,

216
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:03,511
walks right up to me and says,
"Do you wanna talk to God?"

217
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,140
Well, that's gotta be it, right?

218
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,810
So I said, "Fuck, yeah,
I wanna talk to God."

219
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,190
And he said, "Then you've gotta talk
in God's tongue, mate."

220
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:21,863
God's tongue, it turns out,
is an experimental, high-end hallucinogen

221
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,907
this guy brews in his basement.

222
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,036
And I wake up two weeks later

223
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:33,124
in a hotel room in Perth
on the opposite fucking coast.

224
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,378
There's a smoldering mattress next to me

225
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,547
and a bunch of white dudes
lying around in war paint.

226
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,134
And I have no fucking memory

227
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,429
how I got there
or what happened while I did.

228
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,727
Also, God did not talk to me.

229
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,898
And I'm thinking
this is a fucking waste of time,

230
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,819
at best, a misguided detour,

231
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,992
when I notice the TV
in the hotel room is on.

232
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,664
And do you know
what I saw on that TV, Chris?

233
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,501
A chicken.

234
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,754
On October the 14th,

235
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,591
a town in the outback
lost its entire population.

236
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,094
A small town, only 14 people.

237
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,556
But all of them vanished,
even the animals.

238
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:34,102
Every living thing in that town
was gone except for one thing.

239
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,604
An egg.

240
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,651
Two days later,
it hatched and they named him Tony.

241
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,281
And at first, nobody took him seriously.

242
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,658
But then rumors started.

243
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:53,830
Rumors that the chicken could help people
find whatever they were looking for.

244
00:22:54,915 --> 00:23:00,003
And this is the first fucking thing I hear
when I wake up from a two-week acid trip?

245
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,964
It's gotta be a fucking sign.

246
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:09,971
So, I hop on the train,
4,000 kilometers back across the country,

247
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,973
and I go see Tony.

248
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,100
So, I give this guy my money,

249
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:19,397
guy puts the chicken in front of me,
and says, "What are you looking for?"

250
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,151
Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

251
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,154
That's the point. I need Tony to tell me.

252
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,782
And the guy says, "Doesn't work that way.

253
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,494
"You've gotta give Tony
something to look for."

254
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,496
So I said, "Purpose.

255
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,750
"I want some fucking purpose."

256
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,427
And that very minute, Tony jumped up
on my pack and starts pecking.

257
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,351
He was pecking this.

258
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,529
When my kid was about eight years old,

259
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,406
my wife gave him a tape recorder
for Christmas.

260
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,451
She died about a month later,

261
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,997
so he kept it with him all the time.
All the time.

262
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,795
Well, that summer, I took him
on a road trip to Niagara Falls.

263
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,051
And he just about drove me nuts...

264
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,227
Recording everything we said.

265
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,276
Excuse me.

266
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,779
I like listening to it.

267
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,243
This is the tape
that Tony pecked.

268
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,288
I didn't rewind it.

269
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:07,088
I put it in the player and waited
for one last voice to tell me what to do.

270
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,926
You have to sing it.

271
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,386
Oh, come on.

272
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,264
It's for little kids.
You're a big kid now.

273
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,058
You have to or it won't stop.

274
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,810
It's gonna get in the car!

275
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,563
We're pulled over. We're safe.

276
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,316
Please, Daddy?
Just sing it.

277
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,611
Okay.

278
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:35,783
The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

279
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,205
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out

280
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:45,126
Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain

281
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:50,840
And the itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again

282
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,094
You did it.

283
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:09,275
On the seventh-year anniversary
of the Sudden Departure,

284
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,112
I believe the rains will come,

285
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,158
and with them, a great flood.

286
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,663
I have to sing to make it stop.

287
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,752
You have to sing?

288
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:33,091
For the last two years, I've been
working my way down the songline.

289
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:38,346
I don't have to tell you
every community has a different part,

290
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,517
so I've had to learn it piece by piece,

291
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:47,939
every sacred site,
every ceremony, every word.

292
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,025
You want my song?

293
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,860
It's the last one.

294
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,199
The last one.

295
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:04,998
And it is my understanding that you are
the only man alive who knows it.

296
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,044
My song is bring the rain, not stop it.

297
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:18,052
Well, that's all subject
to interpretation.

298
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,556
Do you want to stop the flood?

299
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,267
I do.

300
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,731
Start there.

301
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,240
You got a deal.

302
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,292
Can you see the problem?

303
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,837
Yeah, your swamp cooler's leaking
like a motherfucker.

304
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,589
Can you fix it, then?

305
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,758
You got a pipe wrench or some duct--

306
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,513
Ah, shit!

307
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,226
Oh, shit.

308
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,105
Don't believe a word
that woman says about me.

309
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,441
Remember, we've got a deal.

310
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,486
Oh!

311
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,829
I rolled the other way.

312
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,457
You saw me, right?
I-- I tried to miss you.

313
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,794
-Chris, can you hear me?
-Settle down.

314
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,630
I'm just concerned
that when we get to the hospital,

315
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,131
they're gonna separate us.

316
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,550
And Chris promised
he'd teach me something.

317
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,804
Didn't you, Chris? Chris, Chris, Chris,
nod if you can hear me.

318
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,555
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me--

319
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,100
Sit! Sit.

320
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,478
Friend, I am acting in your best interest.

321
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,689
You are looking
at an initiated Yanmedjaran.

322
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,526
Show a little respect
for your fucking elder.

323
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,584
Uh, I'm sorry I lost it.

324
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,797
You're gonna leave me here? Ah !

325
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,519
Fuck me!

326
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,690
Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck, fuck!

327
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,864
I don't think this is the way
we're supposed to go.

328
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:48,786
Garvey men don't follow
a highlighter on a goddamn triptych, son.

329
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,580
But what if we get lost?

330
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,874
AAA wants you
to take the interstates

331
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,918
to get you to drive
by the AAA Howard Johnson's

332
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,963
and the AAA giant balls of twine.

333
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,884
You want a real adventure,
you gotta chart your own course.

334
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:10,826
Hey!

335
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,124
Stop. Ah !

336
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,294
Hey! Stop!

337
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,630
Stop! Ah !

338
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,007
Man, what are you doing?

339
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,470
They didn't take me.

340
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:31,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

341
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,976
Slow down, slow down.
Let's just talk for a sec.

342
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,562
They didn't take me.

343
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,648
Buddy, they didn't take most of us.

344
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,483
You're not alone, trust me.

345
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,860
But that was seven years ago.

346
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,490
Would you kill a baby
if it would cure cancer?

347
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,243
What?

348
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,664
Would you kill a baby
if it would cure cancer?

349
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,501
No.

350
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,965
That is exactly what I said.

351
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,844
Wait!

352
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,190
Whoa, shit!

353
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,197
Ah !

354
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,809
Please let there be some goddamn water.

355
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,981
Fucking alcoholic. Jesus.

356
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,071
I know what you're trying to do,
but it's not gonna work.

357
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,407
You can't stop me, asshole.

358
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,432
No!

359
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,226
No!

360
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,062
No! No!

361
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,107
No!

362
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,645
Please.

363
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,113
Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.

364
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,426
God.

365
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,773
Buddy, I know you're my totem, but...

366
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,361
I got some bad news for you.

367
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,405
If I go down,
I don't think I'm getting up.

368
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,741
So...

369
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,037
I need to eat you.

370
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,125
I'm sorry.

371
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,590
Know that you gave your life

372
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,346
for something greater than yourself.

373
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,651
--Oh !

374
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,944
Ah !

375
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,084
Come on. Motherfucking...

376
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,132
Shit.

377
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,304
Help.

378
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, hey there.

379
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,610
Oh, no.

380
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,783
Fucker!

381
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,368
Oh, oh !

382
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,787
Hello?

383
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,416
Anybody here?

384
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,064
--Hello?

385
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,900
Will you accept
a collect international call from...

386
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,735
Kevin Garvey Sr.

387
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,489
All right, fine.

388
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,285
Do you know what time it is here?

389
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,745
I don't care what time it is.
What day is it?

390
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,581
- What?
- What day is it?

391
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,749
How long since we last talked?

392
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,919
Uh, that was three weeks ago.

393
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,797
Oh, shit.

394
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,466
There's just, like, eight days left.

395
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,759
Shit.

396
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,180
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.

397
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,890
I'm actually glad you called.

398
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,101
Could you send a photocopy
of the book back to me?

399
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,104
-I gave the original--
-No, I threw it away.

400
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,439
-What?
-Doesn't matter.

401
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,859
Look, I need you to call
the Kurripa Hospital.

402
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,695
That's Kur-ri-pa.

403
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,699
Find out if there's a patient there
named Christopher Sunday.

404
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,576
Matt?

405
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,871
You threw it away?

406
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,249
My friend, you've gotta move past
that dumb book of yours.

407
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,043
I don't know where I am,

408
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:30,464
but once I find out, I'm gonna need
your help in getting to this hospital.

409
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,216
-Kevin.
-Yeah?

410
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,134
Go fuck yourself.

411
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,169
-Hey there.
-Hello.

412
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,215
You're building a boat.

413
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,758
Uh-huh.

414
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,681
For the flood.

415
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,231
I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.

416
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,192
Any chance you guys
could give me a ride there?

417
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,028
Lady of the house will take
better care of you than the hospital.

418
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:39,533
No, I'm fine.
Anybody here know Christopher Sunday?

419
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,785
Oh, yeah, sure. We all know each other.

420
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,579
- It's a tiny country.
- I know Chris.

421
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,083
You the fella that landed on him?

422
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,212
He's dead.

423
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,052
He's dead?

424
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,055
Shit.

425
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,460
"Caleb's arthritis."

426
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,546
You Caleb?

427
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,299
I'm in pain, buddy.

428
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,850
Mmm.

429
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,264
Hey.

430
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,523
What are you ladies up to?

431
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,778
Oh, come on.

432
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,402
Hello.

433
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,572
Hi.

434
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,909
Would you like some tea?

435
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,499
How's your arm?

436
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,169
Itches like hell.

437
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,591
We get a lot of brown
and tiger snakes out here.

438
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,428
I gave you anti-venom
for both just to be safe.

439
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,722
Much obliged.

440
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,439
You looked through my photos.

441
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,276
I was hungry. It was in the fridge.

442
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,115
What's your name?

443
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,285
Grace.

444
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,705
Nice to meet you.

445
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,791
-I'm Kev--
-I just killed a man.

446
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,839
Okay.

447
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,009
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

448
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,889
The other ladies you saw,
they had nothing to do with it.

449
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,559
I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them
out of whatever you tell the police.

450
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,898
Are you all alone out here?

451
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:47,942
Yes.

452
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,237
Your family's gone?

453
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,490
Yes.

454
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,910
On the 14th?

455
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,912
It was the 15th here.

456
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,082
I keep forgetting that.

457
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,585
You were with them?

458
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,382
I was in town at the Big W.

459
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,969
The register girl
vanished right in front of me.

460
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,598
She was holding my box of Weet-Bix.

461
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,851
Took it with her.

462
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,940
I knew what it was the moment it happened.

463
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,027
The Rapture.

464
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,700
I finally made it home the next night.

465
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:41,454
I already knew the chapel would be empty
before I set foot inside.

466
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,126
Their Bibles...

467
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,088
Liam's, Abigail's,

468
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:54,259
David's, Samantha's, Jimmy's.

469
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,430
Sam, my husband, his Bible, too.

470
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,685
All in a nice, neat row.

471
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,649
And when I saw them in that moment...

472
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,486
I felt so blessed

473
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,865
because God showed me.

474
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,912
He gave me confirmation
that my family now sat by his side.

475
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,543
For two years, I spread his word.

476
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,838
For two years, I endured...

477
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,925
And held true.

478
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,852
Then I received a phone call.

479
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,355
Remains had been found on my property.

480
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,403
The remains of five children.

481
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,617
Just bones.

482
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,661
Bleached in the sun.

483
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,125
The phones were down.

484
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:16,382
They had no way of knowing
if I was ever coming home

485
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,260
or if I had simply vanished
like their father had.

486
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,680
So they set out on foot,

487
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,767
across the flats,

488
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,102
alone.

489
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,153
I thought they had gone, you see.

490
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,282
Gone with everyone else.

491
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:50,083
I never even considered
searching for them.

492
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,171
If I had...

493
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:09,727
I took the cross from the chapel
and brought it out there

494
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,107
to mark the place where they died.

495
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,115
The place where I found you.

496
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,126
This was in your hand.

497
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,344
A page written like scripture.

498
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,890
One I'd never seen or heard of before.

499
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,559
It tells of a man,

500
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,146
a police chief named Kevin,

501
00:53:55,232 --> 00:54:00,904
who drowned and passed into the land
of the dead and spoke to them.

502
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,826
Who freed them from their pain
and rose again.

503
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,289
Just 20 kilometers from here,

504
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,669
there's a police chief named Kevin.

505
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,341
What are the chances of that?

506
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,385
It had to be him.

507
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:30,475
So, I went to him, to Kevin,
and I asked for his help.

508
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:37,273
And when he refused, I drowned him...

509
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,696
Because I thought he was testing me.

510
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,117
Because I thought he'd come back.

511
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,747
And once I'd proven my faith,

512
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:59,337
he would have no choice but to help me
talk to my children one last time.

513
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,388
So I thought you were sent by God.

514
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,395
Sent with a message just for me.

515
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,241
But you're not an angel.

516
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,869
There is no message.

517
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,540
And God doesn't care about me.

518
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,676
It's all just a story I told myself.

519
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,435
It's just a stupid, silly story.

520
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,149
And I believed it because...

521
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,618
I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?

522
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,461
No, Grace.

523
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,966
I don't think you're crazy at all.

524
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,265
You just got the wrong Kevin.

525
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,003
