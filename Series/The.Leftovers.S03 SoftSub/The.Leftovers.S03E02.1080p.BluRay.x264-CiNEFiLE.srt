1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,274
Did the missing person use
an aluminum-based deodorant?

2
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:51,027
The man didn't shower
for five years.

3
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,696
Hygiene was not a priority.

4
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,698
Did the missing person
have visual impairment

5
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,116
or wear corrective lenses?

6
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,451
No. Uh, no, ma'am.

7
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,203
He had 20l20 vision.

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,039
He could see from the top of that pillar
all the way to the bridge.

9
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,795
Could you please describe
your relationship to the missing person?

10
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
He was my husband.

11
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,514
Your husband, what was he, uh, doing
up there on that pillar?

12
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,307
Is that on your little questionnaire, too?

13
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,434
No. I was just curious.

14
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,395
-Guess.
-What?

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,148
Guess. What do you think
he was doing up there?

16
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,737
I think it was an elaborate
coping mechanism.

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,114
Coping mechanism? For what?

18
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,742
For whatever pain he was suffering.

19
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,413
Honey, he wanted to suffer.

20
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,418
He settled for the pillar only after
we got arrested trying to crucify him.

21
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,547
I got one nail in
before those fuckers had me in cuffs.

22
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,340
Free country, my ass.

23
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,551
But that pillar did the trick just fine.

24
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,889
He stayed up there in the rain,
in the cold, in the burning sun.

25
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,517
And he ate, and he peed,
and he shit up there.

26
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,270
He never came down,
never touched another person,

27
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,146
not even his own wife.

28
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,816
That man never wavered.

29
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,610
He proved himself to God,

30
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,573
and last night he got his reward.

31
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,744
You saw him depart?

32
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,371
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,292
He looked so calm and at peace.

34
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:34,505
And all of a sudden,
he just kind of faded out

35
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,258
like he was on a dimmer.

36
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,885
And, um...

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,137
And he was gone.

38
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,347
And it was beautiful.

39
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,976
So, you just happened to be awake
and looking right at him

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,187
at the exact moment
that he, uh, dimmed out?

41
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,191
I wasn't the only one who saw him.

42
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,277
Ask around.

43
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,662
She says there will be
another departure here on the 14th.

44
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,499
I mean, I didn't actually see it happen,

45
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,128
but, uh, how else could he get down
from that thing?

46
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,589
And the man on the pillar
was the first to go

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,174
because he was the highest up.

48
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,635
I don't know how else to explain it.

49
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,095
He just popped like a bubble.

50
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,855
His wife was a woman of God,

51
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,816
and she spent all morning
with the preacher.

52
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,694
Thank God for the preacher.

53
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,451
Would you happen to know
the name of this preacher?

54
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,669
Hello?

55
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,712
It's open. Come in.

56
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,386
Are you okay?

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,554
I'm fine. Just a nosebleed.

58
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,974
I take it you're here
to yell at me about the book?

59
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,558
What book?

60
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,103
The one I gave Kevin. He didn't tell you?

61
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,438
Oh. No, he told me. I'm staying out of it.

62
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,028
So, you wanna tell me
where the man on the pillar is?

63
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,447
It's my understanding he departed.

64
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,617
I didn't witness it myself,
but that's what people saw.

65
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,078
People also saw you with his wife.

66
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,415
Sandy and I are friends.

67
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,542
- She lost a husband. I offered comfort.

68
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,587
Matt, I can literally see the lie wheel
turning in your brain.

69
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,673
When did I ever lie to you?

70
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,010
When I was five, I stood out on the street
while our house burned down

71
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,178
with our mom and dad inside
and you told me it didn't hurt

72
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,513
because they were already in heaven.

73
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,848
They are.

74
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,977
Where is he, Matt?

75
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,362
You know, that poor woman
lived across the bridge

76
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,614
in that horrible encampment
for three years

77
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,324
just to be close to her husband.

78
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,994
And when they finally allowed her back in,

79
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,580
she pitched her tent
right at the base of that pillar

80
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,874
and took care of him every single day,

81
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,003
even though he never acknowledged her,
never gave a word of thanks.

82
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,468
Her loyalty and devotion,
I've never seen anything like it.

83
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,931
Except when you did it for Mary.

84
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,770
I get it, Matt. She left.

85
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,730
My heart breaks for both of you,

86
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,317
but you making up this bullshit story
about some nutjob departing--

87
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,818
He had a heart attack.

88
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,987
He fell and he died,

89
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,655
and his wife brought him to the church

90
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,908
and asked me to give him
a Christian burial.

91
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,329
And she asked me to promise,
promise not to say anything,

92
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,414
but I didn't lie, Nora.

93
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,208
I did not lie.

94
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,218
He deserves a legacy.

95
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,514
Can't you give a man a little grace?

96
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,478
So, are you gonna dig him up or should I?

97
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,942
One's for dry cleaning,
one's for gym clothes,

98
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,735
and then the last one's
for everything else.

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,613
Honey, you don't need to justify
your desire to have three hampers.

100
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,115
It's not a desire, it's a need.

101
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,575
Well, maybe we should get a fourth hamper
just in case one breaks.

102
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,036
You're jealous. That's okay.

103
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,040
-It's hard to acknowledge my genius idea.
-Boy, is it.

104
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,049
- Ready?
- Yep.

105
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,510
All right.

106
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,890
One King James Bible
wrapped in Saran Wrap.

107
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,060
One thermos.

108
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,396
Empty.

109
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,736
What?

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,533
If I told you this was a picture of him
and a killer whale,

111
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,577
-would you believe me?
-No, I would not.

112
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,833
Huh !

113
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,459
Good morning.

114
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,462
Taking over up there?

115
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,259
Just cleaning up.

116
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,095
Came by to pay my respects.

117
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,930
He was friends with Michael.

118
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,267
Hey, John, I read your book.

119
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,064
-You did?
-Mmm-hmm.

120
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah, Kevin left it in the bathroom
and I picked it up,

121
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,485
and before I knew it,
20 minutes had flown by.

122
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
It's exciting.

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,950
Y'all have a nice day.

124
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,460
I didn't leave it in the bathroom.

125
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,171
If we can't have a sense of humor
about you being the Messiah,

126
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,422
we're gonna have a problem.

127
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,405
These are his personal effects.

128
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,992
I'm so sorry for your loss.

129
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,829
Me too, me too. I'm sorry for your loss.

130
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,958
Well, I appreciate that
very much, sweetheart.

131
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,670
If you don't mind, I'm just gonna sit here
and smoke my coping mechanism.

132
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,091
She's just hurt.

133
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,718
Of course she is.

134
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,680
You took him from his pillar,

135
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,307
now he sits in heaven by your side.

136
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,853
He departed from our world
to be rewarded in yours.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,815
-Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
-Excuse me. Hello.

138
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,027
Hi. You know what happened to him?

139
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,029
- What really happened?
- Come on.

140
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,741
Have a good day. God bless.

141
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,451
"God bless"?

142
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,246
Who gives a shit
if they wanna believe that he lifted?

143
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,455
It's not true.

144
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,082
Well, in 10 days,
when the world doesn't end,

145
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,292
they're all gonna go home

146
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,294
and they're gonna find something else
that's not true.

147
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,587
Till then, I need to keep things
nice and calm.

148
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,964
I am nice and calm.

149
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,799
Yeah. Hey.

150
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,178
You're the calmest
and the nicest person I know.

151
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,477
- Bye-bye.

152
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,937
Bye-bye.

153
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,078
Hard part's over.

154
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,502
Just gonna crack this open, okay?

155
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,505
And you are free. Congratulations.

156
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,718
How's it feeling?

157
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,721
Can you wiggle your fingers, make a fist?

158
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,891
Good as new. Thank you.

159
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,813
Ms. Durst, I'm sorry
if this seems inappropriate,

160
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,859
but when you came in last month
to get the cast, one of the orderlies,

161
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,195
he said he saw you in the parking lot
before you came in.

162
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding,

163
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,993
but he said that he saw you
slam your car door on your arm

164
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,203
on purpose.

165
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,250
Now, why in God's name would I do that?

166
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,349
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Nora Durst?

167
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,309
Yes. Who is this?

168
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,145
-Is this a secure line?
-Who is this?

169
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,232
It's Mark Linn-Baker.

170
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,193
-Who?
-Mark Linn-Baker.

171
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,156
I'm, uh, calling on behalf of
a third party, and they...

172
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,992
--Well, they've asked me to ask you,

173
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,245
would you like to see your children again?

174
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,038
What?

175
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,254
Your children, Erin and Jeremy,
would you like to see them again?

176
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,675
I've got news for you, you shit.

177
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,220
Your third party obviously doesn't know
that I'm a fraud investigator for the DSD,

178
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,471
and I'm gonna have this call traced,

179
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,014
and I'm gonna find out
what exactly it is--

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,850
They know your kids' names, Nora.

181
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,810
I'm pretty sure they know what you do.

182
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,562
And they don't care.

183
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,190
You don't have to trace me.
I'm at the Crown Central in St. Louis.

184
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,526
Just ask for Mark Linn-Baker.

185
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,322
-St. Louis?
-Yes.

186
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,783
And I'm only gonna be here
for the next 24 hours,

187
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:10,539
so if you want to see your children,
you need to come and see me in person.

188
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,876
Nora?

189
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah?

190
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,464
This is real.

191
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,250
George Brevity. Hello.

192
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,586
-Hey, George. It's Nora Durst.
-Hey, Nora.

193
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,379
I just got your paperwork
on the pillar guy.

194
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,090
Extra credit
for sending the photos of the corpse.

195
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,385
Oof! What, did he land on his head?

196
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,346
Oh, is that Durst? Go and ask her, man.

197
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,098
Hey, Ocko wants to know
if you ever found out

198
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,142
what he was doing up on that thing
for five years.

199
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,560
Suffering, apparently.

200
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,020
Hey, George, listen.

201
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,940
Tell me, how do I know the name
Mark Linn-Baker?

202
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,775
The Perfect Strangers guy?

203
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,818
Who?

204
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,362
The sitcom.

205
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,696
Yeah, they were cousins.

206
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,698
One of them was a foreign guy, Yalki.

207
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,618
- Balki.
- Balki, right. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,663
-Mark Linn-Baker was the other cousin.
-He faked his departure.

209
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,792
Yeah, Balki and the two actresses
who played their wives lifted on the 14th.

210
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,837
Mark felt left out
and ran off to Mexico for three years.

211
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,507
You know what he's doing now?

212
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,801
No. Why?

213
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,637
I think he's running a carrot stick
out of St. Louis.

214
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,098
No shit?

215
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,142
-Will you authorize my travel?
-Aw, jeez, Nora, I mean,

216
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,313
we got our hands full right now,
you know, with the seven-year itch coming.

217
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,483
-Well, can't it wait?
-I need to go now, today.

218
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,652
I think this is really big.

219
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,656
All right. Keep all your receipts, okay?

220
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,658
Okay. Thanks.

221
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,034
All right, bye-bye.

222
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,496
She's going.

223
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,672
-Hey.
-Hey.

224
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,923
What are you doing home?

225
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,844
Uh, I just came home to change a shirt.

226
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,679
Oh.

227
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,682
Sick of me already?

228
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,642
I have to go to St. Louis for work.

229
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,769
Just a couple of nights.

230
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,188
Oh.

231
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,190
I'm gonna miss you.

232
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,443
I'll miss you, too.

233
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,864
Oh, do you mind if I borrow this?
I need something to read on the plane.

234
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,325
Really?

235
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,493
-You don't want me to take it?
-No.

236
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,330
Uh, no. Matt said there's only one copy.

237
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,707
Maybe Matt should've gone to Kinko's.

238
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,043
Oh.

239
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,337
Are you... You busting my balls?

240
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,922
Can holy balls be busted?

241
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,426
I would love for you to take it.

242
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,803
We're on the same page about this, right?

243
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,221
That it's ridiculous?

244
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,931
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

245
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,894
Mmm. "And she did kiss the lips of Kevin.

246
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,271
"And lo, it was good."

247
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,237
Love you.

248
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,448
Try not to walk on too much water
when I'm gone, okay?

249
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,908
I won't.

250
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,661
And I love you, too.

251
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,983
Uh...

252
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,152
May I help you, ma'am?

253
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,863
Uh, this isn't letting me hit "No."

254
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,909
And are you traveling
with an infant today?

255
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,537
-No.
-Okay.

256
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,455
--Hmm.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,165
It must be a dead spot.

258
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,458
Just go ahead and click "Yes."

259
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,585
It doesn't matter.
You're only taking up one seat.

260
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,636
May I use another kiosk, please?

261
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,332
All right, a deluxe room, one king.

262
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,002
Just a reminder,
we are a nonsmoking hotel.

263
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,796
And you requested that
a rental car be dropped off for you

264
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,923
-here at the hotel tomorrow morning?
-Yes, that's right.

265
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,718
Great.

266
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,094
Is there anything else
that I can help you with?

267
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,680
Actually, I'm here to meet
with one of your guests.

268
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,141
Oh, of course.
May I have the guest's name, please?

269
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,811
Um, Mark Linn-Baker.

270
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,326
Who is it?

271
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,329
They just called from downstairs.
You know who it is.

272
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,626
It's Nora Durst.

273
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,217
Please, come on in.

274
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,142
Did you know
they have a tailor here on premises?

275
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,520
I bought this suit yesterday.

276
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,396
They just sent a guy up, measures me.

277
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,648
Two hours later, it's back.

278
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,192
I never had a suit fit like this
in my life.

279
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,653
It's very nice.

280
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,321
May I have your cell phone, please?

281
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,781
-What?
-Your phone.

282
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,075
I just need to make sure
you're not recording this.

283
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,493
I'm not.

284
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,411
Please?

285
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,497
Ugh, okay.

286
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,168
Hey!

287
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,087
What are you doing?

288
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,588
--Sorry.

289
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,881
Uh, it's just hardware.

290
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,138
Everything that matters
is up there in the cloud, right?

291
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,434
Uh, please, have a seat.

292
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,774
Uh. . Sorry.  I took notes.

293
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,318
-I don't wanna mess up the science.
-Hmm.

294
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,740
Okay.

295
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,454
There are a couple types of radiation.

296
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,625
Non-ionizing and ionizing.

297
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,294
Now, there are a couple types of that.

298
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,589
There's alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.

299
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,132
Neutron is rare.

300
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,469
You only find it near
particle accelerators or reactors.

301
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,016
And yet, trace amounts were cataloged
within the first 48 hours

302
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,437
following October 14th
at sites where departures occurred.

303
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,982
-You with me so far?
-Oh, absolutely.

304
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:38,111
All right, the guys who discovered this,
they bring their findings to Switzerland.

305
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,907
And the physicists,
the best physicists in the world,

306
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,451
-they confirm those findings.
-Mmm-hmm.

307
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:50,081
And they name it LADR,
low amplitude Denziger radiation.

308
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,833
So, great.

309
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,335
Big deal.

310
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,879
They found LADR at departure sites.

311
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,006
But it's a footprint.

312
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,175
A shadow.

313
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,510
You can't do anything with it
because it dissipated.

314
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,137
It's gone.

315
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,598
Well, what if they could make more?

316
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,517
If they could recreate it?

317
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,105
They could build a device
and whatever they put inside that device,

318
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,524
they could blast it with that radiation...

319
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,653
And it would go.

320
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,864
Go? Where?

321
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,367
Wherever they went.

322
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,744
The 2%.

323
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,873
So, they built it, this device?

324
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,501
-Yes, ma'am.
-Then why haven't I heard of it?

325
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,588
No one would let them conduct
beta testing on live subjects.

326
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,882
-You mean people?
-Right.

327
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,010
Because they were blasting them
with radiation?

328
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,345
Exactly.

329
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,765
So, they had to leave Switzerland.
The unit is mobile now.

330
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,684
They don't stay in one place for too long.

331
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,353
That was smart of them.

332
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,730
Ah.

333
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,566
I know what you're thinking.

334
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,405
They made me go to a hotel in Phoenix.

335
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,826
I felt the same way you do right now
when I heard it the first time.

336
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,369
Her name was Lauren.

337
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,372
Uh-huh. Where's Lauren now?

338
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,251
She went through.

339
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,420
-Through?
-Through.

340
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,764
So, what's the cost?

341
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,767
Well, it's different for everyone. Uh...

342
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,687
I think it's based on a percentage
of your overall net worth.

343
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,772
-I can tell you what I paid-- Yeah?
-Mark.

344
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,608
I don't know if you are a part of this
or a victim of it,

345
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,820
but if this is real,
if they've actually built this device,

346
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:48,283
they're not sending people
to some magical place

347
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,326
to be with their loved ones.

348
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,957
They're incinerating them.

349
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,175
They will call you on this

350
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,678
with a formal invitation and instructions.

351
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,306
All you have to do is answer it.

352
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
And this

353
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,354
is a digital record of the people
who have gone through.

354
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,940
A hundred and nineteen testimonials.

355
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,403
They are not hapless suckers, not victims.

356
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,449
Each and every one of them
had to pass an IQ test to qualify.

357
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,493
There's a Nobel laureate in there.

358
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,912
I have two degrees from Yale.

359
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,460
Are you married, Mark?

360
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,633
Not anymore.

361
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,469
You?

362
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,846
I'm in a committed relationship.

363
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:59,020
Oh. Well, then I guess
I am just wasting my breath, huh?

364
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,022
Yes, you are.

365
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,361
And I think you may be suicidal.

366
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,534
Four series regulars.

367
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,703
Three go, one stays.

368
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:16,955
Me.

369
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,501
You know what the odds of that are?

370
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,841
One in 128,000.

371
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,388
What happened was arbitrary.

372
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,517
It was purposeless.

373
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,270
It wasn't my fault.

374
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,190
I didn't do anything to deserve this.

375
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,193
So, no, Nora, I don't wanna kill myself.

376
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,239
I want to take some fucking control.

377
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,343
My name is Christopher Alan Trewitt.

378
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,596

I hereby indemnify all other parties
as it relates to my physical well-being.

381
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,150
I am of sound body and mind,

382
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,570
and I give my full consent
for the journey I'm about to take,

383
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,989
whatever the destination.

384
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,793

This is a copy of
this morning's Las Noticias.

387
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,679
This was my choice and mine alone.

388
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,806
I indemnify all others.

389
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,644
I'm of sound mind and body,
and give consent to go...

390
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,356
To go wherever they went.

391
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,026
Amen.

392
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,115
My name is Paul Matiba.

393
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,743
I was born December 4, 1969.

394
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,956
This is today's Philadelphia Inquirer.

395
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,041
I'm of sound mind and body.

396
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,295

Date of birth, 14th April, 1985.

402
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,609
I have a copy of this morning's paper.

403
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,196
This was my choice.

404
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,407
...and I hereby indemnify...

405
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,948
Come on.

406
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,920
Hey.

407
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,025
Hey. I saw that.

408
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,276
That's not yours.

409
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,696
Thank you.

410
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,414
Hi.

411
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,292
Hi.

412
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,754
This is yours, right?

413
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,633
Who are you?

414
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,975
Nora?

415
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,771
Christine, hi.

416
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,732
Hi.

417
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,030
What are you doing here?

418
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,369
I'm in town on business.

419
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,704
So...

420
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,584
It's great to see you.

421
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,969
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Austin International Airport

422
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,722
where the local time is about 4:35 p.m.

423
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,600
If you're visiting Texas,
we're happy to have y'all with us.

424
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,852
And if you live here, welcome home.

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,201
Please insert your parking ticket.

426
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,749
Please insert your parking ticket.

427
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,213
Please insert your parking ticket.

428
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,718
--Please insert your parking ticket.

429
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,096
--Please insert your parking ticket.

430
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,433
Please insert your parking ticket.

431
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,811
...your parking ticket.

432
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,442
I prepaid at the fucking machine!

433
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,902
What do you want me to do?

434
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,864
Please insert your parking ticket.

435
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,993
Please insert your parking ticket.

436
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,330
Please insert your parking ticket.

437
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,957
Please insert your parking...

438
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,669
Thank you.

439
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,452
Hi.

440
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,180
-Thanks.
-Mmm-hmm.

441
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,146
So, Michael said Tommy's party was fun.

442
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,397
Yeah, it was nice.

443
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,773
You were missed.

444
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,945
I see you got your cast off.

445
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,823
Oh. Yeah. Day before yesterday.

446
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,159
You know I would've done it for you.

447
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,744
I didn't wanna waste your time.

448
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,831
How'd you break it?

449
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,167
I'm clumsy.

450
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,713
Did I ever tell you how the day
after October 14th I broke my leg?

451
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,924
There was a picture of me on crutches
in the newspaper

452
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,676
once they found out about my family.

453
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,847
The headline was "Nora Cursed."

454
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,394
Rhymes with Durst.

455
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,692
-Nora.
-Hmm?

456
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,612
How'd you break it?

457
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,991
I don't wanna lie to you.

458
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,076
Then don't.

459
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,542
I broke it to cover something up.

460
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,842
Show me.

461
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,896
It's the logo for the Wu-Tang band.

462
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,734
-I think you mean the Wu-Tang Clan.
-Right.

463
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,903
Big fan.

464
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,615
What were you covering up?

465
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,954
Um...

466
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,540
My kids' names.

467
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,426
The artist did a beautiful job.
It was very tasteful.

468
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,096
Very understated.

469
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,976
And it didn't hurt, the needle.

470
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,019
It was... It felt good.

471
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,147
But, um...

472
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,154
Just as he was finishing up,
I played it out.

473
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,158
I thought for the rest of my life

474
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,578
people would come up to me
and they would say,

475
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,913
"Oh, what a nice tattoo.

476
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,540
"Who are Erin and Jeremy?"

477
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,584
And I would say, "They're my children."

478
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,591
"I'm Nora Cursed.
Ask me about my poor, departed children."

479
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,677
It was pathetic.

480
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:07,057
So, I pointed to
the first thing I saw on the wall,

481
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,226
it looked like a phoenix,

482
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,020
and I told the guy
to give me that one instead.

483
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,689
"Just cover it up, please,"
like it never fucking happened.

484
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,986
I was having a bad day.

485
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,575
I think I'm going crazy.

486
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,368
Mmm-mmm.

487
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,747
You are not going crazy, Nora.

488
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,878
How are you not going crazy after Evie?

489
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,674
Evie died...

490
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,428
And I got to bury her.

491
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,724
I got to bury her.

492
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,651
I bought a trampoline.

493
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,821
Come on.

494
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,757
Evening, ma'am.

495
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,467
License and registration, please.

496
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,969
Um, my boyfriend's the chief of police
in this town.

497
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,346
You think I can get off
with a warning, Officer?

498
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,059
Okay.

499
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,187
Consider yourself warned.

500
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,814
I just got off my shift.
Do you wanna go grab a drink?

501
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,776
Can I take a rain check?
I just got back from a business trip.

502
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,738
Business trip?

503
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,493
Christine called you?

504
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,268
I didn't go to see her.

505
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,062
I was in St. Louis on business.

506
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,438
They live in Kentucky.

507
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,441
How'd you even know where to find her?

508
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,026
She's not hiding, Tom.

509
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,278
She's putting pictures of Lily
on Instagram and Facebook.

510
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,863
Her name's not Lily anymore.

511
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,036
Christine just wants to know
if she should be worried.

512
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,539
She came after me.

513
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,166
She filed for custody because

514
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,043
she made the single
worst mistake of her life.

515
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,670
She wanted to fight me.

516
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,296
And did I fight back, Tom?

517
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,507
No.

518
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,175
No, I didn't.

519
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,511
I sat across from her at the deposition,

520
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,889
and all I saw was a mother
who had lost her child.

521
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,142
And I gave her child back.

522
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,810
And now she doesn't know who I am.

523
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,855
So, no, Tom, nobody has to worry about me.

524
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,199
Kevin adopted me when I was three.

525
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,202
I don't even remember that.

526
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,663
I grew up thinking he was my real dad.

527
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,251
Then, when I was 10,
he and my mom decided

528
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:48,255
that I should know about my real father,
my biological father.

529
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,933
I spent the next 10 years of my life

530
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,936
knocking on some asshole's fucking door

531
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,938
who wanted nothing to do with me.

532
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,900
He had moved on. He had a new family.

533
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,778
So, I wish they wouldn't have told me,

534
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,865
because I was already where I belonged.

535
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,287
Well, do you know what I wish?

536
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,583
I wish you'd never left her for me.

537
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,964
I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.

538
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,134
I left her for my dad.

539
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,971
I didn't even know you existed.

540
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,799
Can I print a photo from this?

541
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,846
Which one do you wanna print?

542
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,016
This one, please.

543
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,397
-Jesus.
-How big can I make it?

544
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,715
You are a heartless bitch.

545
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,473
Hey! Hey! Hey, God damn you !

546
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,727
God damn you to hell !

547
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,618
You're home.

548
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,545
I thought you were gone till tomorrow.

549
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,929
I tear it off every time.

550
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,396
I just do it to feel...

551
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,485
I don't wanna die.

552
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,169
It's okay.

553
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,047
It is?

554
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,136
You don't need to explain, Kevin.

555
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,765
Hey, look.

556
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,186
I got a tattoo.

557
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,650
A couple hundred more
and I'll catch up with you.

558
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,533
Let's have a baby.

559
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,201
What?

560
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,791
I wanna have a baby with you.

561
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,176
I'm sorry.

562
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,432
I'm sorry.

563
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,529
Oh.

564
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,244
Hey.

565
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,581
Sorry.

566
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,422
Are you happy?

567
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,551
Yes.

568
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,638
I'm happy, too.

569
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,435
Let's not fuck that up, okay?

570
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,569
I need to get that.

571
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,737
Yeah.

572
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,664
- Yes?
- Hello. Ms. Durst?

573
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:56,957
Yes.

574
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,417
Thank you for answering the call.

575
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,920
Mark explained the opportunity
we're offering you?

576
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:06,758
Yes.

577
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,760
Someone is standing by to meet you

578
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,471
at the Crown Central
in Melbourne, Australia.

579
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,641
Can you be there by Tuesday
with $20,000 in cash?

580
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,817
- Yes, I can do that.
- Excellent. We'll see you then.

581
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,865
-Who was that?
-Work.

582
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,663
I need to go to Australia.

583
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,499
Just for a couple of days.

584
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,088
Can I come with you?

585
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,009
Yeah.

586
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,012
Yeah.

587
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:36,222
I can't be sure just yet, Jean,
but with the seventh anniversary of

588
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,725
October 15 fast approaching,

589
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,311
we may see some hellfire
moving up from the south.

590
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,729
And off the Gold Coast,

591
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:47,567
a high-pressure system of locusts
and perhaps blood boiling up.

592
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:03,917
Where you off to, then?

593
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,088
Oh, uh, just closing up, Chief.

594
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,215
Nothing's happening tonight.

595
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,925
You a psychic, Gerry?

596
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,635
Sorry?

597
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,348
Are you, like, clairvoyant?

598
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,225
Can you see into the future?

599
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,603
- Uh, no, Chief.
- No?

600
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,939
It's just that you've concluded that

601
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,650
nothing's gonna happen tonight
because nothing has happened?

602
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,277
Yeah.

603
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,032
It's just,
Ginny's not feeling well, so...

604
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,492
Ginny?

605
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,327
Who's that?

606
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,621
You know who she is.

607
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,123
I honestly don't.

608
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,793
I mean, it can't be your wife
'cause you haven't got a wife.

609
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,795
I mean, it...

610
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,880
Shit, I know who you're talking about.

611
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,549
You're talking about your dog, aren't ya?

612
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,342
Yep.

613
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,510
Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's

614
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,762
gonna have to wait for you to
come home tonight because

615
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,973
you're on duty.

616
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,143
- Yes, Chief. Yep.
- Good.

617
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,730
Cruiser one's got 'roo brains all over it,
so give it a wash, will ya?

618
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,022
I'm gonna take yours.

619
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,141
- This oughta be good.

620
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,857
Good evening.

621
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,734
G'day, sweetheart.

622
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,069
Ladies.

623
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,534
May I ask why you're blocking my driveway?

624
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,207
Are you chief of police?

625
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,835
Indeed I am.

626
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,838
Is your name Kevin?

627
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,300
Indeed it is.

628
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,768
"And He looked at them
and raised His hand,

629
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,895
"but they did not wave in response.

630
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:34,025
"And so He clutched the stone to His chest
and jumped into the water."

631
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,617
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

632
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,663
I know who you are.

633
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,749
Well, I don't know who you are.

634
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,171
My name is Grace Playford
and I need your help.

635
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,049
Well, Grace, uh,

636
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,719
I'm off duty, so why don't
you and your girlfriends run along home

637
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,263
before I call Mr. Playford?

638
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,391
Will you come with us, please?

639
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,059
I can explain everything.

640
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,436
No, no, no, I don't want you
to explain fucking anything.

641
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,939
I want you
to get the fuck off my property, and...

642
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,399
--What the...

643
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,405
Jesus, Florence.

644
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,407
Well, he wasn't coming.

645
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,769
What the fuck?

646
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,438
What's happening?

647
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,733
- It's all right.

648
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,192
You're amongst friends.

649
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,739
We know who you are.

650
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,575
Let me go.

651
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,578
I don't know why you're acting this way,

652
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,165
but if I have to prove I know,
then so be it.

653
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,167
Maybe it's not him.

654
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,211
It's him.

655
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,672
Let me go, you fucking cunt!

656
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,760
I'll see you in two minutes.

657
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,687
Stop it!

658
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,946
No! Fuck off!

659
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,216
- Grace, what if it's not him?
- It's him.

660
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,224
But what if it’s not?

661
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,503
Okay, let him up.

662
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,258
Okay, let him up!

663
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,124
Kevin?

664
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,297
Kevin?

665
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,760
Kevin?

666
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,598
Kevin, you need to wake up now.

667
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,267
We know who you are.

668
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,187
Wake up.

669
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,446
Help me. Help me get the ropes off.

670
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,117
Let's get him off.

671
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,078
Get him off.

672
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,954
We've gotta get him...

673
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,748
Come on.

674
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,543
You all right, Naomi?

675
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,424
Kevin...

676
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:09,675
Hey.

677
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,560
What are you ladies up to?

678
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,466
English-SDH
