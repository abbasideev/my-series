1
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,190
Heaven and Earth will disappear,
but my words remain forever.

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,734
But no one knows the date now
when the end will be,

3
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,653
not even the angels.

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,780
No, nor even God's son.

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,157
Only the Father knows.

6
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,411
The world will be at ease,
banquets and parties and weddings,

7
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,956
just as it was in Noah's time
before the sudden coming of the flood.

8
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,750
People wouldn't believe
what was going to happen

9
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,878
until the flood actually arrived
and took them all away.

10
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,381
So shall my coming be.

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,801
Two men will be working together
in the fields,

12
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,929
and one will be taken, the other left.

13
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,474
Two women will be going about
their household tasks.

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,477
One will be taken, the other left.

15
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,315
So be prepared, for you don't know
what day your Lord is coming.

16
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,394
Morning.

17
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,982
You can talk. It's okay.

18
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,826
You're much better at this than me.

19
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,453
Maybe you should be in charge.

20
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,505
You like Siegfried and Roy,
the magic guys in Vegas?

21
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,093
They did tricks
with those beautiful tigers.

22
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,930
Every night, a tiger disappears,

23
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,600
and the tiger comes back.

24
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,895
They made calendars with those tigers.

25
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,565
They just laid right on top of them
like they were carpets.

26
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,047
It's just a matter of time before
one of those fuckers bites your face off.

27
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,269
- Go, go, go! Let's go, get in.
- Clear out!

28
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,979
Hurry up, come on, go!

29
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,361
Go, go!

30
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,517
- Hey, over here. Come ahead.

31
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,356
That's it. Keep moving.

32
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,693
Chief.

33
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,986
Yeah, go ahead.

34
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,862
Count's getting up there.

35
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,657
We're over 700,
and it's not even lunchtime.

36
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,409
You want us to try and slow the flow?

37
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,328
All are welcome, Dickie.

38
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,122
Copy that.

39
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,419
How you doing, Andy?

40
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,176
Let's go.

41
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,472
- Come on ! Go!
- Come on, keep moving. Let's go.

42
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,890
Keep it rolling.

43
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,563
Excuse me.
Officer, do we need to get wristbands?

44
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,064
No, ma'am, not anymore.

45
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,691
Is there somewhere we can park?

46
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,069
Uh, yeah. There's a campground
about a half-mile up the road.

47
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,237
Follow me.

48
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,576
Come on.

49
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,910
Come on. Let's go.

50
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,632
- It's Busey!
- ...in our town, okay?

51
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,092
-He's Departed. He's not--
-It's Busey.

52
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,968
I don't care who it is, all right?

53
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,262
There's a height ordinance.
Nothing above 15 feet.

54
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,430
You gotta take it down.

55
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,432
That dude on the pillar
is over 15 feet, man !

56
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

57
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,269
The guy on the pillar
was grandfathered in.

58
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,479
-Hey, Chief.
-What's going on?

59
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,315
Uh, these gentlemen don't seem to wanna
deflate their little joke here.

60
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,192
All right, no, no. It is not a joke, okay?

61
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,070
Mr. Gary Busey's coming back from heaven
on the 14th.

62
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,321
How is he gonna know where to land?

63
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,325
All right.

64
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,244
Here's what I'm gonna do.

65
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,996
I'm gonna let you keep Gary up there,

66
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,042
but you guys have to be my deputies.

67
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,172
You see anyone or anything
that seems remotely dangerous,

68
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,341
call me, personally.

69
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,718
Nuts, man. Fucking nuts!

70
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,346
You never underestimate the spirit.

71
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,057
Yeah, man.

72
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,726
-That was smart.
-Yeah.

73
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,062
See what happens
when you make people feel important?

74
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,689
Should I be writing this down?

75
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,524
Listen, we're already over our number.

76
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,317
We're a few bodies short
down at the bridge.

77
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,819
You mind running down there
till roll call?

78
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,279
-No, not at all.
-All right.

79
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,364
And we got dinner tonight.
6:00 sharp. Don't forget.

80
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,949
5:30 works a little better for me.

81
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,742
Well, 6:00 works better for me.

82
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,911
Okay. 6:00 it is.

83
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,038
You guys do remember
it's my birthday today, right?

84
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,957
- Get to the bridge.
- All right, Chief.

85
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,219
The King of Babylon
had a dream,

86
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,388
and that dream was terrifying.

87
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,391
So, Daniel comes, he cracks his knuckles.

88
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,727
"Okay, tell me what you've got."

89
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,520
"I dreamed," says the King,

90
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,899
"of a great tree
stretching all the way to the heavens.

91
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,652
"A tree that provides
all things to all people,

92
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,906
"but then it was cut down, destroyed."

93
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,033
Daniel nods. "Ah."

94
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,744
"You know what it means?" asked the King.

95
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,080
"You are the tree," says Daniel.
"I am?" says the King.

96
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,917
"You are," answers Daniel.

97
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,837
"And you getting cut down
isn't the worst part either,

98
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,758
"because once you are down,
you will lose your mind.

99
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,594
"You will go mad, my King.

100
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,933
"You will live amongst the wild animals,
and eat grass like an ox."

101
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,852
"Forever?" asked the King.

102
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,271
"No," says Daniel.

103
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,399
"Just for seven years."

104
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,783
Deuteronomy. "Every seven years,
you must cancel all debts."

105
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,786
Genesis. "Seven years of famine began."

106
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,457
Ezekiel. "They shall burn them with fire
for seven years."

107
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,671
So, what will happen on October 14th,
just a couple of weeks from now?

108
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,591
Probably nothing.

109
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,344
But if something were to happen,

110
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,847
it would happen here in Jarden, Texas,
in Miracle.

111
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,310
Because I get a feeling
in this place, sometimes,

112
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,356
the same feeling I got when my wife awoke
from a three-year coma

113
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,983
the day I brought her here. Mary.

114
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,200
The same feeling I had
after being told by countless doctors

115
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,828
that Mary could not bear a child.

116
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,414
But she bore one here.

117
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,463
- Noah's a little shy like his dad.

118
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,507
My friends, I've got that feeling again.

119
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,969
So if something does happen
on October 14th,

120
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,514
you've all come to the right place.

121
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,350
- Amen to that. Amen to that.

122
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,518
Hallelujah.

123
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,228
Hallelujah!

124
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,108
I see a lot of new faces. Welcome.

125
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,652
If you want to be baptized
here in Miracle,

126
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,237
just come on down tomorrow morning.

127
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,781
We'll be at the spring
on the east edge of town,

128
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,868
which the good Lord has seen fit
to replenish with water.

129
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,002
You watching porn?

130
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,046
What?

131
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,049
Oh, when people are watching porn,
they shut...

132
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,385
Ah, never mind. Forget it.

133
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,512
Okay.

134
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,931
You coming tonight?
I told Tommy 6:00 sharp.

135
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,099
Mmm-hmm.

136
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,564
- Hey there, Chief.
- Hey.

137
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,443
Mmm, what are you two talking about?

138
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,236
Just Tom's party.

139
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,072
Oh. Yeah, can't wait.

140
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,824
I'm sorry about the church.
I know we're over capacity.

141
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,035
It's just so many people want to come.

142
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,622
Yeah, well, then look.
Maybe you should, um, stop advertising.

143
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,290
What's that?

144
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,753
The address
for the church is right on it.

145
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,255
No one loves handing out flyers
more than you do.

146
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,174
I swear I didn't do this.

147
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,926
You heard what I said in there.

148
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,177
No, I heard what you said in there,

149
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,429
and you said nothing's gonna happen
on the 14th

150
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,765
unless everything happens on the 14th.

151
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,894
I can't afford to have this place
explode again, all right?

152
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,270
Just tone it down.

153
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,403
Of course. You're right. Will do.

154
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,616
"Will do"?

155
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,285
If you're asking me
to tone it down, Kevin,

156
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,745
I'll tone it down.

157
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:20,956
Good.

158
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,749
Good.

159
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,459
Good.

160
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,381
Good.

161
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,641
Did he see it?

162
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,603
Okay, everybody. Settle down.

163
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,148
Listen, we are two weeks out
from the 14th,

164
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,650
and, uh, currently, our estimates are low.

165
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,026
We are looking now at an influx

166
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,572
of anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 pilgrims
between then and now.

167
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,661
Uh, as of now, you're all approved
for permanent OT, effective immediately.

168
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,291
Am I late?

169
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,001
No, you're right on time.

170
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,630
Um, Agent Nora Durst from the DSD is gonna
tell us about procedures moving forward.

171
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,466
So, everybody, uh, listen up.

172
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,342
Thanks, Chief.

173
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,221
- Can you guys hear me okay?
- Yeah.

174
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,558
Okay, great. So, I know we went over this
a couple of months ago,

175
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,226
but there's been some confusion.

176
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,645
So, let's talk about the "D" word.

177
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,564
Yes, I get it.

178
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,733
If a guy says his girlfriend
vanished into thin air,

179
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,902
there's a good chance
she's decomposing in his trunk.

180
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,446
But as frustrating as it is
to indulge the bullshit,

181
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,532
there is a process in place
that we all must go through.

182
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,118
If a suspect asks for a lawyer,
you get a lawyer.

183
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,580
If a suspects says "Departure,"
you get me. Cool?

184
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,540
- Yeah.
- Got ya.

185
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,959
Dismissed, assholes.

186
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,463
-Walk you out, Agent Durst?
-Absolutely, Chief Garvey. Thank you.

187
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,718
Tommy knows.

188
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,553
Kevin, there's no such thing
as a surprise party.

189
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,473
-Well, then why the hell are we doing it?
-Because it's fun to pretend.

190
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,059
Hey, help me out. Between the blades.

191
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,396
- Get right up in there.
- Oh, yeah. Ooh, higher.

192
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,858
I'm gonna miss this cast.

193
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,902
Yet you never asked to sign it.

194
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,240
-Bye.
-Bye.

195
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,577
Hey, Chief.

196
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,413
A guy just came in,
and says he needs to talk to you.

197
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,499
Is he a tinfoil hat or a Kenneth?

198
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,167
Neither.

199
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,710
Knows you from New York.

200
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,963
Says you guys were hunting buddies?

201
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,944
Christ, it's good to see you.

202
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,446
- Good to see you, too.

203
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,910
-Well, you remember me, right?
-Yeah.

204
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,829
-Dean.
-Of course. Dean, yeah.

205
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,456
What can I do for you?

206
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,126
You know, uh, probably I...

207
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,795
I should hold back on some of the details

208
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,464
until I can provide you
with unassailable proof,

209
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,758
but if I'm being completely honest,

210
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,594
it's... It's a little out-there,
you know...

211
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,803
Sure.

212
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,850
I... I tried to keep you out of this...

213
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,479
But I gotta regretfully inform you
that our prey,

214
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,151
previously unsophisticated
and easily killable...

215
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,864
...has adapted.

216
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:06,306
So, Wyoming Senator Y. Woodrow Huffman,
the incumbent, mind you,

217
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,850
has a swanky fundraiser a week back.

218
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,227
Food's high-class, all right?

219
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,272
Crab cakes, Cornish game hens.

220
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,818
But this motherfucker, Huffman,
he asks me for a peanut butter sandwich.

221
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,988
Wait, he asked you for--

222
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,324
Yeah, I was undercover
on the catering staff.

223
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, the Senator was a guest of honor,
the man of the hour,

224
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,789
so fucking A right,
we got him his sandwich.

225
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,208
You know, peanut butter.

226
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,002
Man, they love that shit.

227
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,422
And he's the only one who touched it,
only one who bit it.

228
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,132
His saliva.

229
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,261
So when you test it, you...
You know that it's uncorrupted.

230
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,390
Test it for what?

231
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,894
Canine DNA.

232
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,856
Now, I... I know what you're thinking.

233
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,901
All right. Why take on human form?
What do they want?

234
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,528
Right? Today, it's the Senator.

235
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,155
Tomorrow, it's the Secretary
of, you know, goddamn Agriculture.

236
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,032
And then, it's the President.

237
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,410
The leader of the free fucking world.

238
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,665
And that, my friend, is how the world ends
two weeks from now.

239
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,959
That's how they get their finger
on the button.

240
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,005
Paw.

241
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,590
Sorry?

242
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,803
That's how they get their paw on the...
On the button.

243
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,101
So, you... You don't believe me.

244
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,607
What you're thinking is happening...

245
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,527
Isn't.

246
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,906
It's all in your head, man.

247
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,078
It's not real.

248
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,300
Look, Valdivia tells me
you're staying down by the trailer park.

249
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,638
--So, tomorrow, I'm gonna come by,

250
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
and we're gonna talk.

251
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,642
Just...

252
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,458
-All right, Chief, see you tomorrow.
-I'll see you, Dean.

253
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,928
Perfect. The Wet-Naps are over there.

254
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,033
So, what do you want to know?

255
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:17,747
Look, no offense, all right,
but, uh, my wife made me come here.

256
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,042
And I don't really believe
in any of this shit.

257
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,294
"Shit"?

258
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,588
Yeah.

259
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,467
Well, you already paid,
so you might as well hear what I got, man.

260
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,347
So, what, you just, uh...

261
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,559
You look at my palm print,
you talk to my dead father?

262
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,310
Don't you think you should light
some candles, you know?

263
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,187
Maybe get out
a Ouija board or something?

264
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,772
Pat Benatar.

265
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,656
Now how'd you know about that?

266
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,285
Look, I can't talk to your dad, man.

267
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,706
It's more like turning a radio dial
and seeing what you pick up.

268
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,959
But you ask the right questions,
you usually get something back.

269
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,632
So, what do you want to know?

270
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,807
Why did he do it on my birthday?

271
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,861
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'm gonna grab something upstairs.

272
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,613
No problem. I'll see you later, Kev.

273
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,406
- Yeah. Sorry.
Mmm-hmm.

274
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,618
All right.

275
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,038
Okay, now listen.

276
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,207
I know there's a part of you

277
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,543
that is hoping that he didn't even know
it was your birthday.

278
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,506
But there are some things
you need to know about him first.

279
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,301
He believed himself
to be a failure.

280
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,638
He believed himself to be a failure.

281
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,972
He--

282
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,351
- He failed his family.
- He failed his family.

283
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,852
He failed at his job.

284
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,064
He failed at being the man
that he wanted to be.

285
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,903
He was... He was sad. He was always sad.

286
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,866
And he didn't want anyone to know,
especially his kids.

287
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,619
He hid it from...

288
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,999
He hid it from Annemarie, and Billy,
and you.

289
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,170
I'm so sorry,

290
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,507
but the truth is he was so broken

291
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,635
that he didn't even know
it was your birthday

292
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,345
when he took his life.

293
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,808
He was only thinking about one thing.

294
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,768
Escaping.

295
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,688
So, that's what he did.

296
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:48,940
He escaped.

297
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,025
And that's what he did.

298
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,528
He escaped.

299
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,321
Okay. You can hug him now.

300
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,203
They won't believe it unless it's harsh.

301
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,539
- Jeez, now I know why I quit therapy.

302
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,625
What brings you by, Kev-o?

303
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,544
We got a problem.

304
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,879
We gotta keep it between you and me.

305
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,715
Okay.

306
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,553
Apparently, dogs are taking on human form,

307
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,932
and they are infiltrating
the highest levels of our government.

308
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,229
And... And where did you
come by this information, Chief Garvey?

309
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,441
A guy I used to know in Mapleton
a few years back.

310
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,902
Maybe we shot some dogs together.

311
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,242
You were in the GR. I was, uh, coping.

312
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,785
So this is my fault?

313
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,996
No, it's his fault
'cause he's fucking crazy.

314
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,749
Did you tell him he was crazy?

315
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,167
Maybe.

316
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,671
You never tell someone who is
experiencing a delusion of that magnitude

317
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,048
that they are delusional.

318
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,759
You told me I was delusional
when I told you I was talking to Patti.

319
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,011
And then you went
and drank poison.

320
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,846
I'm better now.

321
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,474
Of course you are.

322
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,146
Just please talk to this guy?

323
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm worried about him. He's...

324
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,692
- You got it.

325
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,365
-Hey, man.
-How you doing, man?

326
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,201
Uh...

327
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,578
You and Nora need any help
setting up Tommy's thing?

328
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,413
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Yeah?

329
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,506
How much is that?

330
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,966
It's, uh, 80 bucks.

331
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,302
- You just...

332
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,556
She's good, isn't she?

333
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,141
She's the best.

334
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,277
-Pat Benatar.
-Pat Benatar.

335
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,572
Whoo!

336
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,824
Let's party.

337
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,743
Okay, shh !

338
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,663
He's coming, he's coming,
he's coming ! Okay. Okay.

339
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,879
Surprise!

340
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,174
Oh, my God. A party?

341
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:25,972
Happy birthday, dear Tommy

342
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,265
Happy birthday, buddy.

343
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,229
Happy birthday to you

344
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,819
Go on, make a wish.

345
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,697
A wish, huh? What should I wish for?

346
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,616
Let's see.
That's a lot of responsibility, Dad.

347
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,538
I could wish for world peace.
That's always a classic.

348
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,040
-Boo.
-No need to ask for a bigger family

349
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,710
since everybody seems to be
marrying each other.

350
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,714
I always wanted a little brother,
by the way, dude.

351
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,758
Or I could-- I could give it away.

352
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,053
Anyone need anything?

353
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,056
It's your wish, honey.

354
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,561
All right. I... I got it, I got it.

355
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,153
- Someone's at the door.
- Those are so annoying.

356
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,035
This the house
where all the fucked up people live?

357
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,787
What? What?

358
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,790
- Wishes do come true!
- Oh!

359
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,546
Mary and me were in Guatemala.

360
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:41,923
"Huatemala"?

361
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,592
- You don't pronounce the "G," Thomas.

362
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,677
That's the first thing
they told the missionaries.

363
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,099
What they didn't tell us
was not to eat the cow brains.

364
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,101
I threw up for five days straight,

365
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,940
and apparently, hallucinated multiple
conversations with a burning bush.

366
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,442
-What did it say?
-Well, my Spanish wasn't so great.

367
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,779
Something along the lines of,
"Please put me out."

368
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,368
Where were you, John?

369
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,370
Uh, well, let me see. Uh...

370
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,456
I was about a mile and a half that way.

371
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,209
Uh, Erika was in med school,

372
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,837
- and I was working at a liquor store.
Uh-oh.

373
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,299
Yeah.  Which, uh,
didn't turn out to be so good. Uh...

374
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,801
Your turn, Kev-o.

375
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,553
Oh.

376
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,137
Me at 25? Jesus.

377
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,100
I was, uh... I was a cop.
I worked for my dad, the chief.

378
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:38,479
And, uh, this was long before he decided
to go off the grid and move to Australia.

379
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,982
But, on my 25th birthday,

380
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,443
I was, uh...
I was driving through an intersection,

381
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,532
and bam, back of my cruiser gets clipped.

382
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,119
I jump out of the car,
and, uh, the airbags have gone off.

383
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:57,665
The woman who hit me, she's shaken,
but she's okay. And I go over to her car.

384
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,168
There's a little 2-year-old boy
in a car seat.

385
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,006
And he's just calm as can be.

386
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,800
He's just smiling at me.

387
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,637
Must have liked the uniform.

388
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,309
- Wait, that was Laurie?
- Yeah.

389
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,810
A year later, I married her,

390
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,520
- adopted smiley over here.
- Oh!

391
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,689
All because we both thought
we had the green light.

392
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,066
And it turned out
that the switcher was busted.

393
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,359
So, you know.

394
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,197
Well, divine intervention.

395
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,955
What do you mean?

396
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,627
You know, like, uh, karma,
or kismet, whatever.

397
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,046
You know?

398
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,928
What?

399
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,724
Oh, nothing. I... I'd never heard
the story before. It's lovely.

400
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,603
To being in the right place
at the right time.

401
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,397
- Yeah, right place, right time.
- Right place, right time.

402
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,202
Sure you wanna drive back to campus?
You could stay here with us tonight.

403
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,414
If I stay with you guys,
it'll just hurt Mom's feelings.

404
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,959
Then stay with her and John.

405
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,711
It's not like it's a far walk.

406
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,880
Yeah, but...
If I stay with her,

407
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,758
she'll just keep me up
all night apologizing.

408
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,763
So, this is the last time
we're ever gonna see each other, huh?

409
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
What do you... What do you mean?

410
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,016
Just the world is ending.

411
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,769
Oh, yeah. Well, right.

412
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:44,980
How's Nora?

413
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,191
She's great.

414
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,111
She ever talk about Lily?

415
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,570
No.

416
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,452
Should I try and get her to?

417
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,496
What do I know?

418
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,332
You still got your crown on.

419
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,917
I know I do.

420
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,005
What were you guys talking about
out on the porch? Your penises?

421
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,008
No, we were talking about
what we were doing when we were 25.

422
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,678
And, uh, I told the story about how
when Laurie crashed into the back of me.

423
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,805
Oh, how romantic.

424
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,892
It's more romantic than
when we met in divorce court,

425
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,143
and you told me fuck my daughter.

426
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,644
That's not where we met.

427
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,522
We met at the Christmas dance
and you told me you cheated on your wife.

428
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,486
-We gotta work on our story.
-Mmm. Yeah.

429
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,823
-Here, let me get that.
-I got it.

430
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,868
-Come here.
-Thank you.

431
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,371
- When do you get your cast off?
- Um...

432
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,957
Day after tomorrow.

433
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,340
I was watching you
from the porch, with Noah.

434
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,387
Mmm, yeah. He's yummy, isn't he?

435
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,515
Mmm-hmm.

436
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,576
Good morning.

437
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,914
-What time is it?
-It's Sunday morning. Sleep in.

438
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,457
I'm just gonna go for a ride.

439
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,294
I should get on the bridge.

440
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,712
Suit yourself, Sheriff.

441
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,299
Everybody knows
you just like to ride that horse.

442
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,175
--Giddy-up.

443
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,679
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

444
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,113
- Hey, Chief, you there?
- Go ahead, Tommy.

445
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,325
The church was doing baptisms,
and these kids poisoned the water.

446
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:14,078
- You should probably get down here.

447
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,287
On my way.

448
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,378
Keep moving ! Move!

449
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,926
- They poisoned the water!
- What?

450
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,844
They poisoned the water, Kevin.

451
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,013
Come on ! Come on ! Stand back!

452
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,933
-What the fuck happened?
-These guys interrupted a baptism,

453
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,352
and spilled barrels in the springs!

454
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,479
What the fuck is in those barrels?

455
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,772
This water isn't holy!

456
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,023
This water is a symbol of hypocrisy.

457
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,358
I need you to calm the fuck down.

458
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,735
-Three years ago, October 15th...
-I need you to calm the fuck down !

459
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,363
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Cults

460
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,324
assassinated 93 unarmed members
of the Guilty Remnant.

461
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,536
They were targeted by a military drone
and vaporized.

462
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,954
Megan Abbott!

463
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,622
Evangeline Murphy!

464
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,916
-Remember them. Remember them--
-Taylor Truitt! Nicholas Brody!

465
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,209
Go to hell!

466
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,967
I need you to calm down !

467
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,679
Stay back!

468
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:14,847
Stay back!

469
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,056
Calm down !

470
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,227
Just listen, please!

471
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,520
Dad !

472
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,468
The water's fine.

473
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,388
It's a prank.

474
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,851
The water's safe. It's a stupid prank.

475
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,613
Trust me.

476
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,577
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

477
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:02,746
What?

478
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,958
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

479
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,296
Yes.

480
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,510
Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey,

481
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,514
in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,

482
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,808
buried in the likeness of his death

483
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,186
and raised
in the likeness of his resurrection.

484
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,216
He is saved.

485
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,265
That didn't count.

486
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,662
Want me to put the air on, dry you out?

487
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,582
That's very funny.

488
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,586
Those kids
with "Evie" on their shirts,

489
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,756
they were telling the truth
about what happened.

490
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,428
On the morning of October 15th,
three years ago,

491
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,973
there was an unexpected gas leak
at the visitor center.

492
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,933
As the result of a cigarette being lit

493
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,270
by a member of the Guilty Remnant,
who were occupying the center at the time,

494
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,899
the gas ignited, and the building
and the people inside were incinerated.

495
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,780
We pray for the families
of those that were lost.

496
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,657
And that's the story, Tommy.

497
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,535
But it's bullshit.

498
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,291
How'd you know the water wasn't poisoned?

499
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,503
I just knew.

500
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,463
That's bullshit, too.

501
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,882
Oh, shit!

502
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,479
Fuck!

503
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:37,818
Tommy!

504
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,653
Tommy!

505
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,583
You changed, you son of a bitch.

506
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,348
I got him.

507
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,063
Folks, this is a crime scene.

508
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,023
Stay behind the yellow tape.

509
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,490
Let me bum one of those.

510
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,004
You have to talk to someone.

511
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,715
I gave Billy my statement.

512
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:45,051
No. You gotta talk to a shrink.

513
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,389
I was just doing my job. I'm fine.

514
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,975
I was just doing my job
when I killed someone.

515
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,561
It still fucked me up.
You gotta talk. Talking helps.

516
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,355
You killed someone?

517
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,445
Yeah.

518
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,572
A, um...

519
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,990
A woman.

520
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,746
I had to. She, um...

521
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:16,917
You know, she had armed security
with her, and I...

522
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,004
Well, I killed them, too.

523
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,937
Hey, get away from there!

524
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,523
Stinkin' mutt!

525
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,151
It's a sandwich.

526
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,123
Hey.

527
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,333
Hi.

528
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
What's going on?

529
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,128
Can I tell him?

530
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,841
Mary's leaving.

531
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,052
She and Noah are going back to Mapleton.

532
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,346
What?

533
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,681
Well, when?

534
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,433
Now. Tonight.

535
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,185
We've got a flight out of Austin.

536
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:18,979
For how long?

537
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,858
Ever, Kevin.

538
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,653
We're going forever.

539
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,489
Uh, I don't--

540
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,824
I don't understand.

541
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:32,993
Without Matt?

542
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,789
All of those years
that he took care of you?

543
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,207
He loves you.

544
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,130
Did you know that Matt won't let me
cross the city limits?

545
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,799
He thinks if I go over that bridge,

546
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,385
the magical spell that woke me
from my slumber will break,

547
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,429
and I'll go back into a coma.

548
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,518
Listen, I know Matt can get carried away,

549
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,645
but his heart's in the right place.

550
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,023
He's writing a book about you.

551
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,694
He what?

552
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,739
A book.

553
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,743
He thinks the New Testament's getting old.

554
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,205
I've only read some of it,
but you figure fairly prominently, Kevin.

555
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,710
-Did you know about this?
-No, I did not.

556
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,297
He got pretty excited
when you rose from the dead.

557
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,136
Where the fuck is he?

558
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:41,686
Chief.

559
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,482
Can you give us a second, Michael?
I gotta talk to Matt.

560
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,237
He knows.

561
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,283
What do I know?

562
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,661
-Michael.
-He knows, Matt.

563
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,085
Was it Mary?

564
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,838
Well, whatever she said, she's
very upset right now. She just, uh...

565
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,465
Where's the book?

566
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,052
Can we just take a moment here?

567
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,430
You don't even know
what it is you're asking for.

568
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,101
Am I in it?

569
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,936
Yes.

570
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:25,855
Is it about my life?

571
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:27,941
Yes.

572
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,403
Just give it to me.

573
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,865
I can't. There's only one copy.
Written by hand.

574
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,618
I don't care how many copies there are.

575
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:41,162
'Cause whatever little story
you're making up is bullshit.

576
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,041
I'm not making anything up.
It's all true. It all happened.

577
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,213
It's still happening.

578
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,644
Brought y'all some supper.

579
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,815
What's going on?

580
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,234
Well, John, I'm glad you asked,

581
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:15,071
'cause what's going on is Matt and
your son are writing a gospel about me.

582
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,452
Oh.

583
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,206
"Oh"?

584
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,093
I shot you in the chest...

585
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,096
Point-blank.

586
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,518
And you got up, walked back into town,

587
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:49,189
didn't even go to the hospital
until the next day.

588
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,775
You tried to drown yourself,

589
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,903
and an earthquake saved your life.

590
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,530
You drank poison.

591
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,825
I buried you,
and you went to the other place...

592
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,495
And came back.

593
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,832
You told them about the, uh,

594
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,710
hotel?

595
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,381
It seemed important.

596
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,219
I'm not, um...

597
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:23,723
I can die.

598
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,975
Of course you can.

599
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,228
Just not here.

600
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,146
What?

601
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:31,815
Here.

602
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,402
You can't die here, in Miracle.

603
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,824
And that twisted bullshit, Matt,

604
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,701
is why your wife is taking your son
and leaving you.

605
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,039
"If you come to me,

606
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,668
"but will not leave your family,
you cannot be my follower."

607
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,755
Is that from your book?

608
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,883
No, Kevin. That's Jesus.

609
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,052
Well, I'm not fucking Jesus.

610
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,763
I'm not saying you are,

611
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,641
but, uh, the beard looks good on you.

612
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,229
Go get the book!
Where the fuck is the book, Michael?

613
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,897
No, no, no! He's not ready.

614
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,566
- He'll destroy it!
- No, he won't.

615
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,067
The fuck I won't, John !

616
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,236
All right, then so be it.

617
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,781
Him I understand, but you?

618
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,283
Come on, John.

619
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:28,788
Well, we can't just be going through
all of this for nothing, man.

620
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,960
You're going through this
because your daughter died.

621
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,962
We don't know that.

622
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,799
We don't know that.

623
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,593
What?

624
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,094
I'm supposed to believe she's gone

625
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,846
just because they say
her dental records match?

626
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,639
- Yes.
- No.

627
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,308
No, man.

628
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,561
Evie did it before.

629
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,272
Maybe she did it again.

630
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,427
I am trusting you with this, and I know
you'll do the right thing, Garvey.

631
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,808
I haven't put your baptism in yet,
but it's pretty much up-to-date.

632
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,271
You're insane.

633
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,988
There's, um, glass in your hair.

634
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,744
I was worried you'd forgotten.

635
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,801
Don't usually get so many
so close together.

636
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,554
Love is in the air.

637
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:02,687
Um...

638
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,231
A little extra for your trouble.

639
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,779
Sarah,

640
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:15,741
does the name "Kevin"
mean anything to you?

641
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,124
No.

642
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,032
English - SDH
