1
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,724
What do you want?

2
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,521
I wanna be cremated.

3
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,192
You got it. No problem.

4
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,818
-You sure?
-Mmm-hmm.

5
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,987
Because Matt's gonna wanna
bury me next to Mom and Dad

6
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,323
in the old Jamison plot
about a mile from here.

7
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,699
He's gonna put up a fight.

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,534
Fuck Matt.

9
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,745
If you wanna be cremated,
I'll make sure you're cremated.

10
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,539
We'll burn you up good.

11
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,670
What about you?

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,551
I wanna be stuffed.

13
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,386
-Excuse me?
-Stuffed.

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,555
Like, you know, taxidermy.

15
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,475
You don't have to display me prominently.

16
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,895
Just stick me in the corner
of the bedroom or something.

17
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,942
-I'll get it.
-No, she'll settle.

18
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,328
Okay, I'll stuff you.

19
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,121
On one condition.

20
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,124
Shoot.

21
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,169
I get to put a beard on you.

22
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,255
Why?

23
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,926
Because I'm the one that has to
have sex with that abomination.

24
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,470
I'm gonna dress it up how I want.

25
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,227
You want me to grow a beard.

26
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,729
Do I?

27
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,458
Shit! This is it. Wake up.

28
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,960
Wake the fuck up. Wake up.

29
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,296
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

30
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,340
God damn it! Shit, this is it.

31
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,759
It's today! It's today. Wake up!

32
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,761
-What's going on?
-What happened?

33
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,931
What happened is your wife fucking
drugged us, talked him out of it.

34
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,851
Now the goddamn flood's coming,
and we're all gonna fucking die.

35
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,688
- His horse is here. His horse is here.
- Huh?

36
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,981
What the fuck...

37
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,944
Oh, Jesus Christ!

38
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,001
Help me!

39
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,671
Come on! Get him off that!

40
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,424
Get him out!

41
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,134
Get him the fuck out!

42
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,803
Get him off, God damn it!

43
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,596
Get him off!

44
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,391
Stop!

45
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,601
Stop!

46
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,311
What are you doing?

47
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,521
What are you doing?

48
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,856
I'm doing what you asked me to do.

49
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,110
I thought we'd do it together.

50
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,534
I know what you want me to say to Evie.
Anything else?

51
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,579
No.

52
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,456
My children.

53
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,167
You saw the photos.
Do you remember their names?

54
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,963
Liam, Abigail, David, Samantha, Jimmy.

55
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,133
Thank you.

56
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,512
You want me to find Christopher Sunday,
learn the song,

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,055
so you can stop the flood, right?

58
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,601
Right.

59
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,606
Then let go.

60
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,810
- Kevin Harvey.

61
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,495
No. No! Please, please, please, please.

62
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,122
Don't.

63
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,876
Kilo Hotel is secure.
I repeat, Kilo Hotel is secure.

64
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,464
Mr. Harvey.

65
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,552
Is that your place up there?

66
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,517
Yeah.

67
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,187
Well, are you gonna invite me in?

68
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,744
You got any other reflective surfaces?

69
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,164
TV screens, glassware,
stainless steel pots?

70
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,665
Uh...

71
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,083
No.

72
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,169
The fuck are these?

73
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,381
Uh... My sunglasses.

74
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,055
No reflective surfaces.

75
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,975
Do not look into them no matter what.

76
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,060
That's how they found you.

77
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,021
Yeah. Right.

78
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,534
"He stood on the bow of The Merciful...

79
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,874
"The water endlessly stretching
to the infinite horizon

80
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,377
"as he contemplated the impossible
distance between them,

81
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,714
"but he would not stop
until he found her."

82
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,257
What, are you writing a book?

83
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,010
There's no shame in it.

84
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,305
What you do in your retirement
is your business.

85
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,600
Unfortunately,

86
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,645
folks in your line of work
don't get to retire.

87
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,816
I'm an assassin.

88
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,486
Yes, sir, Mr. Harvey.

89
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,821
So, let's get assassinating, shall we?

90
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,700
Who's the target?

91
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,994
President.

92
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,040
-The President?
-Of the United States.

93
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,751
And based on our intel, in,

94
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,378
well, just under two hours

95
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,464
he's gonna start
an unsanctioned nuclear war.

96
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,011
And you are the only man alive who
can get to him before he does.

97
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,393
Mr. Harvey, you gonna have
trouble putting him down?

98
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,602
No.

99
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,732
But I'm gonna need something in exchange.

100
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,901
Okay. What?

101
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,488
I need to find some people.

102
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,990
Five kids.

103
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,993
Liam, Abigail, Samantha,

104
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,786
David, and Jimmy Playford.

105
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,291
I also need to talk to a woman named
Evangeline Murphy and a man,

106
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,834
Christopher Sunday.

107
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,711
Christopher Sunday?

108
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,715
The Prime Minister of Australia?

109
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,593
Yeah.

110
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,013
Man, you want that kind
of high-level access,

111
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,224
you're gonna have to talk
to the boss yourself.

112
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
Here.

113
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,522
Stick that in your ear.

114
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,233
You'll hear him, he'll hear you.

115
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,361
He'll talk you through this
whole shit show.

116
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,700
Now, the evac chopper is two minutes out.

117
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,914
You're gonna wanna
get yourself dressed.

118
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,099
Testing, one, two, three.

119
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,144
Testing, one, two, three.

120
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,688
Are you receiving me?

121
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,607
Who is this?

122
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,318
Mission control.

123
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,446
Do I know you?

124
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,907
I'm sitting in the railway station

125
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,618
Got a ticket to my destination

126
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,582
You made me sing.

127
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,543
I met you on the bridge.

128
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,087
And do you remember, Mr. Harvey,

129
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,964
what I said to you
that night on the bridge,

130
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,966
what I whispered in your ear?

131
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,140
You said I was the most
powerful man in the world.

132
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,310
Goddamn right, you are.

133
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,523
Now, go pick up that piece of mirror
and look at yourself.

134
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,983
I thought I wasn't supposed
to look in reflective--

135
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,235
Shut up.

136
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,653
You wanna get what you came here for?

137
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,781
Pick up that mirror and look at yourself.

138
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,389
G'day... G'day, Melbourne.

139
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,229
Um...

140
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,399
Thank you for the warm welcome.

141
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,612
This isn't my first time visiting
the other side of the world.

142
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,741
Every time I'm here it gets harder
and harder to leave.

143
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,871
Uh...

144
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,292
I've come, uh, to talk you
today about marriage.

145
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,171
For millennia, we have believed marriage

146
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,257
is a cornerstone of our civilization.

147
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,552
Our party, however,
does not share this opinion.

148
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,599
We believe that marriage
is the single most destructive idea

149
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,227
ever conceived of by humankind.

150
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,689
That's why in my first hundred days
in office, I introduced legislation...

151
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,113
I'm the President.

152
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
Um...

153
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,541
And as... As President, my friends,
tradition is powerful.

154
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,001
In the early days of our movement,

155
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,712
it was mandatory
that all members smoke cigarettes

156
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,673
and refrain from speaking,

157
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,592
but we realized those
traditions were stupid.

158
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,469
Now,

159
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,304
it's an understandable concern.

160
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,976
If there is no marriage,
what happens to the family?

161
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,895
What happens to the children?

162
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,151
And so we decided to
have a worldwide essay contest.

163
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,988
To answer that question
in their own words.

164
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,659
We have one of the finalists, uh,
from that contest here

165
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,661
with us today.

166
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,456
He is joined by his brothers
and sisters for his essay titled,

167
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,501
"Why I Don't Need a Mommy
and a Daddy Anymore."

168
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,670
Please welcome Australia's own...

169
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,884
- um, Liam Playford.

170
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,356
Liam...

171
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,194
Why aren't you wearing any shoes?

172
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,367
Your shoes. You're not
wearing any shoes. Where are they?

173
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,745
Why does it matter?

174
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,833
Well, somebody wants--

175
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,586
Somebody in your family wants to know.

176
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,132
- But you said there is no family.

177
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,512
Love

178
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,892
Love will keep us together

179
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,022
Think of me, babe, whenever

180
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,068
- Some sweet-talking girl comes along...

181
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,195
Singing her song

182
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,738
Don't mess around...

183
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,448
Sir, we have a situation.

184
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,575
We need to move you now.

185
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,994
No, wait. I, uh--

186
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,746
I have to talk to that girl.

187
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,122
No, we haven't got time for that, sir.

188
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,749
We need to get you to a secure location.

189
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,543
I'm not going fucking anywhere
until I talk to that girl.

190
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,296
Okay, I'll get her.

191
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,215
Get him to the car.

192
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,717
This way, please, sir.

193
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,183
Mr. President, Chief of Staff
on the phone.

194
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,686
Hello?

195
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,021
Mr. President, it appears
Ukrainian separatists

196
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,482
have taken control
of an armed nuclear submarine,

197
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,402
and they'll have launch
capability within two hours.

198
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,611
You're being brought to a bunker,

199
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,281
which you will access with your
unique biometrics once inside.

200
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,784
-Sorry, my unique biometrics?
-Yes, sir.

201
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,203
The door can only be
unlocked by you and you alone

202
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,581
unless you have an identical twin brother,
which would be ridiculous.

203
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,625
Yeah, that would be ridiculous.

204
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,045
Sir, do I have your permission
to move us to DEFCON 2?

205
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,631
Um, what DEFCON are we at right now?

206
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,841
We're at DEFCON 3, sir.

207
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,301
Uh, DEFCON 2 is worse?

208
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,303
Yes, sir, it's worse.

209
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,892
Let's just stay where we're at right now
until we have more, um, uh, intel.

210
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,437
With all due respect, sir, I don't think
the Secretary of Defense

211
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,646
is going to be happy about that.

212
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,649
Yeah, well, fuck the Secretary of Defense.

213
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,028
Mr. President, the girl you asked for.

214
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,244
She's coming with me.

215
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,454
Sir, she's a civilian.

216
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,497
She can't travel in the presidential limo.

217
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,291
She's coming with me alone.

218
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,419
That's an order.

219
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,842
Looks like rain.

220
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,148
Do you know who I am?

221
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,816
Yes.

222
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,199
Do you know that I'm not
the President of the United States?

223
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,035
I sure do.

224
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,208
I have a message for you from your father.

225
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,004
My father?

226
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,965
John.

227
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,052
He wants me to tell you...

228
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,723
He wants you to know

229
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,558
that you're loved.

230
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,568
Is there anything you want me to tell him?

231
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,782
Are you fucking serious?

232
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,911
My father was murdered.

233
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,331
My mother, my brother,

234
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,749
all of them gone in an instant

235
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,001
because of a drone strike ordered
by your administration.

236
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,379
No. No, that's not what happened.

237
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,964
You were killed.

238
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,757
What?

239
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,094
I'm not dead.
I'm right fucking here, asshole.

240
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,431
You said you knew
that I wasn't the president.

241
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,766
You're not!

242
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,434
You're just a puppet.

243
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,311
That speech you just gave?

244
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,105
Were those even your words?

245
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,608
Because it didn't sound like you believed
a single thing you were saying.

246
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,151
You just do what they tell you to do.

247
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,779
-That's not true.
-Yeah, it is.

248
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,282
What do you want?

249
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,958
Are you okay?

250
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,462
Stop!

251
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,339
Stop the car!

252
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,049
You need to stop the car!

253
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,346
All right, stand back.

254
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,306
Give him some air.

255
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,601
I was just with Evie.

256
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,690
You... You saw her?

257
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,486
I delivered your message.

258
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,878
Your children were there, too.

259
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,299
All of them?

260
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,052
Yeah, all of them.

261
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,805
They were all okay?

262
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,644
They didn't know what happened
to their shoes.

263
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,077
Did you get the song?

264
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,247
I was working on it.

265
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,374
Why'd you pull me out of the pond?

266
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,585
There is no pond.
The whole fucking ranch is flooded.

267
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,507
Take me to the bathroom.

268
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:27,762
Whoa, hold on.

269
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,264
-You can't keep doing this.
-Yes, he can.

270
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,473
No, look at him !

271
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,059
You got what you wanted.
Now you're worried about him?

272
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,228
Out there is the goddamn flood.

273
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,231
That's why we're fucking doing this.

274
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,566
It's not why he's doing this.

275
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,610
Why else would I be doing this?

276
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,616
I don't know. Why would you?

277
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,788
- Out!
- No. No!

278
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,291
Come on! Kevin!

279
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,460
- Dad, stop.
- Don't do this!

280
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,129
-Kevin!
-Everyone's got a fucking opinion.

281
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,049
- Kevin!
- Dad, stop. Let's go.

282
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,265
You okay?

283
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,894
I'm cold.

284
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,690
If I could do this instead of you,
I would.

285
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,319
I know.

286
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,824
But the secure location can only be
accessed by my exact biometrics.

287
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,745
Is that supposed
to make sense to me?

288
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,125
It doesn't make sense to me.

289
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,594
I love you, son.

290
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,681
I love you, too.

291
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,026
You're gonna have to hold me down.

292
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,355
You all right, sir?

293
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,568
Yeah.

294
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,320
I need to talk to the, uh,
Australian Prime Minister.

295
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,657
-Sorry?
-The Australian Prime Minister.

296
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,951
Christopher Sunday.
I need to talk to him right now.

297
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,745
Well, sir, there's a secure
comms room inside the bunker.

298
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,707
We just need to confirm your ID,
and you can talk to whoever you want.

299
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,418
Just wanna try the
scanner again, please, sir.

300
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,130
Yeah.

301
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,303
- Identity confirmed.

302
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,971
Excellent.

303
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,437
Now your penis, please, sir.

304
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,398
-My what?
-Your penis.

305
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,109
Place it on the other scanner,
please, sir.

306
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,862
Why?

307
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,407
Mr. President,
due to advancements in plastic surgery,

308
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,951
anyone with enough resources
can copy a person's face.

309
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,747
But your, uh--

310
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,000
Your penis, sir, well, they're
not gonna go to that length.

311
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,106
- Identity confirmed.

312
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,316
Confirmed.

313
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,574
Can we go in now?

314
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,744
Uh, just the three
authentication questions, sir.

315
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,833
What was the name
of your favorite childhood pet?

316
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,586
We didn't have one. My mom was allergic.

317
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,046
Correct.

318
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,339
Your favorite movie?

319
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,342
Uh, Godfather.

320
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,428
Part two.

321
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,597
Correct.

322
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,183
Name your secretary of defense?

323
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,018
Um...

324
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,859
Sir, I need a name.

325
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,701
Patti Levin.

326
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,290
Correct.

327
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,250
Good to see you, Mr. President.

328
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,174
I wish the circumstances were different,

329
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,469
but it appears
the shit has hit the fan, sir.

330
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,971
Let's get to the situation room.

331
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,651
Mr. President,
for reasons I cannot fathom,

332
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,945
we remain at DEFCON 3.

333
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,618
This is the case containing
the nuclear football,

334
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,788
which will give you
remote launch capability.

335
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,213
What's in that one?

336
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,006
Never mind about that.

337
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,467
Just pray we don't have to open it.

338
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,724
Sir, in order to arm the device,

339
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,520
you need to verbally take
us down to DEFCON 1 .

340
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,565
You are aware of the situation, yes?

341
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,318
-Yeah, of course--
-So, you know, sir,

342
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,532
that Ukrainian separatists have
seized control of a nuclear submarine.

343
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,993
They will be weapons hot
in less than an hour.

344
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,831
Our only option is to strike first.

345
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,876
Which is why you need to
take us down to DEFCON 1 .

346
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,509
Uh, I have to make a phone call first.

347
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,469
To who?

348
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,180
The Prime Minister of Australia.

349
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,105
Gentlemen, can the President
and I have the room, please?

350
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,696
Yes, if you can...

351
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,039
What the fuck is wrong with you?

352
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,334
All this time, years of planning.

353
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,837
We are minutes away
from making this happen,

354
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,339
and you are dicking around about DEFCON 1 !

355
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,258
-I don't have--
-You don't have any what?

356
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,843
- You don't have any balls?

357
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,136
What?

358
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,057
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. President,
but the Vice President is here

359
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,767
and she's demanding to speak to you.

360
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,352
She?

361
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Fuck her.

362
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,439
Tell her to go away.

363
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,067
She doesn't know about this.

364
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,905
-Let her in.
-Yes, sir, of course.

365
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,240
Madam Vice President.

366
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,212
- You're being played, sir.

367
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,591
What?

368
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,259
You're being played.

369
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,428
I just got off the phone with the Kremlin

370
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,722
who confirms that there is no submarine.

371
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,140
No separatists.

372
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,600
This is a smoke screen.

373
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,019
You have been fed bogus intel.

374
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,986
I don't get fed, I feed.

375
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:07,782
And you clearly have no goddamn idea
what's happening around here.

376
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,116
Then enlighten me.

377
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,994
I couldn't enlighten you with
a fucking 1 ,000-watt bulb.

378
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,873
- Tell her about the plan.
- I'm not telling her jack shit.

379
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,252
If you want me to bring us down to
DEFCON 1 , tell her.

380
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,130
Fine.

381
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,468
We are going to vaporize every man, woman,
and child on the planet.

382
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,223
It's the seventh anniversary
of the departure,

383
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:36,060
and there is reasonable expectation
out there that the world's gonna end.

384
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,021
So, we're gonna fire
our nukes at the Russians

385
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,607
and they're gonna retaliate,
and then that's it.

386
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,401
We're all torched.

387
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,738
No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed that
nothing fucking happened.

388
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,951
We give the people what they're
too chickenshit to do themselves.

389
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,620
What they elected us for.

390
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,373
We give them what they want.

391
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,585
And they want to die.

392
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,922
Well, that's not gonna work.

393
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,009
You can't launch without going through
the Fisher Protocol.

394
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,929
You know about the Fisher Protocol?

395
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,184
Of course I do.

396
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,562
Prove it.

397
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,816
It's an ethical deterrent.

398
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,531
The nuclear launch key was surgically
embedded into the heart of a volunteer.

399
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,368
In order for the president to be able
to blow up millions of people

400
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,080
with the push of a button,
he has to extract that key

401
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,750
by murdering the volunteer himself.

402
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:46,047
But since I don't see that volunteer here,
you can't launch shit.

403
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,557
What?

404
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:04,523
The volunteer is coming through the east
entrance of this facility in 15 minutes.

405
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,572
And how is he gonna make it
through the security door?

406
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,746
He's my identical twin brother.

407
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,961
Well...

408
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,092
It sounds like you two have
really thought this through.

409
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,685
I guess I should go, uh,
handle my affairs.

410
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,979
I guess you should.

411
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,525
Mr. President.

412
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,777
Yeah.

413
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,498
All righty, sir.

414
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,959
May we go down to DEFCON 1 now?

415
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,004
I just need to make my call.

416
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,842
You can make your call after
you take us to DEFCON 1 .

417
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,887
Just say it into the device.

418
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,067
- We're at DEFCON 1 .

419
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,924
What the fuck!

420
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,426
What the fuck?

421
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,844
You can't leave, sir.

422
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,138
Your order initiated a full lockdown.

423
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,142
I told you I had to make a fucking call !

424
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,312
Hey!

425
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,923
Do you have eyes on the entrance?

426
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,223
-Yeah, I see it.
-Good.

427
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,226
Take out the Secret Service
agents and get in there.

428
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,437
There are no Secret Service agents.

429
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,277
It's a trap.

430
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,154
They want me to go in.

431
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,447
They wanna cut me open.

432
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
Do you think I don't know that?

433
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,576
Well, if you knew that,
why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?

434
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,995
Because I'm covering my asset.

435
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,957
-What asset?
-I have someone on the inside.

436
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,834
Leave your weapon, enter the door,

437
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,294
and they'll take
care of you once you're inside.

438
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,754
You want me to go in there without a gun?

439
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,716
"Hence it comes about that all unarmed
prophets have been victorious,

440
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,511
"and all armed prophets
have been destroyed."

441
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,763
That's from Machiavelli.

442
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,600
Put your faith in me, Mr. Harvey.

443
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,864
Identity confirmed.

444
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,486
Stop right there!

445
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,071
Stop! Down!

446
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,656
Down on the stairs. Get down !

447
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,742
Show us your hands!

448
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,702
- Show us your fucking hands!
- Here!

449
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,953
Don't move.

450
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,456
Did you fucking sell me out?

451
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,458
Don't you fucking move.

452
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,209
Hey, are you there?

453
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,170
I said don't fucking move!

454
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,775
Jesus.

455
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,194
You look just fucking like him.

456
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,198
The President is in the situation room.

457
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,368
It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.

458
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,205
And please make sure you fucking
kill the Secretary of Defense.

459
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,290
-Where's the comms room?
-What?

460
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,000
The comms room. I need to make a call.

461
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,044
Do you know what's inside of you?

462
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,089
Yes.

463
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,216
Then you know that
the President will not hesitate

464
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,010
to cut you open and pull it out.

465
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,428
I mean, I know this man.

466
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,639
He is cold and he is merciless.

467
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,102
You think he gives a shit about you
if he's willing to end the world?

468
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,064
I thought that's what you people wanted.

469
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,733
They're all liars.

470
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:43,988
They say they don't believe in love
and they don't feel pain.

471
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,532
I feel pain.

472
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,576
And I'm in love.

473
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,414
I'm in love with the most
wonderful man I have ever known.

474
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,417
Uh-huh. And who's that?

475
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,836
His name is God.

476
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,798
Tell her I love her, too.

477
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,428
Where's the comms room?

478
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,014
What is it with you
and the fucking comms room?

479
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,348
I thought you were an assassin.

480
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,767
I mean, who do you need
to communicate with?

481
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,228
Well, maybe I'm in love, too.

482
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,563
Oh, please.

483
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,940
Where is the comms room?

484
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,152
It's fucking up the hall, to the right!

485
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,031
What's happening?
What was that noise?

486
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,283
I don't know. You tell me. You're God.

487
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,493
That was just a pick-up line.

488
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,454
Did you fucking kill her?

489
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,372
Hey. Hey, Harvey!

490
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,915
Hey! Harvey!

491
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,848
Mr. President.

492
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,686
You shaved.

493
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,148
I need to talk to
the Prime Minister of Australia.

494
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,400
Christopher Sunday.

495
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,654
Is there a problem, Officer?

496
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,906
No, sir.

497
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,710
He'll come out here, Mr. President.

498
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,967
-Give us the room.
-Sir, this is my post--

499
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,552
Give us the fucking room.

500
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,825
Hello.

501
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,701
Hello.

502
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,621
Are you Christopher Sunday?

503
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,997
Yes.

504
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,504
My name is Kevin,

505
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,966
and I know this is gonna sound crazy,

506
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,428
but you're not
the Prime Minister of Australia.

507
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,391
My father,

508
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,977
he came to you for a song.

509
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,064
A song to stop the rain.

510
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,403
There's no song to stop the rain.

511
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,158
What?

512
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,326
I told your father,

513
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,036
but he didn't listen.

514
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,248
No. No, no, no.
Look, you have to give me something.

515
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,293
I have to bring him something.
He needs this.

516
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,129
-There's a flood.
-Do you believe that?

517
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,798
Believe what?

518
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,802
Do you believe your father
can sing a song and stop the flood?

519
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,437
No.

520
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,819
Then why are you here?

521
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,496
Don't move.

522
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,652
Mr. President, can I have my
glasses back, please?

523
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,293
Sounds like they got him.

524
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,090
I don't wanna do this anymore.

525
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,675
Do what, Mr. President?

526
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,718
Stop fucking calling me that!

527
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,723
I'm not the president! You're not
the fucking secretary of defense.

528
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

529
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,688
You named me secretary of defense.

530
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,857
You were asked
who did you want in this position,

531
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,567
and you named me.

532
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:38,115
You summoned me out of retirement
and I came back

533
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,033
because I owed you.

534
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,414
You helped me, Kevin.

535
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,876
And now I'm here to help you.

536
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,633
Help me how?

537
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,722
Well, what do you want?

538
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,479
I wanna go home.

539
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,984
Do you?

540
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,820
What?

541
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:21,408
It's just that you've been known
to say that before, and yet,

542
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,244
you keep leaving home and coming here.

543
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,417
I'm sensing a lot of internal
contradictions from you, Kevin.

544
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:35,130
It sounds like something
you need to work out with yourself.

545
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:06,370
I'm gonna take these off

546
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,249
because I know you're here
of your own free will,

547
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,169
and the last thing you wanna do

548
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,796
is hurt yourself.

549
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,096
They're Kevins

550
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,308
Identical Kevins all the way

551
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,603
One pair of matching bookends

552
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,649
Different as night and day

553
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,194
All right, gentlemen.

554
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,571
Let's get to the hard part, shall we?

555
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:49,287
I, Patricia Levin, in my capacity
as secretary of defense,

556
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,790
hereby invoke the Fisher Protocol,

557
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,000
overriding the Heart Deterrent.

558
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,170
Pursuant to the nuclear command authority

559
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,715
granted by Article II, Section 2
of the US Constitution,

560
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,676
the president shall make an incision

561
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,012
two inches below the sternum
of the volunteer, that's you,

562
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,682
whereupon the president,

563
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,268
gaining access from beneath the ribcage,

564
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,020
shall manually extract the launch key

565
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,231
from behind the left atria.

566
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,526
In recognition of his service,

567
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,697
the volunteer shall receive a posthumous
Congressional Medal of Honor

568
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,366
applicable if Congress exists,

569
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,618
which it will not.

570
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,622
May God have mercy on your soul
if there is a God,

571
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,541
which there is not.

572
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,564
I'm not fucking killing him.

573
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,816
Good, because I'm not fucking letting him.

574
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,401
Gentlemen, language.

575
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,737
Fuck you !

576
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,239
I'm not understanding the problem.

577
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:11,620
The problem is that this is stupid !
I don't care about any of this bullshit.

578
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,914
-It doesn't make any sense!
-It doesn't?

579
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,292
No! Why the fuck
would I volunteer to be cut open?

580
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,002
I don't know. Why would you?

581
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,922
-I wouldn't!
-And yet here you are.

582
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,175
Knowing full well what is inside of you,

583
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,386
you kept moving forward
towards this very room

584
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,723
and the one person
powerful enough to take it out.

585
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,397
I think you should tell him
about the book you wrote.

586
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,777
What book?

587
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,446
The romance novel.

588
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,533
That's him.
He wrote it. That's him.

589
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,494
-What? No. No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

590
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,664
It's the one that was in the typewriter
in the fucking beach house.

591
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,415
I know. I was there,

592
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,876
- but it's not fucking mine.
- Boys, boys.

593
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,837
I think we can all agree
you both wrote the same book.

594
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,589
No, we didn't!

595
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:09,135
Well, I'm sorry it's come to this,

596
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,637
but I have no choice.

597
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,140
I received a call from the CIA

598
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,102
that the President
was keeping a secret journal

599
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,689
hidden behind the portrait
of Millard Fillmore in the Oval.

600
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:25,068
As this was clearly
a national security issue,

601
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,654
I had no choice but to procure it.

602
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,492
I'd like you to read this for us.

603
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:35,662
No.

604
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,333
What about you?

605
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,335
No.

606
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:46,006
Fine,

607
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,674
I'll do it myself.

608
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,355
Sorry, I just need my glasses.

609
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,908
For fuck's sake.

Why?

647

So we can't ever come back here again.

00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,048
We fucked up with Nora.

Let's go watch.

650
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,967
I thought you were gone.

It was raining so hard and I got scared.

00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,107
So I came up here.

Okay.
