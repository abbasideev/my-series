1
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,511
Okay.

2
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,138
Begin.

3
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,017
My name is Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst.

4
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,811
Date of birth, 11-18-1979.

5
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,439
This is a copy of today's paper.

6
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,321
I hereby indemnify all individuals
for the procedure that's about to occur.

7
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,532
I'm of sound mind and body,
and I'm acting of my own free will.

8
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,871
That's it.

9
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,419
Something wrong?

10
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,339
Nothing, it, uh... It's fine.

11
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,382
What did she say?

12
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,219
She wants you to do it again.

13
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,304
Why do you want me to do it again?

14
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,976
Because I do not believe you.

15
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,561
Excuse me?

16
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,690
Excuse me, but you're lying.

17
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,194
You're just...

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,739
You’re just saying
what we want to hear.

19
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,911
You invited me here,
and then you rejected me.

20
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,039
But I sat outside your house all night,

21
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,041
and I followed you here
so you'd have no choice

22
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,585
but to let me get into your machine.

23
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,754
So, I don't give a shit
what you want to hear.

24
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,967
And I don't lie.

25
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,096
Can you say
your children's names?

26
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,806
-What?
-Your children.

27
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,933
Do you think you can say their names?

28
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,434
Erin and Jeremy.

29
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,562
I meant in your statement.

30
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,566
Would you like to try again?

31
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,277
Okay.

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,414
My name is Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst.

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,793
I was born on November 18th, 1979.

34
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,465
This is a copy of today's paper.

35
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,011
Because today is the day
I'm leaving to be with them.

36
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,516
I'm leaving to be with my children,

37
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,978
Erin and Jeremy.

38
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,650
I'm ready to go now.

39
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,659
We, uh, prefer to give a more
thorough orientation,

40
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:09,498
but since we were in the process of moving
on, you'll just have to bear with us.

41
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,717
Was that a person?

42
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,677
It's a fossil.

43
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,638
The person is gone.

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,309
Maybe they'll let you keep mine.

45
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,407
As soon as we've administered
your saline drip,

46
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,910
you disrobe outside the truck.

47
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,246
Once you are inside, you will see
the event chamber at the far end.

48
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,207
You just walk to it.

49
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,128
You may experience nausea or discomfort

50
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,715
as you pass by the undulating
laser array while it cycles up.

51
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,968
Do not touch the array.

52
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,345
Step inside the event chamber,

53
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,013
close the exit port behind you,

54
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,517
and turn the latch to the left,
hard to the left, it'll stick.

55
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,646
Then pull your knees towards your chest
and hold them there.

56
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,857
Okay?

57
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,150
Okay.

58
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,070
We will be monitoring you
from inside there.

59
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,989
Once inside the event chamber,

60
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,950
you will be able to hear us
and we will be able to hear you.

61
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,578
When you're ready,
we will start the ignition sequence.

62
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,164
You will hear three tones.

63
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,419
After the third tone,
the chamber will fill up with fluid.

64
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,965
The fluid will have the same consistency
as water, but it is not water.

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,969
It contains metals
that will be irradiated.

66
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,932
Once this occurs, the fluid will solidify.

67
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,145
Do not ingest or breathe in
any of the fluid

68
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,981
as your lungs would also
solidify upon transport.

69
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,320
Can you hold your breath for 30 seconds?

70
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,032
Yes.

71
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,118
Well...

72
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,620
Then that's it.

73
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,714
Activity.

74
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,340
Pole dancing.

75
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,802
Um, noun.

76
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,220
Gecko.

77
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,307
"Gecko." Excellent.

78
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,894
Uh, okay, last one.

79
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,437
Man's name.

80
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,314
Antonio.

81
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,275
"Antonio." Perfect.

82
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,486
Okay, here we go.

83
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,907
"Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst, age 417..."

84
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,658
--"Was vaporized by a consortium

85
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,704
"of international physicists last Tuesday
outside Never Never Land.

86
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,539
"Miss Durst was born and raised

87
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,791
-"in Cairo, Egypt..."
-Mmm.

88
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,669
"Where she returned after college
to squeeze a family,

89
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,800
"her spiffy husband, Doug Durst,
and her beloved geese, Jeremy and Erin.

90
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,551
"Admired by her coworkers,

91
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,345
"she was a longtime employee

92
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,764
"at the Department
of the Sudden Diarrhea."

93
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,182
- That's disgusting.

94
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,936
"In her spare time,
Miss Durst enjoyed crosswords,

95
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,230
"exposing frauds, and pole dancing.

96
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:25,778
"She is survived, at least temporarily, by
her terminally ill gecko, Matthew Jamison.

97
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:38,374
"As she lives on in our memories,
and in the Great Antonio in the sky.

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,046
"There will be no funeral
or memorial service."

99
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,884
Oh, God bless Matt Libs.

100
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,054
I couldn't ask for a better obituary.

101
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,933
Happy to oblige.

102
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,732
You sending me those things is what got me
through Hellfire and Damnation.

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,652
The horrible Bible camp
that Grandma and Pop-Pop

104
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,113
used to send me off to
in the Adirondacks?

105
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:13,242
It wasn't Hellfire and Damnation,
it was Camp Holy Spirit.

106
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,287
- Potato, potahto.

107
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,165
You were so young with the pigtails.

108
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,250
What were you, eight years old?

109
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,585
Seven.

110
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,296
Do you remember what you said to me
when you put me on the bus?

111
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,673
"Brush your teeth"?

112
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,134
You said...

113
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,139
You said that I was
the bravest girl on Earth.

114
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,228
And every time you sent
me a letter with a new Matt Lib in it,

115
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,232
that's who it was addressed to,
the bravest girl on Earth.

116
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,277
I forgot about that.

117
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,073
You drive me fucking nuts.

118
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,077
But you've always been
a great gecko, Matt.

119
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,125
If I was a great gecko,
I'd be trying to talk you out of this.

120
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,794
You're great because you're not trying.

121
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,675
I'm scared.

122
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,552
I'll be fine.

123
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,600
Of course you will. You always are.

124
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,980
I'm scared of what'll happen
when I go back to Mary.

125
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,777
I'm scared of the chemicals
they're going to put in my body

126
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,695
to try and make me better, and...

127
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm scared it won't work.

128
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,786
I'm scared of dying, Nora.

129
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,001
I'm scared my son will grow up without me.

130
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,838
Forget my face.

131
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,592
Forget the sound of my voice.

132
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,266
But most of all,
I'm scared that I'll survive.

133
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,477
Because if I do...

134
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,233
How can I ever stand in front of a room
full of people and convince them

135
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,570
that I have the answers when I have
no idea what the fuck I'm talking about?

136
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,742
Do you want to come with me instead?

137
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,959
I think, dear sister,
that defeats the purpose.

138
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,259
What are you going to tell
people about me?

139
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,428
About what happened here?

140
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,891
Whatever you want me to.

141
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,610
Are you ready?

142
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,741
Of course she's ready.

143
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,869
She's the bravest girl on Earth.

144
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,315
Give her the blanket.

145
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm hungry, Mom.

146
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,199
I'm hungry!

147
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,992
I'm hungry too.

148
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,494
No phones at the table.

149
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,662
Yours is out too.

150
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,996
I'm waiting to hear about the job.

151
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,832
- I want food!
- This is important too.

152
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,000
I want food!

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,502
I want food !

154
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:34,837
It's coming, buddy.

155
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,004
I want food!

156
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,673
- Jeremy.
- I want food!

157
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,841
Hey.

158
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
- I want food!
- Cut it out.

159
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,067
God damn it, I said two hands!

160
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,734
Nora, can you hear me?

161
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,528
Yes.

162
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,864
Your brother is here with us.

163
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,910
Hello, Nora.

164
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,412
Hi, Matt.

165
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,748
I love you.

166
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,250
I love you, too.

167
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,128
We're going to begin, Nora.

168
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,976
Yes!

169
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,260
I was worried you'd forgotten.

170
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,482
Don't usually get so many
so close together.

171
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,111
Love is in the air.

172
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,452
Um...

173
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,996
A little extra for your trouble.

174
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,337
Sarah, does the name "Kevin"
mean anything to you?

175
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,095
No.

176
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,474
Are you sure?

177
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,103
Because a man calling himself
that came by yesterday.

178
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,813
He had a photo.

179
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,315
A photo of you.

180
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,819
Did you tell him anything?

181
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,320
No, of course not.

182
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,783
But I think he knew I was lying.

183
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,814
Nora?

184
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,155
Uh, Kevin.

185
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,950
Kevin Garvey.

186
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,035
I don't know if you remember me.

187
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,788
Um, I was the chief of police in Mapleton.

188
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,585
We don't know each other really well.

189
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,795
We only talked a couple times, really.

190
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:20,886
There was this dance,
a Christmas dance at the high school.

191
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,432
We just had a really nice conversation.

192
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,475
Yeah.

193
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,311
In the hallway.

194
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,649
I don't expect you to remember.
It was a long time ago.

195
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,404
What... What are you doing?

196
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,536
Well, um, I've been kind of
wandering around Australia on vacation.

197
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,998
Um, I...

198
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,875
Just kind of getting off the grid.

199
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,294
You know, trying to avoid
the touristy stuff.

200
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,756
Like to get a little lost, you know?

201
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:04,679
Anyway, I was, um, in that little town
down the road,

202
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,473
and I saw you riding your bike.

203
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,892
And I thought to myself, "Holy shit.

204
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,854
"I think that's Nora Durst."
And, so, I found out where you lived.

205
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,483
And here you are.

206
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,529
That's not what happened.

207
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,406
Sorry?

208
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,868
You showed a picture of me
to the nun at the convent.

209
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,162
That's how you found out where I lived.

210
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,832
Why would I have a picture of you?

211
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,167
I just came from there.

212
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,670
-She told me that you asked if I--
-Are you married?

213
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,879
What?

214
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,674
Are you married
or are you seeing somebody?

215
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,220
I... I noticed you weren't wearing
a wedding ring.

216
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:52,060
Uh, and I saw that they were
having a dance in town tonight.

217
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:57,691
And, uh, when I saw you riding your bike,
it reminded me...

218
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,569
How I'd always wished I had asked you

219
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,114
to dance.

220
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,414
Anyway, I know it sounds crazy,
but I... I felt a connection.

221
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,210
So, here we are in the middle of nowhere
bumping into each other,

222
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:22,590
and I'm only here for the night,
and I figured, uh, you know,

223
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,510
if I didn't ask you to dance tonight...

224
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,600
I'll never forgive myself.

225
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,564
You need to leave now.

226
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443
Okay.

227
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,945
I get it.

228
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,241
A guy you barely remember shows up
on your doorstep, asks you to

229
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,452
go on a date with him...

230
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,579
Yeah.

231
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,289
I had to try.

232
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,043
Please just go.

233
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,296
I'll be there if you change your mind.

234
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,758
They're shutting down all of Main Street,
so you're not gonna be able to miss it.

235
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,060
It's good to see you, Nora.

236
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,226
- Hello?
- Did you tell him?

237
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,435
Nora?

238
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,062
Did you tell him?

239
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,314
I... I don't understand
what you're asking me.

240
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,859
Kevin, fucking Kevin. He's here.

241
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,443
He found me.

242
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,238
What? He's... He's there in Australia?

243
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,324
Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?

244
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,201
No.

245
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,578
No, I didn't.

246
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,873
-Because if you did, just say so, and I--
-I didn't.

247
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,126
We established boundaries
the first time you called me.

248
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,335
Clear boundaries.

249
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,545
I don't tell you about the people here,

250
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,797
and I don't tell the people
here about you.

251
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,757
I would never betray that, Nora.

252
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,428
Then how did he find me?

253
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,763
How did he say he found you?

254
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,893
He said that he was here on vacation,
and he spotted me.

255
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,855
And then he came to my house, and he
knocked on my door, and he acted like

256
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,108
we were just casual acquaintances
from Mapleton years back,

257
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,777
like... Like...
Like we were never together.

258
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,947
Like... Like none of it happened.

259
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,033
Huh.

260
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,160
"Huh"? What's that mean, "huh"?

261
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,120
Well, I'm just surprised, that's all.

262
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,831
It's a very un-Kevin-like thing to do.

263
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,167
Is he crazy?

264
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,877
Does he seem crazy?

265
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,295
No.

266
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,047
He seemed happy.

267
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,965
Huh.

268
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,800
Would you please stop fucking saying that?

269
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,052
Okay.

270
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,179
Why... Why is he doing this?

271
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,597
I don't know.

272
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,724
Did he say anything else?

273
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,811
He asked me to a dance.

274
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,521
Uh, a dance?

275
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,150
I guess there's a dance in town tonight,
and he asked me to go.

276
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,152
And you don't want to?

277
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,362
No.

278
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,821
What do you want?

279
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,657
I want him to leave me alone.

280
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,742
Then why are you calling me?

281
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,910
What?

282
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,662
Well, I can't make him leave you alone.

283
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm half a world away,
so why did you call me?

284
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,876
I called you because
I thought you told him where I was.

285
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,129
Come on, you know I didn't tell him that.

286
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:36,094
You called me because you wanted me
to say it's okay to go to the dance.

287
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,514
I do not want to go to the fucking dance!

288
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,474
Gotcha.

289
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,477
But if you did, it's okay.

290
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,188
Jesus Christ, Laurie.

291
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,357
Same time next week?

292
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,323
Where're your beads?

293
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,784
-Excuse me?
-Your beads. You need beads.

294
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,744
-Here, take one of mine.
-No, thank you.

295
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,677
You came.

296
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,013
It's a wedding.

297
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,806
I know.

298
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,183
You told me it was a dance.

299
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,437
People are dancing.

300
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,610
Were you even invited?

301
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
Yeah, of course I was.

302
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,449
Um...

303
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,868
That's... That's Eddie.

304
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,496
He can take a tractor apart
and put it back together blindfolded.

305
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,332
Allegedly.

306
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,668
And that's Aggie.

307
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,838
She was in the army.

308
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,632
She left, too many rules.

309
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,553
I bumped into them at the hotel bar,
they told me if I didn't come,

310
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,805
they'd be angry with me.

311
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,559
How did you find me, Kevin?

312
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,730
I'm on vacation in Australia.

313
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,149
I saw you ride by on your bike.

314
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,567
This is the middle of nowhere.

315
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,361
Why would you come here on vacation?

316
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,739
My father came Down Under a while back

317
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,577
and, uh, told me it was an amazing place,
so I just wanted to see for myself.

318
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,746
So you're saying
you've never been here before?

319
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,414
This is your first time in Australia?

320
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,749
Uh-huh.

321
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,044
You're really gonna keep this up?

322
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,089
Keep what up?

323
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,596
So, you and me, we only talked that one
time at that Christmas dance in Mapleton?

324
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,889
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

325
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,683
What about the courthouse?

326
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,354
We got our divorces on the same day

327
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,772
and ran into each other.

328
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,190
I asked you to go to Miami.

329
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,650
- You asked me to go to Miami?

330
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:48,901
Yes.

331
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,946
But we were strangers?

332
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,614
Yes.

333
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,576
And you're giving me a hard time
about inviting you to a dance?

334
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,078
It's a wedding.

335
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,874
You must have me confused
with someone else.

336
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,880
Because if you asked me to go to Miami
with you, I definitely would've gone.

337
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,134
I love Miami.

338
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,308
So... So, you never left?

339
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,188
You've been a cop in Mapleton
all this time?

340
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,523
Uh-huh.

341
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,236
Then you knew my brother, Matt Jamison.

342
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,242
I was hoping you were gonna
come to the funeral.

343
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,330
We said our goodbyes in person.

344
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,876
It was a beautiful service.

345
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,129
Over 400 people came.

346
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,883
Mary gave the eulogy.

347
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,721
She really loved him.

348
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,016
There was a lot to love.

349
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,149
How are Jill and Tom?

350
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,737
You remember my kids' names?

351
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,697
Yeah.

352
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,158
I remember.

353
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,205
It's a little creepy, but I am impressed.

354
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,961
Jill's great.

355
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,671
She married a great guy.

356
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,549
They, uh, have a daughter together.

357
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,717
Penelope.

358
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,719
About a year old now.

359
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,515
And I'm a fucking grandpa.

360
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,393
Tommy's marriage didn't work out so great.

361
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,064
But he landed on his feet,
like he always does.

362
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,442
What about you?

363
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,944
Me?

364
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,987
Did you ever get married again?

365
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,823
No.

366
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,951
Why not?

367
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,039
Because I'm still holding
a candle for you.

368
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,126
Um...

369
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,213
I find that hard to believe.

370
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,552
My mom died when I was nine
and my dad never remarried, so...

371
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,722
People hold candles, Nora.

372
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,897
How is your dad?

373
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,233
- He's fantastic.

374
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,776
Jesus.

375
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,445
He's 91 . He's still kicking.

376
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,822
Oh, he must be immortal.

377
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,992
Runs in the family, right?

378
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,204
-I'm not immortal.
-Oh?

379
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,956
Says who?

380
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,708
My cardiologist.

381
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,128
I had a condition.

382
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,422
It was undiagnosed my whole life.

383
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,259
Couple years back, I had a heart attack.

384
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,804
Pretty... Pretty bad one.

385
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:11,020
But if they hadn't diagnosed the condition
then I wouldn't have known I'd had it,

386
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:16,108
and blah, blah, blah, so,
they just cut me open, put in a pacemaker.

387
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,610
Really?

388
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,236
Yeah, really.

389
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,988
Wanna see my scar?

390
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,532
She came!

391
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,659
You said she wouldn't come.

392
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,828
Oh.
I'm just as surprised as you are.

393
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,458
Aggie, this is Nora. Nora, this is Aggie.

394
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,084
-Congratulations.
-He didn't think you were coming.

395
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,920
Uh, yeah, you mentioned that.

396
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,172
Nice of you to get all dressed up
for my wedding.

397
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,132
I'm sorry,
I didn't know it was your wedding.

398
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,634
I'm just fucking with you.

399
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,010
She's very serious.

400
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,261
Yeah.

401
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,013
Wouldn't have it any other way.

402
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,057
All right, that's enough chitchat.

403
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,558
Did you write your messages?

404
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,436
Um, uh, I gave mine to the nun.

405
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,857
Uh, what about you, sweetheart?

406
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,070
Want to write a message of love
to send out to the world?

407
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,030
No, thank you.

408
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,199
And she's a romantic, too.

409
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,243
All right, let's get this over with !

410
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,537
Where the fuck's Eddie?

411
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,043
What did you tell her about us?

412
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,922
I told her I had a crush on a girl,

413
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:25,177
and I wanted to chase after her,
but I didn't know what to say.

414
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,267
All right, everyone, settle down.

415
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,395
I'm talking now!

416
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,646
Oi !

417
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,481
Listen up, fuckwits!

418
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:46,031
All right. Dearest family,
beloved friends, and Russell.

419
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,574
Aye!

420
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,329
Eddie and I just wanna thank you all
for being here on our special day

421
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,332
to drink our alcohol free of charge.

422
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:03,424
Sweetheart, I'm so happy that we're gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

423
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,927
And now that you've married me,
I have a confession.

424
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,555
I think I might be pregnant.

425
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,099
No!

426
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,269
Not to worry, love. It's yours, probably.

427
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,940
All right, let's get to the ooey gooey.

428
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,484
We have gathered your notes

429
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,112
and attached them
to these beautiful birds.

430
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,158
And now we are going to set them free

431
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,786
so they can fly off
to every corner of the world,

432
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,706
spreading those messages of love
to people everywhere.

433
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,000
- Aw!

434
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,877
All right, Sister.

435
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,337
Release the birds!

436
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,268
What did you write?

437
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,443
That's for me to know
and some lonely Eskimo to find out.

438
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,321
Isn't that romantic, eh?

439
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,699
Yeah, let's hear it for the love birds!

440
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,415
See, if only life was just about love.

441
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,376
But it's about temptation.

442
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,670
It's about failure.

443
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,006
It's about weakness.

444
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,759
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Sister?

445
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,678
It's about sin, yeah.

446
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,015
And everybody here knows
I've made my fair share of mistakes.

447
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:40,604
But there is a very big difference
between a sin and a mistake.

448
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,565
Because a mistake is just fucking up. Hmm?

449
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,943
But a sin, ooh-hoo.

450
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:50,364
A sin is when you know something
is wrong and you do it anyway.

451
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:59,039
So, Aggie, my darling wife,
my sun and my stars,

452
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,916
I look forward to a lifetime

453
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,417
- of fucking up with you.

454
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:07,756
But I hereby swear I will never sin again.

455
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,299
Aw.

456
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,891
Now bring out that fucking goat!

457
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,602
Yeah!

458
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,312
Hello!

459
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,274
In biblical times,
a goat was designated to be

460
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,735
driven into the desert with the sins
of the community upon it.

461
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,904
- So...

462
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,782
Let these beads represent our sins.

463
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,871
Unburden yourselves, friends.

464
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,251
Then Russell will drive the scapegoat
deep into the bush, far from here,

465
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:49,006
so we can start over
untainted by our past misdeeds.

466
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,437
At least they didn't sacrifice it.

467
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,941
Have you ever seen somebody
sacrifice a goat?

468
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,818
No.

469
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,528
That'd be weird.

470
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,597
Will you dance with me?

471
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,027
How did you find me, Kevin?

472
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,866
I'm on vacation in Australia.

473
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,703
I saw you ride by on your bike.

474
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,417
I can't do this.

475
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,087
Why not?

476
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,297
Because it's not true.

477
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,017
Evening.

478
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,344
Sarah.

479
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,012
What did you do with my birds?

480
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,974
I let them go just like I always do.

481
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,350
What's wrong?

482
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,893
What's wrong is that
they didn't come back.

483
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,728
Did you give them the seed
that I gave you?

484
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,980
Yes, of course.

485
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,774
And... And you didn't feed them
right before you let them go, did you?

486
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,151
No, of course not.
I did everything the same.

487
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,320
-Then where are they?
-I don't know.

488
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,699
Those birds are trained to do one thing,
just one thing, and that's to come home.

489
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,284
So you must've done something different.

490
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,703
Maybe they're delivering
the messages of love.

491
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,124
It's great that your newlyweds believe
that a bird with a range of 50 miles

492
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,334
is gonna carry their
stupid poetry to Timbuktu,

493
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,919
but don't sell that bullshit to me.

494
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

495
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,342
It's just a nicer story.

496
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,429
Who was that man?

497
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,849
-What man?
-The man I just saw leaving.

498
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,184
You mean Father Brian.

499
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,103
He's the only man
permitted in the convent.

500
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,356
Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?

501
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,692
-No.
-Well, this man did.

502
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,695
And he was climbing a ladder
down from that room right up there.

503
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,405
Oh...

504
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,157
Well, that's strange.

505
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,491
Is that your room?

506
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,368
It might be.

507
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,330
But I certainly haven't seen
any men on ladders.

508
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,041
You just had sex with him.

509
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,500
Oh, no, I didn't.

510
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:23,918
-You did.
-Did not.

511
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,503
Then swear to God.

512
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,464
All right.

513
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,675
- I swear to God.

514
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,511
You're a fucking liar!

515
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,351
I saw you dancing with that man.

516
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,646
That man you said you didn't know.

517
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:50,111
I'll pray for the safe return
of your birds.

518
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,406
Don't waste your breath.

519
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,950
Oh, God.

520
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,467
Oh, God.

521
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,812
Ah !

522
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,191
--Oh !

523
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,864
--Oh.

524
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,283
I know.

525
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,160
Okay.

526
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,713
Hey, you hungry?

527
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:26,971
Hey!

528
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,395
Eat this, you idiot.

529
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,357
Here. Come on.

530
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,724
You wanna know how I found you, Nora?

531
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,144
You want the truth?

532
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,359
When Matt told me you were gone,
I didn't believe him.

533
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,446
Or I couldn't.

534
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:07,905
I just...

535
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,575
I had this feeling that
you were still alive...

536
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,286
And that I would see you again.

537
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,126
And then... Then Matt died
and you weren't even at the funeral.

538
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,336
And that should've convinced me,

539
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,175
but I couldn't believe that the last time
I saw you or talked to you

540
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,471
was in that fucking hotel room
that night I burned this fucking book.

541
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,478
I was so sure

542
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,730
you were still alive even though
everyone else in the world

543
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,774
said that you were fucking dead.

544
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:46,819
God, I...

545
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,156
I had to do something about it.

546
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,952
So I decided that
I was gonna look for you.

547
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,499
I was gonna start right where I lost you.

548
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,755
Every year, I have two weeks of vacation,

549
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,174
and every year,
I come to fucking Australia

550
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,676
and I show your picture
to everybody I meet.

551
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,262
"Do you know this woman?

552
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,181
"Have you ever seen her before?"

553
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,849
And they all just

554
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,352
look at me and they shake their heads
and they say, "Oh, I'm sorry."

555
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,979
Everybody's so fucking sorry.

556
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,899
But I couldn't stop.

557
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,404
Every year, I would say to myself,
I can't do this.

558
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,198
I'm not doing this.

559
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,825
Never again.

560
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,868
But every year, I would come back.

561
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,246
Because...

562
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,415
Because I couldn't stop.

563
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,628
And a couple days ago...

564
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,756
I showed your picture to that nun...

565
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,843
And I saw it in her eyes.

566
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,970
She recognized you.

567
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,265
She knew you.

568
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,686
And when I saw you...

569
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,108
I couldn't believe it.

570
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,028
There you were.

571
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,574
And I was so...

572
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,123
But I didn't know what to say...

573
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,462
Or where to start, and so I just thought,
"Oh, fuck it. I'll erase it."

574
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,716
Just erase it all and maybe that would

575
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,426
give us another chance.

576
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,472
But you were right.

577
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,393
It's not true.

578
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,899
That's how I found you, Nora.

579
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,442
I...

580
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,946
I refused to believe you were gone.

581
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,454
You want some tea?

582
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,250
What?

583
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,629
I was gonna make a cup of tea.
You want some?

584
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,217
Okay.

585
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,733
You want one?

586
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,818
No.

587
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,028
I quit.

588
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:37,907
Heart.

589
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,954
So that part is true.

590
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,997
Mmm-hmm.

591
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,168
That part is true.

592
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,675
What else is true?

593
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,556
Everything I said about Matt's funeral.

594
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,978
Everything I told you about
Jill and Tommy...

595
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:08,688
My father.

596
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,357
Did you move back to Mapleton?

597
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,150
No.

598
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,069
I'm still in Jarden.

599
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,363
In our house.

600
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,991
Anyone still call it Miracle?

601
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,867
Not so much.

602
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:23,828
How are the Murphys?

603
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,498
Uh, Michael's pretty much running
the church now.

604
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,585
I see Erika there every once in a while.

605
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,504
She's great.

606
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,882
And, uh, John and Laurie
still live next door.

607
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:44,140
I talk to Laurie sometimes.

608
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,228
-What?
-Every once in a while.

609
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,564
Just when I need to.

610
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,650
She knows you're here?

611
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,068
Don't be mad at her.

612
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,404
She's my therapist.
She wasn't allowed to tell you.

613
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,573
Why didn't you tell me?

614
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,617
Because you were right, Kevin.

615
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,829
What you said in the hotel...

616
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,582
The last time we saw each other.

617
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,752
I needed to be with my kids.

618
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,213
-Uh, no, I didn't mean that--
-You meant it, and you were right, Kevin.

619
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:20,384
There were always gonna be
bulletproof vests...

620
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,678
Hugs from holy men...

621
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,765
Tattoos to cover up.

622
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,686
But those were just ways
to deal with what I lost.

623
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,733
I needed a way to get them back.

624
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,863
I knew there was a chance
it would kill me,

625
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,366
but I made my peace with that.

626
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,536
And I said goodbye to my brother...

627
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,915
And I climbed right in.

628
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,132
And then you changed your mind.

629
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,593
No.

630
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,096
I didn't change my mind.

631
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,225
- I went through.

632
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,069
I was in the parking lot...

633
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,405
Naked...

634
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,491
Curled up like a baby.

635
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:32,289
It was the same parking lot I'd just
been in, except there were no trucks...

636
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,709
No people, no nothing.

637
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,801
It was cold, so I started to walk.

638
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,013
I walked by empty houses...

639
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,808
Abandoned buildings.

640
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,270
And I found a store,

641
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,605
so I went in and there
were clothes there...

642
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,692
Clothes hanging on racks.
So I got dressed

643
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,278
and I got back to walking.

644
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,534
I walked long enough to convince myself

645
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,203
that I was the only thing
alive in that place.

646
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:17,751
And then night came and I saw lights,
so I went to them.

647
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:23,424
It was a house, and there was a man
and a woman there.

648
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:28,220
They were kind and they told me,

649
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,267
the man told me that seven years earlier,

650
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:37,855
he was in a supermarket and every single
person disappeared except for him.

651
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:44,904
And the woman told me
that she lost her husband,

652
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:49,074
her three daughters,
and all eight of her grandchildren.

653
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,953
And that's when I understood.

654
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:58,083
Over here, we lost some of them.

655
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:02,755
But over there, they lost all of us.

656
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,637
So, I went and did
what I came there to do.

657
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,390
I went to find my kids.

658
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,437
Planes don't really fly over there.

659
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:21,440
They have the resources,
just not enough pilots.

660
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,443
So I found a boat that would take me.

661
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:29,114
No boats go directly
from Australia to New York,

662
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:32,368
so it took me a long time to get there.

663
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,704
A long time.

664
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,291
But I finally did.

665
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,007
And I walked through Mapleton.

666
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:54,181
I walked through
the town where I grew up...

667
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,396
Where my parents died...

668
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,147
And Matt.

669
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,069
Where you and I met.

670
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,533
Most of the houses
were overgrown with weeds,

671
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,827
but the streetlights still
turned on at night,

672
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:18,581
and that made me feel less stupid
about expecting them still to be there.

673
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,710
Still there in the very same house
where I lost them.

674
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,340
When I got there, I stood behind a tree
across the street and I waited

675
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,093
because I was too scared
to go up and knock.

676
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:38,017
And then, after a while, the door opened.

677
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,897
At first, I didn't recognize them.

678
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,154
A tall teenage boy

679
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,573
with curly hair

680
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,038
and a girl, maybe 11 .

681
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,251
They were my children.

682
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:15,387
And then my husband came out,
and he was with a woman.

683
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,805
She was pretty.

684
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:21,185
She was pretty, and they were all smiling.

685
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,733
They were

686
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,278
happy.

687
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:40,412
And I understood that here in this place,
they were the lucky ones.

688
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,126
In a world full of orphans,

689
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,837
they still had each other.

690
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,593
And I was a ghost.

691
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,932
I was a ghost who had no place there.

692
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,315
And that, Kevin,
is when I changed my mind.

693
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,239
The physicists who sent me through

694
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:18,450
told me the first person to use the
machine was the guy who invented it.

695
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,121
His name was Dr. Van Eeghan.

696
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,832
I'm pretty sure they were
making fun of me,

697
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,127
but they said when I went over
that I should look him up, so I did.

698
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,546
That took a long time, too.

699
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,465
But I found him,

700
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:38,345
and I asked him to make another machine
because he already knew how.

701
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,639
And he asked me

702
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,977
if I'd come all that way, why in
God's name did I wanna go back?

703
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,980
And I told him
it's because I didn't belong there.

704
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,441
So he built it.

705
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,235
And I came back through.

706
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,612
I came back here.

707
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,750
Did I...

708
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,754
Think about you?

709
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,471
Did I wanna call you?

710
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,517
Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?

711
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,061
Of course I did.

712
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,068
But so much time had passed.

713
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,909
It was too late.

714
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:51,585
And I knew that if I told you
