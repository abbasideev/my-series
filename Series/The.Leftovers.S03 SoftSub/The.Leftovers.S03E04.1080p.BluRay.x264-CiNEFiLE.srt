1
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,803
Final boarding call for flight 87...

2
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,685
You two together?

3
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,731
Yes, we are.

4
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,025
Australia, huh? Long trip.

5
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:53,112
Yes, it is. I have Global Entry.
Where's the pre-check line?

6
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,198
It is right over there, ma'am.
Leave your shoes on.

7
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,241
-No need to take your laptop out.
-Oh.

8
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,494
Is it all right if I go with her? Uh...

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,704
-I'm a cop, so--
-Do you have Global Entry?

10
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,208
-No.
-Then you can't go with her.

11
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,171
I'll just see you on the other side, okay?

12
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,053
-Sir?
-Yeah...

13
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,225
This way, please. Single file.

14
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,114
Arms up, please.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,293
-Your watch.
-Oh, shit. Sorry.

16
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,049
Just walk on around. Come back through.

17
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,184
-Enjoy your flight.
-Thank you.

18
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,443
Come on. Hey, give it back.
You can't take it, no.

19
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,779
- Look, no, no. No, you can't take it.
- Sir.

20
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,614
- No, it's my suit.
- Is there a problem here, sir?

21
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,449
No, look,
it's not on the list of restricted items.

22
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,410
Okay, look, there's gonna be
a nuclear event,

23
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,662
and I'm entitled
to protect myself from fallout.

24
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,706
Okay? I'm missing my flight.

25
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,541
I need to get to Antarctica.

26
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,042
I need to get to Antarctica!

27
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,547
Another one bites the dust.

28
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,234
Hey.

29
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,069
Hi.

30
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,158
Everything go okay?

31
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,993
Yeah, absolutely.

32
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,995
-You?
-Great.

33
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,081
What are you smuggling?

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,083
Sorry?

35
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,668
You either didn't wanna wait
in line with me

36
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,420
for an extra five minutes,
or you're smuggling something.

37
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,838
So, what is it?

38
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,215
Heroin?

39
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,386
I have $20,000 in cash
strapped to my body.

40
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,482
-Lock the door.
-What are you doing?

41
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,985
I borrowed your duct tape.

42
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,739
They would've seen it
if I walked through the scanner. Sorry.

43
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,991
Why?

44
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,203
It's illegal to travel out of the country
with more than 10 grand.

45
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,955
Why didn't you just give me half?

46
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,583
Huh. Help me get the tape off?

47
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,049
Ooh.

48
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,387
Ooh.

49
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,847
You hiding anything else
you wanna tell me about?

50
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,017
Maybe.

51
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,681
- How many?
- A hundred and nineteen.

52
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,182
Jesus.

53
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,434
They made these testimonials.

54
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,394
They're standing there,
holding a newspaper

55
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,479
like a hostage video.

56
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,274
They, they gave their names,
so I looked them up

57
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,525
just to see if any of them
were still around

58
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,902
after they supposedly got into this thing.

59
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,281
The thing that zaps them
with the radiation?

60
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes, honey, the thing
that zaps them with the radiation.

61
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,620
And were they?

62
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,622
-Still there?
-No.

63
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,833
Every single one of them
is unaccounted for.

64
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,626
-Where'd they go?
-Nowhere.

65
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,295
Well, I mean, they have to go somewhere.

66
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,797
- Not if they're being cremated.

67
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,051
Ladies and gentlemen,
the seat belt sign is now turned off,

68
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,011
and you are free to move about the cabin.

69
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,556
So it's a sting operation.

70
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,641
You give them the money.
They show you the thing.

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,351
You see that it torches people.
Then you bust them.

72
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,936
Right.

73
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,190
But you don't have any jurisdiction
in Australia.

74
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,525
That is technically true.

75
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,492
The DSD didn't send you.

76
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,828
So you've gone rogue?

77
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,290
The DSD has their hands full
with the coming apocalypse.

78
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,627
These assholes invited me personally,

79
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,712
so I can take them down myself.

80
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,631
They didn't know
you were a fraud investigator?

81
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,840
No, they knew.

82
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,675
They knew
pretty much everything, actually.

83
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,681
Well, then they know about me.

84
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,266
I'm sure they do.

85
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,685
And they still think
you're gonna get into this thing?

86
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,028
And what if they ask
why I came down here with you?

87
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,740
I'll say

88
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,493
that you've come to see me off

89
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,330
because we're
in a toxic codependent relationship,

90
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,874
and we've both come to realize
that we're better off

91
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,334
apart than together.

92
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,657
You gonna look your dad up?

93
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,701
-Look him up?
-Yeah.

94
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,870
I thought that's why you wanted
to come down here.

95
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,414
No, I came down here to be with you.

96
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,374
Yeah, but if he's close by--

97
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,126
Honey, I don't know where he is.

98
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,587
And if he wanted me to know,
he would've fucking told me.

99
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,298
Gotcha.

100
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,597
You brought your book.

101
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,106
It's not my book. It's Matt's.

102
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,317
-But it's about you.
-Uh-huh.

103
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,778
Are you finally gonna read it?

104
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,532
-I already did.
-Really? When?

105
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,160
On the plane when you were asleep.

106
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,786
The whole thing?

107
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,915
- The whole thing.

108
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,877
"And so He left the bridge
and the hangman behind.

109
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,130
"And when He went into the woods,
He lifted the girl to His shoulder,

110
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,591
"and she slept.
She pressed to Him and He to her..."

111
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,593
He capitalizes your H's.

112
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,471
"Now the sun rose,
and they had come to a well,

113
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,807
"and He placed the girl
down upon its edge and..."

114
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,562
What?

115
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,940
If you read the whole thing,
what happens next?

116
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,279
He pushed her in.

117
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,823
Jesus.

118
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,284
Where does Matt come up with this stuff?

119
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,664
--Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

120
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,583
Fuck. That's them.

121
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,505
- Yes?
- Is this Nora?

122
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,173
Yes, it is. Who's this?

123
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,175
There's a bus stop across the street
from the hotel.

124
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,136
The 570 will arrive in about 15 minutes.

125
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,138
Take it to the last stop. Don't miss it.

126
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,640
- We won't wait. Goodbye, Ms. Durst.

127
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,225
- What? I don't--

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,186
-That was them. I have to go.
-Where?

129
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,021
I don't know.
They want me to get on a bus.

130
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,399
-You want me to go with you?
-I'll be fine.

131
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,444
Are you gonna follow me, Kevin?

132
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,364
- Yeah.

133
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,201
Look, I have to do this alone, okay?

134
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,704
Okay.

135
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,498
Just take your nap. I'll be safe.

136
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,376
Okay.

137
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,461
Dinner later?

138
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,297
Yeah, sure.

139
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,257
I'll be back soon.

140
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,577
God, motherfucker.

141
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,081
G'day, Melbourne!
It's a beautiful Tuesday,

142
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,249
and I'm Pam Jolly.

143
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,500
And I'm Bruce Quartermain.

144
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,588
Today is October 9th,
and I have to say I'm a bit groggy.

145
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,591
- Ooh, how was your night, Bruce?
- Oh, I had a big night last night.

146
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,759
Did you go to the party?

147
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,262
Well, I went to Melbourne's
Spring Fashion Ball last night.

148
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,015
Ooh. Tell us. Tell us.
Did you wear a costume?

149
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,225
Well, the theme this year
was under the sea...

150
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,477
Good morning. Front desk.

151
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,645
Yeah, I can't turn off my television.

152
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,397
I can't see where it's plugged in.

153
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,774
Yeah, so sorry about that.

154
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,942
It's powered from the wall.
Happens sometimes.

155
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,071
I can reset it from down here.
It'll just be a moment, Mr. Durst.

156
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,616
- It's Mr. Garvey.
- Oh, so sorry.

157
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,451
Uh, would you like us
to add your name to the room

158
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,620
so you can have access
to all the guest amenities?

159
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,538
Yes, that would be great. Thank you.

160
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,667
Well, I'm ashamed to say that I did, Pam,

161
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,338
but at least I get to be having pancakes
with you here this morning, right?

162
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,672
Do you like pancakes, Bruce?

163
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,383
Well, now, who doesn't like pancakes?

164
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,510
Well, no one in their right mind,
that's what I say,

165
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,846
which is why we are having
a pancake cook-off today

166
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,598
right here in the studio.

167
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,809
Now, how are you with a spatula?

168
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,143
You know, can you flip 'em?

169
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,479
- What kind of question is that?
- Well, it's tricky.

170
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,555
And I sure hope no one watching
is named Kevin.

171
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,723
Why is that, Pam?

172
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,141
Well, apparently, there's not one,

173
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,478
but two missing Kevins
in the Melbourne area.

174
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,105
Chief Inspector
Kevin Yarborough's police cruiser

175
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,900
was found abandoned
outside his home in Makara.

176
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,903
Meanwhile, this man, Kevin Garvey,

177
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,113
an American holidaying down under,

178
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,284
was last seen wandering the road
near Kurripa nearly a month ago.

179
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,953
If you have any information
on the whereabouts

180
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,248
of either of these men,
please contact the police.

181
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,459
Right, let's get to those pancakes.

182
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,919
Are you ready, Georgie?

183
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,504
Oh, yes, I am, Pam. Come on over.

184
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,719
Okay, now, tell us about the batter.

185
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,387
Well, we've actually got
three batters, George.

186
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,932
The, uh, the first one
is a plain buttermilk.

187
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,103
That's good.
Yeah, I like the classic pancake myself.

188
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,522
Because you're so boring.

189
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,065
Oh, that's not all true.

190
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,650
Uh, but the second one is banana.

191
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,693
Oh, yum. That's definitely for me.

192
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,112
And the third one, of course,
is a chocolate chip.

193
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,822
Oh, Bruce, you'll have...

194
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,325
- Can you hear me?

195
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,122
Fuck.

196
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,709
Good morning. Front desk.

197
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,045
Yeah, I need you to turn my television
back on right now.

198
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,798
Uh, sorry, Mr. Durst. I just reset it.

199
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,007
Just, uh, give it a few minutes.

200
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,094
G'Day Melbourne,
is that show live?

201
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,263
-Sorry?
-Are they shooting it right now?

202
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,848
-Uh, yes, sir. I believe so.
-Where?

203
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,476
Taxi !

204
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you know when the bus
is supposed to get here?

205
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,043
Uh, any minute now.

206
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,838
Excuse me, miss.

207
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,298
Are you a mother?

208
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,092
-Yes.
-Thank God.

209
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,344
I have a job interview in that café.

210
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,180
My sitter didn't show up this morning.
If I go in there with a baby,

211
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,974
then they're never gonna hire me.

212
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,559
Could you please watch her?

213
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,853
-Just for five minutes.
-I'm waiting for a bus.

214
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,606
Please. I'll be in and out, I swear.

215
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,151
I really need this job. Please.

216
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,738
-Um...
-I'm begging you.

217
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,036
-Uh, okay. Okay.
-God bless you.

218
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,537
There we go.

219
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,164
Thank you.

220
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,211
Well, you're a good person,
taking a stranger's baby.

221
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,965
She could run off right now.
You'd never see her again.

222
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,052
Desperate times are these.

223
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,555
Just six days left, right?

224
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,015
Here's hoping.

225
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:16,933
Hey.

226
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,565
Oh.

227
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,943
--Oh.

228
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,654
Um...

229
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,822
Excuse me, when's the next bus?

230
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,575
Uh, should be another one
in about 45 minutes.

231
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,535
Um...

232
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,249
Please wait. I'll be right back.

233
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,420
Wait!

234
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,429
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

235
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,224
Discrimination is illegal.

236
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Shit.

237
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,357
Wait! Hey!

238
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,234
Stop!

239
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,611
Hey! Stop!

240
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,816
Excuse me. Excuse me.

241
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,363
- Let's give it a go. Oh !

242
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,408
Got a man down. Pancake down.

243
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,870
Just when I thought
you were getting the hang of it.

244
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,246
Oh, I'm doing my best here, Pam.

245
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,033
Hey!

246
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,544
Evie! Evie?

247
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,423
What do you want?

248
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,053
-What?
-Just tell me what you fucking want.

249
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,224
Why is this happening again?

250
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,518
'Cause I fucking finished this.

251
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,979
So what do you want?

252
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,234
Did Patti send you?

253
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,613
Who is Patti?

254
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,576
I saw you on my TV.

255
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
You were looking right fucking at me.

256
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,832
Everything right?

257
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,084
Yeah.

258
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,211
Yeah.  I'm fine.

259
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,255
Is he bothering you, miss?

260
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,637
You can see her?

261
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,515
Would you step back, mate?

262
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,809
You're real?

263
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,602
Do you know him?

264
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,272
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

265
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,606
That's bullshit.

266
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,402
I know her. Her name is Evie Murphy.

267
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,945
You know me.

268
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,823
My name is Daniah Moabizzi.

269
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,784
Why are you doing this?

270
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,495
-Step back.
-Hey! Relax.

271
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,788
Do you hear me?

272
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,415
- Oi !

273
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,459
Get the fuck off me, asshole. I know her!
I fucking--

274
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,606
Miss Durst.

275
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,649
Yes?

276
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,417
Go on up. They're waiting for you.

277
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,439
-"Take on Me."
-Ja. From?

278
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,944
-A-ha.
-A-ha!

279
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,076
Ms. Durst.

280
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,245
I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in.

281
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,872
I'm Dr. Eden.

282
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,667
And that is Dr. Bekker.

283
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,503
Hi.

284
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,967
Thank you for coming all this way.

285
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,385
We are sorry about the building.

286
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,804
It's a little bit creepy, no?

287
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,225
What'd she say?

288
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,977
Oh, don't worry about her.

289
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,521
Um, let's go downstairs, shall we?

290
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,190
Okay.

291
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,919
This is Bernard.

292
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,338
If you would not mind
removing your clothes,

293
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,674
Bernard will conduct
a brief medical examination.

294
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,092
We have a gown for you.

295
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,473
What kind of medical examination?

296
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,439
It's very routine. It's noninvasive.

297
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,026
And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I,
we will just ask you a few questions,

298
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,069
and then we can move on to the next step.

299
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,739
If you're a doctor,
why aren't you doing the exam?

300
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,949
Oh, sadly, I'm a physicist.

301
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,745
But Bernard is very professional.
I promise you're in good hands.

302
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,915
Okay.

303
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,710
Great. Well, we will see you in a bit.

304
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,342
She was ready to go.

305
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,973
She was ready to go,
and she wishes she could've told you.

306
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,562
She was ready to go,
and she wishes she could've told you,

307
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,022
but she just couldn't.

308
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,400
It was a stroke.

309
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,154
She was in a coma for three months
before he pulled the plug.

310
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,824
Tell him he set her free.

311
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,661
- Three months is a long time, man.
Uh-huh.

312
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,248
And she's grateful that you set her free.

313
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,002
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

314
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,629
Thank you so much.

315
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
My pleasure.

316
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,385
No, but while I'm here,

317
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,889
uh, could you kindly
try to contact my sister now?

318
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,641
-I'll pay extra.
-No, no, no.

319
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,309
That's okay.

320
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,978
Uh, what was her name?

321
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,356
Margery Prentiss.

322
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,448
Uh, there's five Margery Prentisses.

323
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,908
I need a DOB.

324
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,201
What was her birthday?

325
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,620
Uh, March, uh, 17th.

326
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,587
Oh, shit. She's a departure. Abort.

327
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,631
Abort.

328
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,718
Sir, did your sister disappear
on October 14th?

329
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,347
Yes. Why?

330
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,644
I'm so sorry,
but I can't make a connection

331
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,479
with those who departed.

332
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,441
They're in a different space, man.

333
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,363
Wish I could help you out,
but, uh, I can't.

334
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,283
I'm sorry.

335
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,201
Uh, I'm gonna take this.

336
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,998
Um, give him a hug and tell him
the dead wife wants him to move on.

337
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,625
Hey.

338
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,419
Laurie, it's Kevin. Are you alone?

339
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,797
-What?
-Are you alone? Is John with you?

340
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,758
He's downstairs. You okay?

341
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,011
I just saw Evie.

342
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,099
- What?
- Evie. Evangeline Murphy.

343
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,394
She's alive.
She's in fucking Melbourne, Australia.

344
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,689
You're in Australia?

345
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,276
Yes. Uh, Nora had to come here for work.
It doesn't matter.

346
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,155
She's here. She's here.
I talked to her, Laurie.

347
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,698
Okay. Okay, Kevin.

348
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,158
I just... I need you to slow down

349
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,285
and explain to me
exactly what you think you saw.

350
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,287
No, I don't think I saw anything.

351
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,497
I had a fucking conversation with her.

352
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,541
She's here. She's, uh...

353
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,376
I need you to do that thing
that you do on your computer

354
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,795
with the, uh... You know, go on Facebook.
I need you to find her.

355
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,549
She's in Melbourne,
and she's using a, um, a different name.

356
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:56,638
She's using, um,
Daniah Moabizzi.

357
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,806
Daniah Moabizzi. I...

358
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,141
I took a picture on my phone.

359
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,477
I'm gonna send that to you, okay?
Hang on. Hang on.

360
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,273
Daniah.
Did you see her at the Melbourne Library?

361
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,859
- Why? Does she work there?

362
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,904
Did you get the picture?

363
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,744
Yeah, I got it.

364
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,498
It's her.

365
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,667
I know it's her.

366
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,838
Did you talk to Nora about this?

367
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,507
Nora's not here right now.

368
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,884
-Why did you say she was at the library?
-Hey...

369
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,512
Kevin.

370
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,350
Under no circumstances
should you approach Evie again, okay?

371
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,893
It might scare her off.

372
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,562
We just... We need to figure out
what we're gonna do about this, okay?

373
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,855
We need to--

374
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,401
Kevin?

375
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,695
Kevin?

376
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,658
Excuse me. Excuse me!

377
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,035
You know where the public library is?

378
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,215
120 over 80. Optimal.

379
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,555
--Almost done.

380
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,266
Just need to draw some blood.

381
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,310
Why?

382
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,063
Anemia, glucose, potassium,
heavy metals, and pregnancy.

383
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,527
Well, I'm definitely not pregnant.

384
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,448
Oh, right. Your IUD.

385
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,074
You'll need to have it removed
before you go through.

386
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,493
-We can refer you to a--
-How did you know I had an IUD?

387
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,538
It's in your medical records.

388
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,339
Just gonna affix some sensors
for an electrocardiogram.

389
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Oh.

390
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,550
Would you mind lowering your gown, please?

391
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,978
The event chamber of the device
requires an intense period of confinement,

392
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,567
so we're gonna simulate that now
while we're monitoring you

393
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,611
just to see how well you hold up.

394
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,585
It'll just be for a few minutes.

395
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,259
There's plenty of air in there.

396
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,137
I am gonna close the lid,
but you can get out at any time.

397
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,853
If you wanna take your money
in the box with you, that's fine.

398
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,689
Some folks worry
that we're gonna run off with it

399
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,024
while they're inside.

400
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,152
No, I trust you.

401
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,174
One, two, three, four!

402
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,892
Hi. Hey.

403
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,478
Uh, is Danyah working today?

404
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,271
Who?

405
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,398
Uh... Danyah or Daneeah.

406
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,317
-Daniah?
-Daniah, yes.

407
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,819
I'm not sure. Um, is there something
I can do for you, sir?

408
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,113
Yeah, she was helping me look for a book.

409
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,948
What book was it?

410
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,533
Um... Uh...

411
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,912
Assassins. Assassins, I think.

412
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,872
The title is Assassins?

413
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,625
No. If you call her,
she could probably help me.

414
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,669
We don't have a book by that title.

415
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,588
-I'm sorry.
-No, I know that... I know.

416
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,549
But if you just get a hold of Daniah,
then I think she could help me.

417
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,469
So, if you just do that,
that'd be fucking great, please.

418
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,227
Leonard?

419
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,605
Oh, uh, No. I...

420
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,440
He's being weird.

421
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,359
That so?

422
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,612
No. Um, I just...
I don't, I don't want any trouble.

423
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,947
-I was just--
-Fantastic.

424
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,114
Let's take a walk, mate.

425
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,616
I need to get a book that I was looking--

426
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,867
You're leaving.

427
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,202
It's okay, Leonard.

428
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,581
You know this bloke, Dani?

429
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,626
Yes.

430
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,836
I know him.

431
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,642
Let's talk, Kevin.

432
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,500
I am Evie Murphy.

433
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,880
I have started a new life.

434
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,719
I am asking you not to tell anyone
that you have seen me.

435
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,098
Not my mother, my father, my brother.

436
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:20,521
I just need you to leave me alone.

437
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,319
John's my friend. He thinks you're dead.

438
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,865
I have started a new life.

439
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,243
You don't have the right
to take that away from me.

440
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,246
Then you need to tell me
why you're doing this.

441
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,501
Because

442
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,838
there is no family.

443
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,729
Then why are you still using that accent?

444
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,816
- I have to go.
- No, no.

445
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,863
What the fuck is going on?

446
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,437
What?

447
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:50,778
I have compassion for you
because you are ill.

448
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,079
I wanted to help.

449
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,128
She told me to tell you
that I was who you thought I was,

450
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,672
and then you'd go away.

451
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,387
Who told you?

452
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,599
Mmm-mmm. No, no.

453
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,438
This one's on me.

454
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,898
Well, I hope you don't have
any expectations

455
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,484
because you took me out
to dinner, young lady.

456
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,778
I wouldn't dare.

457
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,992
-Who is it?
-Shit.

458
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,994
It's Kevin.

459
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,747
-Call him back.
-I, um...

460
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,376
I think I have to take this.
He's in Australia.

461
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,919
He's where?

462
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,505
Just... Give me, give me a minute.

463
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,016
-Kevin?
-What the fuck did you do?

464
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,144
Okay. I just... I need you to calm down
and just tell me what happened.

465
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,647
What happened is that I went to see Evie,

466
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,900
and she told me
that you fucking called her.

467
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,819
-Where are you?
-The library.

468
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,404
With her? Is she there?

469
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,282
Did you know about this?

470
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,867
Did you know that she was down here?

471
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,869
Okay, Kevin, I need you to listen to me.

472
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,499
I need you
to leave and go back to the hotel, okay?

473
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,460
Go back to Nora, and call me later, okay?

474
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,879
She told me that you said that I was ill.

475
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,215
What the fuck does that mean, Laurie?

476
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,136
Remember when you were seeing Patti,
and I told you that--

477
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,889
I'm not seeing anybody.
She's right fucking here!

478
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,058
You were seeing Patti,

479
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,186
and I told you that you never tell someone

480
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,604
in the midst of a psychotic break

481
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,856
that they are in the midst
of a psychotic break.

482
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,192
Remember?

483
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,029
You need to indulge that person's delusion

484
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,322
and find common ground.

485
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,242
Otherwise, it's very likely
that they will hurt themselves.

486
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:02,535
I don't...

487
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,247
I don't want you to hurt yourself, Kevin.

488
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,084
Just leave Evie, okay?

489
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,379
Just leave her,
and go back to the hotel, okay?

490
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,219
Or I hang up this phone right now,
and I call John,

491
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,721
and I tell him
that you just spoke to his daughter.

492
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,236
- Laurie, you there? Hello?

493
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,322
I need you to pull up
that photo you sent me.

494
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,952
-What?
-The photo that you took of Evie.

495
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,289
I need you to pull it up on your phone.

496
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,959
Can you do that for me, please?

497
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,595
Okay, I did it. What?

498
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,056
I want you to listen to me.

499
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,019
Okay?
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

500
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,608
You could've called anybody
you wanted when this happened,

501
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,192
but you called me.

502
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,988
Because I think you knew
that I could help you.

503
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm gonna give you that help now.

504
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,003
This isn't real.

505
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,548
That girl is not Evie.

506
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,765
Look at the photo again.

507
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,587
I'm leaving now.

508
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,738
I don't understand what's happening.

509
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:51,745
I think that you projected Evie
onto a stranger.

510
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,457
And I think you chose Evie

511
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,629
because you understood
why she did what she did,

512
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,383
why she left her family, why she escaped.

513
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,929
I think a part of you
wants to escape, Kevin.

514
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,016
No, I, I don't want to escape.

515
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,435
Then why are you in Australia?

516
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,230
You are Chief of Police.

517
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,733
You have responsibilities here.

518
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,737
It is less than a week away
from the seventh anniversary,

519
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,823
and you just ran away
without telling anybody.

520
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,993
No, I... I came to be with Nora.

521
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,580
She's the one that needed to be here. I...

522
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,876
And she's the one that, uh, ran away.

523
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,550
Kevin, are you and Nora okay?

524
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,186
Ask John about the fucking book
he wrote about me.

525
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,417
Welcome back.

526
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
Your heart is very calm.

527
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,882
-What?
-Your heart rate.

528
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,178
- It's very even.

529
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,181
Most people panic after a few minutes.

530
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,350
Oh. Thanks.

531
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,189
Let's have a chat, shall we?

532
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,775
Okay.

533
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,332
Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed talking to you
in St. Louis.

534
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,126
Where is Mr. Linn-Baker?

535
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,878
He went through.

536
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,714
Through the machine?

537
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,552
-Yes.
-Is it here in this building?

538
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,557
No, it's not here.

539
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:23,105
I'm happy to answer any other questions
you may have about the device, uh,

540
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,773
technical or otherwise.

541
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,400
Why haven't you used it?

542
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,236
Everything I need is here.

543
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,739
What about you?

544
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,075
I don't like the odds.

545
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,952
Odds?

546
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,581
All we know for certain is
that we are sending people

547
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,918
to the exact same destination
the others went seven years ago.

548
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,631
The odds that this destination
has a sustainable environment

549
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,594
with a breathable atmosphere
and ample food supply are very, very low,

550
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:58,974
so it is more likely
there are 140 million corpses

551
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,560
floating out there in space somewhere.

552
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,771
You make it sound so appealing.

553
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,609
Actually, um, several of our colleagues
did go through.

554
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,236
- Dr. Van Eeghen, the man who--

555
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,618
The man who designed the device,
he was one of the first people to use it.

556
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,288
Oh, yes.
And if you see him, tell him we said hello

557
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,290
and that Finland won the World Cup.

558
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
What did she say?

559
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,267
Dr. Bekker is...

560
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,566
Dr. Bekker thinks you have no intention
of using the device. Um...

561
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,526
She believes that you're curious,

562
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:56,156
but once the time comes,
you will get, uh, how do you say,

563
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,116
cold feet.

564
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,499
I won't get cold feet.

565
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,592
Good.

566
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,762
So do you want my money now?

567
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,014
No, not yet.

568
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,059
We have a question for you first.

569
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,894
Just one.

570
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,729
You wanna know
why I brought Kevin with me.

571
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,482
My boyfriend.

572
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,653
You know everything else about me,
so I just figured you'd be worried--

573
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,863
We know who Kevin is,
and we're not worried.

574
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
Okay.

575
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,456
What's your question?

576
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,798
Two infant twins are born.

577
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,718
One of them will grow up to cure cancer

578
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,595
but only if the other one dies now.

579
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:06,059
You don't have to kill the baby yourself,
but you do have to nod to make it happen.

580
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,855
Do you nod?

581
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,779
If I nod, how will the baby be killed?

582
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,073
Will it suffer,
or is it gonna be quick and painless?

583
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,869
Quick and painless.

584
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,079
Are they mine, the twins?

585
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,414
Irrelevant.

586
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,125
It's relevant if you want me to answer
your fucking question.

587
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,086
They're not yours.

588
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:43,597
She was working for you.

589
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,100
- Sorry?
- The woman at the bus stop

590
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,811
who gave me her baby.
That was a test, right?

591
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,108
We have no idea what you're talking about.

592
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,361
Mmm. Sure, you don't.

593
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,238
Please just answer the question.

594
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,036
Kids die every day.

595
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,996
What's one more?

596
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,458
And I get to cure cancer?

597
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,919
Of course, I nod.

598
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:25,722
That's it?

599
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,225
Yes, Ms. Durst.

600
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,185
That's it.

601
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,479
So how does this work?

602
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,314
You give me a name. I go to a hotel room,

603
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,150
explain what low-amplitude
Denziger radiation is, and then what?

604
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,652
Do I come back here or what?

605
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,112
That won't be necessary.

606
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,490
What? Why?

607
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,576
I'm afraid we will not be proceeding
any further.

608
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,162
What?

609
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,290
What, did I answer
your stupid question wrong?

610
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,006
Oh...  I get it. I get it!

611
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,677
You turn me down, and then you want me
to beg you to take my money, right?

612
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,680
Keep your money.

613
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,350
No.

614
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,185
No.

615
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,022
Wait!

616
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,444
Stop!

617
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,489
Go home, Ms. Durst. This isn't for you.

618
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,924
George. George Brevity.
This is Nora Durst calling for him.

619
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,760
Yeah, I know! I am a fraud investigator,

620
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,597
and I need to talk to him
because I've uncovered a massive fraud.

621
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,016
Hmm. Well, then...

622
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,894
Well, then give me his home number
because it's an emergency.

623
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,395
No, I will not hold--

624
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,397
God damn it!

625
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,736
Hi.

626
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,613
Hi.

627
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,781
What happened to your head?

628
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,285
-Are you smoking?
-Yeah, you want one?

629
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,497
- What happened?
- They turned me down.

630
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,957
-Who?
-The people who invited me here.

631
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,502
They, they told me that
I wouldn't be proceeding any further.

632
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,921
- Did they take your money?
- No.

633
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,423
-I thought it was a scam.
-Yeah !

634
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,634
And they must've known
that I knew it was a scam,

635
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,302
and that's why they fucking ran.

636
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,846
But I'm gonna find them.
I'm gonna find them,

637
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,640
and I'm gonna fucking destroy them.

638
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,648
Are you okay?

639
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,275
Yeah, I'm fine.

640
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,528
Kevin.

641
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,863
What's wrong?

642
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,618
You can tell me anything.

643
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,373
No, I can't.

644
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,125
Why not?

645
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,128
The last time I told you everything,

646
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,965
I woke up handcuffed to a bed,
and you were gone.

647
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,801
Kevin.

648
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,304
I didn't know how to handle
you talking to a dead person.

649
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,395
-Oh, Jesus. Is it happening again?
-I, uh... I...

650
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,481
-We need to call Laurie.
-What?

651
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:25,777
I told her I would come
back here, and we would call her.

652
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,488
When did you talk to Laurie?

653
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,073
I needed help.

654
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,117
-With what?
-I saw...

655
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
-I thought that I saw someone.
-Okay.

656
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,079
-I needed to make sure--
-Who did you see?

657
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:37,831
That doesn't matter.

658
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,875
You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?

659
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,420
Who else? Matt?
'Cause if you're having visions,

660
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,838
he's gonna wanna put it
in your fucking book.

661
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,881
It's not my fucking book!

662
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,049
No?

663
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,010
I think you like it.

664
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,345
I think you wanna be
Jesus Christ fucking Superstar

665
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,847
because it makes you feel important.

666
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,766
Like it? I fucking love it!

667
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,059
It's riveting !

668
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,187
I've read it fucking cover
to fucking cover!

669
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,781
There you go.

670
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,366
Book's gone.

671
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,037
We never have to talk about it again
because that's what we do.

672
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,497
We don't fucking talk about anything !

673
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,585
What do you wanna talk about?

674
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,382
What do you wanna talk about?

675
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,267
Why didn't you stop me?

676
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,562
Stop you from what?

677
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,232
From giving her away. Lily.

678
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:48,568
I didn't stop you

679
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,904
because you decided you wanted to do it,
and you did it.

680
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,697
You never even asked me what I wanted.

681
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,991
And if I had, Kevin,
what would you have said?

682
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,410
You were relieved. Just say it!

683
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,830
And now you want a new baby?
Are you fucking insane?

684
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,167
Oh, are you afraid
you're gonna give that one away, too?

685
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,256
You can't have a kid

686
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,426
because then you'd have no excuse.

687
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,931
You couldn't be a victim anymore.
You... You'd have to be okay.

688
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,725
No one would feel sorry for you.

689
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,191
I do not want people to feel sorry for me.

690
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,110
Well, then how long, Nora?

691
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,737
How long before you move past it?

692
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,326
Move past what?

693
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,247
That you lost your kids.

694
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,791
I did not lose them !

695
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,128
My kids are not dead. They are gone.

696
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,796
They are just gone.

697
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,007
Then you should go be with them.

698
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,262
I need a taxi.

699
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,555
No taxis, sir.

700
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,224
Why not?

701
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,975
The explosion.

702
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,062
Yes, hi, uh...

703
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,610
- I'll be back.

704
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,782
Jesus.

705
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,744
I can't believe you're actually here.

706
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,121
I saw you on the TV in the window.

707
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,625
I turned to my friend, I said,
"Holy shit! That's my boy."

708
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,585
We called the local hotels,

709
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,381
and here you goddamn are.

710
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,758
Hey, there.

711
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,134
Son, that's Grace.

712
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,973
Is this real?

713
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,016
Of course, it's fucking real.

714
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,518
Where are you going anyway?

715
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,811
Home.

716
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,521
You didn't see the news?

717
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,356
All flights grounded.

718
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,943
Are you alone here?

719
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,155
Yes.

720
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,576
Well, you're not alone anymore.

721
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,870
Come on.

722
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,187
