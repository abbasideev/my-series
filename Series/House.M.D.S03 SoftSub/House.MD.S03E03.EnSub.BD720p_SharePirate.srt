1
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,390
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,936
Unfortunately, as much as I
admire your spirit...

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:38,955
Subject anesthetized with.5 CC's
of sodium pentobarbital.

4
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,333
Transfected with
human hepatic cancer cells.

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:48,423
Underwent six rounds of intra-abdominal
treatment with ES-22.

6
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:55,763
Vertical incision through the rectus
sheath opens the abdominal cavity.

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,808
Incision extended into...

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,768
the thorax.

9
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,861
Liver appears normal in color.
No apparent scarring or...

10
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,156
Damn it!

11
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,953
Cancerous tumors still present
on the right lobe,

12
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:24,584
1.12 centimeters in diameter.
No reduction.

13
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,703
71-year-old
cancer research specialist.

14
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,124
Minor tremors, a localized melanoma
removed two years ago, cataracts.

15
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,292
And he can't breathe.

16
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,753
Also, disregard the facial lacerations.

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,797
They're creepy, but unfortunately
irrelevant.

18
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,675
Don't you wanna know why?

19
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,218
You have your cane.

20
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,637
No, why the lacerations
are creepy.

21
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,557
He was about to dissect one of his lab
rats when he collapsed.

22
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:07,228
The little vermin seized the day, so to
speak, and went medieval on his ass.

23
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,064
What? My fly open?

24
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,066
So, the pain's returned?

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,985
There was no pain.
He was unconscious.

26
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

27
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,238
We're talking about you.

28
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,657
Obviously. I'm obviously not.

29
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,867
What is it with you people?

30
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,910
I don't use the cane, you're shocked.
I use the cane...

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,120
We're just concerned.

32
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,330
About the wrong person.
I can breathe.

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,499
Ezra Powell, on the other hand,
is gonna die.

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,293
- The Ezra Powell?
- The researcher?

35
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,659
The guy who wrote
that textbook?

36
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,212
"That" textbook? The textbook.

37
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,548
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

38
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,634
I admire lots of doctors.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,640
Of course, most of them look a lot
better in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,930
but seeing as they
can all breathe...

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,808
Oxygenation is through the floor
and lungs are full of fluid.

42
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,476
Gotta be his heart.

43
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,603
Could be amyloidosis.

44
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,064
Or his lungs, probably from years of
inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,317
It's not the lungs.
The chest x-ray's clean.

46
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,860
So's his EKG.
It's not his heart.

47
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,612
We're being too nice.

48
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,156
Outside the hospital
he can't breathe.

49
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,575
Inside the hospital he can,
because we help,

50
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,952
at least enough to screw with
our test results.

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,622
The source of the problem's either
in his heart or his lungs,

52
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,458
so all we gotta do is
stop helping,

53
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,752
put a little pressure on him
and see which gives out first.

54
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,504
At 71, we get his
heart or lungs to give out,

55
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,048
we might not get them to give in again.

56
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,091
That's why we're gonna do it
in a hospital.

57
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,553
Put him on an inclined treadmill
and do a stress EKG.

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,890
So much for the admiration.

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,187
Let's get you started.
I'll turn your oxygen up.

60
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,732
I...

61
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:39,278
I worked with Williams on the first
protocol for this machine.

62
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,155
Everyone still uses it.

63
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,867
Except for Williams.
He died four years ago.

64
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,452
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,497
He was 84. He died parasailing.

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,376
He was always an idiot.

67
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,837
You okay?

68
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,008
Hang in there. You know the protocol's
only a few minutes.

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,636
His heart rate's flat.

70
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,972
If we don't get it past 130,
we're not going to see anything.

71
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,391
And if he falls and breaks a hip, we're
not going to see anything either.

72
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,602
Except an increase
in our malpractice insurance.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,107
I figured House might
go back to the pills,

74
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,443
but if he's using his cane,
he's right back to where he was before.

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,403
Maybe even worse.

76
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,614
Luckily, he'll handle it
in a stoic, grown-up fashion.

77
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,950
He'd never take it out on us.

78
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,872
I can't.

79
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,291
I've got to stop.

80
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,419
Just a little longer.

81
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,760
His heart rate's only 90.
I'm going to increase the incline.

82
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,682
I've got to stop.
I've got to get off.

83
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,732
You're doing great.
Just a little faster, okay?

84
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,521
I don't need a cheerleader,
I need oxygen.

85
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,649
Stop. This isn't working.

86
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,240
His heart rate
barely got above 90.

87
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,701
He can't breathe.
There's too much fluid in his lungs.

88
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,412
Really?
He's got fluid in his lungs?

89
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,206
Whatever are we gonna do?
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

90
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,834
Put him on a treadmill and run him like
one of his rats on a wheel.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,419
He can't run.
He can hardly walk.

92
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,712
That's 'cause he's not
trying hard enough.

93
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,338
If he was, his heart rate
would go up.

94
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,175
Exercising with a lung full of
your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.

95
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,886
They don't call it
a stress test for nothing. Do it again.

96
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:27,970
He's drowning.

97
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,640
Then pull him out of the pool
and do it again.

98
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:40,066
I'm assuming this isn't
your idea of a long-term solution.

99
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,692
We need to get rid
of the fluid in your lungs,

100
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,277
so you'll be able
to do the test.

101
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,446
To see if it's my heart
or my lungs?

102
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,739
Exactly.

103
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,157
My money's on both.

104
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,495
I've been in and out of the hospital
for the past year.

105
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm old. I'm sick.
And I'm getting older and sicker.

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,294
Not a very interesting
differential but...

107
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,172
I'm in.

108
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,892
You don't need a $400 handbag.

109
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,978
It's kinda hard to check your throat
when you're flapping your gums around.

110
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,230
Sorry.

111
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,773
But it's for the fall formal.

112
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,610
He doesn't care if it's for
the Presidential Inauguration.

113
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,113
But I'm using Marissa'a
old dress. It's free.

114
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,906
You know what else is free?

115
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,201
The roof over your head, the food
you eat, your phone, your computer.

116
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,828
How long have you
been congested?

117
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,413
All week, ever since we
got back from Fresno.

118
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,583
Fresno? That's in France,
right? See the Parthenon?

119
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,252
California.

120
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,463
I've got no appetite,
I'm aching all over, I'm weak.

121
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,174
- Does that hurt?
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,679
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

123
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,430
Totally.

124
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,518
I'm gonna take that giggle
as a "no".

125
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,104
Fever, aches, weakness,
loss of appetite.

126
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,940
You been having an anal sex
with IV drug users lately?

127
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,151
Of course not. I'm married.

128
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,485
You think she might have
been having...

129
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,279
No!

130
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,114
Probably a rhinovirus.

131
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,365
What's that?

132
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,075
A cold.

133
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,329
Take this four times a day,
and stay off airplanes.

134
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,456
They're flying cesspools.

135
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,293
Oops!

136
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,337
You dropped something.

137
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,592
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

138
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,514
- Yes?
- He's too old and weak.

139
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,694
Yeah, this is way better.
This'll work.

140
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,863
Just try.

141
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,575
There are 20 words
to describe chest pain.

142
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,913
Burning, squeezing,
stabbing, tearing...

143
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,415
Each one diagnostically useful.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,919
For that, you have to thank
Dr. Powell's textbook.

145
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,881
But there are no words to describe
degrees of what he's feeling right now.

146
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,674
Shortness of breath.

147
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,386
If he had worked
on those issues, there would be.

148
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,306
He never would have given up
until he had an answer.

149
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,058
This isn't working.

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,938
Dr. House...

151
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,189
Please don't get up.

152
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,899
I'm sure you're very busy,

153
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,944
I'm just gonna try
and speed things up a little.

154
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,779
Is that epi?
That's not the protocol.

155
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,951
No. The protocol is what you tried
to do and failed each time.

156
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,374
Over 100. Now we're
getting somewhere.

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,540
How does it look, Foreman?

158
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,168
No EKG changes.

159
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,545
Then we push harder.

160
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,832
House, you're gonna kill him.

161
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,383
No, he's right. Let him do it.

162
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,344
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

163
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,971
He can't breathe.

164
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,852
130, our magic number.

165
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,855
Nothing here. Foreman?

166
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,315
Still no sign of blockage.

167
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,362
Which means it's not the heart.
It must be the lungs.

168
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,991
See, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

169
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,620
No. Just give me the rest
of the epinephrine.

170
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,027
The test is over. It's okay.
We're going to stabilize you.

171
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,291
No.

172
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,919
No, just let me die.

173
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,004
You're not gonna die.

174
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,839
Yes, I am.

175
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,799
We'll find a treatment.

176
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,261
I don't want to live like this.

177
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,890
Please, I'm begging you.

178
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,476
Kill me.

179
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,191
He says no more tests.

180
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,360
He wants to die and he wants us
to help him do it.

181
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,905
And I wanna play a little game I like
to call Block My Spike with Misty May.

182
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,313
He's thought this through.
It's not an impulsive decision.

183
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,201
Neither is mine.
He's depressed.

184
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,929
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

185
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,538
He's seen all the tests
we've seen.

186
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,582
Even if we figure out
what's causing the lung damage,

187
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,833
it's too late to reverse it.

188
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,879
You can't know that
without knowing what's wrong.

189
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,086
It's his call.

190
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,212
So what do we do?

191
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,298
Do we just put a plastic bag
over his head and get it over with?

192
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,259
No, we give him
a syringe full of morphine.

193
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,097
Every doctor I've ever practiced with
has done it.

194
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,766
They don't want to,
they don't like to,

195
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,310
- but that's the way it is.
- I haven't. I won't.

196
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,227
I couldn't do it either.

197
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,396
You just said we should
respect his decision.

198
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,982
Respect it doesn't necessarily
mean we honor it.

199
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,568
Right. It just means
we talk about it.

200
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,364
At some point, "do no harm" has to mean
allowing nature to take its course,

201
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,157
not stubbornly
standing in the way of it.

202
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,452
Sticking a metal syringe
into a plastic IV line and pumping in

203
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,747
a lethal dose of morphine is not
letting nature take its course,

204
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,123
not according to
the State of New Jersey.

205
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,126
So it's better we allow him
to slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

206
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,128
Whose side are you on, Senator?

207
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,340
First respect his wishes, then invade
Iraq, then get the troops home.

208
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,384
- Make up your mind.
- Wow.

209
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,220
There's certainly a lot of interesting
things to consider.

210
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,931
The stress EKG
rules out the heart,

211
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,682
which means something's
gotta be attacking his lungs.

212
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,144
Could be mycoplasma
or Strep pneumo, which probably means

213
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,688
it's too late
to do anything about it.

214
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,565
We could try levofloxacin.

215
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,734
Coming up with a new treatment
isn't gonna do us any good

216
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,153
unless we convince him
it's worth trying.

217
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,199
Come on. He's old
and sick and tiny.

218
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,201
And we can do
whatever we want to him.

219
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,754
What happened?

220
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,214
I don't know.

221
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,382
He must have fallen out of bed

222
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,593
and got the nasal cannula
wrapped around his neck somehow.

223
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,637
Ezra, what are you doing?

224
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,267
I don't want to live hooked to machines,
too weak to wipe my own ass.

225
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,913
Why would you want to
wipe your own ass

226
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,437
when you could have someone
do it for you?

227
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,105
You're wasting your time.

228
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,311
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

229
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,319
All services rendered
on a first come, first served basis.

230
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,322
I won't consent
to any more tests.

231
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,368
And if anyone tries to
so much as touch me,

232
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,288
I'll press charges for assault.

233
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,833
You heard the man.

234
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,670
He wants everyone to leave him alone.
Why don't you go first?

235
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,298
Get out!

236
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,101
You came to me.
I didn't come to you.

237
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,061
I figured you'd have the guts

238
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,106
to do what had to be done
if it came to that.

239
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,277
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

240
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,408
Breathe!

241
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,993
You're gonna have to
exhale sometime.

242
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,077
Stop!

243
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,329
House, you're hurting him.

244
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,538
You're hurting me.

245
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,922
Fine. If you don't help us,
we don't help you.

246
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,760
Your lungs slowly
fill with fluid.

247
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,013
You gasp to catch every breath,
but never can.

248
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,140
Every breath is petrifying.

249
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:15,187
It'll be slow,
painful, torturous.

250
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,193
We don't choose our birth.
And we don't choose our death.

251
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,157
What if you could?
How about we make a deal?

252
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,910
Give me one more day.

253
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,373
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

254
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,584
- I'll help you die.
- House.

255
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,004
Twenty-four hours.

256
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,633
Come on,
it's not gonna kill you.

257
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,185
Old guy, lungs, fluid. Go.

258
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,591
You cannot help him
kill himself.

259
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,437
Of course I can.

260
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,855
Chase says we do it
all the time.

261
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,608
- Cuddy is not gonna let you.
- Enough!

262
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,318
You don't want me to kill him.
Fine.

263
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,484
Here's a big shock.
I don't want to kill him either.

264
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,490
How do I not kill him?
By you guys doing your job.

265
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,286
We have 24 hours to figure out
what's wrong with him.

266
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,453
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

267
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,498
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria in his blood.

268
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,958
That's gonna take
longer than 24 hours.

269
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,334
Not if I spin down the sample.

270
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,254
Separate off the buffy coat,
then Gram stain for bacteria.

271
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,675
Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer,
C-reactive peptide, get a urine,

272
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,635
and do a bronchial sputum
while you're at it.

273
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,138
And you, check his home
and lab for radiation and toxins.

274
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,468
And do a bone marrow biopsy.

275
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,641
- All of that in 24 hours?
- Nah.

276
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,353
Whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

277
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,389
Wow. You guys look like crap.

278
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,017
- What have you got?
- Purple dye on my fingers.

279
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,395
- What did the bone marrow biopsy show?
- I don't have the results.

280
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,563
What? What have you
been doing all night?

281
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,440
Jell-O shots and wild sex,
what else?

282
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,609
There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

283
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,903
We still have some cooking,
but so far, nothing.

284
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,029
Nothing in the urine.

285
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,366
Lab was clean enough to do surgery in,
because, well, they do.

286
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,536
And there was no sign of viruses
or fleas on any of the rats.

287
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,829
Yeah.

288
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,373
Who?

289
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,334
Tell her to call the clinic.

290
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,462
Then tell her to leave a message
and I'll get back to her.

291
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,006
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

292
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,509
- Who's that?
- That's your protégé.

293
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,844
What are these?

294
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,637
Dictation tapes. He records everything.

295
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,638
Why?

296
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,348
Because he's
a diligent researcher?

297
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,683
Or he's losing his memory.

298
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,292
A lot of people
dictate their notes.

299
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,229
Yes, we could assume that
and we'd have nothing.

300
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,814
Or we could assume
it's a symptom,

301
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,234
in which case whatever's in his lungs
is also in his brain,

302
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,652
unless you've got
something more promising.

303
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,320
I'll go get an MRI of his head.

304
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,364
Keep testing
till you find something.

305
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,242
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

306
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:03,081
It's been a long time
since I took an anatomy class,

307
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,294
but I'm pretty sure you're moving
farther and farther away from my lungs.

308
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,755
Running out of places to look,
aren't you?

309
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,965
It doesn't mean
we're gonna stop looking.

310
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,134
Oh, no. Not for six more hours.

311
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,428
- Do you want us to fail?
- No.

312
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,805
But you will.

313
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,235
No abnormal nuclei means
no leukemia. He a drinker?

314
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,528
Not according to the history.

315
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,735
Which means yes, he drinks,

316
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,574
which gives us a nice mundane
explanation for the acellularity.

317
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,744
Or he's telling the truth, which means
fungus is still on the table.

318
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,789
But your entire view
of human nature gets destroyed.

319
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,416
Six of one,
half a dozen of the other.

320
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,587
Bad news fast. Good news,
you can take your time.

321
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,340
Head's clean. You were wrong.
His faculties are intact.

322
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,258
Too bad.
If his brain was addled,

323
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,052
we wouldn't have
to listen to anything he says.

324
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,678
Hand me the 10 percent KOH.

325
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,388
It's 4:00.
We have nothing to tell him.

326
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,475
Then we have no reason to talk to him.
We still haven't ruled out fungus.

327
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,353
Yeah, we have.
No bugs, no hyphae.

328
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,067
Okay. Next procedure.

329
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,528
We sneak in,
turn back the clock.

330
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,162
Whole team. Must be bad news.

331
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,163
Nope.

332
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,376
Your bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

333
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,379
It's not good news,
but there are some treatments.

334
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,090
- I need to draw some blood.
- What about my breathing?

335
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,300
Associated hyper-viscosity syndrome

336
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,386
gummed up the blood vessels
in your lungs.

337
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,265
Dr. Chase said
my calcium is normal.

338
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,767
We call him Dr. Idiot.

339
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,978
There's no
M protein in my urine.

340
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,604
Odd presentation.

341
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,317
It's so odd that Dr. Cameron
doesn't believe it either.

342
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,323
Just give me 12 more hours.

343
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,951
We had a deal. No more tests.

344
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,122
Fair enough.
Give me six more hours.

345
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,001
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

346
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,961
You a man of your word or not?

347
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,713
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm not.

348
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,340
Fine. Then discharge me.

349
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,803
My lungs will slowly
fill with fluid.

350
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,766
I'll gasp to
catch every breath, but never can.

351
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:32,063
Every breath will be petrifying.
It'll be slow, painful, torturous.

352
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,069
You really gonna
let me die like that?

353
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,944
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

354
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,673
Everybody who can walk
should get out of here.

355
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,385
- You can't do that.
- I can't do what?

356
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,180
Administer a prescription pain killer
to a patient who's in pain?

357
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,306
Go.

358
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,809
Make sure somebody sees you
downstairs in the cafeteria.

359
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,852
I can't let you do this.

360
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,982
Either I die in pain
or I just die.

361
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,985
That's what the argument is here.

362
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,612
No. It's about whether
you die or we murder you.

363
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,698
What's gonna happen here

364
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,283
is that someone's
getting a buttload of morphine.

365
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,995
I'm not sure exactly who
at this point.

366
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,555
I can't be a part of this.

367
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,414
Thank you.

368
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,338
I always wondered exactly what
was on the other side.

369
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,467
Nothing.

370
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,544
What are you doing?

371
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,588
Getting a laryngoscope.

372
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,343
Don't just stand there, help!

373
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,429
But you told him that...

374
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,304
A little something
I like to call a lie.

375
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:55,225
It's bad, I know, but it's way further
down the list than murder.

376
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,236
He's unconscious.
No more whining.

377
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,155
We can keep testing him.

378
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,245
Go get a ventilator.
I'm not gonna do this all night.

379
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,462
We can legally assume
that he'd consent

380
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,923
to whatever a reasonable person
would consent to.

381
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,802
And a reasonable person would
obviously consent to being put

382
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:34,389
in a coma against their will
just to satisfy your curiosity?

383
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,059
I try to kill him, you're mad.
I don't kill him, you're mad.

384
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,519
All he wanted was some dignity.

385
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,895
Were you in that room with him?

386
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,440
Was he wearing a tux while he
was choking on his own plasma?

387
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:50,155
Keep doing the tests. Take your time.
Do it right. Go! Get to work.

388
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,824
Wait!

389
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,331
Cameron, why did you do these cuts
so far down on this MRI of his head?

390
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,958
I wanted to get his brain stem
and his C-spine

391
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,960
to make sure his diaphragm
wasn't paralyzed.

392
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,630
You also caught the top of his lungs.
There's scarring.

393
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,760
You do know that you can't really pierce
me with your stares.

394
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:16,514
Lung scarring along with the bad bone
marrow points to an autoimmune disease.

395
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,683
- Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
- Or lupus.

396
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,685
He can kill himself
after we get him better.

397
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,563
Start him on an MG
for the lupus and get a colonoscopy.

398
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,815
The lupus could be
hiding there.

399
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,157
I can't do this.

400
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,329
Drama queen.

401
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,582
Descending colon's clean.

402
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,710
Moving into the sigmoid...

403
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,088
We sure could use
a little more help around here.

404
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,840
She's doing what
she believes in.

405
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,427
Yeah, if she was acting on principle,
she'd be in here trying to stop us.

406
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,721
All she's doing is
running away from the principle,

407
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,807
so she won't have to feel
uncomfortable facing it.

408
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,099
And if you were
acting on principle,

409
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,059
you would have called the cops

410
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,895
when you thought House
was killing the guy.

411
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,939
- We better hurry up.
- Why?

412
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,024
'Cause I don't think she's
gonna have a problem

413
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,777
deciding what to tell Cuddy.

414
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,405
02 sats, 89 and dropping.

415
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,872
I thought you were only
supposed to put on

416
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,680
a pound a week
during your last trimester.

417
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,876
I'm not pregnant.

418
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,504
I heard about
your little stunt with Dr. Powell.

419
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,799
Not really a stunt.
More of a trick. A ruse, a hoodwink.

420
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,467
- A lie.
- Okay.

421
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,928
Lying is sometimes good, right?

422
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,723
Like when you're trying to teach someone
a lesson about humility or something.

423
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,601
All I'm trying to do is save his life.
He's not gonna learn anything.

424
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,978
I just thought
the same principle might apply.

425
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,354
It does.

426
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,731
I could have just let him die.

427
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,775
We're not gonna get sued
for keeping him alive.

428
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,778
We could.
I completely disregarded his wishes.

429
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,240
Do you want me to disagree with you?
You want me to yell at you?

430
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,366
It is comforting.

431
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,786
We're doctors.
We treat patients, we don't kill them.

432
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,330
How right you are, Dr. Cuddy!

433
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,625
We also don't pad our bills,
swipe samples from the pharmacy,

434
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,628
or fantasize about the teenage daughters
of our patients, either.

435
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,798
True. It better be true,
and you're a pig.

436
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,136
I'm sorry about your leg.

437
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,848
Yeah. We really should
spend some time talking about that.

438
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,933
The MG made him worse.

439
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,768
02 sats plummeted.

440
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,313
So we know it's not lupus.

441
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,814
What else could it be?

442
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,066
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

443
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,278
We're gonna need
an open lung biopsy to confirm.

444
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,364
So now we're gonna
operate on the guy?

445
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,660
Well, unless you've invented
a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.

446
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,915
When you searched
Dr. Powell's office,

447
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,836
did you find a copy of the January 1967
Massachusetts Medical Journal?

448
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:52,795
Why?

449
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,839
I just figured
if you're not doing any work,

450
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,425
you might like something
to pass the time.

451
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,552
The centerfold's a killer.

452
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,026
How's your leg?

453
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,612
It hurts. And it's gonna
keep on hurting.

454
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,740
- You gonna keep on asking?
- How's Ezra Powell?

455
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,409
Resting comfortably.

456
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,828
That's not what Cameron says.

457
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,789
I hate practicing medicine
in high school.

458
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,667
He's not asking you to help him kill
himself. He's just asking for help.

459
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,086
The disease will kill him.

460
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,630
I know what he was asking for.
I just said, "No."

461
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,007
You've done it before,
plenty of times.

462
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,801
To patients that I knew
were terminal.

463
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:40,927
Oh, give me a break.

464
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,346
This has nothing to do
with saving a life.

465
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,847
You just can't bear
the thought of a patient dying

466
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,933
before you've been able to
figure out why.

467
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,228
If we're gonna keep refusing
to cure patients just to rein in my ego,

468
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,995
then we might start having a little
problem in patient recruitment.

469
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,150
Worried about meeting
your one-patient-a-week quota?

470
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,238
I'm a cripple, remember?
Accommodations must be made.

471
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,292
Wedge of left lobe isolated,
and removed.

472
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,754
Clamp.

473
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,051
Why'd you have me
look up that article?

474
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,298
Did you find it interesting?

475
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,596
He injected newborn babies
with radioactive agents

476
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,515
just to see
if they had urethral reflux.

477
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,724
He was curious.

478
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,251
He didn't even tell their parents
he was doing an experiment.

479
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,190
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

480
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,481
His peers at Tuskegee
and Willowbrook?

481
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,067
He ignored the rights of a few
to save many.

482
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,944
So you're okay
with what he did?

483
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,029
It doesn't matter what I think.

484
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,240
It's what you think
that's relevant.

485
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,870
Because if I think
less of him, I'll help you more?

486
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,874
You're wrong.

487
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,043
The fact that a patient did bad things
doesn't change anything.

488
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,921
He still deserves to
have some control over his own body.

489
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,591
If he had control
over his own body, he'd be dead.

490
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,886
Some control. We can withhold
treatment without killing him.

491
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,138
No, you can't!

492
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:11,851
You either help him live or you help
him die. You can't have it both ways.

493
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,566
Well, I guess it's not IPF.

494
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,739
Maybe he'll die right now,
make everything easy for all of us.

495
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,079
- Heart rate's fast.
- BP's low.

496
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,811
No breath sounds on the right side.
He's dropped his right lung.

497
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,588
Air's building up in his chest,
compressing his heart.

498
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,809
Heart rate's decreasing.

499
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,811
BP's stabilizing.

500
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,917
What are you doing?

501
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,385
He withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side but not the right.

502
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,011
Those are just reflex arcs.

503
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,346
He's under anesthesia.

504
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,890
Or he's lost sensation
in some places.

505
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,935
Or the hypoxia from the arrest
stunned his CNS.

506
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,604
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

507
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,232
We can't do that
while he's in a coma.

508
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,819
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer
and check his deep tendon reflexes.

509
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,030
It won't work. He needs muscle relaxants
to be on the ventilator.

510
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,741
Only one more way to tell.
Pupillary reflexes.

511
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,286
- All that tests is the brain stem.
- See, I was right.

512
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,038
Only one way to tell.
Do somatosensory evoked potentials.

513
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,207
I just said, we can't do that
while he's in a coma.

514
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,959
So wake him up.

515
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,934
Don't go towards the light.

516
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,938
You'll fall and break your hip.

517
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,965
What's happening? I...

518
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,886
You took a little nap.

519
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,891
I thought I told you
I didn't want...

520
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,934
Sorry. A little deaf
in one ear.

521
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,562
Your bone marrow
is hypocellular.

522
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,982
We've ruled out lupus
and pulmonary fibrosis.

523
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,069
But it looks like it could be
attacking your nerves.

524
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:12,031
So this is all a waste?
A huge failure?

525
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,370
Impossible.
You're Gregory House.

526
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,664
We need to attach some sensors
to your skin.

527
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:20,706
No.

528
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,541
Look, we can't
do what you want.

529
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,419
We've assigned a nurse to watch you,
so you can't do it either.

530
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,129
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

531
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,006
No. I want to be discharged.

532
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,093
You can't be discharged.
You've got two chest tubes in.

533
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,260
Then take them out!

534
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,012
Oh, get over yourself.

535
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,973
The ventilator puffed up your lungs.
You'll be fine for a few hours.

536
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,101
Just let us run the tests.

537
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,813
Okay.

538
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,150
But first,
let's clean you up a little.

539
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,905
- What...
- Does that feel nice?

540
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,192
- What are you trying to prove?
- Just cleaning him up.

541
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,034
What does it look like?

542
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,996
Pay no attention
to the man behind the curtain.

543
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,626
Get out!

544
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,755
Okay, I'm going already.
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

545
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,218
Okay, so you've got me curious.

546
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,386
I was right.

547
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,847
Whatever is attacking his lungs
is attacking his nerves.

548
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,598
And you got that by
splashing ice water on him?

549
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,560
No sensation in the left leg,
abdomen, right arm.

550
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,853
Technology's overrated.

551
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,659
That means the clean MRI
of his brain means

552
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,412
it's just affecting
the peripheral nerves.

553
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,524
And bone marrow.

554
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,151
Kawasaki's would explain
the kidney failure.

555
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,361
- So would lymphoma.
- So would sarcoidosis.

556
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,573
All potentially treatable.
The question is which?

557
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,576
We need to catch
the little bastards in the act.

558
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,702
What's the largest organ?

559
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,037
- Skin.
- We need to get a piece.

560
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,750
Sure. We'll just wait until he leaves
his room without his skin,

561
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,877
sneak in and take a piece.

562
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,839
I want you to get
a skin sample for a biopsy.

563
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,216
And I want to get a foot massage
from Johnny Damon.

564
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,304
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis are all treatable.

565
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,974
And it could be a hundred other things
that aren't treatable. You have no idea.

566
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,392
But you do.

567
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,443
- You know everything.
- I didn't say that I...

568
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,645
Exactly!

569
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,149
You can't decide if we're helping
or hurting him.

570
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:14,820
If it's good or bad, or if you want
paper, plastic, or a burlap sack.

571
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,115
Do your damn job.

572
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,536
I'm not gonna lie to him.

573
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,669
Fine. Tell the truth.
Just get me a pound of flesh.

574
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,637
What do you want?

575
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,973
House wants to biopsy your skin.
He sent me to get it.

576
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,141
And you agreed?

577
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,895
I had nothing to do with putting you in
a coma or any of the subsequent tests.

578
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,688
Which brings us to now.

579
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,565
I read some of your articles.

580
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,026
There were a lot of them.

581
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,781
1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal.

582
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:04,078
You radiated babies, just like that.
No forms, no questions, nothing.

583
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,872
Who knows how many cancers
you caused?

584
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,290
I don't know.

585
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,210
But what I do know is,
we discovered techniques that

586
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,714
prevent fatal kidney failures
in hundreds of thousands of other kids.

587
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,383
You're not sorry.

588
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,426
I don't regret what I did.

589
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:24,348
Informed consent, patient rights...
Holds back research.

590
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,230
What the hell are you doing?

591
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,400
Informed consent
is holding back our diagnosis.

592
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,777
Good for you.

593
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,950
Finally standing up for something.
Acting on what you believe.

594
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,876
Dr. House? Hi. How are you?

595
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,919
Not as good as you think I am.

596
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,422
Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
My dad just lost his medicine.

597
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,215
I needed to come back
for another prescription.

598
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,800
Yeah, right.

599
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,635
He's moving it
on the street, isn't he?

600
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,555
Yeah, my dad, the meth kingpin.

601
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,643
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls?

602
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,856
I plan to in a couple of years.

603
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:17,818
I was just calling to say thank you
and to tell you how impressed I was.

604
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,737
You diagnosed my dad
by just looking at him.

605
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,489
I felt his glands, too.

606
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,328
Well, there's my dad.
I've got to go.

607
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,163
Yeah, me, too.

608
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,083
And, you really don't have to wait
a couple of years to return my calls.

609
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,794
Just six months,
till I turn 18.

610
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,100
It's not Kawasaki's either.
What's next?

611
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,477
Congo red.

612
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,937
Amyloidosis?

613
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,022
What the hell else
would I mean by Congo red?

614
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,106
It's not on the list.

615
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,650
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

616
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,778
An abnormal protein is building up
inside the cells of his body,

617
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,264
shutting down his organs one by one.
It explains everything.

618
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,991
The infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow, kidney failure.

619
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,703
We rejected amyloidosis because it
didn't fit the first symptom we found.

620
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,955
- It would affect his heart.
- It did.

621
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,247
It wasn't on the stress test.

622
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,083
We didn't push him hard enough.

623
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,669
Add the stain
and let's find out.

624
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,713
Congo red added.

625
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:23,384
Change the polarization
of the light already.

626
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,477
That means
it should be treatable.

627
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:34,937
How the hell did you
pull that out of...

628
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,356
Not out of mine. I had a muse.

629
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:44,905
Oh, God. Protein type AA.

630
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,882
Dr. House...

631
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,509
You have amyloidosis.

632
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,722
It's in your lungs, kidneys,
bone marrow and brain.

633
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,642
Why should I believe you now?

634
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,109
If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you
the sub-type is AA.

635
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,863
It's terminal.

636
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,742
Congratulations.

637
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,038
You got your answer.

638
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,134
Ezra Powell
passed away last night.

639
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,469
I'm sure you already
knew about that.

640
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,555
No, I just got in.

641
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,306
The nurse charted at 2:00 a.m.

642
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,934
He was stable,
breathing labored but regular.

643
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,688
Then, at 2:30, he suddenly stopped.
You know anything about that?

644
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,691
If I did, would you
really want to know?

645
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,266
I'm proud of you.
