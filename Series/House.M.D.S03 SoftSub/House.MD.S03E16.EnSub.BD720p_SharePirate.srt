1
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,263
- Take it, Sarge. Take it.
- Oh, I'll take it.

2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,899
Yeah.

3
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,118
Yo! Yo! Turn that back on.

4
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,369
Yeah, man, what'd you do?

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,496
Don't look at me, 'cause you know I
didn't do it. All right?

6
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,124
Hey! You better have put fresh batteries
in that thing like I told you.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,085
No. I did, Sarge. Right when
you gave them to me. I did.

8
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,088
- I put them in.
- Well, then hit it or something.

9
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,133
Otherwise you all
are gonna have to listen to me sing!

10
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,002
Here.

11
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,967
Don't panic.
Don't shoot us. Don't die.

12
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,928
You got it, G?

13
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,144
Go! Go! Go!

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,660
Up and at them.

15
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,914
You're supposed to
be in clinic duty.

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,918
Yeah, like I can sleep down there with
all the crying and coughing.

17
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,586
Here.

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,464
Ex-Marine thinks
he has Gulf War syndrome.

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,217
- There's no such thing.
- So he's been told.

20
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:18,596
It hasn't stopped the unexplained
fatigue, rashes and joint pain.

21
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,808
And just so you know, he's the nephew
of a benefactor I owe a favor,

22
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,644
so you're gonna take this case
whether you like it or not.

23
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,146
Why wouldn't I want
to take the case?

24
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,234
The guy's tired and sore.
It's gonna be chapter one in my...

25
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,952
Don't panic.
Don't shoot us. Don't die.

26
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,498
You know him?

27
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,959
Never met him
before in my life.

28
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,879
Okay. Well, you're about to.
He's on his way here.

29
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,341
Get your ass up and get your team
together. You have work to do.

30
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,514
- That's amazing.
- No, it's not.

31
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,435
- It's not?
- I can play the harmonica with my nose,

32
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,314
make a penny come out of a child's ear,
or any other orifice for that matter,

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,109
and given the right circumstances can
bring two women to simultaneous ecstasy.

34
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,361
The right circumstances
being their agreement

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,887
to bill you on
the same credit card.

36
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,866
But what I absolutely cannot do
is dream about someone

37
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,701
I've never seen before.

38
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,455
Well, just because you don't understand
it doesn't mean it can't happen.

39
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,125
True. It can't happen
because it can't happen!

40
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,504
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

41
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,674
Right. Just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

42
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,218
No. You imagined
some generic Marine,

43
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,680
then you placed his face
in the dream after you saw the picture.

44
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,350
Sort of a coincidence mixed
with a little déjà vu.

45
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,852
There's no record
of him ever coming into the clinic,

46
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,771
so I must've seen him
before somewhere else.

47
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,023
Fine. You've known him
since Cub Scouts.

48
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,360
The more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed, but why.

49
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,948
I'm guessing you're longing for either
a renewed relationship with your dad,

50
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,534
or a new relationship
with one of the Village People.

51
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,578
He was in the Navy,
not the Marines.

52
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,122
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

53
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,916
The guy in the Village People.

54
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,127
Actually he's only in the Navy
when they sing In the Navy.

55
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,339
The rest of the time
he's just in generic fatigue.

56
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,008
What?

57
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,177
You brought it up!

58
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,723
- You didn't flush.
- I didn't pee.

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,690
Male, 34, just got out of the Marines
after two years in Iraq.

60
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,275
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

61
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,737
joint pains, intermittent rashes
and sore throats.

62
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,531
Thinks he has
Gulf War syndrome.

63
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,032
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,202
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to avoid fellating,

65
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,372
who doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis
of nothingswrongatosis.

66
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,665
The VA's right.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,542
There's no such thing
as Gulf War syndrome,

68
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,988
especially in veterans
who've never served in the Gulf War.

69
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,379
Different war, same place.

70
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,048
Whatever was there
in 1990 is still there.

71
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,925
What's there can send you home
in a pine box

72
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,219
but it can't make you sick three months
after you've gotten home.

73
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,306
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about their symptoms?

74
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,518
You send 700,000 people
on a vacation to Hawaii,

75
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,519
some are gonna come back sick.

76
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,979
Doesn't mean it was
caused by snorkeling.

77
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:55,980
He's right.

78
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,190
The studies all show the same pattern
of symptoms in veterans

79
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,568
who were sent to the Gulf
and those who weren't.

80
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,652
That's it?

81
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,237
You believe her but not me?

82
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,114
Stick to your guns, Chase.

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,283
Just 'cause there isn't
a single unifying symptom

84
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,909
doesn't mean there isn't
something going on.

85
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,676
It could just affect
everyone differently.

86
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,621
You think this guy has
Gulf War syndrome?

87
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,081
Of course not.

88
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,584
He's depressed
and he's looking for a disability check,

89
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,670
most likely because he's just realized
that knowing how to barter for sex

90
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,590
in six languages and open a beer bottle
with your eye socket

91
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,467
are not the most
marketable skills.

92
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,426
Why did you take this case?

93
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,470
'Cause a good scientist
continually questions

94
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,638
his own theories
and assumptions.

95
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,600
- Cuddy's making him.
- And now I'm making you.

96
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,644
Do a full physical and recheck
his blood for HIV, hep C,

97
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,481
malaria, schistosomiasis,
and T strain A. Baumannii,

98
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,691
just to make sure
the VA's dotted their I's.

99
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,277
And find out every hospital and clinic
he's ever visited,

100
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,616
every city he's ever lived in
and whether he's ever been on TV.

101
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,825
TV?

102
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,078
Problem could be neurological.

103
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,955
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

104
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,502
Well, it's usually the worst
on my palms and the bottom of my feet.

105
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,671
I get these
black dots all over.

106
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,549
- I don't see anything.
- It comes and goes.

107
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,427
You're sure it's not
just scrapes and bruises?

108
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,014
I know the difference between
a rash and a bruise.

109
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,767
Sometimes it's harder than you realize
to distinguish between the two.

110
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,519
You obviously exercise.

111
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,312
My problems aren't caused
by my workouts.

112
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,730
But you do work out.

113
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,649
And by the look of you,
pretty strenuously.

114
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,776
That's not usually
the case with patients

115
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,403
whose principal complaint
is chronic fatigue and joint pain.

116
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,157
I was in the Marines for 12 years.
I'm used to doing PT every day.

117
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,004
Just because I can push through the pain
doesn't mean it's not there.

118
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,703
We're not saying
we don't believe you.

119
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,372
The hell you aren't.

120
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,959
We just need to be specific about
what exactly the problems are.

121
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,047
I sleep 10 hours a night
but I feel tired all the time.

122
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,217
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

123
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,345
My knees and hips feel like someone
poured sand in my joints.

124
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,681
Get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

125
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,977
Sometimes they're cold. Other times,
feels like my blood is boiling.

126
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,354
Specific enough?

127
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,109
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it.

128
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,071
Gulf War syndrome, Iraq fever,
or just crappy sickness X.

129
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,159
I just want someone to figure out what
it is so they can cure it.

130
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,495
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,206
none of the other symptoms he's
complaining about are currently evident.

132
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,458
And besides low potassium,
probably caused by him

133
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,335
over-hydrating
after working out.

134
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,582
His blood work's all normal.

135
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,507
Low potassium could also probably be
caused by the experimental vaccines

136
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,927
and anti-chemical warfare pills he was
given before he deployed to Iraq.

137
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,721
Not to mention the fact
that whole country is littered

138
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,306
with hundreds of tons
of radioactive shrapnel

139
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,600
from depleted uranium munitions.

140
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,976
You go to medical school in France?

141
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,853
There's no trace of uranium in his
urine.

142
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,105
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

143
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,482
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

144
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,693
Has he ever done any modeling?

145
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,653
We forgot to ask.

146
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,697
We should send his urine to
the University of Leicester.

147
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,781
There's a professor there
who's developed

148
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,909
a more advanced
screening technique for uranium.

149
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,869
If the levels are too low
for us to detect,

150
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,164
they're way too low to cause any damage.

151
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,541
Where are you going?

152
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,168
This way.

153
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,004
You find out about any television
or other media exposure?

154
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,340
Do you really care or are you just
trying to waste hospital resources

155
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,592
to get back at Cuddy
for making you take the case?

156
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,260
Of course, I care.

157
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,554
What a horrible thing to say.

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,182
Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy
of his credit report.

159
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,809
Before or after we
tell him to eat a banana

160
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,269
and discharge him with a psych referral?

161
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,479
I say before.

162
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,398
And I say in between
give him a polysomnogram.

163
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,985
Sleep apnea could cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

164
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,821
And find out where he went
to summer camp.

165
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,243
You okay?

166
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,329
Yeah. Just a little too
much coffee this morning.

167
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,332
Were we walking you to
the bathroom?

168
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,291
I wish.

169
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,838
Wilson was just in there.
These guys know what I'm talking about.

170
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,053
That's his third REM cycle and
his breathing's completely normal.

171
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,340
There's obviously nothing wrong
with his sleep pattern.

172
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,100
If it's not the uranium, it's got
to be some other sort of toxin.

173
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,434
Or nothing at all.

174
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,894
You really think there's something
wrong,

175
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,021
or you just want Foreman to be wrong?

176
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,147
Both.

177
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,857
Well, it's not
his sleep pattern.

178
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,944
If you really think it's a toxin, you
can do a liver biopsy in the morning.

179
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,153
We can't leave.

180
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,948
If we don't monitor the whole test,
House won't accept the results.

181
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,484
He'll just make us do it over.

182
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,617
It doesn't take two doctors
to monitor

183
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,578
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

184
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,039
Oh, so you want me to stay?

185
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,541
You're the one that thought
there was something wrong.

186
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,376
I never said
it was a sleep disorder.

187
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,336
You wanna flip for it?

188
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,048
Just go.

189
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,927
Oh, come on. Don't be a baby.

190
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,057
Fine. I'll stay.

191
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,232
You know what we could do?

192
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,905
- Here?
- Why not?

193
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,033
We're surrounded by
empty rooms with beds in them.

194
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,535
Yeah. And video cameras, too.

195
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,701
- So we turn them off.
- Yeah, that's all I need is.

196
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,247
House or Foreman
walking in on us.

197
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,082
We have the keys.

198
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,378
No. What if he wakes up?

199
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,629
All right.

200
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,969
Suit yourself.

201
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,573
Damn it.

202
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,331
Hello? Is anybody out there?

203
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,460
I think there's
a problem in here!

204
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,048
What's wrong?

205
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,592
What do you mean, "What's wrong?"
You don't smell that?

206
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,927
Nothing smells, John.

207
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,346
Oh, are you kidding me?
It's disgusting.

208
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,349
How long have
you thought... Wait.

209
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,352
Open your mouth.

210
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,192
The smell's not in the room.
It's in your mouth.

211
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,405
What's going on?

212
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,490
Good question.

213
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,696
What?

214
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,532
You were wrong about
the nothingswrongatosis.

215
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,242
You can fake fatigue
and joint pain,

216
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,037
but you can't fake
bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.

217
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,121
Where's his mouth been?

218
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,567
Says he hasn't performed
oral sex on anyone in over a year.

219
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,709
Selfish bastard.

220
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,879
Because he hasn't been with anyone since
his last girlfriend dumped him

221
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,672
after he deployed to Iraq
the second time.

222
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,132
Selfish bitch.

223
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,553
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes
and any other endocrine abnormality.

224
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,840
Could be autoimmune.
Sjögren's decreases salivary flow,

225
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,641
creates a hospitable
home for bacteria.

226
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,351
No. His eyes and tear ducts
are fine.

227
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,852
Who was his last girlfriend?

228
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,147
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

229
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,318
Chronic fatigue, joint pain and
opportunistic infection spells cancer.

230
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,903
Probably lymphoma.

231
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,156
We should biopsy his
tonsillarand submandibular lymph nodes.

232
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,575
Right about cancer,
wrong about lymphoma.

233
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,037
Unless you're simply hiding the fact
that his lymphnodes are swollen.

234
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:36,250
Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary
glands. He's got parotid cancer.

235
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,544
And see if you can get to the truth
about who he's been dating.

236
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,256
No way, a Marine goes a year without
getting some bloodon his bayonet.

237
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,216
It's not an STD.
You just said...

238
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,425
Just do it.

239
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,473
The antibiotics should
at least relieve the infection,

240
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,892
which will reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

241
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,477
Not soon enough.

242
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,151
All right.
You're gonna feel a little burn.

243
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,904
You know I never even dipped?

244
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,283
Chewing tobacco.
Practically everyone in my unit did it.

245
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,953
But me. I was so paranoid
about cancer.

246
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,458
Well, if it's parotid cancer,
it's very treatable if diagnosed early.

247
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:23,505
My mom had cancer, which is why I know
that diagnosing cancer early

248
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,008
means before
there's any serious symptoms.

249
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,725
Certainly tastes like a pretty serious
symptom, you know?

250
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,227
We'll know more after the test.

251
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,314
If he was just trying to
mess with Cuddy for wasting his time,

252
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,107
this would have stopped as
soon as the patient started

253
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,358
exhibiting actual symptoms.

254
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,111
So the question is,
why is he wasting our time?

255
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,654
Or is he wasting our time?

256
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,824
You think he's got a medical reason for
asking for the guy's credit report?

257
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,200
I don't.

258
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,329
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

259
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,459
We just stepped out
for a second.

260
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,210
To do what?

261
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,006
To get a coffee.
We'd been up most of the night.

262
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,467
He's just pushing to make sure
we have a complete history.

263
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,137
Obviously we're missing
something or we'd have the answer.

264
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,223
You didn't have any coffee
when you came back.

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,810
All right already.
We confess. You caught us.

266
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,812
We snuck into one of
the sleep lab rooms to have sex.

267
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,458
We shouldn't have done it
while we were working and we're sorry.

268
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,359
Now can we move on?

269
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,364
House would do Wilson
before you'd do Chase.

270
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,284
No. You would do House and Wilson
before I'd do Chase.

271
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,995
Now can we get back to work?

272
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,163
She did me once.

273
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,916
She was stoned!

274
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,805
Biopsy's inconclusive.

275
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,973
I'm gonna do a sialogram while we wait
for results

276
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,058
from the additional blood work.

277
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,226
No hurry.

278
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,019
Probably nothing we can do
at this point anyway.

279
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,625
As long as
the cancer hasn't spread...

280
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,108
He's spitting stink.
You should focus on the living.

281
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,277
I need a prescription.

282
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,154
I just wrote you
a prescription.

283
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,824
For Vicodin. I need alfuzosin.

284
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,617
No, you don't.

285
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,453
You figured out
where you met your Marine?

286
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,663
What?

287
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, that. Haven't really
thought about it.

288
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,961
I can't pee.

289
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,421
You can't remember him,
can you?

290
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,131
I can't pee.

291
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,799
So stop taking the Vicodin.

292
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,009
I want to pee
and not be in pain.

293
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,720
Why don't you go to sleep?

294
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,179
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

295
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,349
Maybe you'll dream about him
again. Maybe he'll give you an address.

296
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,809
I haven't peed in three days.

297
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,812
I read that REM sleep is
the brain's way of working out problems.

298
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,779
- Very useful.
- Did you hear what I just said?

299
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,067
Yeah. You lied because you want to avoid
talking about your obsession.

300
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,695
- I'm not obsessing.
- Why don't you just ask him?

301
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,322
- I haven't peed in three days!
- You'd be dead.

302
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,408
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

303
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,701
You'd be in agony.

304
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,287
I passed agony
yesterday around 4:00.

305
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,307
His mother, brother,
uncle and best friend

306
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,809
all confirm he hasn't had
a date in over a year.

307
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,394
Which means it's not an STD.

308
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,064
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

309
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,625
What did you want me
to tell him? The truth?

310
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,242
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

311
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,578
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to you.

312
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,457
This is getting out of control.

313
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,708
Don't pout.

314
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:51,338
Our patient woke up with an infection
while we were getting our rocks off.

315
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
Do you want to stop?

316
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:55,884
No.

317
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,720
But I don't want to
get caught, either.

318
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,971
You think I do?

319
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,953
You certainly didn't go out of your way
to keep the volume down

320
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,259
when we were in the sleep lab.

321
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,102
I couldn't help that.

322
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,524
Why would I want to get caught?

323
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,985
Maybe you want to give House
a reason to be jealous.

324
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:15,946
I'm over House.

325
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,283
All this is, is uncomplicated sex.
Don't try to make it more than that.

326
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,119
We're not doing it
at work anymore.

327
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,955
Fine.

328
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,550
Wanna go grab some lunch?

329
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,473
I think the pill
is the way to go.

330
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,475
We haven't had
a condom break yet. Thank God.

331
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,521
But it's bound to happen,
especially the way we've been doing it.

332
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,358
- On a bed of nails?
- No.

333
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,445
He's not kinky.
He's just insatiable.

334
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,574
I can barely make it
to any of my morning classes.

335
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,452
- You smoke?
- No way.

336
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,830
Stop it!

337
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,665
Sorry.

338
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,045
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

339
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,132
Nope. Besides my OCD,
I'm fit as a fiddle.

340
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,013
- You have OCD?
- Can't you tell?

341
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,391
Any other compulsions besides drinking
massive amounts of water?

342
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,143
No, that's it. Thank God.

343
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,478
My therapist says
it could be a lot worse.

344
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,314
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

345
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,107
Yeah. Every couple of hours.

346
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,068
Then your therapist
is an idiot.

347
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,446
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

348
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,740
They can, whoever,
have diabetes insipidus.

349
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,784
That's impossible.
I eat candy all the time.

350
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,413
Different kind of diabetes. This kind is
caused by banged up pituitary.

351
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,540
You're obviously more of
a lover than a fighter.

352
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,987
I'm guessing either
a car accident

353
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,337
or you cracked your
skull on the balance beam.

354
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,548
How'd you know?

355
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:03,011
Easy. Nice ass. No boobs. And you've got
palms like a longshoreman.

356
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,180
Wait here. You need a CAT scan.

357
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,432
- Oh, my God...
- Don't worry.

358
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,353
Just means you'll be taking
two hormone supplements instead of one.

359
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,277
Okay, this time
you're gonna feel a little pressure.

360
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,446
We're injecting
the contrast material.

361
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,492
Could you turn up the music?

362
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,868
Sure.

363
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,792
Looks pretty good so far.

364
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,419
Still can't hear it that well.

365
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,217
Can you hear it now?

366
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,219
John?

367
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,097
John!

368
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,517
John, can you hear me?

369
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,191
Still no relief?

370
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,859
I got relief.

371
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,695
I just got no pee.

372
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,406
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

373
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,950
You didn't come here
to talk to me about my pee.

374
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,576
What's going on?

375
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,162
He's got cancer all right.

376
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,499
But it's not in his salivary glands.
It's in his brain.

377
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,295
And it's bad.
At least six tumors. Maybe more.

378
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,592
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

379
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,512
Death is probably next.

380
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,268
No way he could've
grown all these in a week.

381
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,396
They can't be older.
The VA couldn't have missed all these.

382
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,815
Maybe they didn't miss them.
Just mixed them up.

383
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,985
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

384
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,278
Maybe.

385
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,031
It'd mean some poor sap's
getting his melon sliced

386
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,407
at the VA for no reason.

387
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,910
And this poor sergeant's
gonna be dead by the end of the week.

388
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,704
Where've you two been?

389
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,955
Lunch.

390
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,498
Why? What happened?

391
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,794
Wilson's found some fast-growing,
elusive or magic brain tumors.

392
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,421
What did you find?

393
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,798
Nothing.
He's telling the truth.

394
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,175
About what?

395
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,384
About everything.

396
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,053
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

397
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,305
Besides forgetting to mention
his dad's shin splints,

398
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,725
his granddad's nosebleeds,
and to return a few rented DVDs,

399
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,685
everything he's told us
has checked out.

400
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,937
You have them
researching your dream?

401
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,815
No. I have them
researching my patient.

402
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,776
You had a dream
about a patient?

403
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,528
This poor guy's brain
is riddled with tumors

404
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,364
and you're checking his credit report?

405
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,745
Come on. I need you guys.

406
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,289
- Where are you going?
- To do my job.

407
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,749
He's not your patient.

408
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,959
He is now.
Go home and go to sleep.

409
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,921
Maybe you'll dream a cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

410
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,473
How is he?

411
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,433
He's dead.

412
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,145
- Oh, God.
- At least he will be in a few days.

413
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,857
Question is why.

414
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,152
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

415
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,280
There was definitely
no mix up. I had them recheck.

416
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,785
Yes. Why would a government agency lie
to cover up a mistake

417
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,328
that might have caused
the death of a guy

418
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,497
they'd been trying to kill
for the last two years anyway?

419
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,374
They didn't lie.

420
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,752
Did you just take two Vicodin?

421
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,921
No. Just an antidepressant.

422
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,258
I was told to take two every time
you walked into the room.

423
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,222
The VA's scan of his brain.
No tumors.

424
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:39,727
Yes. This is proof positive that someone
didn't have tumors in their brain.

425
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,230
You see that bright spot
below his left orbit?

426
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,692
That is a titanium pin your patient
had inserted 20 years ago.

427
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,028
Unless you think the VA happened to mix
up his scans with someone

428
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,282
who had the exact same pin,
they didn't screw up.

429
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,204
You paged us?

430
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,333
Why didn't you send his urine
to Leicester like I told you?

431
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,669
Because you told me not to.

432
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,380
Why did you choose that moment
to listen to me?

433
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,267
You think depleted uranium might have
something to do with his tumors?

434
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,385
Radiation's the only thing
that will make tumors grow that fast.

435
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,137
High doses of radiation!

436
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,383
Even if he ate
depleted uranium bullets for breakfast,

437
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,057
he still would've been exposed
to less radiation

438
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,642
than we've given him
in the last two days.

439
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,813
Do it anyway.
And you, call his uncle back.

440
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,567
Find out if he ever brought his nephew
to any hospital parties or fundraisers.

441
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,986
No. Not until
you give me a reason.

442
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,781
- Because I'm your boss?
- A rational reason.

443
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,992
Or at least admit
that you don't have one.

444
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,198
I've got a full bladder
and I'm not afraid to use it.

445
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,954
But you are apparently afraid

446
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,281
of discovering something you can't
rationally explain...

447
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,374
Shut up!

448
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,294
Do what you're told.

449
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,007
Cuddy and Wilson may not have
to listen to me, but you do.

450
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,430
What the hell
was that all about?

451
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,598
I don't care.

452
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,564
Which is why I didn't feel the need to
ask him eight personal questions.

453
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,269
I'm over him.

454
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,857
Just making an observation.

455
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,446
All right.
Ready whenever you are.

456
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,864
I'm ready.

457
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,286
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

458
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,125
I don't see it. You sure you got
the right coordinates?

459
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,711
Yeah. She's in the right place.

460
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,423
Go 10 millimeters above the AC-PC line
on the Z axis.

461
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,009
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

462
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,763
It's not there anymore.

463
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,515
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

464
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,434
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- It's not there.

465
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,480
It disappeared.

466
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,440
Six tumors don't
just disappear.

467
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,359
Unless they were
never there to begin with.

468
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,111
The VA didn't screw up.

469
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,612
Maybe someone else did.

470
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,239
Maybe it was
Dr. Self-Righteous.

471
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,158
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix up.

472
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,577
Maybe there's something wrong with
the portable imager in the OR.

473
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,385
Something that would cause it
to show brain tissue in perfect detail

474
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,624
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

475
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,960
Then they were
never tumors to begin with.

476
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,295
I told you I saw...

477
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,882
Oh, you saw something that looked like
tumors. We all did. We were all wrong.

478
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,009
Or maybe he doesn't
have cancer.

479
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,695
Maybe he has a brain infection
that's causing multiple abscesses.

480
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,138
That miraculously healed?

481
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,784
No. They were healed
by the antibiotics

482
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,770
we're giving him for
the vaginosis in his mouth.

483
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,228
If it's an infection, why didn't it show
up in his blood work?

484
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,314
I don't know yet.

485
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,233
Dr. Wilson, we have a problem.

486
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,485
What did you do?

487
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,071
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

488
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,156
- John...
- What did you guys do?

489
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,574
John! Calm down!
We didn't even operate.

490
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,992
Could this be
a regional effect?

491
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,243
I can't move my legs!

492
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,329
It's not the anesthesia.

493
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,954
John! John!

494
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,497
We're gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

495
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,795
But first we need to know one thing,
have you ever appeared in any porn?

496
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,968
Chronic fatigue,
sore throats, rashes,

497
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,221
putrid discharge in the mouth,
multiple abscesses in the brain,

498
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:06,809
hearing loss, and last but not least,
lower limb paralysis.

499
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,811
He's certainly given us
plenty of clues.

500
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,356
It's got to be
some sort of infection.

501
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,483
That's miraculously improving
in his brain

502
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,234
but getting worse
in his ears and legs?

503
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,779
Could be an infection
and cancer.

504
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,448
A neoplastic syndrome
could depress his immune system

505
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,075
and cause the other symptoms.

506
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,494
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

507
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,120
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

508
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,748
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

509
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,583
And what are you gonna base
your theory on?

510
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,710
His favorite restaurants?

511
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,504
I was right.

512
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,799
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

513
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,802
We should start him on an IV infusion
of isotonic sodium bicarbonate...

514
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,345
It's not depleted uranium.

515
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,638
- You're the one...
- Who asked for the test

516
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,848
when we were thinking cancer.
We no longer are.

517
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,101
Depleted uranium doesn't just
cause cells to mutate.

518
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,519
It can cause
cell death as well.

519
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,229
Not spinal cord cells.

520
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,035
At least not before the dose
is high enough

521
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,816
to kill
all his other cells first.

522
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,486
So you're saying the radioactive uranium
in his urine is irrelevant.

523
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,614
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

524
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,783
This hospital is filled
with radiation.

525
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,744
The issue is not where it is,
but how much there is,

526
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,872
and what damage that amount can cause
in someone's spinal cord.

527
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,750
As I've already
stated quite clearly.

528
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,753
Got it. We're all idiots.
What's your theory?

529
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,672
Give me your keys. Why?

530
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,300
You ever tried to ride a motorcycle
with a distended bladder?

531
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,848
Keep him on antibiotics, check his
hearing and paralysis every hour.

532
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,891
So you basically
want us to do nothing?

533
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,935
No. I basically
want to do nothing.

534
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,562
I want you to
keep him on antibiotics

535
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,731
and check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

536
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,025
Wait. You can't go home now.

537
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,986
Actually, I have to
go home now.

538
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,196
It's two days past my bedtime.

539
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,115
House, he needs your help.

540
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,575
And I need sleep!

541
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,744
Hey, it's the brain's way
of working out problems

542
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,956
that the conscious mind can't solve
during the day, remember?

543
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,304
No. Nothing.

544
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,393
I'm gonna die. Aren't I?

545
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,774
No, we're not.

546
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,861
We should start treatment for
the uranium toxicity like you said.

547
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,738
- But House...
- Isn't here.

548
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,744
If House wanted to be
involved in the case...

549
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,706
he wanted us to
start this treatment,

550
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,958
he would have told us to do it
the last time you brought it up.

551
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,211
- You have a better idea?
- No.

552
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,171
Then we're going with Chase's.

553
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,614
Tell him not to
get the lines tangled.

554
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,220
With an infusion this slow
we can't have any kinks in the line.

555
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,118
I went to medical school, too.

556
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,375
Keep your arms on your body.
Above your heart.

557
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,672
I can't feel my stomach!

558
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,054
I don't feel that!
I don't feel anything!

559
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,639
Paralysis is ascending.

560
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,557
If it keeps going
we're gonna need a respirator.

561
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,518
- What? What are you saying?
- Can you breathe?

562
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,150
No. Not yet.

563
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,865
Incident on the Garden
State Parkway, southbound at exit 91...

564
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,034
So, where were we?

565
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,496
- You have a nice night?
- No.

566
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,333
The paralysis is ascending.

567
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,877
Last check it was
nearly to his diaphragm.

568
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,004
- Tells us something.
- Means it's getting worse.

569
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,840
Worse is something.

570
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,800
Also it tells us
it's not the uranium.

571
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,262
Did we think it was?

572
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,099
We started him on sodium bicarb to try
to flush the uranium out of his system.

573
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,436
Great. Now the fact that
he's getting worse tells us nothing.

574
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,854
Never thought it was uranium.

575
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,189
For all we know, the uranium treatment
is what's making him...

576
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,476
A sodium bicarb infusion
wouldn't have any effect on...

577
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,943
On what?

578
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,737
Kind of hard to say
what it wouldn't have an effect on

579
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,464
if you've no idea
what's there to affect.

580
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,209
- We had to do something.
- Well, next time,

581
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,082
go with something
that has a chance of working.

582
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,702
Like what?

583
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,871
You come up with some brilliant idea
while you're warm and cozy

584
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,748
- in your bed at home?
- We need more information.

585
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,333
How much more information
could you possibly want?

586
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,545
We have a medical history going all the
way back to his great grandparents.

587
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,423
- A non-medical history going...
- It's not enough.

588
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,008
It's all we're gonna get.

589
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,346
Wanna bet?

590
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,771
Who approved
a sodium bicarb infusion?

591
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,148
Don't look at me.
I was home in bed.

592
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,400
- What's wrong?
- He's unconscious.

593
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,862
His skin has lost all color and his BP
and hematocrit are plunging.

594
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,349
He was only on
the sodium bicarb...

595
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,281
He's bleeding out.

596
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,783
He can't be bleeding out.
There's no blood in the bed.

597
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,284
Fine. He's bleeding in.

598
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,036
There's no sign of bruising
or internal hemorrhaging.

599
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,882
The paralysis
must've reached his diaphragm.

600
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,331
He's not able to
oxygenate his blood.

601
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,375
He's not able to oxygenate his blood
because he doesn't have any left.

602
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,668
There's no evidence.

603
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,045
The only thing
that would explain...

604
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,004
There's no reason
for blood loss.

605
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,422
There has to be a reason!

606
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,175
He needs a transfusion.
Get me four units of O-negative, stat.

607
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,219
Let's elevate his feet.

608
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,013
He doesn't need a transfusion.

609
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,641
Nobody asked you.
In fact, why are you even here?

610
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,727
- Because obviously you need my help.
- Get out.

611
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,688
House, his blood obviously
didn't just vanish into...

612
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,193
What the hell is this?

613
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,320
Somebody must have
spilled something.

614
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,114
Somebody else should be getting me four
units of O-negative, stat.

615
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,116
What the hell is that?

616
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,623
It's a urine catheter
collection bag with a rip in it.

617
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,708
What the hell's it look like?

618
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,756
What?

619
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,261
It's just urine. It's sterile.

620
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,265
No one's getting me blood!
Why isn't anybody getting me blood?

621
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,474
You're bleeding.

622
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,728
House, are you all right?

623
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,900
Why are you even here?

624
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,570
I'm always here.

625
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,239
No, you're not.

626
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,326
There's a reason.
There has to be.

627
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,695
Incident on
the Garden State Parkway...

628
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,780
So, where were we?

629
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,575
Have a nice night?

630
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,410
Yes, I did. Thank you.

631
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,412
I'm guessing better
than our patient.

632
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,916
Probably due to his BP
and hematocrit plunging.

633
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,751
How'd you know?

634
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,179
The answer was staring
right at us the whole time.

635
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,681
As plain as
the nose on our faces.

636
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,141
And the nose on his face.

637
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,143
What's going on?
What did he say?

638
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,854
No hairs and
cauterization scars.

639
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,065
Which means?

640
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,985
- He had it cauterized.
- How could you know that?

641
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,032
Because it makes sense.

642
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,281
Undoubtedly done to stop
the same childhood nosebleeds

643
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,866
that plagued his grandfather.

644
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,553
Undoubtedly because they were both born

645
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,828
with hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia.

646
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,955
What's he saying?

647
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,291
I'm saying you have a genetic disease
that's destroying your capillaries.

648
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,877
That no one in his family's
ever been diagnosed with before?

649
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,505
Not surprising,
since the most common initial symptoms,

650
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,511
skin rashes and nosebleeds
are often written off

651
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,426
as the result of
minor trauma or dry weather.

652
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,180
But they can also be the result of his
arteries and veins merging together.

653
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,140
He obviously has AVMs.

654
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,850
AVM near the spine
caused the paralysis.

655
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,020
AVM in his lungs prevented
his blood from being filtered.

656
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,481
Dirty blood caused
the joint pain, fatigue,

657
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,650
and the infections
in his mouth and brain.

658
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,403
Nothing that a few surgeries
won't clear up.

659
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,364
Get MR angiograms
of the aforementioned.

660
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,783
The Marines weren't hiding
anything. He was.

661
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:51,578
Or at least he forgot
to mention his bloody tissue issue.

662
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,916
What's going on?
What did he say?

663
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:04,091
Well, looks like solving the case
solved your other problem.

664
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:08,012
There is no medicine
like happiness. Except maybe laughter.

665
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,306
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

666
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,475
You cathed yourself?

667
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,771
It's actually not that bad after the
first, I don't know, 9 or 10 inches.

668
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,649
The cath relieved the spasm.
I'm good as new.

669
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,651
Of course.
Just a minor spasm in a muscle

670
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,029
you've been using multiple times a day

671
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,948
without any problems
for the past 45 years.

672
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,074
Not a major side effect

673
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,953
caused by the overuse of a particular
narcotic painkiller.

674
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,872
Yeah. That was my thought, too.

675
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:39,001
So, no reason to think about
cutting back on your use

676
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,210
of that particular pill.

677
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,754
Thank God!

678
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,589
Actually, it was
the triple dose of the good stuff

679
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,509
that allowed me to finally get some
sleep and solve the case.

680
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,970
Pills made all my dreams
come true.

681
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,140
You really got the answer
in your sleep?

682
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,852
I got one in my sleep.
The other one I got in the shower.

683
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,235
I've been thinking about you.

684
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,113
You lied.

685
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,865
I didn't lie.

686
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,744
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

687
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,163
Like the fact that you lied.

688
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,916
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

689
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,251
You were practically
swallowing it on the dance floor.

690
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,711
I was not.

691
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,254
Talk about the cool uncle.

692
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,841
He donates the money
and the nephew gets the write-off.

693
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,302
And of course, by write-off,
I mean he gets to put your ankles...

694
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,348
This is exactly why I didn't mention
our one date over two years ago.

695
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,601
Because of my T-shirt.

696
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,937
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

697
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,272
Because you would have
spent the whole time...

698
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,357
That's very smart.

699
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,693
'Cause this way I spent the whole time
completely focused on the patient.

700
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,028
How did you even remember him?

701
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,995
We were only at that party
for like 10 minutes!

702
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,949
Is this a new health plan?

703
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,494
Service the Dean of Medicine, you get
free health care for a year?

704
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,081
Why are you smiling?

705
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,876
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

706
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,921
I'm good with faces.

707
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,841
So this plan,
is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?

708
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,259
You're lousy with faces.

709
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,387
Don't make this about me.
This is your humiliation.

710
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,097
So how much for
private room coverage?

711
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,558
Get over me.

712
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,853
Give me a break.
You hired me...

713
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,480
'Cause you're a good doctor who couldn't
get himself hired at a blood bank,

714
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,065
so I got you cheap.

715
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,817
You gave me everything I asked for

716
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,819
because one night I gave you
everything...

717
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,947
Stop staring at my ass
when you think I'm not looking,

718
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,658
showing up at restaurants
where I happen to be on a date,

719
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,494
and fantasizing about me
in the shower.

720
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,080
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

721
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,124
Get over it.

722
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,586
If you're still referring
to your ass,

723
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:49,756
I think that supertanker sailed would be
the more precise metaphor.

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,042
Sorry.

725
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,878
Just looking for
an extra-large trashcan.

726
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,845
Since when does
he clean anything up?
