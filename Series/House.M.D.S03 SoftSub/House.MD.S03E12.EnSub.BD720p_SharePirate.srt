1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,505
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,465
You got any cases?

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,260
Three. Got a teenage
African American lung transplant...

4
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,472
Next two days you'll be doing
nothing but clinic work.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,556
I just said...

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,516
You were lying.

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,351
Well, then why'd you ask?

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,727
Because if you told the truth

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,146
I was only gonna give you
one day of clinic duty.

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,524
That's dishonest.
I refuse to participate in this...

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,025
You'll do it. You owe me.

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,945
I kept you out of jail.
I can put you back.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,367
Perjurer.

14
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,910
Felon.

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,457
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,001
I told the nurse
I have a runny nose.

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,336
But I don't.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,589
I think I have
syphilis or gonorrhea.

19
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,218
I think I have an STD.

20
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,641
I think I have a...

21
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,407
Who is here for a runny nose?

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,870
It's a cold!
It'll get better. Go home.

23
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,582
Those of you who stayed
obviously do not have colds.

24
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,876
You will be
assigned to a doctor who is not me,

25
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,961
because I am tired
of wiping crotches.

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,422
House. You're doing this.

27
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,969
- It hurts!
- Sir...

28
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,559
Call security.

29
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,439
Should I get a sedative?

30
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,940
No, I'm good. Thanks.

31
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,906
It hurts! My head hurts!

32
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,087
Need a team here.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,256
- I have the sedative.
- Little late.

34
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,341
Just in time.

35
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,884
What did you give him?
A paralytic.

36
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,302
Why would you do that?

37
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,789
Somebody had to
stop the screaming.

38
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,388
Then he's still in pain.

39
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,057
Yeah. But quietly.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,975
Paralytic's
stopped him breathing.

41
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,728
If he goes hypoxic,
he's gonna be quiet forever.

42
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,028
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
or I can figure out
if this guy's delirium, pain

44
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,242
and insanely high heart rate
are life-threatening

45
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,494
or just a personality quirk.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,165
I think the latter choice is the better
for all three of us.

47
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,908
He's sedated.

48
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,994
It took five CCs of haloperidol

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,037
to get him down after
the paralytic wore off.

50
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,709
So, pain in his right ear,
psychotic behavior and dizziness. Go.

51
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,295
Nurses said he was
holding his head.

52
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,297
How do you know
it was specifically his ear?

53
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,423
Because he was dizzy.

54
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,383
Means the problem was
affecting his inner ear.

55
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,718
Nurses said he was
running in circles.

56
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,094
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,387
He wasn't running in circles.

58
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,388
He was running in oblongs.

59
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,473
Looked like a three-year-old kid
drew them.

60
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,727
Acoustic neuroma that started
a hemorrhage.

61
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,272
Explains the pain,
vertigo, everything.

62
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,024
Get an MRI.

63
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,358
What else?

64
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,360
If it explains everything...

65
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,646
Might not explain everything.

66
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,697
Well, what if he
was psychotic first,

67
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,365
then self-mutilated,
damaged the ear.

68
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,159
Excellent.

69
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,202
We need a complete
psychiatric work up.

70
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,787
Your turn.

71
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,832
I was gonna say what Foreman...

72
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,208
Say something else.

73
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,546
He came to the clinic.

74
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,506
Good.

75
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,216
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

76
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,385
especially given
the rapid heart rate.

77
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,930
Lingering ear infection,
pressure builds up in his inner ear,

78
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,432
bursts through the mastoid bone
while he's waiting in the clinic.

79
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,850
Oh, yes!

80
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,477
Get a head CT.
Draw blood cultures.

81
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,438
Run a chem panel and get
a complete blood count.

82
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,316
Oh, while you're at it,
pour some alcohol into his ear

83
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,318
and take out the cockroach.

84
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,154
He has a cockroach in his ear?

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,489
He was scratching that ear

86
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,240
right before the event,
so I took a peek.

87
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,243
My guess is it started biting.

88
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,579
Nothing else wrong with him?

89
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,374
Isn't that enough?
It's pretty gross.

90
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,834
So why are we doing the tests?

91
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,087
Well, it's either that or
I have to keep doing clinic duty.

92
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,374
You can do the tests
or just stay out of Cuddy's sight.

93
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,091
I don't really care which.

94
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,064
Why are you here?

95
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,401
Because it's not a hospital.

96
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,486
It's a jogging park.

97
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,863
You're not jogging.
You can't jog.

98
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,949
I'm watching jogging.

99
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,995
I sit and I watch
and I imagine.

100
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,294
So what do you watch for?

101
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,675
That guy's running in shorts.

102
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,137
He's not running.
He's trolling.

103
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,472
You're good at this.

104
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,351
How long are you
going to stay here?

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,481
Beauty of this place is that it's
the last place Cuddy will look.

106
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,615
How can I help you?

107
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,202
The doctors gave me this.

108
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,912
What doctors?

109
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,749
At the other hospital.
Last month.

110
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,049
Do you know what this says?

111
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,884
Yes.

112
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,929
"Patient has a six-centimeter
mass in the right lung.

113
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,140
Cancerous. Inoperable."

114
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,143
Do you understand
what this means?

115
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,939
Is it okay if I
sleep here tonight?

116
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,027
It's cold outside.

117
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,912
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,705
I thought House had a case.

119
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,292
He doesn't.

120
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,884
You ordered a CT on a patient
with a bug in his ear.

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,135
How did you know I was here?

122
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,762
I ran into Cameron
in the clinic.

123
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,514
"Ran into"?

124
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,307
You ordered
pointless tests just to...

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,435
Wouldn't have been pointless
if you hadn't "run into" Cameron.

126
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,645
She got punished.

127
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,105
She's stuck with
another dying patient.

128
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,648
Is that Vicodin?

129
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,858
Breath mint. Thought you
were gonna kiss me.

130
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,360
What happened to rehab?

131
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,444
I got out.

132
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,032
It was a scam?

133
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,909
Enough foreplay. Are you
going to kiss me or not?

134
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,620
You are going back to
the clinic. Or jail.

135
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,622
You perjured yourself
to keep me out of jail.

136
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,915
How are you going to tell...

137
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,460
I only did that because
I thought you were getting clean.

138
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,380
So it's, "Do clinic duty
or go to jail"?

139
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,548
Yes.

140
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,134
Then it'll be, "Finish your paperwork
or go to jail."

141
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,802
"Help with
fundraising or go to jail."

142
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,346
"Do your job or go to jail."

143
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
I think I'd rather go to jail.

144
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,852
You owe me.

145
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,947
Beautiful.

146
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,408
Thank you. It's dry.

147
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,578
Who cares? It's beautiful.

148
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,205
If my lawn were half
as well-maintained as that,

149
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,833
pigeons wouldn't have
the nerve to poop on it.

150
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,960
Good grooming is important.

151
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,045
Was that a shot?

152
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,131
People do judge you
on your appearance.

153
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,550
When you entered,
I noted your shirt hadn't been pressed.

154
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,552
You hadn't shaved
in quite some time.

155
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,637
I extrapolated you
are a person for whom

156
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,514
detail was not a major concern.

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,683
I was worried you might apply
that same standard in your...

158
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,019
Do you use toenail
clippers up there?

159
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,562
They're longer so they allow me

160
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,022
to better reach
the upper hairs.

161
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,066
I'm wearing a rumpled shirt
and forgot to brush my hair this week.

162
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,235
You've got
athlete's foot in your nose.

163
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,282
I'm ready to be judged.

164
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,370
Okay. 50 dollars to any patient

165
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,582
who's willing to
leave here right now.

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,125
Sounds good to me.

167
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,085
House. You can't...

168
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,253
My money.

169
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,130
I don't care. People do not...

170
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,383
If they'll leave for 50 bucks,
they're not all that sick.

171
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,427
Or they're poor and desperate,

172
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
which is why
this place is here.

173
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,620
If they're that poor,
then they'd rather have 50 bucks than...

174
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,894
- Can I have the money?
- Look. It's monogrammed!

175
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,063
He doesn't need money.
Ergo, he's not sick.

176
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,648
And the blood?

177
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,857
Could be anybody's.

178
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,609
Monogram's definitely his.

179
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,196
We need to talk.

180
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,494
Doesn't matter what you say, do or
threaten, I will find a way out.

181
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,038
How can we make this
more interesting for you?

182
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,498
How can we make the sky green?

183
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,124
How can we make the tall short?

184
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,710
You cannot make
the uninteresting interesting.

185
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll pay you 10 dollars
for every patient

186
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,340
you diagnose without touching.

187
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,636
You pay me 10 dollars
for every one you have to touch.

188
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,931
You're making this
into a game for me.

189
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,475
From which I can only conclude this
isn't a game for you.

190
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,726
No.

191
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,981
Why? You think if I deal with enough
people I'll find some humanity?

192
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,566
Yes.

193
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,197
Why do I have to
do this myself?

194
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,242
I got a bum leg. Say, "Ah."

195
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,326
Ah.

196
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,454
Feels rough.

197
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,126
Yes. It's a rash.
I'm gonna need more than "rough."

198
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,297
Well, it... It's just rough.
Can't you feel it?

199
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,965
Well, I could.

200
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,718
But then what
satisfaction would you get?

201
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,264
Got it!

202
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,558
Start counting.

203
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,311
How many?

204
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,603
Twenty-six.

205
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:54,236
Okay. Either you suck at math
or you're gonna die in two seconds.

206
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,699
You suck at math.

207
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:04,413
Diagnosis. Prescription.
You owe me 30.

208
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,474
I owe you 10.

209
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,393
Test results are back
for your STD patients.

210
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,978
I'm not paying you for them.

211
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,730
You already touched them.

212
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,026
How old are you?

213
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,235
30.

214
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,489
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

215
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,656
Dawson's Creek?

216
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,534
How do you get to 30
and not know about condoms?

217
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,578
Oh, God. I have an STD.

218
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,413
No. But you will.

219
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,500
Every patient who comes
in here for an STD test

220
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,918
has one thing in common.

221
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,255
They had SWS,
"sex while stupid."

222
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,840
How old are you?

223
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,884
Sixty.

224
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,888
You're lying,
but that's not the point.

225
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,224
Have you never seen
Dawson's Creek?

226
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,977
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

227
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,106
How do you live to your age
and not know about condoms?

228
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,565
I have an STD?

229
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,111
Yeah. You're actually
the first one today.

230
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:22,116
Lucky day. Well, not for you, but you
gotta feel good for everyone else.

231
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,248
It's chlamydia.

232
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,166
As bad news goes,
it's about the best.

233
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,506
Oh, settle down.
It's treatable.

234
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,258
It's actually curable.

235
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,140
All you gotta do is
take these pills...

236
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,391
Don't touch me!

237
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,898
Oh, God.

238
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,574
I need someone to
cover a patient.

239
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,950
House, you committed to...

240
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,368
She was raped.

241
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,626
You think I'm
the right doctor for her?

242
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,966
We've assigned
another doctor to your care.

243
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,177
I didn't mean to
upset Dr. House.

244
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,345
He knows that.
That's not why we're doing this.

245
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,431
I'd like to keep
being treated by him.

246
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,390
Why?

247
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,100
Just do.

248
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,644
Trust me. It's better if you
deal with somebody who specializes...

249
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm fine.

250
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,316
You told Dr. House
it's been less than a week.

251
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,610
You haven't told
anyone other than him.

252
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,861
Emotionally you're still...

253
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,071
You know what I'm dealing with?

254
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,157
You know what
I'm going through?

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,701
No.

256
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,787
You think Dr. House does?

257
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm not suggesting either one
of us be your doctor.

258
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,669
Dr. Stone is a psychiatrist.

259
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,130
If Dr. House is too busy,
I could wait.

260
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,351
Why do you want me?

261
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,230
I don't know.

262
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,775
I don't want to treat you.

263
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,903
You're just saying that
so I'll see the psychiatrist.

264
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,322
True.
Except for the word "just."

265
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,432
I'm saying I don't
want to treat you

266
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,700
so you'll see the psychiatrist

267
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,328
and because I don't
want to treat you.

268
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,457
Why don't you want
to treat me anymore?

269
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,543
I never wanted to treat you.

270
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,628
The fact that you were raped

271
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,883
holds no interest for me.

272
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,260
It's nothing personal.

273
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,514
There's nothing to treat.
You're physically healthy.

274
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,600
Okay.

275
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,856
But I want you to be my doctor.

276
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,235
Why?

277
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,529
I don't know.

278
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,740
You gotta have a reason.
Everything has a reason.

279
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,204
I trust you.

280
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,164
Ah, you see?
That's a bad reason.

281
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,333
'Cause I'll lie to you.

282
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll tell you anything just
to get you out of here.

283
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,964
I don't care.
I want to talk to you.

284
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,884
Look, you were raped.

285
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,970
All control was taken from you.

286
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,697
You're trying to
find that control again.

287
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,974
You want me
because I don't want you.

288
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,186
I'm raping you?

289
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,025
In a very non-invasive,
more annoying than traumatic...

290
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,569
Get the hell out of here!

291
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll send in Dr. Stone.

292
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,620
I didn't consent to
all of this medicine.

293
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,413
You've been out
on the streets. No treatment...

294
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm dying. There is
no treatment for dying.

295
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,126
We can make you comfortable.

296
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,463
Don't want to be. Why not?

297
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,590
Because I screwed up my life.

298
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,760
So you want to punish yourself
for messing up your life?

299
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,432
Please, stop the treatment.

300
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,981
It'll go away on its own.

301
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,524
It's not. Can't you...

302
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,068
Nope. It'll go away.

303
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,235
It's been all day.

304
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,570
There must be
some treatment you...

305
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,238
Nope. It'll go away.

306
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,116
Or it won't go away.

307
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,035
I read about a treatment.

308
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,037
Some doctor won a prize for it.

309
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,499
I read about it.

310
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,920
You don't have the hiccups,
do you?

311
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,385
Make a note,
"Drug-seeking behavior."

312
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,889
- Morphine?
- No. Anal digital stimulation.

313
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,561
How long has Stone
been in with her?

314
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,105
Are you concerned?

315
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,649
You know how many people get
raped every day?

316
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,275
So it's common,
therefore boring?

317
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,986
If we were to care about every person
suffering on the planet,

318
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,071
life would shut down.

319
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,781
How about just
the ones we meet?

320
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,987
They deserve our sympathy
more than the other people?

321
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,911
So your solution is not to give
a damn about any of them.

322
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,997
How do you do that?
How do you take that theory

323
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,916
and put it in practice?
You met her...

324
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!

325
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:32,259
Hey! I paid these people
50 bucks to leave here an hour ago.

326
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,385
Yeah, we came back.

327
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,011
Then you owe me 50.

328
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,388
The kid needs surgery.

329
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,890
And he could
walk way back then.

330
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,600
Stand up, kid.

331
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,979
He swallowed a magnet.
We got to cut it out.

332
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,564
- How old are you?
- Eight.

333
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,942
And he swallowed
something stuck to a fridge.

334
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,527
Darwin says, "Let him die."

335
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,363
If it's already below the stomach,
it should pass on its own.

336
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,364
Strong magnet.

337
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,824
It's messing with the imaging.

338
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,493
We have no way to...

339
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,413
You got x-ray vision, House?

340
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,421
Whoa, whoa! You're gonna
cut him open? Right here?

341
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,725
It's well into the intestines.
He's fine.

342
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,853
I want my 50 back.

343
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,688
I need a crash cart! Stat!

344
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:37,949
What happened?

345
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,076
Pills. Benzos. We need to get
her stomach pumped.

346
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,953
- Respiration's shallow.
- What did you say to her?

347
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,163
Nothing that would
make her want to...

348
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,169
Heartbeat's irregular.

349
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,457
- What did she say to you?
- Nothing.

350
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,167
I gave her a couple of sedatives,
turned around,

351
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,294
- and she grabbed the whole bottle.
- You must have said something.

352
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,588
I said plenty.
She said nothing.

353
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,089
I was with her
for over an hour.

354
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,050
She didn't say one word.

355
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,247
You gonna do that again?

356
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,546
You're gonna be okay.
Physically.

357
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,758
Which is all
that interests you.

358
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,514
But you're here.

359
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,140
Under orders.

360
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,561
Why would you tell me that?

361
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,729
'Cause I don't like hypocrisy.

362
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,399
But you don't have
a problem with cruelty?

363
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,905
Which brings us back to,
why do you want me?

364
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,949
I don't know.

365
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,161
You tried to kill yourself
because you couldn't talk to me.

366
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,209
You must have a reason.

367
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,039
Why does there always
have to be a reason?

368
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,916
Can't we just talk?

369
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,002
There's a phone.
Talk to a friend,

370
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,296
a family member.
Call the police.

371
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,221
You want to talk about
what happened to you?

372
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,472
No.

373
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,560
You want to talk
about your STD meds?

374
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,186
No.

375
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,356
You don't really
seem to want to talk.

376
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,649
No, I do.

377
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,610
About what?

378
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,655
I don't know. Anything.

379
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,617
The weather?

380
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,080
You were raped and
you want to talk about the weather?

381
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,708
Yeah.

382
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,713
I'm not gonna talk to
you about the weather.

383
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,055
- You help her.
- She wants you.

384
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,014
God knows why.

385
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,807
She doesn't know
what she wants.

386
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,727
She knows she wants you. You were the
first person she spoke to about this.

387
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,896
The fact that I
was in the wrong place at the wrong time

388
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,898
should be trumped by the fact
that I'm useless at this.

389
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,566
No, you're not.

390
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,235
You romantically
wanting to believe that

391
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,237
is never going to make it true.

392
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,115
I'm agreeing with you.

393
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,369
You're the last person
she should be talking to.

394
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,288
If she wants to talk about the weather,
talk about the weather.

395
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,208
She wants normalcy. She wants to feel
like the world didn't end.

396
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,336
Right. I'll tell her
that everything went on without her.

397
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,838
Babies were born,
people got married,

398
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,132
thousands of people
will remember the day she got raped

399
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,300
as the happiest
day of their lives.

400
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,552
You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

401
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,388
You need to get her to
talk about what happened.

402
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,347
No, he doesn't.

403
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,306
Pretending it didn't happen...

404
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,832
Wrong.
Pretending this didn't happen

405
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,184
is the best thing
she could possibly do.

406
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,519
She's got to make this real.

407
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,188
You know what we should
be trying to make real or process?

408
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,857
The few decent
moments in our lives. Not the crap.

409
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,585
Maybe you're right.
Except there's no way

410
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,403
she can pretend
this didn't happen.

411
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,114
So she has no choice
but to process it.

412
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,119
You've got to tell me
what happened.

413
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,621
You don't really want to hear.

414
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,039
Sure I do.

415
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,000
You're lying.

416
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,005
This doesn't have
to destroy your life.

417
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,631
I know.

418
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,466
It doesn't mean
anything about you.

419
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,468
It wasn't your fault.

420
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,845
I know.

421
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,471
You did nothing wrong.

422
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,306
Some jerk hurt you. That's all.

423
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,558
I know.

424
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,394
You're worried that you can
never trust men again.

425
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,353
No.

426
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,439
Statistically, there was always a chance
this could happen.

427
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,066
The fact that it did happen
doesn't change anything.

428
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,902
The world doesn't suck any more today
than it did yesterday.

429
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,862
I know all that.

430
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,655
Well, then what do
you want me to tell you?

431
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,075
Nothing. I just want to talk.

432
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:53,329
About nothing. If we talk about nothing,
nothing will change.

433
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,415
It might.

434
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,833
How?

435
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,251
Time.

436
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,589
Time changes everything.

437
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,925
That's what people say.
It's not true.

438
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,261
Doing things changes things.

439
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,807
Not doing things leaves things
exactly as they were.

440
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,191
Why do you have to suffer?

441
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,027
I gave my word.

442
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,613
Who would make
you promise that?

443
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,198
My father.

444
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,869
He said I would die
alone and miserable.

445
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,079
That's not a promise.

446
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,955
And even if it was, he's dead.

447
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,208
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care if...

448
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,835
Why did your husband
have to suffer?

449
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:45,006
- How do you know about my husband?
- Well, I just know.

450
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,013
You have to die in pain

451
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,766
because of a promise
you made to your father?

452
00:23:54,892 --> 00:24:00,063
If I say "yes," you'll use that
as proof that I'm insane.

453
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,316
Force treatment on me.

454
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,611
Did the nurse tell you
about my husband?

455
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,238
No.

456
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,535
- Nurse!
- Yes.

457
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,288
It's under control.

458
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,714
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to freak you out.

459
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,133
Why?

460
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,385
Because I need you
to remember me.

461
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,012
I need somebody to remember me.

462
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,103
Where did you go to college?

463
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,313
Northwestern. You?

464
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,608
Hopkins. What was your major?

465
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,277
Comparative religion.

466
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,486
Why do you trust me?

467
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,113
I don't know. Can't we just...

468
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,239
That's not rational.

469
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,448
Nothing's rational.

470
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,616
Everything is rational!

471
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,326
I was raped.

472
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,620
Explain how that
makes sense to you.

473
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:05,086
We are selfish, base animals
crawling across the earth,

474
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,173
and because we've got brains,
if we try real hard,

475
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,093
we can occasionally aspire to something
that is less than pure evil.

476
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,269
Has anything terrible
ever happened to you?

477
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,524
What do you want me to say?

478
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,652
You wanted this conversation.

479
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:34,157
You wanted to talk about
something that matters. Talk.

480
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,290
She's waiting for your answer?

481
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,833
She's asleep.

482
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,711
I sedated her.

483
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,006
Why do you care
what you say to her?

484
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,009
Because I don't know how to
answer these questions.

485
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,720
It's a simple question.
"Has your life sucked?"

486
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,306
Tell her the truth.
Tell her you were shot. Tell her...

487
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,891
She doesn't want
to hear the truth.

488
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,351
She's looking for something.

489
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,677
Looking to extrapolate some...

490
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,103
She's looking to
connect with you.

491
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,607
And that's what's scaring the hell
out of you. Tell her the truth.

492
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,067
There is no truth.

493
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,862
Are we role-playing?

494
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,268
Am I you?
I don't want to be you.

495
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,199
She's not asking
for test results.

496
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,368
She's not asking what
two plus two equals.

497
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,328
She's asking for my
personal life experience

498
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,455
so she can extrapolate
to all humanity.

499
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,166
That's not truth.
It's bad science.

500
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,463
It's not science at all.
Tell her the truth.

501
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,842
Tell her your life
has been good.

502
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,177
It hasn't been.

503
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,221
Tell her anyway.
She wants hope.

504
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,516
She wants to know that
what happened to her wasn't the norm.

505
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,017
That things can be okay,

506
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,728
which means maybe they can be
okay for her again.

507
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,983
Tell her your life sucked.

508
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,359
It didn't.

509
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,694
Tell her anyway.

510
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,237
She wants to know
she's not alone.

511
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,043
She wants to know
she's gonna survive this.

512
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,717
That other people
have been through this

513
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,325
and worse and come
out the other end.

514
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,536
She wants to know if
she's going to heal.

515
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,997
Act like you've healed.

516
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,792
Tell her...

517
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,422
Keep her asleep.

518
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,343
Thanks. You all
have been a huge help.

519
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,054
There's no wrong answer.

520
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,473
Because there's
no right answer.

521
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,475
Wrong.

522
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,686
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

523
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:33,985
Wake up.

524
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,495
It's not as bad as
what happened to you.

525
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,414
I don't think.

526
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,249
I don't know what
happened to you.

527
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,855
But given how lousy
you're responding,

528
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,504
I assume it was worse than
getting abused by your grandmother.

529
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,760
What did she do to you?

530
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,263
Parents traveled a lot.

531
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,265
They'd leave me with her.

532
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,477
She liked things
the way she liked them.

533
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,645
And she believed in discipline.

534
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,022
She was right, I suppose,

535
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,150
because I hardly ever
screwed up when she was around.

536
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,279
Too scared of getting forced
to sleep in the yard

537
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
or take a bath in ice.

538
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,995
Your turn.

539
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,376
Your parents,
they never stopped her?

540
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,003
I never told them.

541
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,713
Why not?

542
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,507
Usual reasons.

543
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,258
I was afraid they
wouldn't believe me.

544
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,345
I was afraid they'd think
I'd done something wrong.

545
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,768
I opened up to you.
You open up to me.

546
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,770
What did you call her?

547
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,938
Oma.

548
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,856
And you kept calling
her that after this?

549
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,068
Dutch for "grandmother."
She was still my grandmother.

550
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,028
And she was still Dutch.

551
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,661
Is any part of that story true?

552
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,122
All of it.

553
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,249
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma.

554
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,334
Something would have to change.

555
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,293
You don't know me.

556
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,712
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma!

557
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,590
- Look, you're over-reacting...
- Do not dismiss me.

558
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,637
I'm not dismissing you.

559
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,385
I'm saying you're
not acting rationally.

560
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,303
I'm angry because
you are lying to me!

561
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,139
- No, you are...
- What can I do?

562
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,305
What the hell can I do
that you're not gonna dismiss

563
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,810
as just being
because I was raped?

564
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,023
Nothing.

565
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,030
Your story, is it true?

566
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,951
True for somebody.

567
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,537
But not for you.

568
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,205
These things happen.

569
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,124
It happened to somebody.

570
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,876
What do you care
if it happened to me?

571
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,712
- They're not in this room.
- No, they're out there!

572
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,047
Doctors, lawyers,
postal workers.

573
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,258
Some of them doing great,
some of them doing lousy.

574
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,051
You gonna base your whole life

575
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,761
on who you got
stuck in a room with?

576
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:09,390
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck in a room with.

577
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,478
It's what life is.
It's a series of rooms.

578
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,814
And who we get stuck
in those rooms with

579
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,025
adds up to what our lives are.

580
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,617
House?

581
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,674
You gotta get me out of this.

582
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,384
There's nothing to diagnose.
There's nothing...

583
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,470
You only tested her for STDs?

584
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,306
I had seven morons
who forgot their raincoats.

585
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,975
It's all they asked for
so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?

586
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,895
I wasted their time.
She's pregnant.

587
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,203
Do you understand?

588
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,583
Are you okay?

589
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,628
I mean, I know you're not okay.

590
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,047
But are you more
or less not okay

591
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,799
than you were five minutes ago?

592
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,552
About the same.

593
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,179
Good.

594
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,598
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant...

595
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,600
I don't want to terminate.

596
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,186
You want to keep the baby?

597
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,272
Abortion is murder.

598
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:46,237
True. It's a life.
And you should end it.

599
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,490
Every life is sacred.

600
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,911
Talk to me. Don't
quote me bumper stickers.

601
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,454
- It's true.
- It's meaningless.

602
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,248
It means every life
matters to God.

603
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,208
Not to me, not to you.

604
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,336
And judging by the number
of natural disasters, not to God either.

605
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,702
You're just
being argumentative.

606
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,131
Yeah. I do do that.

607
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,383
What about Hitler?

608
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,590
Was his life sacred to God?

609
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,636
The father of your child?

610
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,846
Is his life sacred to you?

611
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,723
My child isn't Hitler.

612
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,558
Either every life
is sacred or...

613
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,686
Stop it! I don't want to
chat about philosophy!

614
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,231
You're not killing your rape baby
because of a philosophy.

615
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,485
It's murder.
I'm against it. You for it?

616
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,405
Not as a general rule.

617
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,740
Just for unborn children?

618
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,991
Yes.

619
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,665
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

620
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,044
It might make sense to kill the ass
that did this to you,

621
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,837
but then where do
we draw the line?

622
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,881
Which asses do we get to kill?

623
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,924
Which asses get to
keep on being asses?

624
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,968
The nice thing about
the abortion debate

625
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,803
is we can
quibble over trimesters

626
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,767
but ultimately there's
a nice clean line, birth.

627
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,520
Morally there's not
a lot of difference.

628
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,356
Practically, huge.

629
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,401
You're enjoying
this conversation.

630
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,114
It's just the type of
conversation I do well.

631
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,743
But the other type?

632
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,790
The personal stuff?

633
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,419
There are no answers.

634
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,756
And if there are no answers,
why talk about it?

635
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,430
You're healthy.
You shouldn't be here.

636
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,227
I don't want to go.

637
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,274
Fine. I won't discharge you.

638
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,700
Wanna go for a walk?

639
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,792
It's the last of my journey.

640
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,747
You don't deserve pain.
You're just an insane old man.

641
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,505
- No.
- I am not going to watch you suffer.

642
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,048
I need you to remember me.

643
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,426
- I'll remember you!
- Why?

644
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,885
Because you're a nice man.

645
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,972
You don't know that.
You don't know anything about me.

646
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,724
Either you were a nice man
or you were an ass.

647
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,436
Either way you did something to somebody
that they're going to remember.

648
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,855
I have no family.
I have no friends.

649
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,399
I didn't even have a real job.

650
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,568
If I die in peace,

651
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,445
then I'm just another patient.

652
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,988
But if I die suffering...

653
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,491
It'll be horrible. Don't
do that to either of us.

654
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,538
No. I just need to
die knowing that something is different

655
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,623
because I was here.

656
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,208
Life goes on.

657
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,462
Is that the reason
why we're out here?

658
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,714
Know why I come here?

659
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,675
I sit. I watch. I imagine.

660
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,305
Sounds nice.

661
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,433
I imagine that one of
them will break a leg.

662
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,604
Just one false step,
one crack in the sidewalk...

663
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,148
You don't really.

664
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,483
I'm evil.

665
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,152
Evil people don't
say they're evil.

666
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,655
That sounds like
an easy loophole.

667
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,453
People can do good things,
but their instincts are not good.

668
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,624
Either God doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

669
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,545
I don't believe that.

670
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,630
What do you believe?

671
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,007
Why do you think this happened?

672
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,011
I don't want to talk about it.

673
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,806
Me neither. Too bad.

674
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,770
You know, I don't think
there was a reason.

675
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,565
So God does exist,
lets you get raped,

676
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,609
needs you to keep
your rape baby for no reason.

677
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,322
Maybe he was challenging me.

678
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,616
He hurts you to help you.

679
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,620
Well, I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

680
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,747
You're trying to convince me
there's no God.

681
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,249
Why would you even say
something like that?

682
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,709
Because you're
throwing your life away.

683
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,377
I'm doing what I believe!

684
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,796
What you believe
doesn't make sense.

685
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,757
This is not helping me.

686
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,718
Then I can't help you.

687
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,515
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

688
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,351
The same way that
a bug is irrelevant

689
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,312
in comparison to the universe.

690
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,860
If you don't
believe in eternity,

691
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,862
then what you do here
is irrelevant.

692
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,698
Your actions here
are all that matters.

693
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,074
Then nothing matters.

694
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,993
There's no
ultimate consequences.

695
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,164
I couldn't live like that.

696
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,376
So, you need to think
that the guy

697
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,879
who did this to you is
going to be punished?

698
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,549
I need to know that
it all means something.

699
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,470
I need that comfort.

700
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,723
Yeah.
Are you feeling comfortable?

701
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,144
You feeling good right now?
You feel warm inside?

702
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:06,784
I was raped.
What's your excuse?

703
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,469
Do you think the guy who did
this to me feels bad?

704
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,890
Would that help you?
Make you feel better?

705
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,561
Why do you always do that?

706
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,939
Ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just answering the question?

707
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,066
The answer doesn't interest me.

708
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,402
I don't care what he's feeling.

709
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm interested in
what you're feeling.

710
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,867
You are?

711
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,957
I'm trapped in
the room with you, right?

712
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,753
Why did you choose me?

713
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,384
There's something about you.

714
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,389
It's like you're hurt, too.

715
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:07,488
It was true.

716
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,575
What was?

717
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,913
It wasn't my grandmother.
But it was true.

718
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,543
Who was it?

719
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,673
It was my dad.

720
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,028
I'd like to tell you
what happened to me now.

721
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,701
I'd like to hear it.

722
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,170
It was my friend's
birthday party...

723
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,932
She terminated.
She's been discharged.

724
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,687
She's going to be okay.

725
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,898
Yeah. It's that simple.

726
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,527
She's talking
about what happened.

727
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,821
That's huge. You did good.

728
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,367
And everyone'll tell you
that's what we gotta make her do.

729
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,662
We got to help her, right?
Except we can't.

730
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,835
We drag out her story,
tell each other that it'll help her heal

731
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,089
and feel real good
about ourselves.

732
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,802
Maybe all we've done
is make a girl cry.

733
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,555
Then why did you...

734
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,770
Because I don't know.

735
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,365
You gonna follow up with her?

736
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,453
One day, one room.
