1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,841
Coming up to 50 feet.

2
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,551
Roger that.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,970
We're light on fuel.
Two minutes to bingo.

4
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,934
Come on, Fisher,
we got places to go, people to see.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,018
Working on it!

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,979
So I've heard.
What's taking so long?

7
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,237
Let go of the suitcase!

8
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,828
Let go of the suitcase!

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,538
You're gonna have
to hold on to me!

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,043
Sir, whatever it is,
it's not worth it!

11
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,295
We're at bingo fuel, sir.

12
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,922
You hear that, Fisher? Bingo!

13
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,216
Either reel him in
or we're leaving them both here!

14
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,801
Okay, sir.

15
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,355
Ditch the damn luggage!

16
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,005
Marina.

17
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,425
Marina! Marina!

18
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,815
Tell him if he was so worried
about his wife's clothes,

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,775
he should have stayed in Cuba!

20
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,824
He says it wasn't her clothes,
it was her medical records.

21
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,117
Says she's sick
and needs to go home.

22
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,873
No home, House!
I need to see Dr. House!

23
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,861
You don't answer
your phone anymore.

24
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,780
I'm world-famous now.
Press won't leave me alone.

25
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,865
- It's Cuddy.
- I know.

26
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,471
If it was the press,
I'd be answering.

27
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,869
And since you're not
taking her calls, I am.

28
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,829
Your patient's been
waiting for hours.

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,830
She didn't book an appointment.

30
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,916
No, she risked her life.

31
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,375
If you don't reach terra firma,

32
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,543
you don't get
any milk or honey.

33
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,463
The woman has 10
different things wrong with her,

34
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,549
including pains
all over her body.

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,802
Admittedly, not as interesting

36
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,055
as staring uselessly
at Foreman.

37
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,767
You know why I find
a goodbye party fascinating?

38
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,866
I think it's kind of insulting to
celebrate when someone leaves you.

39
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,022
- What are you gonna do to keep him?
- Nothing.

40
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,608
He really is gonna leave.
You know that, right?

41
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,944
- Yeah.
- So what are you gonna do?

42
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,070
Nothing I can do.

43
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,656
He doesn't want more money,
better working conditions,

44
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,866
doesn't even want a better job.

45
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,534
He wants to not be me.

46
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,578
Because he thinks
you're a cold-hearted bastard

47
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,664
without any regard
for anyone but yourself.

48
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,748
He's right.

49
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,834
You need to show him
that you really do care.

50
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,127
Don't!

51
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,382
Foreman's not the only
chocolate-covered cherry in the box.

52
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,135
House, you play a guitar
you got in ninth grade.

53
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,095
Eighth.

54
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,514
You're living in
the same apartment for 15 years,

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,517
you drive a 10 year-old car,
you are not good with change.

56
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,936
That used to be true,
but I changed.

57
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,899
He's not afraid to be you, he's afraid
to be who he thinks you are.

58
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,657
Rheumatic fever
would explain the skin rash.

59
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,200
But not the double
vision or bloody urine.

60
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,766
They were lost
at sea for three days.

61
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,426
Severe dehydration
causes kidney problems.

62
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,913
And the double vision?

63
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,290
Concussion
during the shipwreck.

64
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,752
It all fits as long as each symptom
started when you think it started.

65
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,382
This would be a lot easier
if we had her medical records.

66
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,634
Any of you
certified deep-sea divers?

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,845
She's from a dirt-poor
country in the tropics.

68
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,597
Infectious disease and parasites
are the most likely cause

69
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,226
of unexplained pain, fever and skin
rash. We might as well start there.

70
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,395
If there's one thing
Castro knows,

71
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,564
it's how to look
great in green.

72
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,982
And if there are two
things Castro knows,

73
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,901
it's how to look great
in green and train doctors.

74
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,528
Even without
the medical records,

75
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,697
we can assume she was
drowned in antibiotics

76
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,866
before she risked
drowning to see me.

77
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,701
So what doesn't Castro know?

78
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,120
How to lay his hands on
high-tech scanning equipment.

79
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,123
Pain, double vision
point us toward the head.

80
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,626
Cameron, get an MRI. See what's cooking
in the old cabeza.

81
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,880
Chase, check out the husband.

82
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,548
Why? He hasn't
complained of any pain.

83
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,801
Basic math. Take all of her symptoms,
subtract his sea symptoms,

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,179
the remainder equals
her original symptoms.

85
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,490
Are you in any pain?

86
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,742
No, I'm just sunburned.

87
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,120
Any blurred vision?

88
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,914
No.

89
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,125
So my wife,
she is with Dr. House?

90
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,795
She's with another doctor
who is part of Dr. House's team.

91
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,005
No, she's supposed to
see Dr. House.

92
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,507
We have permission.

93
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,509
That's the way it
works with Dr. House.

94
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,177
I came 1,000 miles to see him!

95
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,929
He doesn't care.

96
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,807
I'm sorry,
but that's who he is,

97
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,559
that's who you
risked your life to see.

98
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,855
And you made the right choice.

99
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,818
Any other metal?

100
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,613
Must have been
difficult on the boat.

101
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,534
When the storm came,
yes, very much.

102
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,537
I pray while my husband, he...

103
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,041
With the paddles?

104
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,668
You were on a boat
without a motor?

105
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,212
No, no, we start with a motor,

106
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,422
but it break on
the first night.

107
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,511
My husband,
he can fix anything.

108
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,766
A washing machine,
a car, a computer.

109
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,186
But that is stupid motor.

110
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,439
And me.

111
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,608
These two he cannot fix.

112
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,485
He got you to us.

113
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,070
He never gave up.

114
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,448
No matter what happen,

115
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,536
he kept saying to me,
"Don't worry,"

116
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,165
"we will make it."

117
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,250
"I'll take care of you."

118
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,629
That's Esteban.

119
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,633
He refuses to worry or pray.

120
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,929
He believe
if you don't have one,

121
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,764
that you don't need the other.

122
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,479
Husband has a pulled
muscle in his shoulder,

123
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,857
but no other pains
or double vision.

124
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,944
He does have a fever, fungal rash,
cough, and elevated bilirubin.

125
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,030
Foreman's not going anywhere.

126
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,451
- He said that to you?
- He doesn't really wanna leave.

127
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,938
And you don't
really wanna let him.

128
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,673
You'll cave, just like
you did with Cameron.

129
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,789
Foreman's not
as easy as Cameron.

130
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,499
But, of course, who is?

131
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,169
I'm in the room.

132
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,172
He may not want a date,
but he does want something.

133
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,007
Well, maybe it's
something I can't offer.

134
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,217
Then you'll just lie.

135
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,635
- He'd see through it.
- Maybe.

136
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,845
Or maybe he'll just see
what he wants to see.

137
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,433
She has MS.

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,893
Explains the pain, fatigue,

139
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,645
double vision, kidney problems.

140
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,230
The kidney problems
aren't connected.

141
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,148
Her husband
has the same issues.

142
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,733
It is possible for
two people to have

143
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,539
the same symptom
for two different reasons.

144
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,736
If we're gonna
take that approach,

145
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,695
then we may as
well just throw out

146
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,781
everything we got
from the husband and start over.

147
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,242
We could do that, or we could do
something productive.

148
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,993
Start her on
Interferon for the MS,

149
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,620
see if she improves.

150
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,083
I do like being productive.

151
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,044
Well done. Do it.

152
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,968
"Well done"? Is that what you think
he wants, a pat on the head?

153
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,719
Go do your job.

154
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,274
She does not have MS.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,567
I know it's not a pleasant
diagnosis to hear...

156
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,237
But, no! The doctors in Cuba
would have found MS.

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,032
What's that?

158
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,328
It's all right.
Her pulse ox just came off.

159
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,622
Marina, you can't...

160
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,665
But it hurts.

161
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,874
Her pain is getting worse!

162
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,627
Your treatment isn't working
because it's not MS.

163
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,920
Does this hurt?

164
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:40,848
Wow! Well, either Foreman's way
stronger than he thinks he is or...

165
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,768
Seriously. Or?

166
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,146
She's too young for
osteoporosis that severe.

167
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,231
And too old for
osteogenesis imperfecta.

168
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,650
- Which leaves bone cancer.
- Cancer's a long shot.

169
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,487
Why? Because metastatic
tumors don't explain the abnormal MRI,

170
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,948
kidney damage, cotton mouth,
double vision.

171
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,116
Oh, wait, they do!

172
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,522
Infection could
do all that, too.

173
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,702
It's not an infection.

174
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,079
Because you know the nonexistent
medical records confirm

175
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,124
that the brilliant doctors
in Cuba treated her for infection,

176
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,626
or because you're trying to
kiss up to Foreman?

177
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,629
Because an infection
would cause a fever,

178
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,597
and the brilliant doctors
who work in my office

179
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,717
have already crossed that off the list
because the husband...

180
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,719
You're the one who said
it's possible for two people

181
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,845
to have the same symptom
for two different reasons.

182
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,681
And you're the one
who said if we do that,

183
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,683
we might as well throw out everything
we got from the husband.

184
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,102
Right, and then you said we should
do something productive

185
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,812
like breaking her arm?

186
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,189
Foreman didn't break her arm.

187
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,858
- Of course he didn't.
- Cancer did.

188
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,778
Put her in a PET scan,
see what else it's breaking.

189
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,407
This isn't gonna work!
He's not a moron!

190
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,826
You can't just agree with
everything he says for two days

191
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,705
and hope he forgets the last three years
and how much he hates you!

192
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,249
Anything else?

193
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,589
When you get the results
of the PET scan, let me know.

194
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,159
I don't really care
if Foreman stays or goes, but...

195
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,327
You're fired.

196
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,710
What, because I yelled at you?

197
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,213
Because you've
been here the longest,

198
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,800
learned all you can or
you haven't learned anything at all.

199
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,720
Either way,
it's time for a change.

200
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,856
Fine.

201
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,124
No tumors in her arm.

202
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,835
Synovial membrane
is working fine.

203
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,421
No hot spots, no bone cancer.

204
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,715
Maybe we should be
looking for something else.

205
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,595
Is it raining out?

206
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,805
- House fired me.
- What?

207
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,640
Because you yelled at him?

208
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,685
"Time for a change"
was the official explanation.

209
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,353
It makes no sense.

210
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,855
Since when does
House make sense?

211
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:35,981
He always makes sense.

212
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,065
He's angry.

213
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,734
Yes, it's all about you,
Foreman.

214
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,903
He's upset you're leaving,
so he fires Chase.

215
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,738
Excuse me.

216
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,908
On the humerus,
she's got a hot spot.

217
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,026
Why'd you fire Chase?

218
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,152
Sure thing.

219
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,079
First you tell me
the results of the PET scan.

220
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,280
Did you fire him for me?

221
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,615
Would you stay if I did?

222
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,908
You asked him to fire Chase?

223
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,451
- No!
- Yes!

224
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,911
You're frustrated with Foreman

225
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,788
so you lash out, kick the dog?

226
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,582
He's not gone five minutes
and the name-calling starts.

227
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,376
What's on the PET scan?

228
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,460
Why'd you fire Chase?

229
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,003
Do you know
what's on the PET scan?

230
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,338
You two, out.

231
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,675
Wait! What's on the PET scan?

232
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,843
You can't dump
your entire department

233
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,388
just because you don't know
how to deal with an issue.

234
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes,
they are all irreplaceable.

235
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,725
If only in this country
we'd figure out a way

236
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,852
to somehow teach people
to interpret PET scans.

237
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,230
What the hell's wrong with you?
You fired Chase?

238
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,274
I don't suppose you know
what's on my patient's PET scan.

239
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,651
I told you to show Foreman
you have a heart.

240
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,486
How does that translate
into you being a bastard?

241
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,445
So that's a no.

242
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,948
Pick up the phone
and tell Chase you made a mistake.

243
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,783
Un-fire him.

244
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,458
Chase, if you know what's on
the PET scan, call me back.

245
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,627
Cut the crap.

246
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,045
Chase is a good doctor.

247
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,797
Sorry,
you're in the wrong room.

248
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,300
My name on the door,
my team, my decisions.

249
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,760
My building,
my floor, my people.

250
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,015
Hold that reprimand. House.

251
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,768
Dr. Chase! How are you?

252
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,275
Thank you.
You are indispensable.

253
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,945
You're still fired. Sorry.

254
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,948
Wow, that was awkward.

255
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,492
PET scan revealed
a blood clot in my patient's arm.

256
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,411
Which means goodbye.

257
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,104
Still got two people
working for me,

258
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,914
gotta get one of them
to do my job.

259
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,545
A clot means a heart problem.

260
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,881
We have to do
an emergency angiogram.

261
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,299
But you're not sure
it's a blood clot?

262
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,427
PET scan can't determine
that with certainty.

263
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,888
So you have no better idea what's wrong
with her than when we first got here?

264
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,682
- We've ruled out MS.
- I told you it wasn't MS.

265
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,850
Where is Dr. House?

266
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,352
Dr. House has
left for the night.

267
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,854
He'll be here in the morning
to review the results,

268
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,065
if you sign the consent.

269
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:34,326
But, you know,
you could call him at home.

270
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,538
He doesn't always pick up,
so keep calling.

271
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,376
Thank you.

272
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,635
Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez again.

273
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,846
As soon as you get home,
it's very important you call me.

274
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,774
Hello, yes, Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez.

275
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,360
As soon as you get home,
if you can please call me?

276
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,616
The catheter is in
her femoral artery.

277
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,118
Why are you telling me that?

278
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,828
Because you're assisting.

279
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,163
Do I look like I'm assisting?

280
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,083
I had nothing to do
with Chase's termination.

281
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,584
Is everything okay?

282
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,837
You're doing fine, Marina.

283
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,172
The dye will take a minute
to work its way through your system.

284
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,216
Why would you tell House
you're leaving because he's a jerk?

285
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,801
Because it's the truth.

286
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,013
Did you give
an angry Cuban my home number?

287
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,181
Why would you do that?

288
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,387
You're not turning into House,
you're worse than him.

289
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,227
Let me get this straight.
Instead of picking up the phone

290
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,771
and talking to
a patient for five minutes,

291
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,441
you gave up on sleep
and drove in here.

292
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,859
My chest!

293
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,820
She's in V-Tach.

294
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,113
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

295
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,407
Must have hit something.
You nick an artery?

296
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,909
She has no pulse.

297
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,036
It hurts.

298
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,668
She has no pulse,
but she's talking.

299
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,840
Cough! Cough again!
Keep coughing!

300
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,592
It'll push blood into your head,
keep you conscious.

301
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,218
Push one milligram Epinephrine.

302
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,805
Will that help?

303
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,725
No. But it is amazingly cool.

304
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,179
We need to get her on bypass!

305
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,312
We need to keep her here.

306
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,772
If this was a clot,
the force of bypass

307
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,378
will blow it into
her brain, kill her.

308
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,775
If we continue CPR,
she'll lose blood flow,

309
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,901
which will cause brain damage.

310
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,694
What caused the heart to stop?

311
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,196
Let's assume
it wasn't human error.

312
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,923
I didn't nick an artery,
it just stopped.

313
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,907
I said let's assume.

314
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,913
The only other option
is electrical instability.

315
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,744
No ST segment changes.

316
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,746
We need to tell the husband.

317
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,123
Tell him what?
We have no idea what happened.

318
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,127
House?

319
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,630
Keep going until
I figure this out.

320
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,758
House!

321
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,056
Jeez.

322
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,893
At 47, I hope my colon looks
better than this guy's.

323
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,145
Isolating
the first transverse...

324
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,607
Help! I'm trapped
inside a monitor!

325
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,905
Not a good time, House.

326
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,325
My patient lost her heartbeat during
routine cardiac catheterization, so...

327
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,953
- Human error.
- It's not human error.

328
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,162
Electrical instability?

329
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,373
Pre-procedure EKG was normal,
no syncope.

330
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,541
Ischemia?

331
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,459
Foreman said no
STsegment changes.

332
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,294
Human error is
the only other possible...

333
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,754
It's not human error.

334
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,714
Of course it's human error!

335
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,424
You don't want Foreman
to have made a mistake

336
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,676
because then
you'd have to mock him.

337
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,136
And that would put a crimp
in your brilliant plan of keeping him

338
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,347
by having a breakdown
and firing Chase.

339
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,558
Did you just
spit on the monitor?

340
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,393
You know I can't see you.

341
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,813
Human error would not
explain her symptoms.

342
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,816
You mean her heart stopping?

343
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,526
I mean her foot pain,
her back pain.

344
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,194
House! I'm busy!
You have a team,

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,821
run your differential
with them.

346
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,156
Foreman and Cameron
are doing CPR.

347
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,908
Then you shouldn't
have fired Chase.

348
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,661
Change is fun, huh?

349
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,960
- Five, six, seven, eight!
- Go!

350
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,254
Someone's gotta
talk to the husband.

351
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,500
He thought this whole thing
was gonna last 45 minutes!

352
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,471
A half hour more of this,
nothing to talk about,

353
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,031
we won't be able to bring her back.
We gotta get her on bypass.

354
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,846
House still isn't
answering his phone.

355
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,306
You, get in here.

356
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,600
Go!

357
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,230
Excuse me, my wife was supposed
to be back an hour ago...

358
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,649
As soon as we know anything,
we'll call you.

359
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,192
Thank you.

360
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,950
Human Behavior finals
will also get into

361
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,078
clinical presentations
of mania,

362
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,916
and we'll touch on
Stanislas Dehaene's PET scans.

363
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,293
Excuse me, Professor.

364
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,337
House, when we're
done with our rounds...

365
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,922
My patient has no heartbeat.

366
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,508
Stopped when we inserted a catheter
during a routine angiogram.

367
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,011
Anyone tells me
why her heart stopped

368
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,305
gets an A in Dr. Cuddy's class.

369
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,515
Anyone?

370
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:08,975
Human error?

371
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,227
Yeah. I'm polling
first-year medical students

372
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,915
because I hadn't
considered human error.

373
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,230
Marfan Syndrome?

374
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,608
Structural abnormalities
would show up on the echo.

375
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,902
You get a C. Yeah?

376
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:19,903
Botox injections.

377
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:20,862
F.

378
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,032
If the injection was tainted
with live botulism, it'd fit.

379
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,784
B-plus.

380
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,036
Unfortunately, she missed
her last Botox appointment

381
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,538
due to a boating accident,
but send me your résumé.

382
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,957
House, time's up.

383
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,834
Good Lord,
you smell like musk ox.

384
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,545
Either our patient goes on bypass,
or I call time of death.

385
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,422
Your patient isn't
already on bypass?

386
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,799
I was worried about a clot.

387
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,175
- How long?
- Three hours.

388
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,177
House. Bypass, now!

389
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,528
Clear the hall!

390
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,988
Out of the way, please!

391
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,489
Let's go! Excuse us!

392
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,784
Dr. Foreman! My wife!
What has happened?

393
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,619
Her heart stopped.
We have to get her on bypass.

394
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,996
He needs to wait outside.

395
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,247
Got it?

396
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,306
Dr. House.

397
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,766
You can vacuum later.

398
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,020
I am not the janitor,
I am Esteban Hernandez.

399
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,604
What happened to my wife?

400
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,524
Her heart stopped.

401
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,234
Why did her heart stop?

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, if I knew that,
I'd be coming to you.

403
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,446
Tell me where you take her.

404
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,772
Tell me what is happen to her?

405
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,034
"Happening."
It's a present participle.

406
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,536
Not a particularly
interesting form of speech.

407
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,329
Kind of like this conversation.

408
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,998
But I risk my life to see you.

409
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,042
I looked you up.
You fix people.

410
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,688
When everyone else
gives up, you don't!

411
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,712
And now you insult me?

412
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,422
Ignore my wife?

413
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,590
Helps my process.

414
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,258
You do not ignore my wife,
okay?

415
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,593
She is everything to me.

416
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,595
Well, then you do
not ignore your wife.

417
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,598
You just sit here!
You don't talk to people.

418
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,517
How do you fix something
if you don't look at it?

419
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,366
Turn on bypass, please.

420
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,705
Good. Good distal flow.

421
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,708
Need to look at the heart.

422
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,667
Why?

423
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,337
I can't find my wallet.
Pick it up. Turn it over.

424
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,380
I don't see anything
physically wrong with her heart.

425
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,174
Hearts don't
stop for no reason.

426
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,676
Okay. Take your look.

427
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,390
You see anything wrong?

428
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,729
Give her a jump-start.

429
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,403
Clear. Clear.

430
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,991
Clear.

431
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:13,368
And again.

432
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,039
Clear! Clear! Clear!

433
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,583
Again.

434
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,045
Yeah, seventh time
is the charm. Sorry.

435
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,932
I'll keep her on bypass until the
husband has a chance to say goodbye.

436
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,658
I'm not telling
the husband anything

437
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,876
until I can tell him why his...

438
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,136
It doesn't matter.

439
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,013
Her heart can't start.
She's dead.

440
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,156
I got you something.

441
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,126
I'll miss you.

442
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,296
I know you won't miss me,
but...

443
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,549
I just thought it would be nice
for you to have that.

444
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,304
I will miss you.

445
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,436
Can I have a hug, too?

446
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,105
The surgeon found nothing.

447
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,940
He can't start her heart.

448
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,152
What a thoughtful gift.

449
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,778
Nice reminder
of intellectual theft

450
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,466
to hang at your new
place of employment.

451
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,408
You two can go.
Say hi to Chase for me.

452
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,076
You're wearing lipstick.

453
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,163
We can stay. We can run
another differential.

454
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,457
You two have no theories
about why the heart stopped,

455
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,863
which means I don't need you.
Go.

456
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,419
It's too late for theories.
We need to tell the husband.

457
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,962
- Tell him what?
- That it's over.

458
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,964
- Why?
- Because her heart won't start!

459
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,883
How can we tell him
there's no hope

460
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,676
if we don't know
why there's no hope?

461
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,846
He's not gonna pull
the plug on his wife.

462
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,372
He risked his life
to get her to me.

463
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,807
If he pulls the plug,
it means he's failed.

464
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,768
If he pulls the plug,
it means you've failed.

465
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,144
And you're okay with that?

466
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,106
Go.

467
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,416
- Hey.
- Hey.

468
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,794
You look great.

469
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,338
You know House firing you
has nothing to do with you.

470
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,423
The why doesn't matter.

471
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,217
Foreman will end up staying,
House will call you,

472
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,135
probably yell at you
for not showing up.

473
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,762
It's okay.

474
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,558
He's right.
It's time for a change.

475
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,644
You were right, too.

476
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,816
The whole "It's Tuesday,
I like you." It was silly.

477
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,695
Oh, don't give me that look.

478
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,405
Don't feel sorry for me.

479
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,450
Getting this job was the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

480
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,452
Everything about it.
And losing it?

481
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:08,918
Well, I think it's
gonna be good, too.

482
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,714
I'll miss you.

483
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,384
Have you got time for
a drink or something?

484
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,678
I think I should go.

485
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,640
Yeah.

486
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,631
How's it going?

487
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,929
The way the security
light hits your legs,

488
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,766
looks good.

489
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,601
Thank you.

490
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,314
If you're here
to yell at me about

491
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,608
the Foreman-Chase situation,
it can wait.

492
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,443
When do you plan
on telling the husband

493
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,153
it's time to say
goodbye to his wife?

494
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,905
Haven't put a clock on it.

495
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:24,452
Other than your curiosity, do you have
any reason to keep her on bypass?

496
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,704
Patient's husband
prefers her not dead.

497
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,289
Or you want a storybook ending

498
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,750
for the young man who
crossed the ocean for his wife.

499
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,502
This is not an act.

500
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,212
- I don't care.
- Then pull the plug!

501
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,631
What if I can fix it,
but I just don't know it yet?

502
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,715
I know you care.

503
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,258
I don't care!

504
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,886
I really don't care.

505
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,681
My motives are pure.

506
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,685
If we do an autopsy
and we see, "Oops",

507
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,067
"if I'd thought of that crazy idea,
we could have saved her,"

508
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,986
then the husband
might be upset.

509
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,197
You've done all you can do.

510
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,449
It's time to let go.

511
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,595
I was told
you didn't believe in God.

512
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,681
I don't.

513
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,144
I promise my wife I'll do everything
I can to fix her.

514
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,482
If I don't pray,
then I don't do everything.

515
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:43,281
It's not working.
She's not coming back.

516
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,576
If you want to say goodbye,
you can come down to the ICU,

517
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,078
and then I'll take her
off bypass.

518
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,418
I'm sorry. I should have...

519
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,680
Marina, I am so sorry.

520
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,395
When you turn
the machine off, that's it?

521
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,482
Yeah.

522
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,570
Right now,
is her brain working?

523
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,448
Probably. Just not her heart.

524
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,783
She seems like
she's just sleeping.

525
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,327
She's not sleeping.

526
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,496
We double-checked.

527
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,513
Her heart? It beat?

528
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,392
No, it's residual
flow from the bypass.

529
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,520
No, I can feel it. Look!

530
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,831
That is her heart, no?

531
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:01,794
P wave, Q, R, S, T wave.
That's a normal normal.

532
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,922
Esteban?

533
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,757
Marina!

534
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,010
Holy crap.

535
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,846
Is this heaven?

536
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,765
No, it's New Jersey.

537
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,559
God sent you back to me.

538
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,690
It's a miracle.

539
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,201
It's impossible.

540
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,411
Apparently not.

541
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,830
Live hearts don't
stop for no reason.

542
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,416
Dead hearts don't
start for no reason.

543
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,542
Apparently they do.

544
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,545
She's three hours off bypass
and still stable.

545
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,172
And the pain is gone.

546
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,256
No, it's not.

547
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,009
You think she's lying
about feeling better?

548
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,136
Just because it's not there now
doesn't mean it's gone.

549
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,512
Just because
it was there before

550
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,839
doesn't mean it's coming back.

551
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,557
Chase was probably right.

552
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,559
She had some sort
of tropical infection

553
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,125
that cleared when we put her on
antibiotics during the bypass.

554
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,773
Antibiotics did not
bring her back to life.

555
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,399
Other than a miracle,

556
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,610
it's the only explanation
for her symptoms.

557
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,864
How come God gets credit
whenever something good happens?

558
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,575
Where was he
when her heart stopped?

559
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,830
What if it wasn't human error?

560
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,502
What if it was God's error?

561
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:29,799
A congenital defect in an artery making
it susceptible to inflammation.

562
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,635
We need to do
another angiogram.

563
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,638
We've looked at her heart 100 different
ways. There was no evidence...

564
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,847
The one time we
looked inside her heart,

565
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,534
we stopped before
we could see anything.

566
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,184
Because it stopped.

567
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,031
Good news.

568
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,325
I think we know
what the problem is.

569
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,785
You mean "was."

570
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,246
Hey, it's my first language,
not yours.

571
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,749
If she wants to outlive Castro,
we need to fix her heart.

572
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,377
In case no one's filled you in,

573
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,088
today is Monday,
which means you've been dead for a day.

574
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,049
If that kind of
symptom comes back, it can get serious.

575
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,095
I need to do another angiogram.

576
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,265
Wait. Wasn't that what caused
her heart to stop before?

577
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,393
No, God caused that.
He's all-powerful, you know.

578
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,564
He was watching
over us in the ocean

579
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,482
and he's watching over us now.

580
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,153
Your rescuers didn't have wings,
they had a helicopter.

581
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,279
Esteban prayed.

582
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,198
Do you know how many little boys
are praying for jetpacks?

583
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,492
How many priests
are praying for...

584
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,654
Well, that one actually works.

585
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,080
You didn't bring me
back to him.

586
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,540
And I'm not gonna
take you away from him,

587
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,168
but if we don't do
this test, God will.

588
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,630
You said there was no chance,
no hope, which means...

589
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,048
Which means I was wrong.

590
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,717
But I'm wrong all the time.

591
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,053
My mistakes don't
prove there's a God.

592
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,639
You came a long way to see me.

593
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,269
You gonna put her life
in God's hands or in mine?

594
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,822
Ready?

595
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,619
I better not see you praying.

596
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,747
I don't want to have
to fight for credit on this.

597
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,502
Exiting the femoral,
entering the aortic arch.

598
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,586
This is where...

599
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,671
Where we stopped to
have a picnic last week.

600
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,256
Her blood pressure's rising!

601
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,593
Mine's rising, too. Of course,
I am doing battle with a deity.

602
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,680
In the heart.

603
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,351
Injecting the dye.

604
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,649
Right coronary flow is unobstructed.
Left coronary flow looks normal.

605
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,775
Looks like you're wrong.

606
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:57,238
Either I'm right or this test
is about to go very bad.

607
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,870
What's that?

608
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,045
She has one, two,
a third ostium!

609
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,632
How many is she
supposed to have? Dos.

610
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,261
All the third one's doing is causing
inflammation, throwing off clots,

611
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,971
getting in the way
of the angiogram.

612
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,139
No human would
screw up that big.

613
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,724
Don't worry.

614
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,102
Just one more surgery,
it'll be fine.

615
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,854
Thank God!

616
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,690
Don't make me slap you!

617
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,330
Hi.

618
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:49,915
It's Tuesday.

619
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,505
No, it's Monday.

620
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,592
I know, I just...

621
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,345
I didn't feel like waiting.

622
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,485
I hear you got
another satisfied customer.

623
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,282
One more and I get
a set of steak knives.

624
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,623
Well, this is it.

625
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,670
I appreciate
the opportunity you gave me.

626
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,339
Didn't do it for you.

627
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,508
Thought you were
the best guy for the job.

628
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,802
Thanks, I guess.

629
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,513
Which is why
I want you to stay.

630
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,645
You're an important part
of the team.

631
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,396
I need you.

632
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,905
I know. But I don't need you.

633
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,865
And I definitely
don't wanna be you.

634
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,033
You're miserable.

635
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,410
I just solved
a case by predicting

636
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,704
a never-before-seen
heart defect.

637
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,456
A case you couldn't solve.

638
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,749
A case you gave up on.

639
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,250
I couldn't be happier.

640
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,543
For two minutes, maybe.

641
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,420
Until the next case
comes along.

642
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,464
Until you're jonesing
for your next fix.

643
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,384
This woman talks while
in full cardiac arrest

644
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,678
and you're more excited
about the talking than the heart dying!

645
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,929
The two were connected.

646
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,806
I don't wanna solve cases.

647
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,391
I wanna save lives.

648
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,142
Do you think she cares?

649
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,144
Do you think the husband cares?

650
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,479
You think the children
she can now have

651
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,023
because of me are gonna care
why I saved her?

652
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,275
- I care.
- About yourself!

653
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,986
- About your own ego!
- House.

654
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,613
You're the selfish bastard,
not me,

655
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,323
which is why you took
so much pleasure in drawing out

656
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,569
this little goodbye of yours
for the last three weeks.

657
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,327
It wasn't for me,
it wasn't for anyone!

658
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,371
It sure as hell
didn't help anyone!

659
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,472
Nice try.

660
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,101
Nice tries are worthless.

661
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,255
You now have
a bigger office than I do.

662
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,966
Why don't you go enjoy it?

663
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,096
Better be naked pictures.

664
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,890
My resignation letter.

665
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,025
I've gotten
all I can from this job.

666
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,446
What do you expect me to do?

667
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,116
Break down and apologize?
Beg Chase to come back?

668
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,576
No.

669
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,537
I expect you to do
what you always do.

670
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,498
I expect you to
make a joke and go on.

671
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,544
I expect you to be just fine.

672
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,633
I'll miss you.

673
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,688
Genuine American cigars.

674
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,857
You guys can't
get them in Cuba.

675
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,526
100% healthy.

676
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,402
Shouldn't you go home?

677
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,155
Patient follow-up.
Very important.

678
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,161
She looks great.
I think she's sleeping.

679
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,582
She is sleeping,
I double-check.

680
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,380
So, they all quit?

681
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,842
Two of them quit.
I fired the third.

682
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,760
It must be very hard
to lose your people.

683
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,096
You must be very upset.

684
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,141
Yeah, I must be.

685
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,060
But you're not?

686
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,771
I don't think I am.

687
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,360
I think I'm okay.

688
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,821
What are you going to do?

689
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,616
God only knows.
