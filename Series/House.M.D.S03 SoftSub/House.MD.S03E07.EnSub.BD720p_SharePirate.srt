1
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,265
- See you Tuesday.
- How about right now?

2
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,726
What? What?

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,437
You wanna throw in the towel?

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,897
No, I don't wanna
throw in the... towel!

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,233
I thought that's what you said!

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,519
I'm not upset about anything!

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,906
Where the... are we going?

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:32,865
What are you doing down here?

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,702
I thought you usually
had lunch with Coma Guy.

10
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:39,080
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,124
Hey, hey, tell him
about those Sherpas

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,543
you dropped acid with
in Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

13
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,422
You stole my prescription pad
and you forged my name.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,843
- What did you tell the cop?
- I lied.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,449
They'd have put you away
for 10 years,

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,680
after they took your license
to practice medicine.

17
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,056
So, everything's good, then.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,142
I lied. To the cops.

19
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,977
There is no case
unless they can prove

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,896
that either I got the drugs illegally
or I sold them illegally.

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,107
I didn't do the second,
you lied about the first. Game over.

22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,859
Yeah, Tritter's just playing.

23
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,528
He's gonna see how clever you are
and then just walk away.

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,113
The important thing is
that you keep prescribing

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,116
the same amount of drugs to me
or it'll look suspicious.

26
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,117
Here's another way
to look at it,

27
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,327
having forced me
to lie to the police,

28
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:22,039
your first concern
is securing your drug connection.

29
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,255
Joining my father for lunch?

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,360
I should have called ahead
for a table.

31
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,508
Dr. House was just...

32
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,302
Enjoying a Reuben.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,845
It's okay.

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:40,057
After 10 years, anything that'll
get doctors in the same room as...

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,394
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,146
What are you doing?

37
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,733
Chips?

38
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,197
Wanna see something
really cool?

39
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,289
I saw you leaving last Tuesday.

40
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,584
You practically
tripped over two guys on your way out,

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,753
but you had no problem
opening doors.

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,546
It's called akinetopsia.

43
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,632
You can't see things
when they move.

44
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,135
Now, since you haven't been hit by
a bus, I assume that it's intermittent.

45
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,553
It's probably
accompanied by seizures,

46
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,057
which made me think that
I could set one off by flashing the...

47
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,148
God, I love this family.

48
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
I can see fine now.

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,527
I've had seizures before.
Most of the time they're small.

50
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,281
Doctors ran me through all the tests.
Couldn't find anything.

51
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,491
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

52
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,535
The only things I know
that run in my family are

53
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,414
a lot of chutzpah
and the ability to sleep for 10 years.

54
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,374
Although
I'm not really an expert.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,334
Dad never really liked
my mother's side of the family,

56
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,547
and after she died and he came here
I was raised by a guardian.

57
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,758
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with them.

58
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,427
How about your father's side
of the family?

59
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,874
Any relatives
we could speak with?

60
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,430
My father was an only child.

61
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,931
And my grandparents are dead.

62
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,266
Well, who did you put down

63
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,102
as the person the hospital
should contact in an emergency?

64
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,270
I left it blank.

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,938
There's gotta be someone,
a friend...

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,273
I have plenty of friends.

67
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,609
Just no one that would care
if I was here.

68
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,197
Say, do you mind passing me
my backpack?

69
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,714
Hair of the dog.

70
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,010
Could be infection.

71
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,303
Or a brain tumor.

72
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,346
Says he had a CT.

73
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,556
What's wrong
with the simplest explanation? Trauma?

74
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,933
He didn't report any injuries.

75
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,060
He didn't report
being an alcoholic, either.

76
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,437
Drinking equals falling down
equals trauma equals...

77
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,855
Maybe it's inherited.

78
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,651
How would you jump to genetics
from his EEG?

79
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,362
All you've got are some vaguely
epileptiform waves.

80
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,615
It's not his EEG.
It's his father's.

81
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,785
When it comes to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

82
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,411
Small seizures
aren't unheard of

83
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,746
in a patient
in a vegetative state.

84
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,373
Similarities
are interesting, though.

85
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,124
What caused
the vegetative state?

86
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,876
His house burned down.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,544
Went back in to get his wife,

88
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,296
firefighters
found him unconscious

89
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,465
three feet from the bedroom,
asphyxiated.

90
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,425
Not an inherited condition.

91
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,179
Test his DNA. Start with
adrenomyeloneuropathy.

92
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,348
Check out the home.

93
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,064
He has a single bed.

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,066
They still make single beds?

95
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,712
It could mean
he just doesn't have sex,

96
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,028
though there were condoms
in the apartment.

97
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,615
House asked you to check out
the home for toxins.

98
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,951
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

99
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,036
MRI and LP
are both inconclusive.

100
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,997
Infection's still possible,
tumor's less likely, but...

101
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,207
- DNA?
- The adrenomyeloneuropathy test

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,292
- was negative.
- DNA test again.

103
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,712
Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

104
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,296
Genetic tests take forever.

105
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,381
You can't keep testing

106
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,341
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

107
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,594
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.

108
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,102
You said no one's been sick but
what about delivery people, repair guy?

109
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,563
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

110
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,982
Haven't been to the office
in over a month.

111
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,108
Visitors?

112
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,526
Haven't had any.

113
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,445
The only person
I've seen in the last week

114
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,781
was the pizza delivery guy
and he looked pretty healthy.

115
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,576
There's gotta be someone
you're close to.

116
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,205
Actually, the person
I see most often is my father.

117
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,460
He's asleep
so he can't stop me.

118
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,757
What is it?

119
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,092
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

120
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,389
I think his liver's failing.

121
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,060
God. Does that mean that I'm...

122
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,565
We need a central line kit,

123
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,651
two units of packed red blood cells
type O Negative.

124
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,155
He's unconscious
and heading for a coma.

125
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,990
He's at a four
on the RLAS scale.

126
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,452
Stop all treatment.

127
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,121
You think this is a reaction
to our meds?

128
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,457
Well, they're obviously
not helping.

129
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,000
Given the fact
that he's an alcoholic,

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,336
there's a good chance
his liver wasn't so hot when he came in.

131
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,838
Anti-seizure drugs could have
just pushed him over the edge.

132
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,424
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

133
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,634
I was hoping you'd know.

134
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:10,054
It may be academic,
I just started him on dialysis.

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,891
Kidney and liver failure.
Not too many people come back from that.

136
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,227
Trauma's out of the picture.
Could still be infection.

137
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,270
- Or neurological...
- Or genetic.

138
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,816
We need a better history.

139
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,070
Did you miss the part
where the patient lost consciousness?

140
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,406
L-dopa?

141
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,910
You're not waking Kyle.
You're waking his father.

142
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,912
I commend
your observational skills.

143
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,163
You have no reason to think

144
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,415
any amount of drugs
will wake a man from a coma.

145
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,292
Vegetative state. Much easier.

146
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,420
This guy's no Terri Schiavo,
his brain's all there, he moves around,

147
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,131
his muscles
have barely atrophied.

148
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,383
He's just waiting
for a fairy-tale kiss.

149
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,136
After I do that,
I'll stick a needle in him.

150
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,141
The amount of amphetamines alone
would be dangerous,

151
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,268
besides whatever the hell else
you've got in there.

152
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,520
There are reports
out of South Africa

153
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,941
about a pill that would temporarily
revive someone in a vegetative state.

154
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,986
You've all seen Awakenings,
made me cry.

155
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,362
I wanna cry.

156
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,573
Put the syringe down.

157
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,994
I can outdraw you,
mysterious stranger.

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,246
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

159
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,623
Be reasonable.
There's no way this is gonna work.

160
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,376
Even if you woke him,
it would only be for a few hours.

161
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,253
A day, two at the most.

162
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,796
You're risking his life.

163
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,465
I'm risking getting sued,
that's the only objection here.

164
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,135
You'll be torturing him
and his family.

165
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,638
Well, good news for Legal, the only
family he's got is upstairs dying.

166
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,806
Hey!

167
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,901
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

168
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,611
I want someone with him
at all times

169
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,070
to make sure
you didn't kill him.

170
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,489
I want your ass in my office.

171
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,911
God, I'm starving.

172
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,958
I could really go for a steak.

173
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,342
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you are?

174
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,387
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name of this hospital.

175
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,223
How much are three and five?

176
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,642
Eight.

177
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,854
Also known as half of 16,
a quarter of 32, two to the third power.

178
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,523
Coolest thing ever.

179
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,943
Any history of seizure
in your family?

180
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,694
- No.
- Liver disease?

181
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,779
No.

182
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,198
How long have I been here? I...

183
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,117
I got the feeling
it's been a long time.

184
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,118
Interesting.

185
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,621
Your internal clock
kept ticking.

186
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,123
How deep
does that awareness go?

187
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,625
Pick up scraps
of conversations?

188
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,584
Do you have the vague sense

189
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,128
that the hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

190
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,382
Or that the new Star Wars movies
were a disappointment?

191
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,679
I know my wife is dead.

192
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,768
I don't know
how long it's been.

193
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,856
Ten years.

194
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
What's the last thing
you remember?

195
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,075
The fire.

196
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,996
My wife was in the bedroom,
she had taken a sleeping pill.

197
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,874
I got Kyle out,
went back in for her.

198
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,962
I knew I didn't make it.

199
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,213
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,092
What about your wife's side of the
family? Any history of seizures there?

201
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,095
Your son Kyle
is a patient here.

202
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,433
I'm afraid his condition is serious.
He may be dying.

203
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,939
No seizure issues
on my wife's side, either.

204
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,860
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

205
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,161
Rumor in the cafeteria
was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.

206
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,871
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy

207
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,498
was woken by,
yeah, Caustic Guy.

208
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,499
So what happened?

209
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,794
I gotta get him a steak
before I can ask him any more questions.

210
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,171
He doesn't wanna talk
about his son?

211
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,132
Didn't seem to emotionally register
that his son is sick.

212
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,300
Brain issue?

213
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,969
He was asphyxiated,
spent 10 years as asparagus,

214
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,263
- who knows what damage is in there.
- It's possible.

215
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,640
Of course there's always
the simple explanation.

216
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,893
Maybe he just
doesn't like his son.

217
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,853
Only in your world
would that be simple.

218
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,022
The delusion
that fathering a child

219
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,524
installs a permanent geyser
of unconditional love...

220
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,110
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional, not everyone's.

221
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,362
Well, of course,
that would play into

222
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,728
your romantic vision
of human...

223
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,198
In terms you would understand,

224
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,824
we have
an evolutionary incentive

225
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,451
to sacrifice for our offspring.

226
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,829
Our tribe, our friends.
Keep them safe.

227
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,083
Except for all the people
who don't.

228
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,251
Everything is conditional.

229
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,214
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

230
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,393
Mind if we talk
for a few minutes?

231
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,314
How many pills would you say
Dr. House takes a day?

232
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,567
I'm uncomfortable
setting a number.

233
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,027
Well, try.

234
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,238
Six.

235
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,782
A day?

236
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,663
Has he ever had you
write prescriptions for him?

237
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,290
No. What is it
you want me to say?

238
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,817
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital,

239
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,046
or he takes too few because
he's selling them on the side?

240
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,506
Either one is ridiculous.

241
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,217
I meant the former.

242
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,635
You're wrong.

243
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,973
Can I ask what Dr. House has done
to deserve your loyalty?

244
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,933
He's not known as a great boss.

245
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,476
He's not even much of a friend.

246
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,771
Look how he left
Dr. Wilson holding the bag.

247
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,945
It's odd.
You don't know about that?

248
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:05,742
You defend him, and he won't even
tell you what's happening in his life.

249
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,589
I was paged.

250
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,048
We saw you with the cop.

251
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,509
- What'd he want?
- How many pills does House take,

252
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,677
did I ever write him
a prescription?

253
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,262
That sort of stuff.

254
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,557
- I told him six.
- A day or in a mouthful?

255
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,601
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with...

256
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,227
He wants to talk to us, too?

257
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,812
You're next.

258
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,191
We've gotta tell House
what's going on.

259
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,109
- Tritter says no.
- Then no it is.

260
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,404
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

261
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,823
Quick. What's the kid's status?

262
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,949
I gotta get back to our sleeper

263
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,911
before he goes looking
for the orgasmatron.

264
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,540
See, if that were rhetorical,

265
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,501
it would mean that I can just
turn around and leave now,

266
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,252
which I'm not doing,
from which you should deduce...

267
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,838
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

268
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,840
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

269
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,967
He's still sliding into coma.

270
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,148
Your barber sucks.

271
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,569
Hey, Coma Diet,

272
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
I could make a fortune.

273
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,989
Vegetative State Diet.

274
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,241
Who gave you your clothes?

275
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,742
Dr. Cuddy.

276
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,869
I guess I'll need
all new ones, anyway.

277
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,621
Everything went in the fire.

278
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,872
Don't worry about it.

279
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,251
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

280
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,170
Your son's measles vaccination,

281
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,005
do you remember if he had it,
what type it was?

282
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,383
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

283
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,178
You weren't gonna tell me,
were you?

284
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,304
I don't need new clothes.

285
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,182
Dr. Cuddy says my body
will adjust to the drugs,

286
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,226
that I'll be
a vegetable again by tomorrow.

287
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,979
If I'm really lucky,
the day after.

288
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,481
Yeah.

289
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,816
If I've got a day to live,

290
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,193
I'm not gonna spend it in a hospital
room being grilled.

291
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,987
Come on, where you gonna go?

292
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,991
Your house burned down,
your wife's dead. Business was sold off.

293
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:13,120
The only thing you have left is down
the hall, heading for a liver biopsy.

294
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:20,210
Used to be this little hole in the wall
run by a guy named Giancarlo.

295
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,213
Made the best hoagies
in the world.

296
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,592
Real Italian rolls,
prosciutto, provolone...

297
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,597
How far is Atlantic City
from here?

298
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,100
You have one day to live,
and you want a sandwich?

299
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,185
People on death row
get a last meal.

300
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,480
The state provides it.
Who's providing for you?

301
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,734
You got a car? Money?

302
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,321
You're negotiating with me.

303
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,913
Take out another 100 for me.
And I need your car.

304
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,665
I'm not doing you any favors.

305
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,376
You'll get it back tomorrow.
Two days, max.

306
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,794
Road trip.

307
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,179
This is like trying
to control the weather,

308
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,389
but I'd prefer it
if you didn't eat in the car,

309
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,016
I just had it detailed.

310
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,809
- I drive.
- Oh, the hell he does.

311
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,061
Sure.

312
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,731
Aside from the fact he just woke up
from a vegetative state,

313
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,057
the guy doesn't have a license.

314
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,652
How about this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

315
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,237
You know how to do that. Chips.

316
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,076
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

317
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,828
Right now his reflexes are better
than Dale Earnhardt Jr's.

318
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,665
What's this? It says ipod.

319
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,211
I'm coming.

320
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,304
So let's talk about
toxic exposure.

321
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,812
What was wrong with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

322
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,398
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

323
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,857
Raspberry cocaine.

324
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,819
This house that burned down,
where was it?

325
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,278
Moorestown, New Jersey.

326
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,990
Listen, I really need to know about the
candy because I'm allergic to berries.

327
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,077
You didn't mention that.

328
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,576
Is it significant?

329
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,912
No. So where else did you live?

330
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,081
List everywhere,
including vacations,

331
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,874
start with
when your wife got pregnant.

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,378
We lived in Jersey. Then we moved
to Jersey, from there, Jersey.

333
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,548
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage in the Amazon

334
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,800
with the mosquitoes
and the lead paint all over the walls?

335
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,093
Yes.

336
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,845
You know what?

337
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,930
I didn't let you come along
so you could suck all the fun

338
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,057
out of my one day of life.

339
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,352
Well, you're outta luck,
because that's totally why I'm here.

340
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,481
Okay, rule change.

341
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,943
Person with the money makes the rules.
Or in this case,

342
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,405
the person who's friends with the person
with the money makes the rules.

343
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,241
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

344
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,368
All right, so here's the game.

345
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,120
Ask whatever you want.

346
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,707
But for every question I answer,
you have to answer one first.

347
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,959
Why would you care
about anything I have to say?

348
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,379
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

349
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,258
I had a factory
with over 200 employees.

350
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,260
People listened when I talked.

351
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,637
I liked power.

352
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:25,020
Now, the only power I have left
is the power to annoy you.

353
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,320
I took Wilson's assistant
for coffee.

354
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,947
- Why?
- Something Tritter said.

355
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,365
She told me the police think

356
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,119
that House stole Wilson's
prescription pad and forged his name.

357
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,872
You believe it?

358
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,083
- Do you?
- Well, absolutely I do.

359
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

360
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,296
He's not gonna steal his best friend's
pad, jeopardize his career.

361
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,673
Until his best friend
says no to him.

362
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
House is a junkie.

363
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,136
Junkies do whatever they have to do
to get what they need.

364
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,933
Kyle's down to a three
on the RLAS scale.

365
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,894
He's only showing
localized response.

366
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,773
I'll call House, tell him
we're gonna need an answer soon.

367
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,277
Get in your right lane for 295.

368
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,571
And pass me the Twizzlers.

369
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,410
- I'm curious...
- No, you're not.

370
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,204
Why would
a man's first instinct

371
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,206
be to drive away
from the only family he's got?

372
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,584
No, this is no time
for you to do your thing.

373
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,795
We don't care about his state of mind,
we don't care if he's happy.

374
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,422
This factory of yours,
what did you make?

375
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,303
So ask me a question.

376
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm thinking.

377
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,557
Only six left, by the way.

378
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,393
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor, you need a pen.

379
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,644
What is up with you two?

380
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,939
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me out of the big house.

381
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,482
Are you out of your mind?

382
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,150
Well, who's he gonna tell?

383
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,571
By tomorrow night he's gonna be
a mindless stalk of celery.

384
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,407
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

385
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,908
What did you make
in your factory?

386
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,451
Luxury boats.

387
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,954
Have you ever been in love?

388
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,955
Wow!

389
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,916
Going right for the clostes
with the embarrassing stuff. Good move.

390
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,002
Yes. Describe the boats.

391
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,755
Thirty-five to 65-foot hulls, twin
engines, parquet floors in the galley,

392
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,883
staterooms with queen beds.

393
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,219
- How'd you meet?
- She shot me.

394
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,890
These boats, I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?

395
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,683
Naturally. Shot you?

396
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,520
Paintball.
Doctors versus lawyers.

397
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,022
Did you ever take your son
to the factory?

398
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,234
Sure. He used to run all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

399
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,528
Ever love anybody else?

400
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,449
No more questions,
I got my answer.

401
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,328
While Dad's in the office,
his son's watching them spray-paint.

402
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,121
And what kid wears a mask?

403
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,999
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

404
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,365
You're saying this is my fault?

405
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,461
Mercury poisoning
explains the seizures

406
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,463
and the liver's like
a big soup strainer.

407
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,215
The soup runs through,
chicken dumplings stay.

408
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,425
For soup, read blood,
for chicken...

409
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,385
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

410
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,720
Sits more or less idle

411
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:07,182
until your kid
pours tequila shooters into his liver.

412
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,977
When the liver goes, takes out
the kidneys, explains everything.

413
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,978
Yeah, it's me.

414
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,065
Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.

415
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,150
Chase,
start heavy metal chelation

416
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
while we're waiting
for results.

417
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,363
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the...

418
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,156
Where is he?

419
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,659
The lab.

420
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,874
How many pills
does he take a day?

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,461
It's hard to say,
pain levels vary over time...

422
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,673
Could be six, eight, ten.

423
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,092
Ever write
any prescriptions for him?

424
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,635
- Yes.
- Why?

425
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,178
Did he tell you to?

426
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,180
He asked me to.

427
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,485
Medicine attracts people
who are attracted to power.

428
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:05,198
I know how he hates
when he is defied by a patient.

429
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,744
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

430
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,830
Now you correct me
if I'm wrong,

431
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,458
but I don't think
Dr. House asks for anything.

432
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,420
I think he takes it.

433
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:23,425
And I think that you are stuck
lying to the police

434
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,513
to cover up something
you didn't wanna do.

435
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,774
We have been up and down
St. James like a Monopoly car.

436
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,737
It's not here.
Giancarlo has left the building.

437
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,159
We can still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

438
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,454
No. We've come this far,
I'm getting the hoagie.

439
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,250
If your son does
have mercury poisoning,

440
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,456
there's a good chance
he'll respond to the chelation.

441
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,421
You might be able to have
a few minutes with him before you lapse.

442
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,090
Why are you so concerned
about me?

443
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,011
Deep inside Wilson believes
that if he cares enough

444
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,804
he'll never have to die.

445
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,182
Your behavior isn't normal.

446
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,350
And you would know normal?

447
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,562
What could he have done
that you won't forgive after 10 years?

448
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,606
When this is your last chance?

449
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,942
My son is what he is.

450
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,945
His mother's side,
all drunken losers.

451
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,782
He's gone the same way.

452
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,495
House told you drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

453
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,788
I just said that.

454
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,164
But you didn't hear
him say that

455
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,333
until after
we left the hospital.

456
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,959
So why did you leave?

457
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,464
Maybe your son
takes after your side.

458
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,884
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

459
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,719
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

460
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,807
We're in Atlantic City
and my time's not up yet.

461
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,267
We find a hotel with a casino.

462
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,400
BP's starting to drop.

463
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,569
O2-sat's down to 70.

464
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,534
Point-three milligrams
of epi in.

465
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,285
What are you trying to do,
make him bleed faster?

466
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,246
Check the pulse.

467
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,456
It's not his liver.

468
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,876
It's the heart.

469
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,087
I understand he's a French chef

470
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,047
but I'm sure
he can handle this.

471
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,091
You need a 12-inch
Italian roll,

472
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:32,262
oregano vinegar, no,
not balsamic vinegar, oregano vinegar.

473
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,306
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

474
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,267
Game's still on.

475
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,686
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

476
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,729
What other questions
would you care about?

477
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,096
If you each had
one day to live,

478
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,651
you'd look for one last meal and House
would look for one last answer.

479
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,029
No, can you just
send the ingredients up here

480
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,157
and I'll make it myself.

481
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,578
Last 10 years,
how much awareness did you have?

482
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,622
I don't know,
I knew it wasn't the next day.

483
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,249
I knew that...

484
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,085
I recognized your voice.

485
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,796
How often were you in my room?

486
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,340
No, you're wasting a question.

487
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,508
I have a better one.

488
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,970
Why steal my pad?

489
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,806
Oh, my God, you're right.
I'm an addict.

490
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,391
Thanks for opening my eyes.

491
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,351
No, I mean why my pad?

492
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,771
Foreman, Cameron and Chase's pads
are just as convenient.

493
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,774
But their association with you
is involuntary, they're employees.

494
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,693
I associate with you
through choice

495
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,445
and any relationship
that involves choice

496
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,239
you have to see
how far you can push before it breaks.

497
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,657
This is easy.

498
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,119
You ask the questions,
answer them and make tasty snacks.

499
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,914
Let's go try the casino.

500
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,874
And one day
our friendship will break

501
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,336
and that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional

502
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,214
and you don't need
human connection or deserve it,

503
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,300
or whatever goes on
in that rat-maze of your brain.

504
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,594
Sorry, if I'd known
he was gonna be this annoying,

505
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,262
I would have stolen
Dr. Cameron's pad

506
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,181
and Dr. Foreman's car.

507
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,226
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

508
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,562
House's House of Whining,
state your complaint.

509
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,368
The patient's BP
just dropped like a stone.

510
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,273
Do an echo.

511
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,858
Mercury isn't likely
to damage the...

512
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,026
It didn't.

513
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,861
Mercury test was negative.

514
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,990
Do an echo.

515
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,457
I was wrong.
Your son's still dying.

516
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,378
I need to go over
every relative you ever had. Again.

517
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,422
And this time, forget their diseases,
just tell me how they died.

518
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,508
And we don't have time
to take turns.

519
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,843
You give me the answers,
you get a big one at the end.

520
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,303
You can go
for whatever you want.

521
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,889
Destroy my privacy, my dignity.

522
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,231
Your grandmother?

523
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,483
Heat exhaustion,
Fourth of July picnic.

524
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,985
The woman was 92.

525
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,529
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

526
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,281
that used to be
on St. James Place?

527
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,533
You sister-in-law
with the diabetes.

528
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,034
As far as you know, is she still alive?

529
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,744
She's not. She was killed
in a traffic accident

530
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,496
driving home
from a Phillies game.

531
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,123
I'm sure a lot of beer
was consumed.

532
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,041
- The Phillies lost.
- Your father?

533
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,294
Old age.
Heart finally gave out.

534
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,670
Your wife's father?

535
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,506
Hit-and-run,
walking the incontinent dog.

536
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,301
Hi, do you guys deliver?

537
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,849
Let me put it this way,

538
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,973
if you deliver, there'll be
a $100 tip in it for you.

539
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,267
Excellent.

540
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,770
- Victory.
- The night is finally going my way.

541
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,148
Wilson, toss me a soda.

542
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,873
Shall we go somewhere to talk?

543
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,083
House is an ass.

544
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,336
But he obviously needs
pain medication,

545
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,879
and how much pain
one person feels

546
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,340
is not a call
the government should be making.

547
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,508
So you think
I'm a bureaucrat with a badge

548
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,719
following
some arbitrary guideline.

549
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,804
Yeah, I do.

550
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,559
So you're saying
I should just trust him. Do you?

551
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,313
- You're not qualified to make that...
- I'm not sure you are, either.

552
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,148
I've been a cop for 20 years.

553
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,114
And not a day goes by

554
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,737
that someone doesn't try
to sell me some self-serving story.

555
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,615
If you had my job, you'd know.

556
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,743
Everybody lies.

557
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,044
I think
you've run out of relatives.

558
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,130
So, it's my turn.

559
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,261
Why did you become a doctor?

560
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,805
That's the big question?

561
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,724
I give you complete license
to humiliate me

562
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,226
and that's the best you can do.

563
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,312
Well, okay, let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

564
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,606
No, no, no.
You're a curious guy.

565
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,984
You like to figure things out,
why not go into research?

566
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,820
Why work with people when you

567
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,531
obviously hate people?

568
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,450
Oedipal fixation.

569
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,785
I was seeking my mother's love

570
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,112
and she thought that Ben Casey
was just the dreamiest...

571
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:12,208
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need any more answers from me?

572
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,418
Give me a hard time.

573
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,470
When I was 14,

574
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,057
my father was stationed
in Japan.

575
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,561
I went rock-climbing
with this kid from school.

576
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,106
He fell and got injured
and I had to bring him to the hospital.

577
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,818
And we came in through
the wrong entrance

578
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
and passed this guy
in the hall.

579
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,781
He was a janitor.

580
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,200
My friend came down
with an infection

581
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,995
and the doctors didn't know
what to do.

582
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,830
So they brought in

583
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,916
the janitor.

584
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,337
He was a doctor.

585
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,883
And a buraku.

586
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,428
One of Japan's untouchables.

587
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,516
His ancestors
had been slaughterers, gravediggers.

588
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:12,935
And this guy,

589
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,523
he knew that he wasn't
accepted by the staff, didn't even try.

590
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,860
He didn't dress well,
he didn't pretend to be one of them.

591
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,071
The people around that place,

592
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,908
they didn't think
he had anything they wanted,

593
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,870
except when they needed him.

594
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,332
Because he was right.

595
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,836
Which meant
that nothing else mattered.

596
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,048
And they had to listen to him.

597
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,476
Thank you.

598
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,982
Need 20 milligrams of diazepam
in a syringe.

599
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,116
Heartbeat's irregular
and accelerating.

600
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,701
- He's at 200.
- He's gonna crash.

601
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,161
Allergic reaction
to the diazepam?

602
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,120
Better hope so.

603
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,082
It's either that
or his heart's done.

604
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,466
What happened
on the night of the fire?

605
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,932
Yeah. I'm sure it's a stressful,
emotional question.

606
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,100
Suck it up.

607
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,189
My wife had taken a sleeping pill
and gone to bed.

608
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,155
It was Christmas Eve.

609
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:44,277
I let Kyle pop corn
in the fireplace.

610
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,614
He managed to knock loose
some tinder.

611
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,741
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

612
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,160
It spread so fast.

613
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,079
I got Kyle out and...

614
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,999
When I went back in for...

615
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,921
You're a disappointment.

616
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,176
You act as though
you don't need anybody, you...

617
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,345
You just blame your son
for what happened.

618
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,265
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

619
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,267
You don't blame a kid
for an accident.

620
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,019
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

621
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,062
Because it wouldn't matter.

622
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,024
I failed
to keep my family safe.

623
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,736
I couldn't stop the fire,
I couldn't save my wife,

624
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,573
now you want me to stick around watching
while I fail to save my son.

625
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,242
Thank you so much
for waking me up.

626
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,460
How did your son
dislodge the tinder?

627
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,087
God...

628
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,301
He dropped the popcorn tray.

629
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,596
He had been complaining it was
too heavy, I should have listened.

630
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,058
And the hit-and-run,
walking the pissy dog.

631
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,768
That happen at night?

632
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,353
I think so, yeah, why?

633
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,022
Car accident
after the Phillies lost.

634
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,523
Night game?

635
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,778
Ragged-red fiber.

636
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,196
It's an inherited condition.

637
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,366
Dropping things, muscle weakness,
poor night vision.

638
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:17,286
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone, careless.

639
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,789
It's transmitted
in mitochondrial DNA

640
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,749
so it only passes
through the mother.

641
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,294
Your wife's family
weren't drunks, they were sick.

642
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,004
It wouldn't have
affected his liver.

643
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,673
The kid is a drunk.

644
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,882
He thinks that
he killed his mother

645
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,967
and turned his father
into a vegetable.

646
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,220
I might have
a few shots myself.

647
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,597
Foreman.

648
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,725
Test his DNA
for ragged-red fiber.

649
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,371
- It's not gonna...
- Here's a thought.

650
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,397
Why don't we not assume that the test
is negative until we actually do it?

651
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,192
House, the kid
has severe cardiomyopathy.

652
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:52,071
Alcoholic,
no shot at a transplant.

653
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,865
So yeah, maybe you figured out why,
good for you, but

654
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,369
he's gonna die anyway.

655
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,188
I want to give Kyle my heart.

656
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:35,197
This thing, whatever it is,
you said he gets it from the mother.

657
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,490
My heart's fine.

658
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,910
And it could go on being fine
for the rest of your life.

659
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,038
Yeah, it's not like he's gonna
do anything with it.

660
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,498
Well, you woke him up once,

661
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,251
maybe someone'll come up
with some other answer.

662
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,879
We've both seen breakthroughs
no one expected.

663
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,925
And ragged-red fiber's
treatable, but not curable.

664
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,387
Even if he gets your heart,
there's no guarantee.

665
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,183
He's my kid.

666
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,102
No!

667
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,021
Did you really expect
a different answer?

668
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,816
We have arranged transplants
before when a patient is near death.

669
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:15,446
Except he isn't near death, he's saying,
"Kill me and cut out my heart."

670
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,198
Are you out of your mind?

671
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,160
Fine.
I'll think of something else.

672
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,788
I'm sorry.

673
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,473
Wilson, get out.

674
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,019
No.

675
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,983
You lied to the cops
enough for me.

676
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,574
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

677
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,724
Pills are the simplest.

678
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,231
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

679
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,361
I'm okay with pain.

680
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,866
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck,

681
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,452
which means this'll be slow.

682
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,585
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car right now

683
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,671
and broke the speed limit driving back,
would I?

684
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,215
No.

685
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,136
Tell him...

686
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,939
I don't know what to tell him.

687
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,740
I think it's my turn
to ask a question, isn't it?

688
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,283
I don't think so.

689
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,745
'Cause you just asked me that thing
about the speed limit.

690
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,042
What do you wanna know?

691
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,712
If you could hear one thing
from your father, what would it be?

692
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,215
It wouldn't help you.

693
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,175
Try me.

694
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,599
I'd want him to say,

695
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,646
"You were right."

696
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,024
"You did the right thing."

697
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,363
Yeah. It doesn't help.

698
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,297
- Hi.
- Hi.

699
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,884
I'm Dr. Wilson.

700
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,220
I'm Mrs. Schaffer.

701
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,972
I'm from Princeton.

702
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,559
My husband and I and our three children
live in Philadelphia.

703
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,359
So, do you like to swing?

704
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,154
No.

705
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,783
Well, if you
change your mind, I'm in...

706
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,162
House? House?

707
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,748
Is it room 622, 642?

708
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,083
622.

709
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,379
- 662.
- Yeah.

710
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,979
Alibi.

711
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,941
I figured.

712
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,325
They found an open bottle of aspirin
by the body.

713
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:17,623
Lucky he had a headache,
reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

714
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,375
Lucky.

715
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,765
That can't be all.

716
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,393
Well, you got a heart
out of it.

717
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,521
How many organs
do you want from the guy?

718
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,440
I mean, my father
must have said something.

719
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,692
He couldn't just...

720
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,571
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

721
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,745
He said you were right.

722
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,748
You did the right thing.

723
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,879
Right about what?

724
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,758
What does that mean?

725
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,971
How would I know?
He's your dad.

726
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,528
You know what I found interesting
about this case?

727
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,489
That it proved that people
can love unconditionally

728
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,199
and you can tell yourself
it's not true,

729
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,994
but you'll just end up
in a hotel room in Atlantic City

730
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,412
asking someone
to cut your heart out?

731
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,581
The hoagie.

732
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,000
You thought this guy
was emotionally confused,

733
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,626
and that the hoagie
was just a mask

734
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,671
to hide his real feelings
toward his son.

735
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,047
It was.

736
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,942
Did you know Tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

737
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,010
Yeah.

738
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,999
And yet you moved
Heaven and Earth

739
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,056
to get him that mask
with mustard and prosciutto.

740
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,600
Which one of them told you?

741
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,143
All of them.

742
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,395
Which means that none of them
said anything I have to worry about.

743
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,855
Back to the hoagie.

744
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,065
You think that
my addiction's out of hand.

745
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:11,028
Your need to be needed is so strong
that you'll give people what they want,

746
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,794
what they need,
what they think they need.

747
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,783
I don't think my enabling is anything
you should be complaining about.

748
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,328
Yes, my name
is Dr. James Wilson,

749
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,664
account number 835687.

750
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,792
The ATM says I've got zero...

751
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,296
What does that mean, a hold?

752
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,384
Yeah, okay, thanks.

753
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:43,727
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

754
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,399
They can't keep
your money forever.

755
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,405
No, they can keep it till I agree
to help send you to prison for 10 years.

756
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,162
You're getting dinner.
