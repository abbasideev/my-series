1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,756
I can't do this button.

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,508
You almost got it.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,967
Almost got it.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,599
The sound

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,687
of the people talking...

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,688
Mmm?

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,652
- It's A-flat.
- Is it?

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,071
Well, look how smart
you are, huh?

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,325
Here we go.

10
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,926
Thank you.
I am proud to introduce

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,971
my son to you,
Patrick Obyedkov.

12
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,349
Twenty-five years ago,
Patrick was in the fourth grade,

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,437
a good student,
played Little League

14
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,398
and then there
was the accident.

15
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,525
And here we are,

16
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,696
raising money for people
with similar neurological disabilities.

17
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,490
I hope you enjoy the concert.

18
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,168
You all set?

19
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,836
All set.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,043
He's never missed a note.

21
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,924
Something's wrong.

22
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,643
Patrick, what is it?

23
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,437
My hand, it hurts.

24
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,898
Let me see it.

25
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,984
Oh, Papa.

26
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,656
What's the emergency?

27
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,241
Thirty-five-year-old savant.

28
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,784
Dystonia in his left hand.

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,630
He paged us at 5:00 in
the morning for that?

30
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,539
I'm going back to bed.
Dystonia's not life threatening.

31
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,707
Clonazepam will
take care of it.

32
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,002
He's already on clonazepam
for seizures he has

33
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,628
from a bus accident
when he was 10.

34
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,839
Then we treat with benztropine.

35
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,965
What's up?

36
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,758
Thirty-five-year-old savant.
Dystonia.

37
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,761
I'm going back to bed.

38
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,471
Where you going?

39
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,849
Bathroom. It can wait.

40
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,684
There is no case, House.

41
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,770
Even if dystonia was some
big medical mystery, it's not this time.

42
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,565
You're not intrigued as to how a
perfectly healthy 10-year-old boy

43
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,731
with no prior
musical training gets into an accident

44
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,028
on his way to school
and can suddenly play the piano?

45
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,656
Do we have to solve
a 25-year-old case before breakfast?

46
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,616
You two shower together?

47
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,700
- No.
- No.

48
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,026
Double negative. That's a yes.

49
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,246
Savantism is just
one of those things. It's inexplicable.

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,499
Just because it's inexplicted
doesn't mean it's inexplicable.

51
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,294
I want new labs,
CBC with platelets, chem panel,

52
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,379
thyroid and
adrenal function tests.

53
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,380
For what?

54
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,548
I don't know.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,137
Raise your left hand.

56
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,514
That's your right hand.

57
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,101
What are you looking for?

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,438
Just want to make sure
whatever happened doesn't happen again.

59
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,981
- Push up.
- Push up.

60
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,943
He repeats what people say.
It's a compensation mechanism.

61
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,589
He knows he's supposed
to say something

62
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,571
so he repeats
what he's just heard.

63
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,531
Well, that's good.
Shows he's engaged.

64
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,242
Spine's okay.

65
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,913
All right, stick out your tongue
like this. Copy me.

66
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,623
You have a big tongue.

67
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,001
Hey, I know it's
funny but copy me.

68
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,260
There was
construction on Radcliffe.

69
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,388
So I had to get out of the car

70
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,682
and walk in high
heels for over a mile.

71
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,601
Radcliffe?
What was the cross street?

72
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,769
Does it matter?

73
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,438
I don't know.
I'm not the one who brought it up.

74
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,733
Tie this off. Nice and tight.

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,699
Does this have anything
to do with my foot?

76
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,325
You have a blister.

77
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,703
You don't waste
a doctor's time with a blister.

78
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,747
You waste a doctor's time
with more important things,

79
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,291
like the sewer
that's being vented out of your mouth.

80
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,918
My breath?

81
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,044
If you could stop doing that,
we'd all be grateful.

82
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,296
I can't stop breathing.

83
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,798
Nope. But you can stop puking.

84
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,467
- I don't.
- Your lips say, "No."

85
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,012
Your gnarly fingers say...

86
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,225
He's good to go.

87
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,645
It's a shame.
You look cute that thin.

88
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,442
Motor cortex looks good.
Everything checks out.

89
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,489
What tests did you run?

90
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,569
Full battery of neurological...

91
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,406
I need this blood checked for
cholesterol and glucose levels.

92
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,366
Patient had a foot problem.

93
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,534
Different patient.

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,453
There was no one else in there.

95
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,580
You're using
the wrong equipment.

96
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,635
Dr. Foreman,
I thought we were being discharged.

97
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,887
I'm Dr. House,

98
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,223
and on the off chance
that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it,

99
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,684
I have something
of a gift, too.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,269
Come on.

101
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,578
- Your turn.
- My turn.

102
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,886
Does this have anything to do
with his hand?

103
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,346
It might.

104
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,515
Okay, Patrick. Close your eyes.

105
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,600
What's this?

106
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,021
- D, G-flat, A-flat, B.
- Yeah. All right, all right.

107
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,482
He's good. Can we let him go?

108
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,068
He's great. He's staying.

109
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,680
Call radiology.

110
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,016
We need
a functional MRI on his brain.

111
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,268
FMRI's not gonna show trauma.

112
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,437
We're not looking for trauma.

113
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,439
I want to see the music.

114
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,941
See the music.

115
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
Well, that's dull.

116
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,242
You think the FMRI's
gonna show a big arrow

117
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,287
pointing to a flashing sign
saying "savantism"?

118
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,705
It would be hugely helpful.

119
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,750
Somehow he got rewired
as a music specialist.

120
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,877
I want to know
how that happens.

121
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,755
He has access to parts of
the brain that you don't.

122
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,506
His brain's doing nothing.

123
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,383
He looks like
any jerk listening.

124
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,179
He's not a savant at listening,
he's a savant at playing.

125
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,975
Well, listening and playing are
two different neurological processes.

126
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,980
Turn off the music.

127
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,069
Patrick, I want you to pretend
that your leg's a piano.

128
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,570
My leg's not a piano.

129
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,490
I know.
That's why I said "pretend."

130
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,700
Kid's a moron.

131
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,703
Keep your head still.
Use your fingers.

132
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,935
Wow.

133
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,186
Cool, huh?

134
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,397
His heart rate rose.

135
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,690
Emotional response?

136
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,150
Then why's there no activity
in the limbic system?

137
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,027
Unless there's
a problem with his heart.

138
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,862
Do an echo to confirm.

139
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,615
And scrub up.
He's gonna need surgery.

140
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,411
It wasn't dystonia.

141
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,746
He's got a heart
condition that caused

142
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,581
the arteries in
his arm to constrict.

143
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,918
Do you have any idea
why House would want to go to Boston?

144
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,211
The chowder?

145
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,588
Plane tickets this Friday.

146
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,756
I opened his mail.

147
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,467
I heard there's an opening at
Harvard for Division Chief,

148
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,886
Infectious Disease.

149
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,390
Ambition is not one of his
more prominent traits.

150
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,433
Although...

151
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,059
What?

152
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,437
He was testing
blood in the clinic.

153
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,689
I don't think it
was a patient's blood.

154
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,274
Why? It was green?

155
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,109
No, he was checking
for routine stuff.

156
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,156
Makes sense if he's looking for
basic medical clearance for employment.

157
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,496
I'm going home.

158
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,623
No, you're not.

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,500
He could show up any minute.

160
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,422
Not with a savant
to obsess about.

161
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,221
I'll take in here.
Bedroom's down the hall.

162
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,765
You've been here?

163
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,726
Where else would
the bedroom be?

164
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,687
Come with?

165
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,523
You're scared of
him catching us breaking into his home

166
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,985
but you're not scared of him catching us
doing it in his bed?

167
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,031
If I'm gonna get
fired anyway...

168
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:46,288
Almost at the heart.
Ablating and done.

169
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,792
Heart rate's 160.
It's accelerating.

170
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,251
He's at 210!

171
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,818
He's in
supraventricular tachycardia.

172
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,380
Paddles!

173
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,631
Charging.

174
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,633
Clear!

175
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,677
We're wasting our time.

176
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,180
His high-school yearbook.

177
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,348
Unless you think
he's going to Boston

178
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,714
to attend
a high-school reunion,

179
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,559
put it back and let's get out of here
before he comes home.

180
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,144
He's not smiling.

181
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,021
I wonder if he has teeth.

182
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,523
What's the area
code for Boston?

183
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,108
617, why?

184
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,366
Massachusetts General. May I help you?

185
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,370
Did you think you could steal
Dr. House without a fight?

186
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,329
Steal him for what?

187
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,540
Quit jerking me around.
I know he's coming out there.

188
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,874
We're not looking to hire him.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,720
He's called you six times
in the last month.

190
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,128
We're not looking to hire him.

191
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,380
You think if you keep repeating it,
I'll start believing you?

192
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,173
Dr. Cuddy, there's
nothing else I can say.

193
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,883
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,855
If he's not coming there
for a job interview,

195
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,249
he's either coming
to your hospital

196
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,766
for a social visit or
because he's a patient.

197
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,440
Is it a social visit,
Dr. Medak?

198
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,483
I can't stand House.

199
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,444
Neither can Dr. Coopersmith.

200
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,579
What's up?

201
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,250
Do you know a
Dr. Coopersmith in Boston?

202
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah. He's an oncologist.

203
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,921
What's up?

204
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,175
- What's his subspecialty?
- Brain cancer.

205
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,761
What's going on?

206
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,477
He doesn't look sick.

207
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,895
He should have symptoms.

208
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,608
Blurred vision, headaches,
confusion, clumsiness.

209
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,568
Depends how far
along the cancer is.

210
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,445
What kind, how aggressive.

211
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,280
He didn't tell you?

212
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,283
House is House.

213
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,619
He's no different
than anyone else with cancer.

214
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,331
Once you tell,
then every conversation is about that.

215
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,126
Cardiac arrest
means we were wrong.

216
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,586
There was a heart problem.

217
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,213
But no vasoconstriction.

218
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,174
The heart problem
couldn't have caused the hand problem.

219
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,635
Unless the bleed
happened suddenly.

220
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,179
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia.

221
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,139
Less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

222
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,641
Scope him above and below.

223
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,601
If that doesn't work, gut him.

224
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,272
Can't you sedate him?

225
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,233
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

226
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,901
You look mad, Papa.

227
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,402
No.

228
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,780
No, I'm not mad. I promise you.

229
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,325
It's just that the doctor
has to do something to you and it's...

230
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,868
And it's gonna hurt.

231
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,370
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

232
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,247
Make you better.

233
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,165
What's wrong with me?

234
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,501
Well, they don't know.

235
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,421
Patrick, don't you worry.

236
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,215
Everything is gonna be great.

237
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,581
All right. Here we go, Patrick.

238
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,842
You wanna hurt me.

239
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,053
Hey, open. Like this.

240
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,352
You just look at me
and everything is gonna be okay.

241
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,396
Look at me now.

242
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,481
Patrick.

243
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,818
There you are.
It's okay. It's okay, really.

244
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,447
Dr. Wilson. Wilson!

245
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,491
I just spoke to Cuddy.

246
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,857
She can't confirm whether House

247
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,244
is applying for
a job in Boston.

248
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,996
Yeah. I'm late for a...

249
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,541
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

250
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,141
Pretty.

251
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,895
I wrote this when I was
in junior high school.

252
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,441
Could never figure
out what came next.

253
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,569
Then dimwit came up with this.

254
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,285
It's good.

255
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,203
It's perfect.

256
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,084
I could set up a tower on the roof
during a lightning storm.

257
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,837
Help you switch
brains with your patient.

258
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,673
Then you would be
the brilliant pianist

259
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,344
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer from his friend.

260
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,555
It's nothing.

261
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,059
You need to talk about it.

262
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,685
At least let me look
at your medical file.

263
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,188
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

264
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,149
- Who else knows?
- No one, and cancer isn't nothing.

265
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,443
Sorry. Didn't mean to
offend your specialty.

266
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,694
Why didn't you come to me?

267
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,779
Stein's good.

268
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,156
Stein's in Africa for
the next six months.

269
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,699
He's given me
at least six months.

270
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,494
I go to Boston.
I get the treatment.

271
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,287
Everything will be fine.

272
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,039
No need to talk about it.

273
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,791
You were right.

274
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,501
Surgeon found
a bleed behind the kidney

275
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,213
in the retroperitoneal cavity,
but no reason for it.

276
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,674
No cancer,
no ruptured arteries.

277
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,967
So bleeding explains
the symptoms

278
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,261
but we've got no explanation
for the bleeding.

279
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,389
And while they
were closing him up,

280
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,515
Patrick had
a grand mal seizure,

281
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,141
which makes no sense,

282
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,602
since he's on
an anticonvulsant medication.

283
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,730
You told him.

284
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,023
No, I didn't.

285
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
I only told Cameron.

286
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,786
Hey!

287
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,835
Okay, you guys have cleverly deduced
that I have cancer.

288
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,336
You have no right to know.

289
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,337
You have no business knowing.

290
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,005
We'd like to run
some blood tests.

291
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,383
As soon as you
work up our patient, who is not me.

292
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,509
We just want to make sure
you weren't misdiagnosed.

293
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,387
I wasn't. Let's move on.

294
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,264
We're just asking
for a couple of vials.

295
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,765
- No!
- Why not?

296
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,144
Okay, we are going to proceed
as if I am perfectly healthy.

297
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,104
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

298
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,273
You don't know anything!

299
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,733
Except, hopefully,

300
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,403
how a patient on
anticonvulsant medication has a seizure.

301
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,155
Anti-seizure meds
don't prevent seizures.

302
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,521
They just make them manageable.

303
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,936
According to
the surgeon's report,

304
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,451
this one wasn't even
close to manageable.

305
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,953
Means the question isn't,
"Why is he having seizures?"

306
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,038
It's, "Why are his
seizures getting worse?"

307
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,957
What's changed?

308
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,126
His brain. It's gotten worse.

309
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,462
So we make it even worser.

310
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,630
We take him off
anticonvulsant medication.

311
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,882
He'll seize even more.

312
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,092
Multiple seizures can
seriously damage a brain.

313
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,635
Dude can't button a shirt.

314
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,387
How much more damage
are we really talking about?

315
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,639
Stronger seizures will light up
different parts of the brain,

316
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,486
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

317
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,186
Once he gets worse,
do a PET scan.

318
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,488
PET scan done?

319
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,989
No.

320
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,200
Did you come for my feelings?

321
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,160
'Cause I left them
in my other pants.

322
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,814
This is a letter
of recommendation.

323
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,830
I'm applying for a job at Penn.

324
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,420
Thank you for writing your own.

325
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,506
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

326
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,676
Thank you for signing it,
saves me having to fake your signature.

327
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,229
Stay away from Weiss.

328
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,234
He cries with his patients,
holds their hands as they die.

329
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,902
He won't like you.

330
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,031
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

331
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,453
I thought you'd
find it appealing.

332
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,164
20 seconds. Pretty good.

333
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,541
For what?

334
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,378
The time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

335
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,424
You really want to leave?

336
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,302
If you're not here,
there's not much point in staying.

337
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,304
I'm not dead yet.

338
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,313
What are you doing?

339
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,282
I know this must be
a turn-on for you.

340
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,902
A little whorish
to kiss and stab.

341
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,361
You kissed back.

342
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,947
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

343
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,366
Actually, no woman should die
without knowing the feeling.

344
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,660
All we need is a few
drops of your blood.

345
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,954
Foreman and Chase's lips
are not gonna get so close,

346
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,414
now that I know your plan.

347
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,541
There's a nurse downstairs
about to risk his job

348
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
to steal the blood
you drew from yourself yesterday.

349
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,754
I'm patient number 020406,

350
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,632
in the record room,
under the name Luke N. Laura.

351
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,384
There's a whole vial of blood
in there along with CT scans,

352
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,720
MRis, CSF. Everything you need.

353
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,393
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

354
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,155
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

355
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,491
extending into
the temporal lobe.

356
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,160
That's inoperable.

357
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,704
What kind of time does he have?

358
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,666
He's got a year.

359
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,505
Nurse! Nurse!

360
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,431
Here's the consent from Boston
for the cancer drug trial.

361
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,934
Any description
of the process or previous trials?

362
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,894
- Yep.
- Any chance it'll work?

363
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,230
No. It's not even
designed to work.

364
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,439
Why would he...

365
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,401
It's designed to treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

366
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,735
He doesn't seem depressed.

367
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,908
Okay,
let's assume that I am dying,

368
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,786
which I specifically
told you not to assume.

369
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,956
Can we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

370
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,165
Whereas this kid...

371
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,669
PET revealed several more hot spots
but they're non-specific.

372
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,337
How can you focus on him?

373
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,423
It's the only way I can cope.

374
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,342
PET also showed a left brain
that's working hard.

375
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,593
Harder than the right?

376
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
Wouldn't be worth
mentioning otherwise.

377
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,681
Bleeding in the brain,
blood would irritate the lining,

378
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,808
might cause
the seizures to get worse.

379
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,228
Yes, he needs an angiogram to look at
the vasculature inside his brain.

380
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,106
We'll get right on it
as soon as we're finished here.

381
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,569
Don't get up. I got it.
You're busy. Continue.

382
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,162
You know what my team
is doing right now?

383
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,913
No.

384
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,292
They're trying to figure out
what's wrong with me.

385
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,298
What's wrong with you?

386
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,753
Thanks for asking.

387
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,255
They've found out
that I'm dying.

388
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,090
That's sad.

389
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,593
Everyone's dying.

390
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:07,969
That's sad.

391
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,597
If a meteor lands
on my head tomorrow, it's all academic.

392
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,641
I told them to leave me alone.
But did they?

393
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,018
Did they?

394
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,311
That one was rhetorical.

395
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,021
Oh.

396
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,315
No, they did not.

397
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,613
Who the hell were you
before you hit your head?

398
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,364
Hell is a bad word.

399
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,075
So is "ass" and "bitch."

400
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,327
I could probably
rattle off 50 much more

401
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,204
complicated and
disgusting ones,

402
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,539
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

403
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,210
You like your life?

404
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,045
What life?

405
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,254
Your life.

406
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,051
Playing the piano, going on tour,
scoring girls left and right.

407
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,011
I don't like girls.

408
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,138
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

409
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,015
I like the piano.

410
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,230
What's wrong?

411
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,735
Dr. Peter Hayes. This is Eric Foreman,
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

412
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,321
You're doing a signal transduction
inhibitor clinical trial.

413
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,281
What kind of
results have you been...

414
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,076
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

415
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,329
Bye, Pete.

416
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,335
They've got another
trial going at Duke.

417
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,588
15 percent extend their lives
beyond five years.

418
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,217
- If you're positive for protein PHF...
- Stop trying to save me.

419
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,594
I'm fine.

420
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,305
MRA confirmed small
collections of blood

421
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,850
throughout the white matter
of Patrick's right hemisphere.

422
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,434
Mind if we chat about that
for a few moments?

423
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,188
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer or autoimmune disease.

424
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,107
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

425
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,692
His EEG was non-specific.

426
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,858
Where you going to biopsy?

427
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,777
Everywhere.

428
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,072
Sure, just put on a blindfold
and play "Pin the Tail on the Brain."

429
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,825
He's bleeding into his brain.
He's dying.

430
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,411
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

431
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,996
and hope you hit
the right spot.

432
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,642
I'm only gonna take
little tiny pieces.

433
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,832
Till what?

434
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,041
Till I find the problem.

435
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,168
Or you kill him.

436
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,628
No, I'll keep going,
even if I kill him.

437
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,552
Then he's screwed.
Thanks for the chat.

438
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,649
What if we do the EEG
from inside his brain?

439
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,485
I'm actually a little insulted.

440
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,057
You were supposed to
spend the last hour worrying about me.

441
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,281
It's risky and invasive.

442
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,367
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

443
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,452
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

444
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,329
External EEG could get confused

445
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,581
if there are multiple
structural abnormalities.

446
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,334
If we perform
the EEG inside the skull,

447
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,128
it could show us
where to biopsy.

448
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,380
Brilliant. Go. Do.

449
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,406
I'd also like to
talk to you about...

450
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,928
This is going to be personal,
isn't it?

451
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,346
Yeah.

452
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,196
We'll use a small drill
to get inside his skull.

453
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,324
There's bleeding inside?

454
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,494
Yes. Once we have 12 holes,

455
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,454
we'll surgically
implant the electrodes

456
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,915
under the meninges,
against the brain.

457
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:31,506
And it's either cancer
or autoimmune disease?

458
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,466
Sorry, but yeah.

459
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,136
Which one is better?

460
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,265
Neither.

461
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,464
Hey.

462
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,716
Where do we cut?

463
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:15,883
We don't.

464
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,053
I need to say something.

465
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,930
Something personal?

466
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,140
Yeah.

467
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,850
And I can't leave

468
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,096
because you've got
something interesting in that file.

469
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,145
Sorry.

470
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:37,530
You're an arrogant ass who makes it
impossible for anyone to like him

471
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,324
by punishing people
who don't deserve...

472
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,285
Can you get to the "but" part
of this speech?

473
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,412
But I like you.

474
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,663
No, you don't.

475
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,333
You're just reacting to
the perception of my death

476
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,918
and the need to put things in order.
Fear of guilt...

477
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,253
Just shut up.

478
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,213
See? I annoy you.

479
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,842
Now, you gonna give me the results
or are you gonna...

480
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,140
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

481
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,142
- Which means it's autoimmune.
- No.

482
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,354
It also showed his entire right
hemisphere is brain-dead.

483
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:21,324
So while you guys were worrying about
me, half this kid's brain died.

484
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,994
The only solace you should take from
this is the fact that it didn't.

485
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,164
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to the in-brain variety,

486
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,374
but it's not going
to miss brain death.

487
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,334
- He's gotten worse.
- Not that much worse.

488
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,877
Respiration is depressed.

489
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,883
Seizures are increasing,
one every five minutes.

490
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,090
Not that much worse.

491
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,133
He can still talk
and he's left-handed,

492
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,676
which means speech
is in the right side.

493
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,971
You don't know how Patrick's brain
reorganized itself 25 years ago.

494
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,934
What if the right side
is just a little dead?

495
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,770
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

496
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,065
You're just looking for a puzzle to
distract you from your own situation.

497
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,859
You're right, he's dead.
Let's go home.

498
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,989
What did you find out?

499
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,867
Is he gonna be okay?

500
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,452
- I'm sorry.
- Yes!

501
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,458
What's this?

502
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,043
A piano.

503
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,212
What's this?

504
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,135
He's obviously lost use...

505
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,428
Shut up.

506
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,116
Music is a global process.

507
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,577
You can't play
the piano with half a brain.

508
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,456
What's it mean?

509
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,041
Means the right side of
his brain has always sucked.

510
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,586
Means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

511
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,754
- Wow. Then it's autoimmune.
- Yeah.

512
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,506
Question is what
do we do about it?

513
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,966
Most likely ones we can fix.

514
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,344
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu or Sarcoid.

515
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,054
I'll start treatment.

516
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,681
Not what I was talking about.

517
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,308
But, yeah, you do that.

518
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,233
Your turn?

519
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,319
Do you have to do that?

520
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,114
You mean cheapen everyone's attempt
at a human moment

521
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,326
by identifying the real calculations
that go into it?

522
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,578
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I do.

523
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,707
I'm sorry you're dying,
I'm gonna hug you.

524
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,167
Anything to say?

525
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,377
If you're considering
grabbing my ass,

526
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,631
don't start anything
you can't finish.

527
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,615
Well, as long as we're just standing
here, you mind if we work?

528
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,764
How's the kid's
treatment going?

529
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,808
Are you crying?

530
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,435
No.

531
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,314
Respiration rate's up.

532
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,650
Seizures are calming down.
It's all good.

533
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,612
Not for what I'm gonna do next.

534
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,031
There is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

535
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,077
Only if he wants to remain
a four-year-old who wets his bed.

536
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,287
There's nothing else for him.

537
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,540
There's better.
Thanks for the hug.

538
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,771
It's the middle of the night.

539
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,856
You knew I'd be asleep.

540
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,858
Phone would have woken you up
just as much.

541
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,736
And I can't see
what you're wearing on the phone.

542
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,450
My patient with the 55 IQ
has Takayasu syndrome.

543
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,744
Very uncommon.

544
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,788
Happens mostly in Asian women.

545
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,584
Takayasu is manageable with steroids,
which you already know.

546
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,503
So I assume you're here
for something else.

547
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,839
My patient also has
a significant seizure problem.

548
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,383
Also manageable with
anticonvulsant medication.

549
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,969
Yes, and if he kept taking his
anticonvulsant medication,

550
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,847
he could go back on tour
and play the piano.

551
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,808
But a hemispherectomy

552
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,478
would completely stop
the right-brain seizure activity

553
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,230
and he would no
longer need to take

554
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,648
his anticonvulsant medication.

555
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,095
You want to remove
half his brain?

556
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,443
The right half.

557
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,986
It would be irresponsible
to remove the left.

558
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,822
You don't remove half a brain
and gain function!

559
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:34,327
Not my brain.
But his? Who knows? What?

560
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,954
Let's say that I'm the left side
of Patrick's brain.

561
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,206
I'm quick-witted, I'm charming,
I'm great looking.

562
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,416
You're the right
side of his brain.

563
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,418
You're useless, old, damaged.

564
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,794
We go to a bar for a drink.

565
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,882
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring all the hot babes,

566
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,676
but instead I'm spending my time wiping
drool off your chin

567
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,804
and making sure
you don't eat the tablecloth.

568
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,057
What's the father want to do?

569
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,643
I don't know.

570
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,355
So go wake him up.

571
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,403
House, I'm so sorry.

572
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,490
Forgot I was dying, huh?

573
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,450
I'm here if you need me.

574
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,370
I need you.

575
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:32,677
One small feel for man,
one giant ass for mankind.

576
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,471
Thanks.

577
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,224
Good luck in Boston.

578
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,730
Call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

579
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,324
Dr. Foreman was just here.

580
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,827
The seizures have
almost completely gone away.

581
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,038
Says we might be
able to go home in the next day or two.

582
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,832
Thank you so much.

583
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,377
I think we should remove
the right side of your son's brain.

584
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,921
I thought you fixed him.

585
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,047
Does he look fixed?

586
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,617
The right side of his brain is
keeping him walking straight.

587
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,635
Other than that, it's been dead weight
ever since the accident.

588
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,847
If we remove it, the seizures
would stop completely.

589
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,849
The seizures are
hardly noticeable.

590
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,559
They don't bother Patrick.

591
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,935
But without the seizures,

592
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,355
the left side would have a chance
to actually function.

593
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,649
It could learn
to do new things.

594
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,070
Only bummer, he'd never play
the piano again.

595
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,615
Oh, no.
The piano is everything.

596
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,284
I'm not saying
he's never gonna work for NASA,

597
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,953
but flipping burgers
isn't out of the question.

598
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,559
Well, I don't mind taking care of him
so he can play the piano.

599
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,666
No, you're actually lucky.

600
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,251
You don't have to
watch your kid grow up.

601
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,669
You don't have to let go.

602
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,046
You trying to
make this about me?

603
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,550
I love my son,
just the way he is!

604
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,802
He's a monkey
grinder at the circus.

605
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,429
He's worked hard to get where he...

606
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,555
So does the monkey.

607
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,060
The piano is
a neurological accident.

608
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,187
He has a gift.

609
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,147
I'm offering him a life.

610
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,404
It's up to you.

611
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,338
I've isolated
the cancer proteins in House's CSF.

612
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,215
About time.
We can't let him go to Boston

613
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,300
if he qualifies
for the Duke trial.

614
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,010
You want to do it?

615
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,112
Damn. He's negative
for protein PHF.

616
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,365
He doesn't qualify.

617
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,499
What's that?
That shouldn't be there.

618
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,950
Patrick?

619
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,123
Hello, Papa.

620
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,587
Patrick,
I have a question for you.

621
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
Yes?

622
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,253
Are you happy?

623
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,281
House! Open up!

624
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,701
Open up! It's important!

625
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,956
I've got a flight
in three hours.

626
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,874
You don't have cancer.

627
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,961
There was an abnormal presence
of IgG and IgM, indicating...

628
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,880
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing...

629
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,091
It's a gumma in your brain.
It's very rare not to be in the liver,

630
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,218
and I'm really glad
we never slept together but...

631
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,928
We would have used a condom.

632
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,014
And I don't have syphilis.
My VDRL was negative...

633
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,765
We did an FTA antibody test.

634
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,892
The VDRL was a false negative.

635
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,104
You're not going to die.

636
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,939
All you need is IV antibiotics.

637
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,237
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

638
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,655
Of course.

639
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,033
You idiots.

640
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,494
We just told you
you're not gonna die!

641
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,538
You should be
making out with Cameron.

642
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,457
You knew it wasn't cancer?

643
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,167
I was sure it was cancer.

644
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,253
Then why aren't
you celebrating?

645
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,839
Because it wasn't my damn file.

646
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,801
You faked cancer?

647
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,262
The real patient is in
the Witherspoon wing.

648
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,597
Feel free to tell his wife
that he's not gonna die,

649
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,057
but he is cheating on her.

650
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,392
Why would you want us
to think that you...

651
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,810
I didn't!

652
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,187
I wanted the guys in Boston
to think that I had cancer.

653
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,024
I wanted the guys who were
gonna implant a cool drug

654
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,235
right into the pleasure center
of my brain to think that I had cancer!

655
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,572
You faked cancer to get high?

656
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,499
I'm going to bed.

657
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,087
You're right. I don't like you.

658
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,506
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.

659
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,277
Heard Patrick's
hemispherectomy went well.

660
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,613
He survived the surgery.

661
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,739
He's unconscious but...

662
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,532
How depressed are you?

663
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,034
I'm not depressed.

664
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,578
You faked cancer.

665
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,372
It was
an outpatient procedure. I was curious.

666
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,500
Are you curious about heroin?

667
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,503
Not since last year's
Christmas party.

668
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,923
I know this goes
against your nature,

669
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,132
but can we not
make too much of this?

670
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,136
You made people think
that you were going to die!

671
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,346
I didn't make them.

672
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,680
I tried to hide it,

673
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,183
but you idiots needed to
get into my business.

674
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,649
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

675
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,692
It's ironic.

676
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,945
Well, I'm sure I'll
regret asking, but why...

677
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,114
Depression in
cancer patients...

678
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,615
It's not as
common as you think.

679
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,345
It's not the dying
that gets to people.

680
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,329
It's the dying alone. The patients
with family, with friends,

681
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,997
they tend to do okay.

682
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,458
You don't have cancer.

683
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,502
You do have
people who give a damn.

684
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,920
So what do you do?

685
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:13,262
You fake the cancer,
then push the people who care away.

686
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,432
Because they're boring.

687
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,229
Go home to your hotel room
and laugh at that irony.

688
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,860
Start small, House.
Take a chance.

689
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,655
Maybe something that doesn't involve
sticking stuff in your brain.

690
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,574
Pizza with a friend.

691
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,369
A movie. Something.

692
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,100
Follow my finger.
Do you know your name?

693
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,108
His speech center
was on the right side.

694
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,195
It'll be a while
before he's talking.

695
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,657
He hasn't really done anything
except to stare off into the distance.

696
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,117
It'll take some time to...

697
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,261
You buttoned your shirt.

698
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,310
He looks happy.
