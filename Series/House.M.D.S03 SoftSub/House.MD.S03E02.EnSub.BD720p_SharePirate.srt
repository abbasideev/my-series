1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,752
Mom!

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm thirsty.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,676
I just gave you water.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,052
I want juice.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,470
It's bedtime.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,056
Close your eyes
and go to sleep.

7
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,036
Mom!

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,164
What do you want, Clance?

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,333
Oh. Hi, Dad.

10
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,960
Go to bed.

11
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,586
Can I turn the TV on?

12
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,922
TV's only for the daytime.
That was the deal.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,883
I'll keep the volume down.
I just like the light.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,343
Go to bed.

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,886
Dad, what if...

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,974
What if they come
to get me again?

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,105
Nobody is coming to get you,
okay? Go to bed now.

18
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,741
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.

19
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,909
If you plan to
be out at the shore today,

20
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,702
you are in for a treat.

21
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,415
We're looking at mostly sunny skies up
and down the Jersey coast...

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,251
I guess he's already up.

23
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,044
That's a first.

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,840
Well, I'll see
if he needs breakfast.

25
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,594
Hey, Clance, you hungry?

26
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,976
Hon, he's not down here.

27
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,894
You sure?

28
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,146
Clancy?

29
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,538
Clancy? Where are you?

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,084
- Sweetie, are you hiding?
- Clancy?

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,919
Where is he?

32
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,798
Clancy!

33
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,719
You're gonna be in big trouble
when I find you.

34
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:44,098
Honey, come out right now,
wherever you are. This is not funny.

35
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,560
Clance?

36
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,936
Clancy?

37
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,433
Where's the sweat and the BO?

38
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,269
You've taken such pride
in bathing us all in your musk.

39
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,228
I showered at home.

40
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,897
And yet you're
earlier than usual.

41
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,983
Is this an intervention?

42
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,027
It's a little late,
since I'm not using drugs anymore.

43
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,237
I am, however,
still hooked on phonics.

44
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,322
If you did your morning run
and showered at home,

45
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,615
you'd be later than usual.

46
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,367
Thought of you in the shower.

47
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,620
How's your leg?
You seem to be favoring your left side.

48
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,588
I was hanging down
my right pant leg yesterday,

49
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,957
makes all the difference
in the world.

50
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,584
You've taken the stairs
every day.

51
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,044
Do I need a restraining order?

52
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,004
You slack on your rehab,

53
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,507
the muscle will weaken,
and your leg will hurt again.

54
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,262
Looks like the ketamine
treatment might not stick.

55
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,557
Or maybe we've made him depressed
because we're lying to him,

56
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,044
telling him
he got that case wrong.

57
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,311
We didn't hurt him.
The pain isn't...

58
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,229
He gets depressed,
he stops exercising.

59
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,398
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

60
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,317
The muscle atrophies,
the pain returns.

61
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,488
Maybe he stopped exercising because the
giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

62
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,823
The ketamine
could work perfectly,

63
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,243
and he would still be back on his cane,
popping Vicodin again.

64
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,498
You can't tell him.
He got lucky. There was no medical...

65
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,041
He was right.

66
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,252
We tell him he was right,
and we're feeding his addiction.

67
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,546
Without Vicodin,
he's only got one to focus on.

68
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,590
Well, he's not gonna
OD on puzzles.

69
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,009
No, it's not gonna hurt him,

70
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,679
but he could just as easily
have killed that patient.

71
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,559
We have a tiny window of time here where
House may be healthy enough to change,

72
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,979
and based on that limp,
the window's closing fast.

73
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,946
Kid is a product
of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy,

74
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,449
had all his vaccinations,
fractured his right ulna at age three,

75
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,076
chicken pox at age five...

76
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,078
He ever get his feelings hurt?

77
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,832
I'll need to know that, too.

78
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,085
You are "0" for one since you came back.
We just wanna make sure that...

79
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,254
Rectal bleeding plus
alien-abduction fantasies.

80
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,713
Most likely sexual abuse.

81
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,133
Penetration causes the bleed.
Trauma causes the fantasy.

82
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,719
ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence
of tearing, semen or pubic hairs.

83
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,013
I think we should
talk to the kid.

84
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,058
Why? In case
he's telling the truth?

85
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,969
You're a believer, aren't you?

86
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,188
Well, I'm just not
arrogant enough to think

87
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,359
that of the 50 billion galaxies,
100 billion stars per galaxy

88
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,361
and 10 million billion planets
in the universe,

89
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,155
that we're the only ones
with life.

90
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,283
No, but I'm guessing we're the only ones
who like shoving things

91
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,330
through our back doors.

92
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
There is new research indicating a link

93
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,996
between neurological problems
and bleeding disorders.

94
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,915
Perfect, especially
if there were neurological problems.

95
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,044
What part of hallucinating
an alien abduction isn't neurological?

96
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,588
It wasn't a hallucination.

97
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,048
What? You think the kid...

98
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,009
He's having nightmares.

99
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,762
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything
other than wanting to sleep with Mommy,

100
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,348
which just leaves us
with one symptom, the bloody tuchus,

101
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,685
which can easily explained
by a GI problem or bleeding disorder.

102
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:43,898
Check his coags with a PT,
PTT and bleeding time,

103
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,734
and prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

104
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,284
I'm gonna make
a tiny nick in your forearm, okay?

105
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,100
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you to stop bleeding.

106
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,792
Now, this is gonna sting a little,
so you might wanna look the other way.

107
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,635
Are those windows locked?

108
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,846
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.

109
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,182
Good, 'cause they know
I'm here.

110
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,352
Clancy, don't bother
the doctor with this stuff.

111
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,771
No, it's okay.
How do they know you're here?

112
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,399
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

113
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,984
I can feel it back there.

114
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,695
Clancy, you know
there is nothing back there.

115
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,780
There is.

116
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,115
Let me see. Lean forwards.

117
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,120
And they have this other thing, and they
put it in between these two ribs,

118
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:44,750
always on this side,
and then they move it around my insides.

119
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,001
It hurts.

120
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,170
You know what, Clancy?

121
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,297
I think I might have
found the chip back there,

122
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,091
and I think I might be able
to get it out.

123
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,968
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

124
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,181
Okay, lean forwards.

125
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,560
Now hold very still, okay?

126
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,230
Got it.

127
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,487
I'm seven, not three.
All you did was pinch my neck.

128
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,159
Sorry.

129
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,414
His alien-abduction story,
the level of detail is...

130
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,332
Well, I don't know
where he gets it from.

131
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,626
The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi.
He doesn't read comic books...

132
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,296
Great. You do any
of that medical stuff we talked about?

133
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,256
Upper and lower endoscopies
were clean.

134
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,258
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder.

135
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,011
No, blood tests are all normal,
and he clotted in six minutes.

136
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,848
So it's a simple bleeding disorder,
and you screwed up the test.

137
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,891
I didn't screw up the test.

138
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:47,521
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

139
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,650
Either you screwed up the test, or
I screwed up my analysis of this case.

140
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,403
If you screwed up,
I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

141
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,364
It's a simple bleeding disorder.
Foreman, redo the test.

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,076
How could I screw up
a simple bleeding-time test?

143
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,163
Maybe you were abducted,
lost time.

144
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,298
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

145
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,674
Sure?

146
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,303
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

147
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,307
So you're saying
Chase did screw up.

148
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,061
Or Foreman screwed up.

149
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,563
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

150
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,025
Oh, snap.
Foreman's playing the dozens.

151
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,319
You're at a huge cultural
disadvantage here, Chase.

152
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,321
Take a couple of minutes
to think of a witty retort.

153
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,207
So we have contradicting
bleeding-time tests.

154
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,158
If we run labs
to check his clotting factors,

155
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,618
we can confirm which one's right.

156
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,994
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

157
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,705
Way better than trying
to guess which doctor's incompetent.

158
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,749
Looks better
in the paperwork, too.

159
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,795
Hey, Foreman, your mama's so fat,
when her beeper goes off,

160
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,338
people think she's backing up.

161
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,976
Where's Clancy?

162
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,562
He's asleep. He's...

163
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,361
House, Clancy's gone missing.

164
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:23,450
Oh, no! You take Alpha Centauri,
Foreman can look on Tatooine,

165
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,912
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

166
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,208
Let's pray he hasn't gone
into hyperdrive. We'll never catch him.

167
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,633
Clancy?

168
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,512
I had to go where there are no windows
so I could get the chip out.

169
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,972
God.

170
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,641
I can feel it.
I just can't grab it.

171
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,060
Clancy, stop. There is no chip.

172
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,817
We're gonna clean you up,
and we're gonna go back to your room.

173
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,446
You can't do things like this.
Your parents...

174
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:25,053
Results came back.
The lab cannot identify the metal.

175
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,764
Said it might not
even be terrestrial.

176
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:28,724
Really?

177
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,228
No, you idiot, it's titanium,
like from a surgical pin,

178
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,607
like the kind the kid had inserted
into his broken arm four years ago.

179
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,816
Nice medical history.

180
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,359
That pin was removed
six months...

181
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,112
So a little piece broke off
during removal.

182
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,782
Titanium is used to build nuclear subs.
Pieces don't just break off.

183
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,659
Tell that to the guys
on the Kursk.

184
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,038
And how exactly did it get from his arm
to the back of his neck?

185
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,915
Body attacks
any foreign object.

186
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,793
Inflammatory reaction could erode it
into a vein. Fragment gets a free ride.

187
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,338
To his lungs maybe,
not his neck.

188
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,341
Yeah, an alien chip
makes more sense.

189
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,428
The real mystery is
that you didn't actually screw up.

190
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,805
You okay?

191
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,016
Fine. Tripped.

192
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,852
Kid carved a hole
in the back of his neck.

193
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,855
Apparently didn't bleed
to death. Now that's weird.

194
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,565
He clotted on his own?

195
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,067
Sure did.

196
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,904
So first there was no bleeding disorder.
Then there was. Now there's not again.

197
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,239
Which is impossible.

198
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,658
Or Foreman screwed up.

199
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,077
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

200
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,038
Lucky for us,
the fourth test will be the charm.

201
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,545
So you're just gonna
keep cutting him? Until what?

202
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,214
This test is different.

203
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,926
We'll draw some blood, and see if
any clotting factors are low or missing.

204
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,845
- But why haven't the other tests...
- We've got three results.

205
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,173
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.

206
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,016
Or two of them.

207
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,272
Is it possible the problem isn't
his blood? It's just psychological?

208
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,441
I mean,
he almost killed himself.

209
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,527
He wasn't trying
to hurt himself.

210
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:07,906
No, he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

211
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,578
I have time for one more.

212
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,414
Can't blame you
for spending extra time down here.

213
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,001
I heard the Artist
Formerly Known as Gimp is back upstairs.

214
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,711
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

215
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,796
She's busy. I'll take it.

216
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,844
Oh, my God! You're...

217
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,347
You're okay!

218
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,807
Have we met?

219
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,642
I was one of your doctors.

220
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,936
You were in a vegetative state
when you left here last week.

221
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,980
Addison's disease.

222
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:45,235
All I needed was cortisol,
and my brain turned on like a switch.

223
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,862
This is amazing!

224
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,072
Surprised you didn't know.

225
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,407
How would I know?

226
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,826
Not quite my old self yet.

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,870
Baby steps,
the doctors tell me. Now...

228
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,332
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?

229
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,627
- How would I...
- I wanna have sex with my wife,

230
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,339
and I was hoping that
maybe you could...

231
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,966
Viagra? You're here for Viagra?

232
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,677
A bucketful would be nice.

233
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,932
Dr. Cuddy.

234
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,060
Hi.

235
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,067
It's completely unethical.

236
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,234
He was reckless with a patient.

237
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,278
- He was right.
- But he didn't know that.

238
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,280
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

239
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,615
Why does he need that?

240
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,619
Because other people have that? Why does
he need to be like other people?

241
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,412
He needs to be less reckless.

242
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,914
Well, you did it.

243
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,043
He's dismissing symptoms, looking
for easy solutions. He's in pain.

244
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,128
- How much pain?
- Why?

245
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,258
You know this is
affecting him, don't you?

246
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,390
Telling him that he got his last case
right won't do anything to help him.

247
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,808
- It'll make him less depressed.
- Which might not help his leg.

248
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,851
But you don't know.

249
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,229
Just let me run a PET scan

250
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,315
on his parietal thalamic area
to see if it's sensing pain.

251
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,609
If it is, the ketamine
isn't working anymore,

252
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,361
and he's headed for a huge crash.

253
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:14,616
If it's not, the leg pain is my fault,
and I will tell him the truth.

254
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,708
Too tight?

255
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,168
My parents think I'm crazy.

256
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,670
No, they don't.

257
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,255
They're just worried
about you. That's all.

258
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,048
I'm not weird.

259
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,884
It's just that weird things
keep happening to me.

260
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,344
Slight pinch.

261
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,143
If you make me better, do you think
the aliens will leave me alone?

262
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,770
I don't think they're gonna be
bothering you for much longer.

263
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,147
Are you lying again?

264
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,356
No.

265
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,235
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

266
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,288
Still with us?

267
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,252
Let's go.

268
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,924
Pulmonary edema,
stage-two hypertensive crisis.

269
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,760
What is happening?
Wait outside.

270
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,846
Get him oxygen, and start him
on an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.

271
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,264
Get them outside!

272
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,059
He's in ICU, systolic is
hovering around 170.

273
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,811
I left instructions to lower it slowly

274
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,855
so we don't risk
hypoperfusing his organs.

275
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,900
Trade-off being that leaving his
blood pressure that high risks stroke,

276
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,359
MI and blindness.

277
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,069
I'm open to suggestions.

278
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,864
Solve the case. Kidneys could explain...

279
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,407
Kidneys are clean.

280
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,619
Tell me
he's a mutant-human hybrid.

281
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,162
It is a bleeding disorder.

282
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,373
Clancy tested positive
for Von Willebrand's.

283
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,417
I didn't screw up.

284
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,129
How could he clot on his own
two out of three times?

285
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,008
Maybe he cheated.

286
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,011
Right. Kids always cheat
on their bleeding-time tests.

287
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,723
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

288
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,976
I have no idea what you meant, but
I could smell what The Rock was cooking.

289
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,688
I meant, he's clotting right now,
and he's in hypertensive crisis.

290
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,232
Maybe the two are related.

291
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,878
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times that he clotted?

292
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,946
Hypertensive crisis
can activate clotting factors.

293
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,241
Even someone low on Von Willebrand's
could theoretically clot.

294
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,785
And the first time Clancy clotted,
he was all worked up

295
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,830
recounting his alien abduction.
He could've easily been hypertensive.

296
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,208
I get worked up when I cut microchip
tracking implants out of my neck.

297
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,584
Sounds like a cheat to me.

298
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,586
Yeah, we get it.

299
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,922
Okay, what's the differential
for a seven-year-old boy

300
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,133
suffering multiple
hypertensive crises?

301
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,389
We think the problem is
in your son's heart.

302
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:46,309
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophageal echo.

303
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,728
Okay, and that will
fix his heart?

304
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:53,024
That will tell us where the problem
is, hopefully. Then we can fix him.

305
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,579
Listen, this isn't
really part of my job,

306
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,583
but he's worried that
you think he's crazy.

307
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,918
Well, isn't he?

308
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,839
There are still plenty of other
explanations for what's going on.

309
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:22,095
It's important he knows
you believe in him, even if you don't.

310
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,728
It's clean.
His heart isn't the problem.

311
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,316
Why don't I have a high-def
in my office? I'm a department head.

312
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,068
- There are no structural defects.
- Valves are intact.

313
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:42,073
Tissue characterization is impossible
when the pixels are the size of Legos.

314
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,161
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

315
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,330
Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

316
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,873
Let me ring up
one of the homies.

317
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,833
The clearer the image, the clearer it is

318
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,044
that there are no masses,
no clots, no tears.

319
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,296
The problem's gotta be
somewhere else.

320
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,050
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

321
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,017
You're wrong, House.

322
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,312
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX
before he admits it?

323
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,688
- There.
- Where?

324
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,650
Right there.
Left side, no movement.

325
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,196
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.

326
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,074
How do you see something not move
if nothing's moving?

327
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,909
I need a laser pointer.

328
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,286
- We don't have a laser pointer.
- Well, why not?

329
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,915
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have a laser pointer?

330
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,834
Right here.

331
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,880
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

332
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,091
So you've found an arrhythmia?

333
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,760
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhythmia.

334
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,429
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

335
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,600
Go get me those myocytes.
I wanna talk to them in my office.

336
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,022
How's the kid doing?

337
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,193
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.

338
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,029
Most of it, anyway.

339
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,727
Why do they bother
putting age restrictions on these things

340
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,661
when all you have to do
is click, "Yes, I am 18?"

341
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,955
Even a 17-year-old
can figure that out.

342
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,040
What's going on with the leg?

343
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,627
First, tell me
what's going on with the boobs.

344
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,422
- If you're feeling pain...
- They're firmer.

345
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,590
It's called an underwire.

346
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,467
I wanna get a PET scan
of your brain.

347
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,885
I think it's hormones.

348
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,332
As long as there's
no increased activity in the thalamus...

349
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,224
Looks to me like those puppies
are going into the dairy business.

350
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,104
Then the pain can be good.
It could be muscle regenerating.

351
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,155
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.

352
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,610
Guess I should be saying, "Mazel tov."
Who gets to pass out the cigars?

353
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,031
I'm not pregnant.
I need to get a PET scan of your brain.

354
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,117
- Boy or girl? You got a name?
- I'm not pregnant.

355
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,951
- My leg doesn't hurt.
- You're in denial.

356
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,619
No, I'm not!

357
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,371
Oh, you got me.

358
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,131
If I thought that my leg
was deteriorating,

359
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,384
don't you think
I'd want to take steps to prevent that?

360
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,637
Okay.

361
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,726
Gotta go.

362
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,156
Here's Clancy's DNA.

363
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,953
And here's the DNA from that piece
of his heart we just biopsied.

364
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,794
That is impossible.

365
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,588
Run it again.

366
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,050
We already did
and once more after that.

367
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,880
The genes from Clancy's
myocytes don't match the genes

368
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,222
from the rest of his body.

369
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,475
Alien DNA.

370
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,070
Anybody watch any X-Files
that inspired an explanation?

371
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:11,199
There are ways DNA can become mutated.
Extreme UV radiation.

372
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,577
That much sun, he'd be dying with
a healthy bronze glow.

373
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,955
Nitrous acid
or ethidium-bromide exposure.

374
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,040
First, Daddy was a rapist.
Now he's a chemist.

375
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,543
Various species of fungus
have been proven mutagenic.

376
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,837
Not unless the kid's
been eating barrels of celery

377
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,131
or living in Indonesia or both.

378
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,966
- Is your leg hurting?
- Is that question helping?

379
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,050
- You're leaning.
- You're sitting.

380
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,761
- You're evading.
- My head's hurting.

381
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,391
Please, someone, give me a plausible,
terrestrial explanation

382
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,101
for this kid's alien DNA.

383
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,521
We could search his home for toxins,
fungals and radiation.

384
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,524
Who cares what caused it?
A kid comes in with strep,

385
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,111
we don't conduct a search to see which
classmate he got it from. We cure it.

386
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,947
We know he's got the stuff inside him.
Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.

387
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,949
Where do we cut?
Chances are, it's not just in his heart.

388
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,243
Well, we got lucky with the heart.
Myocytes contract.

389
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,162
We could see that
these weren't working.

390
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,623
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna find it anywhere else.

391
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:07,005
What if we take the heart cells
with the bad DNA, and we tag them?

392
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,592
Can you phrase that
in the form of a metaphor?

393
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,635
It's the same way
we search for cancer.

394
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,972
The bad DNA creates a unique protein
on the surface of the affected cells.

395
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,683
We create an antibody
that recognizes only that protein,

396
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,728
we flush it throughout his system,
and the similar cells light up

397
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,189
like light bulbs.

398
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,568
Okay, let's do that.

399
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,496
You have to tell him.

400
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,956
He said he wasn't in any pain.

401
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,125
- He's lying.
- Of course he's lying.

402
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,585
We need another plan.

403
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,961
Don't talk about it that way.

404
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,213
What way?

405
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,714
"Plan."

406
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,560
It sounds like we're conspiring
against him.

407
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,426
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No, you're not.

408
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,638
Then come up with a cunning plan
and fast.

409
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,646
She's not nearly as delightful
as she thinks she is.

410
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,440
What's this machine do?

411
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,068
Makes a lot of noise,

412
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,812
and it's gonna help us figure out
what's wrong with you.

413
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,114
You think House
has lost a step?

414
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,533
He's fine.

415
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,622
There. Clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow of the femur.

416
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,207
Explains the
intermittent-bleeding disorder.

417
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,961
'Cause I don't need to subject myself
to House's torture if there's no upside.

418
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,004
I'm telling you, he's fine.

419
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,842
We missed some
affected cells in his heart.

420
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,303
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

421
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,181
You said the last case
really threw him, and now suddenly...

422
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,641
I was wrong.

423
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,769
So you changed your mind. Why?

424
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:49,190
His brilliant ideas
on this case have all been yours.

425
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,277
There's the reason for him
needing glasses.

426
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,238
Apparently, it's a symptom.
It means the condition predates...

427
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:59,450
You don't change your mind
without a reason. Now, what do you know?

428
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,291
House didn't blow
the last case.

429
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,461
Cuddy cured the guy
using House's idea.

430
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,798
Cuddy and Wilson
are trying to teach him some humility.

431
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,680
Scan is complete. Three hot spots,
but nothing in his brain.

432
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:25,226
House's original theory was right.
It is not neurological.

433
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,895
Is he going to be able to walk?

434
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,940
His leg should be
functional after some rehab.

435
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,943
"Functional"?
What does that mean?

436
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,113
He'll be able to walk,
but not run? He'll have a limp?

437
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,824
If everything goes well,
he'll walk. He'll run.

438
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,368
He'll probably be
even stronger than he is now.

439
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,956
When we close him up,
we'll move over to his other leg,

440
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,543
snake a catheter up through
the femoral artery and into his heart.

441
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,296
Once the affected areas are removed,

442
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,132
is normal tissue
ill step back in, do its job.

443
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,052
He should have no more problems
with his blood pressure.

444
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,264
After confirming those areas are clear,
we'll start the final procedure.

445
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,350
We're gonna insert
a needle through the pupil

446
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,727
and get rid of the
abnormal cells in the retina.

447
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,865
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?

448
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,950
Yeah, it's clear.

449
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,953
You can throw away your glasses.
We got it all.

450
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,415
Get some sleep.
You're going home tomorrow.

451
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,709
Thank you.

452
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,432
Do you wanna go for a run?

453
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,476
What do you want?

454
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,977
I want you to run.

455
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,069
When did you become an enabler?

456
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,154
I'm enabling you to exercise.

457
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,615
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab,

458
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,700
muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

459
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,996
I'd rather not become dependent
on pain pills to get through my day.

460
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,584
You're just like
any other patient,

461
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,921
running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

462
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,756
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

463
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,467
You're scared
the ketamine treatment's wearing off,

464
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,054
that it was just
a torturous window to the good life.

465
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,432
What part of "poop"
didn't you understand?

466
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,393
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

467
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,521
It's my leg.
We've known each other a long time.

468
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,696
You're not always right, House.
You've proven that lately.

469
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,295
What's happening to him?

470
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,861
- He's seizing. I need clonazepam.
- I thought you got it all.

471
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,842
Yeah, yell at me. That'll fix your kid.

472
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,267
Obviously, we missed some foreign
tissue. There's something still in him.

473
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,479
The hallucinations and seizures
indicate problems in the temporal lobe.

474
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,525
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.

475
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,070
We didn't miss anything.
Brain scan was completely clean.

476
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,662
Our tag must not have penetrated
the blood-brain barrier.

477
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,791
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.

478
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:13,681
No cells are lighting up. His brain
is clean. It is not neurological.

479
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,811
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.

480
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,648
His scan was clean twice.
It's not there.

481
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,279
What if it is there,
but didn't show up on the scan?

482
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,656
What if the tag
just doesn't work in his brain?

483
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,535
Brain cells are structurally different,
express a different protein.

484
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,704
So how do we find it?

485
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,543
Where are we going?

486
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,670
I am going to think.

487
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,833
Send the kid home.

488
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,002
What do you mean?

489
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,798
Make sure his blood pressure's
stabilized, and send him home.

490
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,620
What, like nothing ever happened?

491
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,843
We cured his bleeding disorder,

492
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,971
removed all the damaged cells
we could find.

493
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,808
We don't know that we fixed anything.
It's only been a day.

494
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,352
Maybe these symptoms come and go
like the blood disorder.

495
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,813
It's more probable that his
remaining symptoms are

496
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,774
just a nightmare.

497
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,109
He had a convulsion.

498
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,862
May be epilepsy.
May be psychological. May be nothing.

499
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,157
If the kid gets sick again,
it'll give us another clue.

500
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,161
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.

501
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,914
Send him home.

502
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,673
House.

503
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,053
You're just giving up
on this kid?

504
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,515
You gotta know when to stop.

505
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,184
You don't stop. You never stop.

506
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,063
You just keep on going until you
come up with something so insane

507
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,523
that it's usually right.

508
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,942
Except on my last case.

509
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,905
Don't be pathetic.
Just forget the last case.

510
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,700
This kid obviously
has something wrong with him.

511
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,122
When did you develop
such strong opinions about my patients?

512
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,374
Last week, you were convinced
my patient wasn't sick.

513
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,959
Now you're convinced
this one is.

514
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,463
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.

515
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,884
Just get together with your team,
spend a few extra hours...

516
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,471
Well, I guess we could amputate his left
leg. That's where we found most of it.

517
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,973
Maybe we should just
remove his affected eye completely.

518
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,476
If you have reason
to believe that that might help...

519
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,645
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts,

520
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,899
but it's interesting
that you give me the green light.

521
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,651
I just want you
to do something.

522
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:16,071
You've been overly supportive
this entire week.

523
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,950
Either you're hormonal,
or you're guilt-ridden,

524
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,244
and it's too early in the pregnancy
for this to be hormonal.

525
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,664
- I'm not pregnant.
- Then what did you do wrong?

526
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:38,177
He had Addison's.
Your last patient. You were right.

527
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,475
I gave him one shot of cortisol
and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.

528
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:53,025
Oh, your mommy is in such trouble.
She's such a liar.

529
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:57,446
That's why you don't have a daddy.
That's why she had to...

530
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:10,042
How does one person
end up with two different sets of DNA?

531
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,377
We've been through this.

532
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,379
Our assumptions are faulty.

533
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,507
We've confirmed two different sets
of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.

534
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,177
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.

535
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,221
We assumed he's a person.

536
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,433
Of course. The aliens didn't
just visit him. They replaced him.

537
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,855
You're being silly. What if he's
not a person? What if he's two persons?

538
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,232
- I'm not getting the metaphor.
- No metaphor.

539
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,694
Chase, you said the mom
used in vitro fertilization, right?

540
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,028
Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.

541
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,738
Kid was right all along.

542
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,950
He was implanted with something,
back when he was young.

543
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,703
I mean really young,
like 12-cells young.

544
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,205
In vitro increases
the likelihood of twinning.

545
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,540
But he doesn't have a twin.

546
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,542
Not walking around.

547
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,461
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop,

548
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,756
so doctors implant two to six embryos
to make sure you get your money's worth.

549
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,719
Problem is, there's not always
enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.

550
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,929
Two brothers get stuck sharing.
There's no bunk beds,

551
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,600
so they cuddle up to keep warm,
and they never untangle.

552
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,519
He's two people in one.

553
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,023
It's called chimerism.

554
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:20,237
Unfortunately, his brother's
like a bad doubles partner.

555
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,032
The guy just takes up space,
gets in the way.

556
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,535
Clancy's body thinks that
he's gonna put away the easy winners.

557
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,747
His brother just keeps
swatting balls into the net.

558
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,833
We gotta get him off the court.

559
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,588
So does that mean that you can find
the bad cells in his brain or not?

560
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,134
Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine.

561
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,056
Clancy thinks differently
than his brother because he thinks.

562
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,766
If we induce an alien abduction...

563
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,684
Wait. What the hell
are you talking about?

564
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,687
The foreign DNA has got to
be in a portion of your son's brain

565
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,773
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

566
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,442
If we stimulate those neurons
with an electric probe,

567
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,153
we can trick your son's brain
into hallucinating.

568
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,950
Your son's neurons will light up,
and his brother's cells will stay dark.

569
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,910
Those are the ones we cut out.

570
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,371
You're talking about
brain surgery.

571
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:15,417
I'm talking about really cool brain
surgery. One of your sons will die,

572
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,254
but the taller one
won't be so annoying anymore.

573
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,674
So I have a twin?

574
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,134
Not really. What's on the card?

575
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,427
A light bulb.

576
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,888
Start us out at 10.

577
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,311
I'm not doing that.

578
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,021
That was all me, kid. Sorry.

579
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,942
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.

580
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,735
He lives inside me?

581
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,153
Sort of.

582
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,783
That tickles.
Stop tickling my feet.

583
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,952
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.

584
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,036
What do you see on this one?

585
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,539
Moon and stars.

586
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,252
So I am kind of weird?

587
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,380
We're all kind of weird.

588
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,551
No!

589
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,845
- Clancy?
- We got something.

590
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,847
- What do you see?
- The light.

591
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,599
Here they come, I think.

592
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,978
Brain waves indicate a mild
hallucination. Neurons are lighting up.

593
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,188
- Any dark spots?
- Area's too fuzzy.

594
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,815
Hallucination isn't strong enough.

595
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,400
Turn up the juice.

596
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,155
His blood pressure's already
160 over 110. Any higher...

597
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:31,243
Riding the short bus is better
than not breathing. Take us to 100.

598
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,167
Area's still too fuzzy
to make any kind of distinction.

599
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,419
- Crank it up higher.
- You've already exceeded

600
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,672
the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.

601
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,476
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.

602
00:39:55,602 --> 00:40:00,105
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.

603
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,964
Clancy? Can you hear me?

604
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,383
Clancy?

605
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,933
You got them.

606
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,603
Yep.

607
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,856
We got them all.

608
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,483
Close him up.

609
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,236
Everything's gonna be normal again.

610
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,209
You believe what
Cuddy tried to pull?

611
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,545
What now?

612
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,338
She lied to me.

613
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,842
She cured my patient with my diagnosis,
then lied to me about it.

614
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,593
That doesn't sound like her.

615
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,470
You're right.

616
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,474
Does sound like you, though.

617
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:23,105
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?

618
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,817
Nothing that your body language
isn't telling me right now.

619
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,321
So what was the plan?

620
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:38,537
I'd feel so humbled by missing a case
that I'd reevaluate my entire life,

621
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,999
question the nature of truth
and goodness and become Cameron?

622
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,253
Something like that.
More that if we told you the truth,

623
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:51,341
that you solved a case
based on absolutely no medical proof,

624
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
you'd think you were God.

625
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,806
And I was worried
your wings would melt.

626
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,145
God doesn't limp.
