1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,838
Adam, eyes here.

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,676
Follow my finger.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:15,348
Adam, show me a bicycle.

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,480
Eyes here.

5
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:32,115
Adam, show me a bicycle.

6
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,716
No, buddy, that's a ball.

7
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,095
Adam, look at me.
Are you hungry?

8
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,847
Show me what you
want for lunch.

9
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:18,035
He's still drawing those lines
instead of looking at the cards.

10
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,707
More juice?

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,294
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

12
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,922
Adam, buddy, eyes here.

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,132
He's tired, Dom.

14
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,051
He wouldn't be
if we stuck to the schedule.

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,262
Show me the juice, buddy.

16
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,348
I think we've reached
the point of diminishing returns.

17
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,768
He has to ask for it. Adam.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,104
He's choking.

19
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,775
That's impossible.
It's mac and cheese.

20
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,359
Ten-year-old boy who screams
for his life for no reason.

21
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,278
He's autistic.
Severely autistic.

22
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,198
Can't talk,
can't make eye contact.

23
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,408
Screaming is probably his way
of communicating.

24
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,411
And he went to three different doctors
who all said just that.

25
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,831
So, clearly that can't be the answer.

26
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,624
His brain can't
filter information.

27
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,044
It's a constant assault on his senses.
I'd scream, too.

28
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,506
Or it's something medical-sounding,
like dysesthesia.

29
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,927
Parents are convinced that there's
something wrong with their son.

30
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,974
Since when did we start believing
parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?

31
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,559
Elevator.

32
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,229
Dad was on Wall Street,
Mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

33
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,596
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

34
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,328
So they're over-protective and scared.
The more reason to discount...

35
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,610
They study this kid.

36
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,030
Heard him scream a million times,
but in ten years of caring for him,

37
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,657
this is the first time
they've brought him to a hospital.

38
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,285
ER checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

39
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,703
Which means the only symptom
was a scream,

40
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,413
which is diagnostic of nothing.

41
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,541
Kid clutched his chest, BP was elevated,
maybe there was chest pain.

42
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,376
ER said the heart was fine.

43
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,128
Don't be so quick
to dismiss pain.

44
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,547
- Where are we going?
- Down.

45
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,424
Stool sample
to check for parasites,

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,427
blood culture to rule out infection,
and ANA for lupus.

47
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,761
Because he screamed?

48
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,805
Could also be
an environmental reaction.

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,558
An allergy.
Dust, wheat, pollen,

50
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,604
- a toxin or something he ate.
- Check the house.

51
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,478
And run a lung
ventilation scan.

52
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,063
Lungs are in the chest, too, right?

53
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,440
I had a date last night,
she screamed.

54
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,483
Should we spend
a hundred thousand dollars testing her?

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,278
Of course not.
This isn't a veterinary hospital.

56
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,197
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving...

57
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,490
That's not what I'm saying.

58
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,200
That's too bad.
It was a good point.

59
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,161
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

60
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,203
You know what it's going to be like

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,831
trying to put an autistic kid
into a nuclear scanner?

62
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,333
I don't envy you guys.

63
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,839
I want my old carpet back.

64
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:22,762
We're going to have to do this later.
A kid in the clinic had an accident.

65
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,222
Generally, when people
are on the phone...

66
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,266
I want my old carpet back.

67
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,559
It was stained with blood.

68
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,312
Yeah, my blood,
which makes the carpet part of me.

69
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,606
I want it back.
I want to be buried with it.

70
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,652
You think you can get me to do
anything you want,

71
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,610
regardless of how stupid it is?

72
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,779
It's my office.
It's where I work,

73
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,075
where I think, where I save lives,
allowing you to brag to rich people,

74
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,495
so they'll give you more money
to spend on MRis and low-cut tops.

75
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,538
I want it back the way it was.

76
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,041
It's identical
to the old carpet.

77
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,543
Except without
the hazardous biological waste.

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,006
I shall not return to my office until
every patented, durable micro-fiber

79
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,716
has been restored
to its rightful place.

80
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,301
Inspiring.

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,346
If you don't want to work
in your office, work in the clinic.

82
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,766
If you don't want to work in the clinic,
go home. And don't get paid.

83
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:14,563
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica! Attica!

84
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,651
Attica?

85
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,949
He just needs to
finish this level.

86
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,451
We only have the scanner
for the next half hour.

87
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
- After that...
- Trust me,

88
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,539
you don't want to move him
until he's finished.

89
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,584
The sooner we do this test,
the sooner we can get you guys home.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,343
Adam, do you think that...

91
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,554
No.

92
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,474
Ten minutes. Tops.

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,185
If he has a vascular disorder,
he might not have...

94
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,604
He might not have ten minutes?

95
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,149
I don't have ten minutes.

96
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,528
No! No! You don't want to
do that. Adam? Adam?

97
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,952
I used Metamucil
like the doctor told me

98
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,747
and finally I was able to
use the bathroom.

99
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:18,377
But I saw something in the toilet
I couldn't identify.

100
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,381
I wrapped it in tissue paper,
so you could take a look.

101
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,263
Can't you sedate him or something?

102
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,267
I could if I didn't want
the test results to mean anything.

103
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,034
Painkillers, exercising,

104
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,537
we even did that
puncture thing, nothing works.

105
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,708
Then this morning, I get up,
my back feels great.

106
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,504
I figured I'd better
get down here, right away.

107
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,766
Big shocker, Dad's depressed.

108
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,934
Save your time.

109
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,353
SSRis don't cause chest pain.

110
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,190
Wow.

111
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,067
Every minute of every day is booked.

112
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,861
When he eats, sleeps,
plays his handheld.

113
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,905
Not much of a life for them.

114
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,281
They chose to have a family.

115
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,785
You don't get to decide
what your kid's going to be like.

116
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,620
Nobody chooses this.

117
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,628
It's funny,
you get a normal kid, the parent works.

118
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,672
You get a special kid
that costs more,

119
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,633
you quit and turn the backyard
into a therapy circuit.

120
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,052
Yes, if only you
were handicapped.

121
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,556
All the good times
you could have had with Dad.

122
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,780
Hi, Doctor House.

123
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,200
Hello, girl whose name
I don't remember,

124
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,120
but whose dad I treated,
so I don't really know why she's here.

125
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:21,500
Ali. I think I caught
what my dad has. The rhino thing.

126
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,294
Right.

127
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,922
Does that hurt?

128
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,174
Little.

129
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,135
It's in my chest, too.

130
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,386
Of course it is.

131
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:46,066
Kind of had access through the shirt,
but this'll work.

132
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,572
That feels good.

133
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,411
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

134
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,124
About five weeks ago.
It's been very lonely.

135
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,173
The...

136
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,179
The ventilation scan was normal.
Time to send him home.

137
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,848
Can't leave right now.
Well, congratulations.

138
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,392
You are the proud owner
of your very own "rhino thing."

139
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,354
A rhinovirus?
You can't leave because she has a cold?

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,357
I can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

141
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,278
All the tests are normal.

142
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,823
Okay, don't start with me.
We're backed up.

143
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,035
I know this is hard for all of us,
but thanks to Doctor Cuddy,

144
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,037
I don't have an office,
so I have to work here.

145
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,580
What did she do to your office?

146
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,040
It's unusable.

147
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,793
So whatever's bothering him,
it wasn't his lungs.

148
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,002
What about the kid's house?

149
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,968
There were some pesticides and alcohol,
but the tox screen was negative.

150
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,368
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong with this kid.

151
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,135
We already had that discussion.
We get a fecal smear?

152
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,887
Should we do this
someplace else?

153
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,014
No, Cuddy says
I have to work here.

154
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,060
No, I said you can work in your office,
or you had to work here.

155
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,688
And since I can't work
in my office...

156
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,690
Is this your master plan?

157
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,610
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

158
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,655
Devious. Saw it
in a James Bond movie.

159
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,532
Fecal smear! Talk to me.

160
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,033
Get out of here.

161
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,159
Put back my carpet?

162
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,619
No. Get out of here.

163
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,163
Fecal matter.
Is there a sample we can look at?

164
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,874
The parents have a smear kit.
The kid is constipated.

165
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,836
Do what you want.
Not replacing your carpet.

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,257
Go up his rear and get a smear.

167
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,427
Which reminds me,
I kind of feel like a bagel.

168
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,639
Carpets.

169
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,477
Need a stool sample.

170
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,108
We should probably wait until
he's finished playing that level, huh?

171
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,485
I actually think
he's a bit better today.

172
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,195
He seems more like
his old self.

173
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,156
It's possible that
he was never sick.

174
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,575
I guess, we could've overreacted.

175
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,419
- Adam? Adam?
- Adam? Adam?

176
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,136
So what makes fluid fill the lining
of a kid's lungs?

177
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,139
Why are we in here?
Is this some sort of power play?

178
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,098
Yeah.

179
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,186
So, you stuck your finger in the kid
and gave him a pleural effusion?

180
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,271
Have you ever considered
getting a manicure?

181
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,440
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

182
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,192
Or do you really have a problem
with the carpeting?

183
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,693
Change sets you off...

184
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,320
I said it was a power play.

185
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,239
If someone answers yes to option A,
you don't move on to option B.

186
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,926
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out heart failure.

187
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,203
Why now? Why a power play now?

188
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,788
I smelled weakness.

189
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,998
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

190
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,050
That's funny.
It says, "James Wilson."

191
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,469
That's a strange typo.

192
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:05,224
The fluid comes back and exudates,
get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.

193
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,603
- Thank you for coming.
- No problem.

194
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,147
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

195
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:18,695
You share stories, feelings,
toys, you don't share offices.

196
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,156
That is so not Zen.

197
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,784
It was a gift.

198
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,619
Some doctors get those.

199
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,246
So, you want mornings
or afternoons?

200
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,958
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable,
so you're going to make me miserable,

201
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,085
so I can make Cuddy miserable
on your behalf?

202
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,044
Yeah.

203
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,004
What makes you think
I can make her miserable?

204
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,214
'Cause you're
good at that stuff.

205
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,299
I'm nothing compared to you.

206
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,592
Is there anything
you'll throw out?

207
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,928
That's a gift from
an eleven-year-old patient of mine.

208
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,265
She and I both knew it was a piece
of junk, and that's what made her laugh.

209
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,851
So you gotta keep it until she...

210
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,477
She already did.

211
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,449
Adam, I need you to
stay still, buddy.

212
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,993
It's okay. It's okay.
I got him.

213
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,455
There we go.

214
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,966
What? What is it?
Is his heart okay?

215
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,385
No.

216
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:32,227
Echo suggested a conduction
abnormality, EKG confirmed it.

217
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,607
Still doesn't explain the effusion.
The pleural fluid was an exudate.

218
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,610
We should be looking for something that
explains the heart and lung problems.

219
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,945
An infection, parasite, cancer.

220
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,450
Microbiology showed no organisms
in the fluids, so forget infection.

221
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,702
It's not a power play.

222
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,624
Doing a differential in the clinic
makes sense, piss Cuddy off.

223
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,001
Same thing with Wilson's office,
works indirectly.

224
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,587
But now we're in office space

225
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,381
because you don't want to be
in your own office.

226
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,884
Which means this has nothing
to do with Cuddy.

227
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,220
You really are obsessed
with your carpets.

228
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,056
- Which means...
- What are you doing here?

229
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,350
I have this room
booked from two to three.

230
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,644
Two, East Coast Time?

231
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:20,067
I thought you meant Pacific.
Which is stupid of me, I guess.

232
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
What about parasites?

233
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,030
Stool sample's negative.

234
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,114
It's two o'clock.

235
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:30,285
Oh, well. We should go then.
That just leaves cancer.

236
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,162
Get a lung biopsy.

237
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,040
It took a half an hour to get the mask
on the kid for the lung scan.

238
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,293
I'm sorry. Was there somewhere
you needed to be?

239
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,675
House, can we talk?

240
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,390
- Carpet?
- Never.

241
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,808
Nothing to talk about.

242
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:57,020
Your girlfriend called the clinic
15 times, looking for you today.

243
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,689
Lot to discuss,
china patterns...

244
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,357
House. She's a stalker.

245
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,483
Right.

246
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,902
Couldn't be that she finds me
interesting, attractive,

247
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,149
has to be that she's insane.

248
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,198
She's called you 15 times. Your mother's
not that interested in you.

249
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,325
Well maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

250
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,531
- I'm notifying security.
- Is this about the carpet?

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,329
Do you think I'll back off
if you block all my fun?

252
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,747
You better not be having fun.

253
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm having fun.
I'm not having sex.

254
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,418
- She's dangerous.
- She's not dangerous.

255
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,919
- She's pretty.
- She's pretty.

256
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,171
- Men are stupid.
- I'm with you so far.

257
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,382
I'm notifying security.

258
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:30,429
Give her a break.
She's not dangerous, she's insightful.

259
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,682
You can't stop our love!

260
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,648
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,650
We have a ten-year-old
with pleural effusion

262
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,028
and conduction abnormality,
but no heart failure.

263
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,529
Was there protein
in the pleural fluid?

264
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,615
Yeah. That's why
we're thinking cancer.

265
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,784
Non-Hodgkin's probably.
So we want to do a lung biopsy.

266
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,536
Lung biopsies usually
come back negative,

267
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,747
so biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

268
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,124
That's probably something
an oncologist should do, right?

269
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,376
There's nothing real tricky to it.
It's a biopsy.

270
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,546
Still, just to be safe. You mind?

271
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,767
For the love of God,
can't somebody shut that kid up?

272
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,477
People are trying to
work around here.

273
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,270
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

274
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,480
Who are you?

275
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,190
Somebody you'll
never send a gift to.

276
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,984
This is Doctor House,
your son's doctor.

277
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,694
High test, please.

278
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,031
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

279
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,369
Out of Vicodin?

280
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,288
What are you doing?

281
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,208
Eating the red berries.

282
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,194
He trusted you.

283
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,990
No, that wasn't trust.
That was self-preservation.

284
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,201
No. That was huge.

285
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,955
- It was like a conversation.
- A mon...

286
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:25,627
A monkey's afraid to eat the red berries
until he sees another monkey eat 'em.

287
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,422
Monkey see, monkey do.
That's all it was.

288
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,260
Your kid's still just as messed up
as when we admitted him.

289
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,191
That was sensitive.

290
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,860
You have pretty hair.

291
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,197
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

292
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,284
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

293
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,953
What they should do is
get a cooker spaniel.

294
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,456
A dog would look them
in the eye,

295
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,959
wag his tail when he's happy,
lick their face, show them love.

296
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,246
Is it so wrong for them
to want to have a normal child?

297
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,338
It's normal to
want to be normal.

298
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,507
Spoken like
a true Circle Queen.

299
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,845
See, skinny,
socially-privileged white people

300
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,847
get to draw this
neat little circle.

301
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,850
Everyone inside
the circle is normal.

302
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,269
Everyone outside the circle
should be beaten,

303
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,939
broken and reset,
so they can be brought into the circle.

304
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,194
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized, or worse, pitied.

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,321
So, it's wrong to feel sorry
for this little boy?

306
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,655
Why would you feel sorry
for someone

307
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,408
who gets to opt out
of the inane courteous formalities,

308
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,120
which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore, degrading?

309
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,123
This kid doesn't have to pretend
to be interested in your back pain,

310
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,418
or your excretions,
or your grandma's itchy place.

311
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,184
Can you imagine
how liberating it would be

312
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:54,090
to live a life free of
all the mind-numbing social niceties?

313
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,720
I don't pity this kid.
I envy him.

314
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,060
No cancer because
these aren't lymph cells.

315
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,978
Then what are they?

316
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,397
Liver cells.

317
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,951
Wow, liver cells under his arm.

318
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,122
Wonder what he's got
where his liver's supposed to be?

319
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,140
Anyone got a clue how
liver cells got into the kid's armpit?

320
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,063
Make yourself at home.

321
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,901
So, you think maybe
Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?

322
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,612
Lymph system circulates fluid,
not organ cells.

323
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,031
Cancer cells break into
the lymphatic system all the time.

324
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,491
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

325
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,119
So what's the difference
between cancer cells and liver cells?

326
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,371
Why can one pass through walls,
but the other can't?

327
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,415
Cancer cells are damaged,
it lets them grow into blood vessels,

328
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,624
go wherever they want.

329
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,150
So if the liver cells
are damaged...

330
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,211
The liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

331
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,797
So if the liver cells
are damaged,

332
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,523
it's theoretically possible
they passed into the lymphatic system.

333
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,720
Liver failure could also explain
pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

334
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,096
The liver cells are fine.

335
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,473
He was immunized for Hep A and B,
and do you really think this kid

336
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,351
is having unprotected sex,
or sharing needles?

337
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,272
Daddy does seem
the type to use a rubber.

338
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,860
So it's not viral. That just leaves
a lot of booze-irrhosis.

339
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,906
Our 10-year-old boy does not
have a drinking problem, or cirrhosis.

340
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,272
House, when we
echoed his heart,

341
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,950
we got a piece of his liver.
There was no scarring.

342
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,661
Cirrhosis explains the symptoms,
heart problems, lungs...

343
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,122
Look up cirrhosis in the dictionary,
it means scarring.

344
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,583
Parents aren't doing
or dosing this kid.

345
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,959
How would you know that?

346
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,211
The kid can't talk.
Why do you think I took this case?

347
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,858
He's not going to give away
the ending.

348
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,256
They quit their jobs for him.

349
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,010
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

350
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,096
Unfortunately,
their kid is nothing you'd want.

351
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,891
When a baby is born, it's perfect.

352
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,270
Little fingers, little toes,
plump, perfect, pink,

353
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,940
and brimming
with unbridled potential.

354
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:19,152
Then it's downhill.
Some hills steeper than others.

355
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,655
Parents get off
on their kids' accomplishments.

356
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,448
Bend over and relax.

357
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,950
Cute.

358
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,703
They'll annoy you
with trophy rooms and report cards.

359
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,789
Hell, they'll even show you a purple cow

360
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,334
and tell what a keen eye
for color their kid has.

361
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,969
But this kid, he doesn't smile,

362
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,929
he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh.

363
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,389
His parents get nothing

364
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,395
but the right to brag that their kid
picked orange juice out of a lineup.

365
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,229
So you figure they slip the kid a mickey
so they don't have to deal.

366
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,314
Do a biopsy
to confirm cirrhosis.

367
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,652
Don't try to pawn it off on Wilson,
he's going to be busy with Cuddy.

368
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,202
My parents love me unconditionally.
Get out of here.

369
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,083
Don't you think
the restraining order's a little much?

370
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,877
He's not actually going to have sex
with a 17-year-old patient.

371
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,504
I didn't think he was going to ask me

372
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,090
to dig a bloodstained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

373
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,801
It might be easier
in the long run.

374
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,140
Are we stopping here,
so House doesn't find us?

375
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,435
Unless you want to make out.

376
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,604
You want me to surrender
to House's coup?

377
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:42,277
No, no. You pro-actively
give him what he wants.

378
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
I defeat him
by surrendering to him.

379
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,615
He'll never see it coming.
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

380
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,743
What is it, a thousand bucks
to carpet a room?

381
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,536
Actually, it's 400.

382
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,204
Not doing it.

383
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,171
Liver biopsy?

384
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,380
They're doing it now.

385
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,757
How's it going?

386
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,091
Like a biopsy.

387
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,510
Needles, cells, screaming.

388
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,471
What did you find
in the stool sample?

389
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,848
You were too busy
bothering Cuddy.

390
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,854
But as discussed,
it was negative for parasites.

391
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,143
Can we get out of here?

392
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,394
I didn't ask
what you didn't find,

393
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,605
I asked what you did find
in the stool sample.

394
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,607
Stool

395
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,194
and traces of iron, zinc,
calcium carbonate. Can we leave?

396
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,488
What's the matter?
You afraid of the man?

397
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,531
Yeah.

398
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,618
Too late.

399
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,121
Leave my stuff alone.

400
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,750
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim
in 15 minutes. You're wearing that?

401
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,128
I'm going to count to three
and then I'm going to fire you. One.

402
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,215
Calcium carbonate?
That's an anti-diarrheal, right?

403
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,841
- Two.
- Think that's significant?

404
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,302
Think hard poops is significant?

405
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,138
Two and a half.

406
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,141
Never threaten
unless you're ready to deliver.

407
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,518
Makes you look weak.

408
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,353
Thank God you don't have children.

409
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,316
Doctor Cuddy.

410
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,778
Take a message.

411
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,407
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

412
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:16,412
Wow. That's like the one thing
that would get me out of here.

413
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,832
I'm sorry,
you can't come in here.

414
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,959
What's going on?

415
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,044
One, two, three.

416
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,631
He's in V fib.

417
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,761
Charged.

418
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,263
Clear.

419
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,931
Charging, clear.

420
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,519
Charging, clear.
Charging, clear.

421
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,326
He's stable for the moment.
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

422
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,745
Okay, what else do we know?

423
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,748
His liver's damaged. Pleural effusion
compromised his lung function.

424
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,209
Biopsy was negative
for cirrhosis.

425
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,211
Parents didn't
poison their son.

426
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,549
It's not his liver,
his heart, or his lungs.

427
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,343
It's the calcium carbonate
in his stool.

428
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,138
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably just overdid it.

429
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,390
Or they didn't do it at all.

430
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,601
Calcium carbonate
is also what's in chalk.

431
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,852
So he ate some chalk.

432
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,479
It isn't toxic, it sure didn't cause
the pleural effusion.

433
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,606
Forget the chalk.

434
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:25,773
You just said
it was about the chalk.

435
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,734
Yes, and then I said,
"Forget the chalk."

436
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,862
You must be very confused.
The kid's got pica.

437
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,615
You take him to a buffet,
he's going to eat the table.

438
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,657
Or lead paint.

439
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,303
Level of lead in the blood was normal.
His tox screen was clean.

440
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,703
We're not looking for typical poisons.

441
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,705
We're looking for anything
that he could put in his mouth.

442
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,832
Matches, spiders, bricks.

443
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,376
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

444
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,711
Even better.

445
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:51,549
Hansel, get samples of
the Gingerbread House. Bag everything.

446
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,017
Hey.

447
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,191
You could get into
a lot of trouble being here.

448
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,901
I wanted to see you.

449
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,194
Yeah, I got that.

450
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:16,282
So did everyone else.
They think you're a stalker.

451
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,619
One could argue those people
might be jealous of your attention.

452
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,121
Yes, I actually
made that argument.

453
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,000
- You going home?
- That's the plan.

454
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,630
In Iceland, the age of consent is 14.

455
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,176
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry up there.

456
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,055
Today I'm jailbait,
but in 22 weeks,

457
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,308
anybody can do anything to me.

458
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,437
Will I be so different
in 22 weeks?

459
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,941
Twenty-two weeks is enough
for an embryo to grow arms and legs.

460
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,151
It's just a line.

461
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,697
An arbitrary line drawn
by a bunch of sad, old men in robes.

462
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,574
Yeah, who cares what judges think?

463
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,078
I didn't think of you as a guy
who followed rules

464
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,622
just because they were rules.

465
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,005
You are over ten years younger than me.

466
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,258
I said, "Over."

467
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,430
- Gotta go!
- House.

468
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,016
Doctor Cuddy.

469
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,685
Do you happen to know the way
to the Icelandic consulate?

470
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,605
This young woman, a stranger to me,
was just asking directions.

471
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,942
Security was going to call the police.
I don't want to do that to you.

472
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,902
- Go home.
- She needed a ride.

473
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,197
She got here on her own,
she can get home on her own.

474
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,574
Now.

475
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:45,079
If I see you on hospital grounds again,
I will call the police.

476
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:03,598
After that look, I'm feeling
a little frisky. Looks like you're up.

477
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,725
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

478
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,062
The frisky, it went away.

479
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,147
House, this isn't a game.

480
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,405
If I leave her alone,
can I have my carpet back?

481
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,948
No.

482
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,243
If I forget about
my carpet can I have her?

483
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,856
Jimsonweed. I found a small patch of it
in his backyard.

484
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,568
Jimsonweed contains atropine,
poor man's acid.

485
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,030
Our kid's been tripping on
"Lucy in the Sky with cubic zirconium."

486
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,491
Explains the pleural effusion,
the heart arrhythmias.

487
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,410
Meeting here will do nothing
to upset Cuddy.

488
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,869
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

489
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,330
I'm trying to figure out
what's wrong with the patient.

490
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,957
- Continue.
- I'm done.

491
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,501
Jimsonweed doesn't explain
the screaming.

492
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,107
You've obviously
never had a bad trip.

493
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,672
I would've thought you'd try
to accomplish two goals at once.

494
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,158
Why can't you be more like
the other age-inappropriate girls

495
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,010
who have a thing for me?
Just accept me for me.

496
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,304
Continue.

497
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:29,016
Treatment for jimsonweed OD
is physostigmine.

498
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,102
Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

499
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,645
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

500
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,731
Serum from the lab in Patterson
is three days minimum.

501
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,151
He won't survive three days.

502
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,610
What time does he wake up?

503
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,446
7:35 a.m.

504
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,322
Then what? Walk me through it.

505
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,325
7:40 to 7:50 he goes to the toilet,
washes his face.

506
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,410
What does this matter?

507
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,703
I'm trying to prove
he ate the plant.

508
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,705
His schedule has nothing to do
with jimsonweed.

509
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,952
There are two possibilities.

510
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,793
Either the parents saw him eat the plant
or the kid has unsupervised time,

511
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,004
and eats plants instead of
playing with blocks.

512
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,548
Even if you find 15 minutes
of free time outside,

513
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,133
it doesn't mean he spent it
eating a bush.

514
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:06,471
So, what do we do? Nothing?
Wait for the kid to tell us? What?

515
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,477
Where are you going?

516
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,228
To talk to him.

517
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,782
Ever see your son eat a bush?

518
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:27,825
I haven't.

519
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,202
I've only ever seen him eat...

520
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,579
Adam, you ate something at your house.

521
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,875
Something that made you sick.
I need you to show me what you ate.

522
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,335
He can't answer you.

523
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,170
Neither can you.

524
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,673
This is your backyard.

525
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,053
You may know it as Mel's Diner.
This is your sandbox.

526
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:51,432
Your jungle gym.
And under it is this.

527
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,646
I need to know if you ate this, Adam.

528
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,190
He doesn't know what you want.

529
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:03,319
Adam, you have to tell me
because if you don't,

530
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,033
game over. You'll be dead.

531
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,327
What the hell are you doing?

532
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,204
Show me what you ate.

533
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,582
Adam, show me what you ate.

534
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,313
- Adam?
- Honey?

535
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,107
Adam!

536
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,245
Come on in, brothers and sister,

537
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,372
welcome to
the house of the Lord!

538
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,583
House, come on. The Chapel?

539
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,712
We have been blessed
with the miracle of a new symptom.

540
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,463
Brother, can you testify

541
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,759
as to why this poor child's
eyeball rolled back into his head?

542
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:13,347
It's consistent with jimsonweed
poisoning, ocular paralysis. I'm sorry.

543
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,807
The wicked shall deceive ye

544
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,185
because they have turned
from the Lord and are idiots.

545
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,646
His ocular muscle
didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

546
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,399
- MS?
- It is easier for a wise man

547
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,818
- to gain access to heaven...
- Will you stop doing that?

548
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,111
Just say, "Not MS."

549
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,238
A stroke, bleed in the brain.

550
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,451
We'd be seeing other symptoms besides
a single eye misalignment. Like a coma.

551
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,869
And you've already testified.

552
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,329
It's a tumor.

553
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,456
And all the imaging just missed it?

554
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,999
It's a micro-tumor.

555
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,209
It started in his lung,
which caused the pleural effusion.

556
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,379
Then it metastasized to his liver,
which made it slough cells.

557
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,132
And then it went to his brain
behind the eye,

558
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,800
which caused it to roll back
into his head.

559
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,720
So, he had three tumors
and we missed all of them?

560
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,709
What's the opposite of a miracle?

561
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:58,517
I have a better chance of finding it,
now that I know exactly where to look.

562
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:02,396
So, unless you have a better idea,

563
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:08,027
I'm going to go CT his head and then,
if I have to, remove his eye.

564
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,115
You remove this kid's eye,

565
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:17,620
he's only going to be
half as good at not making eye contact.

566
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,340
Hello?

567
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,509
Hello?

568
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,184
I have sad news for you.
She doesn't love you.

569
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,561
You're ugly when you're jealous.

570
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,439
She showed up at my house last night.
Came on to me.

571
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,234
She's even more perfect than I thought.

572
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,070
House, she's sick.

573
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,698
You say, "Sick,"
I say, "Freestylin'."

574
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,075
The girl will have sex
with an invertebrate.

575
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,077
Come on, you're not that bad.

576
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,329
She has a problem.

577
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,375
You're not doing her
any favors by indulging her.

578
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,208
How could you lie like this?

579
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,252
Do you not have room
in your heart for love?

580
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,503
You don't believe me.

581
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,339
I didn't believe the kids when they said
that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

582
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,632
I didn't believe them then.
I don't believe them now.

583
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,136
I don't care that
Susie married Johnny. She's mine.

584
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,181
She has a mole on her right breast,
just below the nipple.

585
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,349
No, she doesn't.

586
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,600
You've seen her breasts?

587
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,145
It was a medical exam.
I was listening to her heart.

588
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:28,315
It went, "Greg-House.
Greg-House. Greg-House."

589
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,901
Fine. I'm lying.

590
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,989
But she did come back.
She's locked up in my office.

591
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:39,493
I was hoping you could talk to her,
put an end to this.

592
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,468
Listen to me.

593
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,952
Do you have any idea what you'd have

594
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,599
to look forward to
if you stayed with me?

595
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,685
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

596
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,856
You're only saying that to make me go.

597
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,358
I'm saying it 'cause it's true.

598
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:17,114
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

599
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,327
Is there a Victor
in your class?

600
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,542
If you're not with someone your age,
you'll regret it.

601
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:34,256
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

602
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,343
What about us?

603
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,678
We'll always have Fresno.

604
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,643
I'm no good at being noble,
but it doesn't take much to see

605
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,249
that the problems
of two little people

606
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,022
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

607
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,943
Someday you'll understand that.

608
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:01,325
Now, now,
here's looking at you.

609
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,666
Damn.

610
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,087
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

611
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,171
What?

612
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,923
I ask all my girlfriends that.

613
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,303
Yeah, a little one.

614
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,472
Damn.

615
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,558
What? What?

616
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,768
- What is it?
- It's not love.

617
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,771
You have spore in your brain.

618
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:34,024
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of them.

619
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,151
They get an earthquake,
they get released into the air,

620
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,945
you breathe it in,
you get a cold.

621
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:43,492
Turns into sinus congestion, aches,
weakness, milky tears, and sometimes

622
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,288
loss of inhibition
and judgment.

623
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,957
Damn!

624
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,335
So, loving you,

625
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:59,008
wanting to have sex with you
was all just the spores talking?

626
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,431
You'll probably live.

627
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,935
Damn!

628
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,504
Hey! Don't touch his eye!

629
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,007
This is an appendectomy.

630
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,054
Like I said,
don't touch his eye.

631
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,142
Why isn't he in surgery?

632
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,477
Some emergency bumped him.

633
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,686
We've got another room
in ten minutes.

634
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,396
You're not taking him in.

635
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,231
Kill the lights.

636
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,903
He was seeing them
all the time.

637
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,446
What are you looking for?

638
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,198
He was telling us
what he was seeing.

639
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,742
Telling us exactly
what was wrong with him.

640
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,536
Drawing them for us over and over again.

641
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,456
But nobody knew
how to speak autistic.

642
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,667
When I asked him what he ate,
he even told me that.

643
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,836
What are you talking about?
What was he seeing?

644
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,634
Hello, my pretties.
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

645
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,929
It's worms swimming in his eye.

646
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:31,809
Animal makes potty in the sandbox,
boy plays in the sandbox.

647
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,644
Boy eats the sand.

648
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,690
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

649
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,370
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

650
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,359
Raccoon roundworms are not
excreted by their human host.

651
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,694
Cameron tested the sand.

652
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,861
All of it?

653
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,031
Worms spread from his gut
to the rest of his body.

654
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,576
They attacked his lungs, that's what
made him scream and caused the effusion.

655
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:53,247
They invade his liver, sending dead
liver cells coursing through his system.

656
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,749
They attacked his eye
and the muscles surrounding it,

657
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,168
making his eyeball
do a back flip.

658
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,296
Laser photocoagulation
to fix the eye,

659
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,966
and a high dose of benzimidazole
to kill the worms.

660
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,886
Wait a minute, that's it?
He's going to be okay?

661
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,722
Good news.

662
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,018
He's going to be with you
for a long, long time.

663
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,152
I'm going to read you
something.

664
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,405
"Asperger Syndrome is a mild
and rare form of autism."

665
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,825
"It is typically characterized by
difficulty establishing friendships,"

666
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,079
"and playing with peers, trouble
accepting conventional social rules,"

667
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,208
"and they dislike any change
in setting or routine."

668
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,877
Or broadloom.

669
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,126
It doesn't say that last part,
but you get my point.

670
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:46,717
House doesn't have Asperger's. The
diagnosis is much simpler, he's a jerk.

671
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,594
Why do you think
he took this case?

672
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,345
Because he
believes these parents?

673
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,556
Because he wants to
help a young boy?

674
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:58,270
He sees himself in this kid,
and he's trying to help himself.

675
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,609
He doesn't want this,
he needs it.

676
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,710
You're not autistic.
You don't even have Asperger's.

677
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,128
You wish you did.

678
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,131
That would exempt you
from the rules, give you freedom,

679
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,511
absolve you of responsibility,
let you date 17-year-olds.

680
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,098
But most important, it would mean
that you're not just a jerk.

681
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,603
At what point does a person endlessly
lecturing someone make him a jerk?

682
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:52,199
First tongue kiss is an eight
on the happiness scale.

683
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,913
Child being snatched back
from the brink of death, that's a ten.

684
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,337
They're clocking in
at a very tepid six point five,

685
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,424
because they know what
they have to go back to.

686
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,473
Listen,

687
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,018
thanks.

688
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,729
You saved his life.

689
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,899
Yeah, I know. See ya.

690
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,789
That was so good.

691
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,179
That was a ten.

692
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,909
All change is bad?

693
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,371
It's not true, you know.
