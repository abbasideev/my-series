1
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,232
You okay?

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,358
Yeah, just got clipped
with a beam.

3
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,818
What the hell do you two think
you were doing?

4
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,152
We thought we
heard someone in there!

5
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,904
You never go in
without authorization!

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,989
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

7
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,450
So torching your ass last year
wasn't enough, huh?

8
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,285
You need to stop trying
to prove how tough you are

9
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,205
before you get yourself killed.

10
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,665
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,293
Let the paramedics
look you over.

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,969
Come on, Derek. Let's get this ladder
to the second story. Let's go.

13
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,334
Derek! Derek!

14
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,389
Derek!

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,977
What's happening?

16
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,938
I'm freezing.

17
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,934
I'm fine.

18
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
ER docs don't think so.

19
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,313
Your temperature's been going up
and down like a rollercoaster.

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,315
How old are these skin grafts?

21
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,859
Last one was
about six months ago.

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,322
We're gonna run some tests and
we'll get a consult with Dr. House.

23
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,323
I'll be fine.

24
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,326
You'll be doing
what the doctors say. Got it?

25
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,246
I'll check in later.

26
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,542
Hey.

27
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,588
The way you
covered for me last night...

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,257
He's my brother.

29
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,634
I know how to eat it from him.

30
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,012
I'm gonna stop by
after my shift, okay?

31
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,347
Okay.

32
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,475
So where is this Dr. House?

33
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,812
Speaking engagement.

34
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,274
Not guilty.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,192
And on the charge of gaining
control

36
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,278
of said medication
by fraud, how do you plead?

37
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,029
- Not guilty.
- Very well.

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,158
Preliminary hearing is set for
the 19th at 10:00 a.m.,

39
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,493
at which time I'll determine

40
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,121
whether there's enough evidence to
proceed to trial.

41
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,583
Next case on the calendar.
People versus Williams.

42
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,376
Charge is assault
in the second degree

43
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,420
with intent to cause injury
to another person.

44
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,464
I see the defense has
submitted a motion to dismiss...

45
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,176
You gonna go talk to him?

46
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,637
I was gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

47
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,391
They have your signature
in the prescription log,

48
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,184
a security camera video,

49
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:51,397
and a pharmacist's sworn statement
saying you stole a dead guy's pills.

50
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,274
You're already looking
at 10 years.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,068
You wanna add
a witness intimidation charge?

52
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,863
Go ahead, ask him
about his hair.

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,204
He suffered third-degree burns
over 54% of his body, a year ago,

54
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,082
and arrived in the ER last night,
disoriented and shivering.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,336
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between 96 and 102.

56
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,713
Why don't you contest the search
of the pharmacy records?

57
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,549
Yeah. You could argue it violated
doctor-patient confidentiality.

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,384
Except he wasn't the patient
or the doctor.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,387
He was the guy who stole
from the patient and the doctor!

60
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,194
This was the third time he'd been
disoriented in the last two weeks.

61
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,645
Running into smoke-filled burning
buildings can be a bit disorienting.

62
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,272
Fortunately, I have the cure.
Stop doing it.

63
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,650
He's not in a burning building anymore,
and he's still shivering.

64
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,096
A hypothalamic tumor could cause
a vacillating temperature.

65
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,363
So could ER nurses
who were too busy to notice

66
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,616
that a patient likes
both hot coffee and cold sodas.

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,706
He tested negative for Hep C, TB, HIV,
Lyme, and his tox screen's clean.

68
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,587
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly in the mood to dance.

69
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,590
I'm not asking you to dance.
I'm asking you to do your job.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
EKG showed arrhythmia.
Probably just a mild heart attack.

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,979
No chest pain. And smoke inhalation
already explains the arrhythmia.

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,315
The guy was in the burn unit for six
months and had multiple surgeries.

73
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,985
Could be a hospital-acquired
infection. Maybe MRSA.

74
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,945
Works for me.

75
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,912
Draw a blood culture,
start him on antibiotics,

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,908
vancomycin plus broad
gram-negative coverage.

77
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,418
If you called to see the design for my
prison tats, they're still in R and D.

78
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,253
You need to talk to Tritter.

79
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,587
Not according to my lawyer.

80
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,714
Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to get
the DA to drop the case. Tritter can.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,093
Yeah, you know what else
Tritter can do?

82
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,429
You are not impressing anyone!

83
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,680
You may call yourself
principled,

84
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,225
but what you really are
is a stubborn adolescent idiot!

85
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,060
- This isn't his fault!
- I'm not the one who...

86
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,354
You used the
rectal thermometer on him.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,190
You insulted him
instead of apologizing.

88
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,945
You flaunted your drug use in his face
and you refused to accept a deal...

89
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,488
I accepted the deal!

90
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,867
Not until after
you stole a dead guy's pills!

91
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,076
Allegedly.

92
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,871
Tritter has been opening doors
for you every step of the way

93
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,290
and you keep
slamming them shut.

94
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,625
There are no more openings
to give, House.

95
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,504
If you wanna stay out of prison,
you got to make one for yourself.

96
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,805
It's Vicodin.
You function better on it. Talk to him.

97
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,066
MRSA's a bacteria that often infects
hospital patients.

98
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,650
The burns on your chest and arm

99
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,029
exposed raw flesh that made you
a wide-open target.

100
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,239
But the antibiotics
would take care of it, right?

101
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,450
Depends on what strain it is.

102
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,827
We'll know more once we get the results
back from these cultures.

103
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,830
So this MRSA thing,

104
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,335
would it make everything
look blue?

105
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,341
He's seeing blue.

106
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,968
Who'd you get the scrip from?

107
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,721
Cuddy. You wanna know
what I gave her?

108
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,431
MRSA wouldn't change
his ocular palette.

109
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,851
Heavy metal poisoning could cause vision
changes, particularly thallium.

110
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,812
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

111
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,647
So maybe it's menopause.

112
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,941
He's 28 years old.

113
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,277
Yes, his age is the reason
it's weird that a man has menopause.

114
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,364
Male menopause. High estrogen,
low testosterone.

115
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,117
Explains the temperature
swings, disorientation,

116
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,911
endocrinologically similar
to female menopause,

117
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,996
but without the vaginae
and the mahjong tiles.

118
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,207
Male menopause doesn't explain
the blue vision.

119
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:42,378
Blue vision isn't a symptom.
It's a side effect of Viagra.

120
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,504
It's right there on the label,

121
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,507
which I'd had no reason to have read,
except that I'm a doctor.

122
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,759
He's not taking Viagra.

123
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,137
You mean he didn't tell you
he was taking Viagra.

124
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,598
I don't care how sick he is. Trust me,
he still thinks he's got a shot.

125
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,018
Menopause causes temperature swings,
limpness, limpness causes pills,

126
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,186
pills cause the blues.

127
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,397
He's presenting no other signs
of premature aging.

128
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,690
Aging's not the only cause.

129
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,776
You said that he's got
burns on 54% of his body.

130
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,445
Sure it's not 55%?

131
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,865
Burns to his genitals could
cause testicular trauma.

132
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,409
Which could in turn cause...

133
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,911
Run a hormone panel.
When it comes back positive,

134
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,539
pump him full of testosterone
and send him home.

135
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,207
Stop following me!

136
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,005
Thank God my parents are dead.

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,466
If the old man had heard
I had menopause, I'd never live it down.

138
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,385
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

139
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,112
Once these testosterone pellets
dissolve,

140
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,538
your system will be back to normal.

141
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,057
Yeah, but until then
I'm an old lady.

142
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,394
Okay to come in?

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,397
It's not MRSA.
He's not being isolated anymore.

144
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,692
Anyone not in a white coat
is welcome.

145
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,737
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

146
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm good.

147
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:56,035
It turns out I got some hormone thing.
They're fixing it right now.

148
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,872
Are you okay?

149
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,916
Yeah, I think so, I just...

150
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,834
Derek, are you in pain?

151
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,212
- You need to get these out!
- Okay, hold on, what's wrong?

152
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,254
- Get these out!
- What's going on?

153
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,048
Looks like
an allergic reaction.

154
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,258
Hold on! We're going to get
you something to stop it.

155
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,301
- It's okay.
- No, just take them out!

156
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,345
- But you have to calm down. It's okay.
- Get them out!

157
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,804
- Derek!
- Get them out!

158
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,682
Derek, let her go!

159
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,976
Two milligrams
of IV lorazepam, stat!

160
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,646
Get them out!

161
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,578
The complaint department
is across the hall.

162
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,878
I'm busy.

163
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,090
Can I just assume that you told me
how unfair I'm being and...

164
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,341
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,140
You could throw a dart at all the
adjectives

166
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,517
between arrogant and unhinged,

167
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,478
and I'm sure you'd hit one
that describes me.

168
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,399
There's a reason
I operate that way.

169
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,778
I live in pain.

170
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,116
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable.

171
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,703
And on bad ones will suck the life force
right out of you.

172
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,957
It doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

173
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:30,087
Actually, it means I was wrong.

174
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,260
Thank you.

175
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,849
I know that couldn't have
been easy for you to say.

176
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,396
Even if you don't mean
a word of it.

177
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,442
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,445
Look, you can hook me up
to a damn polygraph...

179
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,488
And I'm sure you'd pass.

180
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,577
The thing is I've never been interested
in what you have to say.

181
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,289
All I care about
is what you do.

182
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,876
I'll see you at the hearing.

183
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,675
It wasn't the medicine.

184
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,386
Contamination and allergy tests
both came back negative.

185
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,014
There was nothing to suggest
a pulmonary embolism.

186
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,058
And his EKG
showed the expected tachycardia

187
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,602
from the exertion of the attack.

188
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,814
And I'm fine, by the way,
thanks for asking.

189
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,360
Aggression that comes on that fast
has got to have a neurological basis.

190
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,906
We should do a CT for a frontal lobe
tumor and an LP for meningitis.

191
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,078
Great. Have at it.

192
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:54,421
That's it? No challenging our theory,
no tearing us down?

193
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,383
No need.
You got it under control.

194
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,219
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs this time.

195
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,763
To do what?

196
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,101
Check myself into rehab.

197
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,901
Did Tritter offer you
another deal?

198
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,779
Nope. This is all me.

199
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,909
So, no slaps on the back?
Encouraging words?

200
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,745
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

201
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,373
I hope it's me detoxing,

202
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,000
otherwise I soiled a perfectly
good pair of underwear

203
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,335
last night for nothing.

204
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,671
So this is for real?

205
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,548
It's not just a show
for Tritter?

206
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,592
Absolutely it's a show for Tritter.
And the judge.

207
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,929
And, unfortunately, unless it's real,
there is no show.

208
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,722
Hey, if it doesn't
help my case,

209
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,559
at least I can go to prison
with heightened senses.

210
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,228
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

211
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,439
Time's up. Group's starting.

212
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,402
Gonna need to check that stuff.

213
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,321
When I lead
the big patient rebellion,

214
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,657
Voldemort here
is the first to go.

215
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,826
CT was normal,
no frontal lobe tumor,

216
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,536
LP was negative for meningitis.

217
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,621
We're back to square one.

218
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,499
What about something vascular?
Polyarteritis nodosa?

219
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,085
Brain lesions would have
shown up on the CT.

220
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,171
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

221
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,089
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

222
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,842
We would have seen
respiratory problems.

223
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,678
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

224
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,430
We need to
deal with this ourselves.

225
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,141
He can make the time!
Derek's still his patient.

226
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,987
The man's life as he knows it
could be over.

227
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,812
I think you of all people
would want to cut him some slack.

228
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,608
We're treating a man who runs into
burning buildings for perfect strangers.

229
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,193
He didn't ask for what's
happening to him.

230
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,611
House did
everything to himself.

231
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,029
He's been cut more
than enough slack.

232
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,657
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

233
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,785
It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

234
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,457
I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms
around me and tell me he understood.

235
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,961
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

236
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,588
Well, he may never be ready.

237
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,050
You're doing the only thing
you can do. You're trying.

238
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,219
How about you, Greg?

239
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,945
Have you thought about how to
fix things with people in your life?

240
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,473
No need.

241
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,810
The people in my life
have no expectations of me.

242
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,479
Makes all our lives easier.

243
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,813
Apparently not.

244
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,316
The first step in recovery...

245
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,776
Is admitting I have a problem.

246
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,903
I've obviously done that
or I wouldn't be here.

247
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,907
I've even embraced step two and accepted
that there is a higher power.

248
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,745
Maybe not a god per se, but that
André the Giant guy was powerful.

249
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,123
Where I start to butt up
against it is step three,

250
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,085
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

251
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,464
I'm sure André's ghost
has my back and all, but my free will,

252
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,007
I never leave home without it.

253
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,093
Kind of like your pills.

254
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,305
If you could do this on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

255
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,185
True.

256
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,782
Everybody lies. His tox screen.

257
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,033
It's been clean every time.

258
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,952
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

259
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,538
He's had extensive skin grafts,
which hurt like hell.

260
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,040
Not everybody's House. People can handle
pain without medication.

261
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
But they do have pain.

262
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,753
This guy's worried about losing his job,
so he's hiding the pain.

263
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,923
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out what the problem is.

264
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,383
Or he doesn't feel pain.

265
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,302
Either way, it's something.

266
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,394
- When?
- Two minutes ago.

267
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,396
Pulse is 157, respiration 42.

268
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,023
He was fine.
He was just telling me a joke,

269
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,941
- just a minute ago...
- Get her out of here!

270
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,610
No fluid in his lungs!

271
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,070
O2 stat's 85. He's hypoxic!
We're gonna have to intubate!

272
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,282
It's not his lungs!
He's got marked ST elevation.

273
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,492
He's having a heart attack.

274
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,004
Pick a color.

275
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,965
Medication time.

276
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,722
"You are a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day."

277
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
He's stable.

278
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,613
Won't stay that way.

279
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,658
His blood tests showed
troponins and CK-MB up.

280
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,702
Chase was right.
He was hiding chest pain.

281
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,748
He's been having a whole series
of heart attacks.

282
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,706
Heart attacks can't cause you
to reach out and choke someone.

283
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,000
Lack of oxygen to the brain
causes disorientation.

284
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,794
Increased adrenaline
causes rage.

285
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,172
The more important question is
what caused the attacks?

286
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,012
- Where are you going?
- To see House.

287
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,057
We have a 28-year-old with clean
arteries, no valvular abnormalities

288
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,016
having multiple heart attacks.

289
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,019
I'm not gonna wait for Chase to give us
another breakthrough.

290
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,571
- Maybe we should go.
- We don't have an answer yet.

291
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking!

292
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,536
Whoever came up with buprenorphine
to wean off Vicodin should be shot.

293
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,538
Then stabbed in the eye.

294
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,748
I think someone
needs to adjust my meds!

295
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,917
The heart shows no signs
of inflammation or...

296
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,804
If the cause of the heart attacks
isn't internal, it must be external.

297
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,754
Something environmental.

298
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,424
None of the attacks happened
in the same place.

299
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,883
Still must be something
in common.

300
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,635
First one happened
in an apartment building fire.

301
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,387
Fire, water, smoke,
oxygen masks...

302
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,074
The second and third ones
happened here.

303
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,432
There was no fire,
no water, no smoke.

304
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,767
His clothes were all different,
he'd been cleaned.

305
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,562
That's the "whats".
How about the "whos"?

306
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,568
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but...

307
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,857
Anyone else?

308
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,859
People don't
cause heart attacks.

309
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,778
Well, then you shouldn't
be worried about proving me wrong.

310
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,830
Amy? Would you come with me,
please?

311
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,415
Anything new on my brother?

312
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,001
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

313
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,335
Yeah.

314
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,100
What's this all about?

315
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,603
I don't know.

316
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,689
They wanted to
talk to us together.

317
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,065
Derek!

318
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,907
House was right.

319
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,790
I don't get it.

320
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,250
How can I be causing
his heart attacks?

321
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,296
You may be carrying an agent
that triggered them.

322
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,464
It could be anything, mold spores,
poisonous plant residue,

323
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,508
something you picked up
at a fire site.

324
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,178
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

325
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,058
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

326
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,560
You can't blame yourself
for this.

327
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,479
You know how he got
those skin grafts?

328
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,481
He was trapped in a fire.

329
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,193
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire.

330
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,448
And the ceiling collapsed, and it cut me
off from the rest of the group.

331
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,284
And I kept yelling
that I was fine,

332
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,746
but Derek refused to wait for the team
to clear the debris,

333
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,291
so he took off looking for
another access point.

334
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,045
He got caught in a backdraft.

335
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,717
He almost died
because of me once.

336
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,304
And now it's happening again.

337
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,578
You're not my mom. You don't have to
keep checking up on me.

338
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,540
How you doing?

339
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,208
Not bad,

340
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,086
considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

341
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,172
See this big fancy wing?

342
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,175
It was built because
this program works.

343
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,635
Faulty logic.

344
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,723
This big fancy wing exists because some
people with money think that it works,

345
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,767
wanna believe that
they can buy a better world.

346
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,187
This is nothing short
of idealized despair.

347
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,731
Let other people wallow in it.

348
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,733
I don't even know
what that means.

349
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,818
None of this means anything.

350
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,487
It's just nonsensical slogans
and platitudes.

351
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,907
Meaning takes time,
it takes work.

352
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,033
What do you think
I've been doing?

353
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,578
You've been here for two days!
Talk about wallowing in it!

354
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,372
We all get it.
We know how much pain you have.

355
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,699
You're here to deal with that
and get on with your life!

356
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:56,379
Right! I should have an affair with a
dying patient and move into a hotel.

357
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,217
You're a coward, House.

358
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:06,264
You find fault in everybody because
you're afraid to look at yourself.

359
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,686
Thanks. I was running short
on platitudes. You can leave now.

360
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,241
We tested Amy for
about a dozen different agents,

361
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,782
but they all came back negative.

362
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,451
So she's not causing
the attacks.

363
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,830
Derek, are you
in love with her?

364
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,000
What does that have to do
with anything?

365
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,628
Amy told me how
you got those skin grafts.

366
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,595
And the way you're always
watching out for her,

367
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,799
and I
see the way you look at her.

368
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,682
Have you told her how you feel?

369
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,686
She has a six-year-old
daughter.

370
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,689
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

371
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,442
I know.

372
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,697
Because she did.
With my brother.

373
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,576
They're engaged.

374
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,000
Broken heart syndrome.
He's in love and it's killing him.

375
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,252
I thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

376
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,837
Thanks to his menopause
and estrogen level,

377
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,338
he basically is an old woman.

378
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,633
BHS is an acute physical response
to an emotional experience.

379
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,802
Stress triggers
a flood of catecholamines...

380
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,431
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy, not a heart attack.

381
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,641
But if you're too worried
about losing your job to get it treated,

382
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,185
they can devolve
into full-on heart attacks.

383
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,813
You think it's a coincidence
this started when Amy got engaged?

384
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,648
No, I don't.

385
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,483
But now that you
know the "why",

386
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,985
what are you gonna do
to stop the "how"?

387
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,988
I already put him on beta-blockers
and nitroglycerin. No effect.

388
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,698
We need to put him
on antidepressants.

389
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,033
Not if you're right.

390
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,535
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

391
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,381
which would only speed up
the heart attacks.

392
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,665
We could try propylthiouracil,
slow down his metabolic rate.

393
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,501
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

394
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,670
The only other option
is blood thinners.

395
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,340
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled
arteries and a swollen heart.

396
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,551
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to kill his heart.

397
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,512
So buy him a girlfriend,
make him happy.

398
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,056
That might make you happy.

399
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,099
The only thing that'll
make him happy is Amy.

400
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,768
So keep him away from her.

401
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,414
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks in the room.

402
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
What do you think will happen
to his heart

403
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,564
when we tell him
he can never see her again?

404
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,357
He needs a shrink.

405
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,443
Chase's idea is as good as any.

406
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,363
But short of frying his brain
and wiping Amy out, he's screwed.

407
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,411
We need Cuddy.

408
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,579
Why?

409
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,540
So you can tell her
why you need to fry a guy's brain.

410
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,712
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to shock his brain.

411
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,882
Electroshock therapy is the only way
to erase his memories of Amy

412
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,842
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

413
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,636
This isn't 1940!

414
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,762
The problem can be controlled
with antidepressants.

415
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,764
Cameron?

416
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,210
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

417
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,518
speed up the attacks.

418
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:01,147
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them will solve this problem.

419
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,526
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin Romance in his head.

420
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,362
We're gonna pull out
the 1940 playbook.

421
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,699
Bilateral electrodes,
high-stimulus sine-wave intensity,

422
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,077
turning that dial
all the way to 11.

423
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,284
It's basic brain chemistry.

424
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,092
We interrupt protein synthesis,
altering the neurotransmitter system.

425
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,584
End result, no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

426
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,760
Go ahead.

427
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,473
You heard the lady,
go plug him in.

428
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,399
Am I really that pathetic?

429
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,944
What are you talking about?

430
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,488
If I had pitched
electroshock therapy

431
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,075
as a cure for
broken heart syndrome any other time,

432
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,787
you'd have dug in, made me try a
hundred other useless things first.

433
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,165
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me

434
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,418
or you just feel sorry for me.

435
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,088
You presented
a reasonable argument.

436
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,008
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

437
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,427
Never once
used the word "moron."

438
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,598
The rehab's working, House.

439
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,729
You'll still
be able to perform routine functions

440
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,356
like walking, talking,
tying your shoes.

441
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,318
The treatment targets
the anterior cingulated cortex.

442
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,696
It should only affect
your experiential memories.

443
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,034
So my parents? My childhood?

444
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,204
If this works,
you won't remember them.

445
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,457
Or your firefighting training.

446
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,418
And Amy.

447
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,339
Are you okay with that?

448
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,926
I wouldn't miss her, right?

449
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,429
Tell Amy how you feel.
Because if she loves you...

450
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,726
No. I won't do that to her.
Or to my brother.

451
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:09,108
You're effectively killing who you are
just to keep this secret.

452
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,571
She doesn't love me.

453
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,505
Caterpillar?

454
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,219
Lower intestine
with ulcerative colitis.

455
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,640
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

456
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:45,436
Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until I
promised I'd come and see for myself.

457
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,442
I got to admit,
this move I did not expect.

458
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:55,989
Well, don't tell anyone, but the photos
of smiling people in the brochures,

459
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,740
it's just marketing.

460
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,119
Well, you're obviously
making an effort.

461
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:06,207
So I suppose the next step is
for me to talk to the DA.

462
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,753
Which you have
no intention of doing.

463
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,298
No.

464
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,803
So words mean nothing, actions mean
nothing, what the hell is left?

465
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,103
You son of a bitch!

466
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,399
What about your words,
your actions?

467
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:36,696
"Got to get House cleaned up.
Got to get him to show some humility."

468
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,823
But when it comes to actually
doing something,

469
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,576
you prove that all you care about
is bitch-slapping a guy

470
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,619
who refused to kiss your ass!

471
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,707
You ever trust an addict?

472
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,794
You ever give one
the benefit of the doubt?

473
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,754
How many times
did that work out for you...

474
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,838
Yeah, I get it.

475
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:58,176
And so you were screwed over by your
wife, your mother, your partner.

476
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,428
But you keep sending them
Christmas cards

477
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,721
while you
take it out on everyone else!

478
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,765
No more Christmas cards.

479
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,476
No, I learned.

480
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:11,481
People like you,
even your actions lie.

481
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,203
I'm scared.

482
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,579
I know.

483
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,667
I'm gonna give you a muscle relaxant
so your body doesn't convulse.

484
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,586
Count backwards from 10.

485
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:41,719
Ten, nine, eight,

486
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,306
seven...

487
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,279
Go.

488
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,462
What's your name?

489
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,547
Derek.

490
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,676
Heart sounds good.

491
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,052
Do you know what city we're in?

492
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,266
No.

493
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,352
Would you be okay with
a couple of visitors?

494
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,378
Derek, it's me. Brock.

495
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,137
I'm your brother, and when you get out
of here, you'll be staying with me.

496
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,853
I'm Amy.

497
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,317
I'm your friend.

498
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:26,824
I'm sorry,
but I don't remember either of you.

499
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,129
We've given him
four rounds of electroshock.

500
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:44,967
The charge made his voice a little
higher, but the EKG and BP are good.

501
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Good.

502
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,346
We're gonna give him
his last round in the morning,

503
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,265
then be in court
for your hearing.

504
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,600
Thanks.

505
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm gonna stay here.
Monitor Derek.

506
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,110
Thanks for the update.

507
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,826
My next condolence call is arriving.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

508
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,421
I got you something.

509
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,092
Nice.

510
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,682
I figured it might help make
a good impression on the judge.

511
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,475
It's not that nice.

512
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,648
I had no business blaming you
for any of this.

513
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,654
I know you were just
trying to help me. Protect me.

514
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,699
That's what friends do.

515
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,329
Is this an apology?

516
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,956
Part of the program.

517
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,167
- If you don't like it, I can stop.
- Not at all.

518
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:01,836
It's just so

519
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,839
unfamiliar.

520
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,384
Please, keep going.

521
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,194
He looks lost.

522
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,030
It's gonna take him a while.

523
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,743
Brock's pulling a double shift.

524
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,580
He can't stand to
see him this way.

525
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,792
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

526
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,212
I know the timing isn't great
with a wedding coming up.

527
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,131
What wedding?

528
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,508
Yours. You and Brock.

529
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,554
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

530
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,849
Why would you think
we're getting married?

531
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,937
When you first offered Dr. House
the chance to check into drug rehab,

532
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,314
how did he respond?

533
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,816
He told me to
get out of his office.

534
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:10,780
I warned him that he could end up in
prison and lose his medical license.

535
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,116
If he was concerned,
he didn't show it.

536
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,202
So you continued
your investigation?

537
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,161
Yes.

538
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,288
Which is what led me
to the hospital pharmacy.

539
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,583
- Turn it off.
- What did you tell the pharmacist

540
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,794
was the reason for your visit?

541
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,213
I thought I told you never to call me
when I'm on trial.

542
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,132
The memories were false.
We fried his brain for nothing.

543
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,926
Whatever was killing him
before is still there.

544
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,052
We did an MRI.

545
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,471
There's slight hypo-perfusion
in the anterior cortex.

546
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,932
What did you find when you checked
the pharmacy log?

547
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,809
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

548
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,811
Thanks, Your Honor.
It's hard to hear.

549
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,230
Did you test for clotting time
and IV function?

550
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,148
I believe that this is
a medical emergency, Your Honor.

551
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,776
His blood's normal and his
heart's pumping it up to the brain.

552
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,361
But it's not all getting there.

553
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,654
Something's obstructing
the blood flow...

554
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,489
Dr. House, you were given
adequate notice

555
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,241
to make arrangements
for your patients.

556
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,285
There's no hyper intensity to suggest
a foreign body near the region.

557
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,287
And no signs of infection
or vascular malformations.

558
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,580
It's lower down.

559
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,957
Dr. House, hang up!

560
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,924
The cytology on the LP
doesn't suggest a tumor.

561
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,043
Now!

562
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,922
Hang on a second.

563
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,260
Does your voice always get that high
and annoying when you're angry?

564
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,137
Do you want to go to jail?

565
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,346
No, thank you.

566
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,143
Set him up for a selective vertebral
angiography. I'm on my way.

567
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,061
Dr. House.

568
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,355
House! Sit down!

569
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,232
Why? I'm bored.

570
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,568
There's nothing I can say or do
that's gonna make a difference here.

571
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:34,071
If you leave this room,
I will find you in contempt.

572
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,906
Get a recess.

573
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,242
Are you out of your mind?

574
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,162
They said they wanted me there,
but I don't think they like me.

575
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,247
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

576
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,958
It's another symptom
of menopause.

577
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,627
His system keeps getting hit
by women's issues,

578
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,463
so let's follow the pattern.

579
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,466
What might obstruct the blood flow
that's more common in women than men?

580
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,425
Is the catheter in?

581
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,384
Go back to court.

582
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,750
We'll let you know the results.

583
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,554
Shut up and wire him.

584
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,476
Center the image on the interpeduncular
cistern.

585
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,478
Keep it moving at
30 frames per second.

586
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,272
If you think the arteries are narrowing,
you're gonna need still shots,

587
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,774
which we can do without you.

588
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,568
The problem is not
how wide the road is.

589
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,238
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars.

590
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,725
That's what's causing
the slowdown.

591
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,409
We find him,
we find the problem.

592
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,286
- He's wired.
- Go!

593
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,246
Injecting the dye.

594
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,541
Blood's in the capillaries.

595
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,251
There.

596
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,296
Mr. Squeegee.

597
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,550
Spinal meningioma pushing on the nerves
to the vocal cords

598
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,219
creates the voice change.

599
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,388
And that nerve just happens to live
right near the meningeal branch

600
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:45,726
of the vertebral artery, obstructs
the blood flow to the brain.

601
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,604
The brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

602
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,733
Memories cause love.
Love kills.

603
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,987
And we didn't completely
screw up.

604
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,907
Cleaning the slate bought us time
to find the real problem.

605
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,742
On the other hand,
if we had been better,

606
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,619
we wouldn't have
needed the time.

607
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,830
Schedule him for surgery.
Dig that thing out.

608
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,291
He can start enjoying real misery
instead of the fake stuff.

609
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,044
House.

610
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,007
I just heard that you
apologized to Wilson.

611
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,885
Detoxing. I didn't know
what I was saying.

612
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,020
Excuse me.

613
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,150
I have to go to jail.

614
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,408
What is your position
at Princeton-Plainsboro?

615
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,493
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

616
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,699
And you're responsible
for oversight of the pharmacy?

617
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,997
Yes.

618
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,375
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

619
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,336
I hope you don't mind
that we continued on without you?

620
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,756
I said I was sorry.
There's no need to be sarcastic.

621
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,843
What is this?

622
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:05,222
That's our prescription sign-out log
from December 24th.

623
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,725
Does that appear to be
Dr. House's signature?

624
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,934
Yes.

625
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,185
What has he signed for?

626
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:14,648
A prescription for oxycodone
in the name of patient Larry Zebalusky.

627
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,494
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

628
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,735
- No.
- Why?

629
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,194
He was already dead.

630
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,946
And Dr. House knew this?

631
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,072
Yes.

632
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:27,995
So, Dr. House had no legal or medical
basis for acquiring that oxycodone?

633
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,208
Dr. Cuddy?

634
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,632
He never got the pills.

635
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,553
It's his signature.
The log is strictly controlled.

636
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,598
Dr. House did pick up a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

637
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,559
It says oxycodone.
You testified...

638
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,187
I know,
but it wasn't oxycodone.

639
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,441
Dr. Wilson informed me that Dr. House
already tried to steal

640
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,903
the pain medication of this patient,
which made clear to me

641
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,199
that Dr. House was in a particularly
vulnerable and desperate state.

642
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,035
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

643
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,746
Dr. House only got
a bottle with placebos.

644
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,499
I understand your impulse
to protect a valued colleague...

645
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,250
I have it right here
on the inventory report...

646
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,128
Your Honor, she's lying!
She's obviously forged that report.

647
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,588
In light of this evidence...

648
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,839
If this is real,
why didn't she mention it earlier?

649
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,300
I move to dismiss this case!

650
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,843
There is other evidence,
Your Honor!

651
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,304
Everyone shut up and sit down.

652
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,517
Dr. Cuddy, why are you
only now coming forward with this?

653
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,730
I guess I never expected it
to go this far.

654
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,320
The witness is excused.

655
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,086
Your Honor,
you can't seriously believe...

656
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,366
Dr. House, please stand.

657
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,955
My suspicion is your boss...

658
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,045
My suspicion is you have better friends
than you deserve.

659
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,257
Rules and laws
apply to everyone.

660
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,385
You are not as special
as you think.

661
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,179
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

662
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:13,517
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

663
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,060
but I am sure that this man

664
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,312
is not flooding the streets
with cocaine.

665
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,524
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

666
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,776
he must have done something
to set you off.

667
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,738
But you're gonna have to
live with it.

668
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,115
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony,

669
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,743
I'm not going to allow this
to proceed to jury.

670
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,204
Case dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

671
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,667
Dr. House,

672
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,254
you're still guilty of contempt
for that little walkout earlier.

673
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,589
You'll be spending
the night in jail,

674
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,175
and after that you're going right back
to your rehab.

675
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,970
Bailiff, take Dr. House
into custody.

676
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,187
Dr. House.

677
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,281
So should I be looking for you
in the shadows,

678
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,159
or flinch every time
a car backfires?

679
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,912
Good luck.

680
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,458
I hope I'm wrong about you.

681
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,515
They got the meningioma.

682
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,393
Your brain should start generating
real memories again.

683
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,562
What do I do when I get out?

684
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,525
You have people who love you.
They'll take care of you.

685
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,862
You start over.

686
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,289
I'm surprised to see you're not
spooning your way through the walls.

687
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:06,547
So, what do you say? How about
a conjugal visit to celebrate?

688
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,801
There's nothing to celebrate,
House! You made me perjure myself.

689
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,387
Fabricate evidence.

690
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,266
You make everyone around you
worse for being there.

691
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,772
The only bright spot is that
now I own your ass.

692
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,315
When you get out of rehab,

693
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,818
you're gonna be
pulling double clinic duty,

694
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,780
giving lectures to students,
helping me find donors,

695
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,617
pretty much anything else
I ask. You got it?

696
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,592
Your buprenorphine.

697
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,096
You get these from
the pharmacy or from Voldemort?

698
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,141
Voldemort. Why?
What difference does it...

699
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,191
That's Vicodin.
He's been slipping you Vicodin?

700
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:12,070
No! He'd be risking his
minimum-wage job to do that.

701
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,245
The whole time?

702
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,165
My higher power said
it was okay.

703
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,000
Nothing's changed?

704
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,877
Nothing's changed.

705
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,308
The apology.

706
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,603
You didn't need to do that
to make this work.

707
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,605
Believe what you want.

708
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,859
Good night, House.

709
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,154
I'll see you tomorrow.

710
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,697
Good night, Wilson.
