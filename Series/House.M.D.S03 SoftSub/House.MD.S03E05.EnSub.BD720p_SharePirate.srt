1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,087
Here you go.

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,803
That fried crap
will kill you. See?

3
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,059
Good night.

4
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,062
Time to make the donuts.

5
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,452
- Hands in the air! Right now!
- Get them up!

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,903
Move out here. Get up!
Move out here! Let's go!

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,196
- Move it.
- Put them up!

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,198
Purses and wallets
on the counter, right now.

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,243
Yo! Your watches, your jewelry!
Take it all off!

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,623
- Yeah, all right.
- Keep the girl. Keep the girl.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:41,999
Yeah.

12
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,710
We're moving to
the back room. Let's go!

13
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,670
- Go! Let's go!
- Move it!

14
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,797
Go on! Not you.

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,132
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

16
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,883
She's staying right here.

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,843
You're not going to do this.

18
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,511
Whoa, whoa, kid.

19
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,809
No, Jeremy. Please, just do
what they say. Please!

20
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,103
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Move!

21
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,948
Son of a bitch!

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,410
You thought I was
going to let you hurt my wife?

23
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,037
Hey! Hey, sir. Your wife!

24
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,749
What did he do to her?

25
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,916
Nothing.

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,008
Tracy!

27
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,005
Twenty-year-old married
African-American female.

28
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,466
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.

29
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,218
- Children?
- You think pregnancy would explain...

30
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,385
Explains the marriage.

31
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,887
Who the hell
gets married at 20?

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,347
I'm guessing, people in love?

33
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,516
Show me a 20-year-old
who's not in love.

34
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,522
You get married at 20,

35
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,727
you're going to be shocked
at who you're living with at 30.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,771
It's not allergies.
Negative on the skin test.

37
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,898
Four days of antihistamines
and steroids.

38
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,316
- Who's he talking to?
- What?

39
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,528
It's got an ass.
Technically, that makes it a "who."

40
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,198
New nurse in pedes.
Wendy something.

41
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,866
Swelling just started
to go down...

42
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,243
You seen her here before?

43
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,539
A couple times. I tried following
her home, but she gave me the slip.

44
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,415
Swelling's...

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,672
You think that's funny?

46
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,842
Ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

47
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,469
Are you serious?

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,472
There was a point to it.
Wendy, this is House.

49
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,977
Something about not getting too uppity
with normal folks who walk good.

50
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,565
You're everything I'd heard.
Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,696
Why so rude?

52
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,407
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

53
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,702
into an affair with a dying patient.
Now a naughty nurse?

54
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,454
How many more failed relationships are
we both gonna have to deal with

55
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,206
before you learn to
love yourself?

56
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,693
And I mean that
in the literal way.

57
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,877
It's amazing how you can not only know
it's a relationship,

58
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:36,132
but that it's a bad relationship,
based on nothing but nothing.

59
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,592
I know you.

60
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm not with her,
not even trying.

61
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,973
You're lying to me.
That's interesting.

62
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,392
Well, as long as
it's interesting.

63
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,565
- Swelling is...
- Why is she hanging out here?

64
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,233
Anyone interested in what happened
with the swelling?

65
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,319
She's in pedes.
That's the next wing over.

66
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,446
If you're wondering
if Wilson's dating her, ask Wilson.

67
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,490
Clearly he did, and Wilson denied it.
And House doesn't believe it.

68
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,827
That's gotta hurt. That's why it pays
to have more than one friend, House.

69
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,871
If he's not hitting that,
why is she here?

70
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,124
Because I'm hitting that
and it's totally hot.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,001
Swelling took four days
to resolve.

72
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,086
Patient has unexplained
intense abdominal pains.

73
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,880
So explain them.

74
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,132
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

75
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,967
Anybody know her?
Know her story?

76
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,594
Up and at 'em.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,845
They did a laparotomy.

78
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,723
Liver, bowel, gall bladder,
appendix, all clean.

79
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,600
Belly pain plus
throat swelling.

80
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,354
She was in some sort of assault, right?
Simple neck trauma.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,981
It says no one touched her neck, and if
they did, it would resolve by now.

82
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,900
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed on her, right?

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,902
He's in jail and
he's completely healthy,

84
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,238
except for the broken head
he got from the beating he took.

85
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,532
There's pot on her tox screen.

86
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,243
Salmonella from the pot
would explain the stomach pains.

87
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,037
It's a stretch.
She'd have a fever.

88
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,748
She's on steroids for the swelling,
therefore no fever.

89
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,291
And the smoking
explains the throat.

90
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,293
Sorry, take it back.
That's a stretch.

91
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,128
Got a better idea?

92
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,965
Then stretch away.

93
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,176
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

94
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,479
I was waiting
two hours out there.

95
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,022
Fascinating.

96
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,067
Have you considered a career
as a memoirist?

97
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,360
Let's see it.

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,738
You don't introduce yourself?

99
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,323
Sorry, I thought
you were waiting two hours.

100
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,992
Didn't know you wanted to chat.

101
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,953
Hi, I'm Greg.
How about that local sports team?

102
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,166
It's not an infection.

103
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,126
How can you tell without...

104
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,419
You want me to touch you?

105
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,587
It's your private place.

106
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,923
You're chewing nicotine gum,
which causes dehydration,

107
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,758
which causes wear and tear.

108
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,886
Try a lubricant,
or foreplay if you're cheap.

109
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,180
Just take a swab
and get it tested, okay?

110
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:53,269
Sorry, I already met this month's quota
of useless tests for stubborn idiots.

111
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,898
You're rude.

112
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,318
Wow. You're like a
detective or something.

113
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,530
And you're smart
and you're funny.

114
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,325
But you are bitter
and you're lonely,

115
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,080
so you treat everyone around
like they're idiots,

116
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,209
and you get away with it
'cause of your cane.

117
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,839
Please stop. It's hard to
write through the haze of bitter tears.

118
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,175
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

119
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:29,221
Last nurse you made fun of, she probably
slipped some crap into your coffee.

120
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,725
Yeah, I asked for
decrapinated coffee.

121
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,818
Treat people like jerks,
you get treated like a jerk.

122
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,383
Thank you.

123
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,677
Bend over.

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,515
- You kidding me?
- If you have an infection,

125
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,058
you'd have a fever.

126
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,601
But you're chewing
nicotine gum,

127
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,103
which messes with the weather
in your mouth,

128
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,772
so I need to
vacation elsewhere.

129
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,411
And wait till I put
the thermometer in.

130
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,873
You break it, you bought it.

131
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,798
Leaving early today.

132
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,804
Do you ever get that thing
where you're sure you forgot something,

133
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,306
but you can't figure out what?

134
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,643
Guess it can't be
that important.

135
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,772
Salmonella is a bacterial infection
that you can get from pot plants.

136
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,149
It causes stomach pain.

137
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,108
And my throat?

138
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,153
The thinking is it's
an inflammatory reaction to the smoking.

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,738
How much would you need to smoke
for your throat to go nuts like that?

140
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,240
Most cases, a lot.

141
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,658
We don't smoke a lot.

142
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,410
Let's just start the treatment.

143
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,328
You think we're liars,
as well as druggies?

144
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,789
Actually, I'm wondering if you'd mind
getting her a cup of ice chips.

145
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,749
You're not gonna get
any different answer from her.

146
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,127
No, no. He can stay.

147
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,297
No offense, but this place is scary.
I feel better when he's around.

148
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,583
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

149
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,466
We don't do a lot of drugs.

150
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,052
I need to know
your answers aren't being pressured.

151
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,182
Look, if you think the antibiotics are a
good idea, you can give them to me.

152
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:40,811
Okay. Worst-case scenario,
it'll help us rule out a few things.

153
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,688
He's a good guy.

154
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,899
He just has a hard time
holding in his emotions.

155
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,567
You don't have to
apologize for me.

156
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,453
That mean you're
going to do it for yourself?

157
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,487
I got nothing to apologize for.

158
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,572
He's young.

159
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,200
Itchy.

160
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,996
Allergic reaction
to the fluoroquinolone.

161
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,802
We should switch to
a different antibiotic.

162
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,707
Why?

163
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,459
We can't treat the salmonella unless...

164
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,836
Salmonella? That was a total stretch.

165
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,755
Oh, man, why does that
sound so familiar?

166
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,298
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

167
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,384
Then it was a dumb thing
to say. Now it's smart.

168
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,791
She's got the rash, so we know
she's unusually susceptible

169
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,389
to allergic reactions,
so that's what brought her in.

170
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,016
Probably the peanut butter
in her sandwich.

171
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,542
Stick test was negative
for peanuts.

172
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,187
That's because you foolishly tested her
while she was lying down.

173
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,398
- Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
- I think that requires exercise.

174
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,150
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

175
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,397
Not even competitive eating.

176
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,863
And getting robbed.
That always gets my heart rate up.

177
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,448
Give her the same food
she ate at the diner

178
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,407
and stick her on the treadmill.

179
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,953
Better yet, put a gun to her head,
threaten to rape her.

180
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,579
You don't think
I'm going to get a response?

181
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,164
No.

182
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,749
You're on. Fifty bucks.

183
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,167
I'm not betting
on a patient's...

184
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,003
A hundred bucks. If you say so.

185
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,389
Tracy, I'm increasing
the speed a little.

186
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,683
My stomach really hurts.

187
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,312
Jeremy, you out there?
Talk to... Talk...

188
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,856
You're doing great.
Isn't this enough?

189
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,942
We're not getting
any allergic response yet.

190
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,402
Shut it off.

191
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,609
We don't complete the test,

192
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,862
my boss will just come down here
and do it himself.

193
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,364
You do not want that.

194
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,408
She's in pain. Look at her.

195
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,909
I don't want to have to
ask you to leave.

196
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,370
You're gonna ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me? This is my wife!

197
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,539
You guys aren't helping her.
You're just hurting her. What?

198
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,386
You guys have all this equipment here,
and you're not doing anything!

199
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,979
You guys can't even
figure out what's...

200
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,879
God, it hurts.

201
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,841
- Where?
- In my stomach. And my chest.

202
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,762
- Oh, God!
- It's Foreman. Get me a wheelchair.

203
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,269
He's as sick as she is now.

204
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,562
I told you it wouldn't work.

205
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,063
It worked on the wrong patient.

206
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,899
We could spend all day
arguing right or wrong.

207
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,026
Give me the 100 bucks.

208
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,402
We didn't bet.

209
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,238
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

210
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,407
Give me the 100 bucks.

211
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:03,454
Come on, Foreman, pay up. He won.
Or we could just never finish the DDX.

212
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,835
Husband's test showed no MI, no
aortic dissection. It's not his heart.

213
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,463
It's just nonspecific
chest and abdominal pain.

214
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,051
So, psychosomatic?
Panic attack?

215
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,429
Pain persisted after
he got lorazepam and morphine.

216
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,306
Whose locker is that?

217
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,640
Mine.

218
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,518
Chest, stomach, throat.

219
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,396
- What does it all mean?
- We're in the nurses' locker room.

220
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,023
I know that.

221
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,694
Oh, that is so annoying.

222
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,947
Wilson's girlfriend's
left her stuff in my locker again.

223
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,867
Great. I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

224
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,673
Relax. You know who
they're going to blame.

225
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,121
House, you want to mess
with Wilson, no problem.

226
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
But you got no reason
to screw around with...

227
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,874
Can we get back to the medicine?

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,917
Okay.

229
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,753
Why assume one disease?
His chest, her throat.

230
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,131
So it's just a coincidence that they've
both got crippling stomach pains?

231
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,468
Wow, they really are a great couple.
So much in common.

232
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,055
One blue shoe.
What do you think that means?

233
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,183
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

234
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,309
You feeling luckier?

235
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,769
It doesn't matter
what I answer.

236
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,145
Two hundred it is.

237
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,982
If they're married and caught
the same disease, then it means they...

238
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,695
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

239
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,032
Wilson likes jazz.
Foreman, pay the man.

240
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,578
Four, five, six novels, no music.
What does that mean?

241
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,746
She's literate.

242
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,499
It means she spends
her leisure time reading, not listening.

243
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,877
She'd only want to go and watch jazz
if the other person wanted to go.

244
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,172
She has a martyr complex,
issues of inferiority.

245
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,882
Married couple, same disease.

246
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,427
They either got it from each other
or in the same place.

247
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,679
Infectious or environmental?

248
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,516
What we have to do is check out
parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi,

249
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:52,104
prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals.
Or it's Internet porn-related.

250
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,649
I'll check the Internet.
You guys cover the rest of the stuff.

251
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,574
If they can live here without killing
each other, they must really be in love.

252
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,159
It's tiny.

253
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,078
How come it's taking you
so long to search it?

254
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,249
Box of condoms in his jacket.

255
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,976
I know you're poor now,
but buy your own.

256
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,919
She's on the pill.

257
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,172
Why would he need condoms?

258
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,757
No, no, no. Put that back.

259
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:21,842
Why?

260
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,568
We show that to House, he'll just
call the guy a cheating bastard.

261
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,804
Look how he is with Wilson.

262
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,015
He'd be right. Could be an STD.

263
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,643
One that doesn't give them
any symptoms in their sexual organs?

264
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,313
- They never mentioned anything.
- Maybe they're embarrassed.

265
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,439
What else could it be?

266
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,484
You think they just like the sexy feel
of latex against their genitals?

267
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,945
Maybe the wife
just wants to be extra-cautious.

268
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,780
- Come on. You really believe that?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,784
Good. Then I'm sure
you'll have no problem convincing House.

270
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,164
That cheating bastard!

271
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,624
He loves her.

272
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,960
Right, I bet he told you
that she's the love of his life.

273
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,754
People lie. I get it.

274
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,466
But they don't go up against two armed
gunmen to save someone unless they...

275
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:07,804
There's a reason that we don't let kids
vote or drink or work in salt mines.

276
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,598
They're idiots.

277
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,767
Twenty-year-olds
fall in and out of love more often

278
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,102
than they change their oil filters,

279
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,469
which they should do
more often.

280
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,648
Sorry. Ridiculous of me
to draw a conclusion

281
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,816
based on actually
observing them.

282
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,444
I should have just depended on
your misanthropic view of human nature.

283
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,530
Gonorrhea explains
all their symptoms.

284
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,740
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome
for her belly pain,

285
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,868
costochondritis and bladder infection
for his chest and abdominal pain.

286
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:30,869
Good.

287
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,415
Now go rub their lying,
cheating privates with a cotton swab.

288
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,047
Why would you want to
look at our...

289
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,925
Is this because of the condoms?

290
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,470
You found them in his jacket,
figured he was hiding something from me.

291
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,390
I thought I was pregnant last month.
It kind of freaked me out.

292
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,767
I'm way too young to have kids.

293
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,019
So you just wanted
to be extra-cautious?

294
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,481
Wish one of us had figured that out,
stuck to his guns.

295
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,732
We've still gotta
check you both.

296
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,734
She's the only girlfriend
I've ever had.

297
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,319
- She's the love of...
- Please don't say it.

298
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,696
I can't say I love my wife?

299
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,863
We're still going to test you.

300
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,323
What is it? I'm white?

301
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,866
Yeah, that's it.

302
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,786
Jer, I wish you would stop it.
You're really embarrassing.

303
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,664
Everybody thinks they're so liberal,
but I see how they look at us.

304
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,250
White and black,
especially black.

305
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm sorry, Trace,
but it's true.

306
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,171
Great. Prove us all wrong.

307
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,592
Stupid...

308
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,845
No scarring, no purulent discharge,
and the NAATs were negative.

309
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,972
- They don't have an STD.
- What's that you say?

310
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,308
You've got a problem
with interracial couples?

311
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,809
Thank you, Chase. No!

312
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,686
Have any of your shorties
ever been whities?

313
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,856
I'm not sure I understand
your ghetto slang, Dr. House.

314
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,862
How many black women
have you dated, by the way?

315
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:47,112
I don't care about color, as long as
they can help me breed a superior race.

316
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,657
Yeah, my exes have usually
been black. So what?

317
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,869
It's not a racial thing. It's cultural.
I have more in common with them.

318
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,581
Like I assume you only date
emotionally stunted bigots.

319
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,002
Sorry, you're right.
That kind of prejudice is totally fine.

320
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,464
The abdominal pain's getting worse.
We've had to up their morphine twice.

321
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,830
Take the wife off the steroids.

322
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,550
She spikes a fever,
we'll know it's an infection.

323
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
She doesn't,
it's environmental.

324
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,188
He got off easy.
I almost gave him a colonoscopy.

325
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,732
That was one of the stupidest things
you have ever done,

326
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,151
and there is heavy
competition for...

327
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,694
What are you doing?

328
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,946
You only ate
half your breakfast.

329
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,907
Feeling a little sick
this morning?

330
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,076
I'm not pregnant.
They burnt my omelet.

331
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,577
You need to apologize
to this guy.

332
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,162
I am a man of principle.

333
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,165
I don't care how much time and money
it costs you to defend me.

334
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,333
He wants to kill you.

335
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,878
No empty coffee cups.
Off the caffeine. Good for baby.

336
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,131
Cups are in the other wastebasket.
Baby's in your mind.

337
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,592
You can berate patients
all you want.

338
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,096
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

339
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,056
Pay attention to me.

340
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,267
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

341
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,604
Can't ignore that rapidly
expanding first-trimester ass, though.

342
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,273
Sometimes an ass
is just an ass.

343
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,946
You are not always right, House.
Apologize to the guy.

344
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,921
- What are you doing here?
- Stay away from my son.

345
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,006
How did you find us?

346
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,884
Stay away from that girl.

347
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,268
Please! Please! Please!
You leave him alone!

348
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,353
- What happened?
- She's dreaming. She started yelling.

349
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,064
- You're breaking Jeremy's arm. Please!
- No one's hurting him.

350
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,484
Baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.
Tracy, Tracy.

351
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:55,365
She's okay. Baby, it was just
a bad dream. Everything's okay.

352
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,744
Tracy. Tracy?

353
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,547
It was an acute delirium.

354
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,842
Well, she's talking, right?
I mean, she's coming out of it.

355
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,887
No, she's not really talking,
just making sounds.

356
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,513
Okay. When's she
gonna come out?

357
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,142
Jeremy, she's in a coma.

358
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,943
So her vitals
are pretty stable,

359
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,821
but her response to stimuli
is getting weaker,

360
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,656
which means the coma's
getting worse.

361
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,201
Her brain is slowly
shutting down.

362
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,911
Can I see her?

363
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,247
We're getting some more images
to check for masses or infections.

364
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,293
I'll increase your morphine.

365
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,587
Her hallucination.

366
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,675
If you knew what it was,
would that make any difference?

367
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,136
Medically, I mean.

368
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,721
Not usually.

369
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,349
Some cases, the form of
a hallucination can tell us

370
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,060
what part of the brain
is being hit.

371
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,062
I think it was about my dad.

372
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,981
Your dad was breaking your arm?

373
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,821
He was a drunk,
pill-popping racist.

374
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,783
He caught me sneaking
into her house when we were 13.

375
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,952
She lived next door.

376
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,206
He broke my arm
and threatened her.

377
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,376
We ran off when we were 16.

378
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,254
You still in touch with him?

379
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,507
He killed himself
a couple years ago.

380
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,181
Oh, it's not medical. I just thought
blacks were the racist ones.

381
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,315
Some generalized
edema throughout,

382
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,027
and areas of increased signal
here, here, here and here.

383
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,446
Damn, all over her brain stem.

384
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,408
Could be plaques,
maybe hyperdensities from the edema.

385
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,118
Or tumors or anything.

386
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,955
We add brain involvement to the chest,
stomach, throat, what do we got?

387
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,040
Didn't spike a fever
when we took her off the steroids,

388
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,042
- so it's not an infection.
- Leaving environmental.

389
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,085
What flavor?

390
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,461
Environmental doesn't make sense,
either.

391
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,297
If it was a toxin,
we'd see it in their livers.

392
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,183
None of the neighbors
are sick, no coworkers.

393
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,341
They both got it.

394
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,347
That means infection or environmental,
and since it's not an infection...

395
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,722
What if they
didn't both get it?

396
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,850
Maybe we got our basic assumption
wrong and it's two different diseases.

397
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,270
Maybe we didn't and
it's sarcoidosis.

398
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,898
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious
or environmental.

399
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,817
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

400
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,987
Firefighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

401
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,115
I did see these two putting out
that blaze in the Pine Barrens.

402
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,076
If sarcoidosis has
two environmental causes,

403
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,912
it has environmental causes.

404
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,582
We just don't know all
of them yet. Husband's chest.

405
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,711
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

406
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,923
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms,

407
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,008
including her getting worse
off the steroids.

408
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,885
Doesn't explain
his throat swelling.

409
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,092
That's what "almost" means.

410
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,680
90% of sarcoidosis cases
have lung scarring.

411
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,933
- Oh, 90?
- Oh, "almost"?

412
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,977
Fine.

413
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,356
Consult a specialist.

414
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,493
If this is more
dating advice...

415
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,995
Love to gossip,
but I got work to do.

416
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,957
Is this sarcoidosis?

417
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,628
It's pretty nonspecific.

418
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:41,007
It could be granulomas,
could be plaques. What's this?

419
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,928
Oh! Oh! You stole
Wendy's personnel file?

420
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,723
In a way, aren't we all guilty
of bribing the janitor

421
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,725
to take her file and
give it to me?

422
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,103
Yes, I take my share
of the blame, but society's...

423
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,813
First of all,
I'm not dating her.

424
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,232
She is so wrong for you.

425
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:01,361
You know she filed a form so the
hospital would take extra withholding?

426
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,822
- Who does that?
- She's much too cautious for me.

427
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,282
Point taken.
I'll start dating her

428
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,160
so I can break up with her
and start dating a stripper.

429
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,330
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

430
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,417
I didn't try to break up your marriages.
You did that yourself.

431
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,878
My marriages were so crappy,
I was spending all my time with you.

432
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,089
Your real fear is me having
a good relationship.

433
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,341
Yes, it keeps me up at night.

434
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,261
That and the Loch Ness monster,
global warming, evolution

435
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,555
and other fictional concepts.

436
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:33,101
Although, big romantic weekend
in the Poconos could change everything.

437
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,148
You don't... No.

438
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,485
I don't think it's sarcoidosis.

439
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,950
He says it's sarcoidosis.

440
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,702
Start them both
on methotrexate.

441
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:51,703
And if you're wrong?

442
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:56,458
If Wilson's wrong,
we'll biopsy her just to be sure.

443
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,001
Her brain stem?

444
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,253
Brain damage is
not only possible, it's likely.

445
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,799
Good point. Let's biopsy
something safer, like her shoes.

446
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,847
The husband. He'd have to give consent.
He can't right now.

447
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,849
Why? Does this guy write
with his stomach?

448
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,642
He has a conflict of interest.

449
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,649
It's not his brain we're cutting open,
but he still gets all the benefit.

450
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,272
He'd do it
just to save himself.

451
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,440
Or save her.

452
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,006
She's the love of his life,
remember?

453
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,234
He never said that.

454
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,488
She needs a guardian ad litem.
I can't let you do this.

455
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,199
Well, how are you going
to stop me? Call Cuddy?

456
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,575
Cameron's right.
There's a conflict.

457
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,118
No, there isn't.

458
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,913
Not unless one of them
wants to die a horrible, painful death.

459
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,414
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

460
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,208
In a couple days.

461
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,002
Will the guardian convince the disease
to hold off eating her brain

462
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,379
until we can get
the legalities worked out?

463
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,257
I just don't want some
plaintiff's lawyer owning my hospital.

464
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,093
Legalities help.

465
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,460
Speaking of which,
did you get your thermometer back yet?

466
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,932
We had a nice chat.
Did you know he's a Rotarian?

467
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,268
Listen, she'll die
without the biopsy.

468
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,981
I need to cover the hospital's ass.
You're too biased.

469
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,776
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

470
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,695
Something goes wrong, he'll sue us for
not disclosing the risks.

471
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,531
Then have Wilson
talk to the husband.

472
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:13,076
Wilson kills people left and right.
No one ever sues him.

473
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,496
Fine, but only if you apologize
to the clinic guy.

474
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,040
No. Probably better
to just let that couple die.

475
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,001
I don't care if you mean it.
Just do it.

476
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,091
Unfortunately, we don't see
any way around a biopsy.

477
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,844
We'll do all we can
to minimize any damage.

478
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,011
No.

479
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,722
The methotrexate isn't showing
any effects yet.

480
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,723
You could both be...

481
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,684
She's brilliant.

482
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,187
All A's in college
while working full-time.

483
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,730
I can't do that to her.

484
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,859
And if you both die,
you think she'd want that?

485
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,196
Do it on me instead.

486
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,574
- It's not in your brain.
- It will be.

487
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,577
It's the same disease, right?
Do it then.

488
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,872
She could die
before you show the symptoms.

489
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,957
Then stop treating me.

490
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,754
Great job. Why didn't you just
shoot him in the head?

491
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:07,755
Hold on. That gives me an idea.

492
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,300
You know what could save this couple?
Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

493
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,094
They're dead! Yelling at you
might prevent you from screwing up...

494
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,470
I didn't screw up.
I did my job.

495
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,055
Your job was
to get me the biopsy.

496
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,932
No, it was to present
the patient with his options.

497
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,809
Two options,
biopsy or no biopsy.

498
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,562
He chose a third, no treatment.
How do you even do that?

499
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,356
Remember when you used to just weave
elaborate conspiracy theories

500
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,774
about my love life?

501
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,235
Those were such good times.

502
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,823
How much morphine
is the husband on?

503
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,368
We can't increase it any more.
His respirations are depressed.

504
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,496
Increase it?
Drugs cloud people's judgment.

505
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,790
Cold-turkey the sucker.

506
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,001
No.

507
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,004
Good point.

508
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,767
Did I ask you guys
to follow me?

509
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,144
No, which made us nervous.

510
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,897
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

511
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,858
Shoot him up with one of
these puppies instead.

512
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,984
No!

513
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,569
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

514
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,904
It's naloxone.

515
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,157
An opiate blocker? He'll feel like
he's swallowing a bonfire.

516
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,867
That's pretty unethical,
even for you.

517
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,953
How is that unethical?
It'll lead to a diagnosis.

518
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,579
It's leading to
the torture of the husband

519
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,873
on the off-chance he'll allow
a procedure on another person.

520
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,160
Which will lead to a diagnosis.
Didn't I just say that?

521
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,043
Give it up.

522
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,879
Foreman and Cameron are too ethical,
and I'm too scared of getting sued.

523
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,424
Fine. Now, I'm just going to
find someplace safe to hide this

524
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,884
so I won't be tempted
to use it.

525
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,220
You're not doing it, either.

526
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,097
What, are you going
to run for it?

527
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:46,312
If they die now, they'll never be able
to grow old and tired of each other.

528
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,406
We can't baby-sit
House all day.

529
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,033
Tell Cuddy to put a nurse
by his room.

530
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,119
Damn it!

531
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,832
Atropine? What happened to...

532
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,921
He knew we'd stop him.
He stuck both of them in his pocket.

533
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,924
That's actually pretty clever.

534
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,762
Guess I can't use
that trick again, huh?

535
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,473
My stomach!

536
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:28,021
It was a pretty smart plan,
Jerry, but I'm onto you.

537
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,565
There's only one good reason
to kill the biopsy.

538
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,776
You poisoned your wife, and you don't
want the coppers to get wise.

539
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,736
No!

540
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,071
Oh, all right. Then you're just a moron.

541
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,573
Biopsy me!

542
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,826
Only if this thing hits
your brain, you moron.

543
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,078
And I can't stress
that "moron" part enough.

544
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,371
You're killing your wife.

545
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,749
She is the love of my life.

546
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,419
Careful. When she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

547
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,880
you're gonna feel real guilty
about saying that.

548
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,008
Feel that? Get used to it.

549
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,134
Pain's going to get
a lot worse.

550
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,552
No, it won't.

551
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,555
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

552
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,017
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer
in the meantime. It'll work again soon.

553
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,101
Want to bet?

554
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,437
I don't care about the pain.

555
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,731
I need to be in pain,
because I have to get worse.

556
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,025
It means you can do
the biopsy on me.

557
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,236
Dude, she's in a coma.
Who are you trying to impress?

558
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,988
I'd die for her.

559
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,536
Give up. Or are we going to wait for him
to get all grown up and cynical?

560
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,577
I was just going to call you.

561
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,212
I need a court order
to biopsy this woman's brain.

562
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,172
Speaking of litigation...

563
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,427
Michael Tritter,
you know Dr. House.

564
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,264
You guys can talk here.

565
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,937
I don't want to sue you.

566
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,938
Good.

567
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,357
I want to beat
the crap out of you.

568
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,984
- Less good.
- And I'll tell you why.

569
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,488
You're a bully,

570
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,742
and bullies,
they don't back down

571
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,995
until they run into someone
stronger and meaner.

572
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,331
But you'll accept an apology?

573
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,582
Yes.

574
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,168
Not really a recipe
for sincerity.

575
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm not looking for sincerity.

576
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,089
I'm looking for humiliation,

577
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,133
something that will make you think twice

578
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,969
before you treat
the next patient like crap.

579
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,930
Here's what's going to happen.

580
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,137
You go brag to your friends

581
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,892
about how you made
the big, nasty doctor poop in his pants.

582
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,479
I get Cuddy off my back
by telling her that I humiliated myself.

583
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,816
Here's the catch.
We're both going to be lying.

584
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,986
I'm not apologizing.

585
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,031
If anything,
you deserved a bigger thermometer.

586
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,125
- What's wrong?
- Jeremy's worse.

587
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,793
And that's what's right.

588
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,713
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

589
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,881
It's not his brain.

590
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,675
Lactic acid's up to 39.
His intestines are rotting.

591
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,385
This isn't sarcoidosis.

592
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,512
Then he'll get his wish.

593
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,976
He's dying, just not in a way
that's going to help his wife.

594
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,064
Coma's worse.
She's losing response to stimuli.

595
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,317
He's vomiting blood
and his lactic acid's 45.

596
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,486
- He's got to have ischemic bowel.
- So what?

597
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,906
Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's
causing his guts to die,

598
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,157
which will cause him to die,

599
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,910
unless we cut out a few feet of
small intestine and reattach the ends.

600
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,203
I don't know,
seems worth a mention.

601
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,205
Why does he have it?
What does it tell us?

602
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,498
Small-cell vasculitis?

603
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,041
Good. Now let's hear it again,

604
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,607
but this time with a more environmental
or infectious feeling.

605
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,339
Or, like I said before, it might not be
environmental or infectious.

606
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,299
He has vasculitis,
she has porphyria.

607
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,927
Belly pain plus hallucination,
classic symptoms.

608
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,179
It could even cause a coma.

609
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,099
Fine. Start her on
hematin for porphyria.

610
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,309
What about him?

611
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,811
Take out the dead bowel.
It's all we can do.

612
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,147
And biopsy it.
If Foreman's right, it might save him.

613
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,400
If Foreman's wrong, the dead bowel
might save both of them.

614
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,698
Bowel's not dead.

615
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:12,119
Unless he's been tossing down frosty
cans of lactic acid, bowel is dead.

616
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,006
What we're looking for
is a reason it's dead.

617
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,331
Bowel's not dead.

618
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,835
Just general swelling and edema.
High lactate was probably from stress.

619
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,838
We just sliced him open
from chest to pubic bone for nothing.

620
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,009
Nothing's something.

621
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,055
Forget the ischemia.
Add the edema and swelling.

622
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,557
Probably from cutting him open.

623
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,684
Probably, not definitely.

624
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,060
Okay, back to the beginning.

625
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,980
What did we talk about?
Anything. I want to hear it all again.

626
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,232
Allergies.
Doesn't fit at all now.

627
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,693
STDs. Maybe we
got the wrong one.

628
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,777
What about syphilis?

629
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,612
- Neurological symptoms.
- He wasn't cheating on her.

630
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,032
Yeah, love of his life.
Don't you have to wait till he's dead

631
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,284
before you make
that determination?

632
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,077
She's his only girlfriend ever.

633
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,831
They grew up next door,
ran off together as teenagers.

634
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,757
Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out
because we thought he had ischemic...

635
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,544
- Why did they run off?
- What difference does...

636
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,588
Kids talk about running off.
How many do it?

637
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:04,714
What was the reason?

638
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,717
They were trying to escape
his evil, pill-popping, racist dad.

639
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,969
You would've liked him.
We should do another...

640
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,762
How do you know
the dad was racist?

641
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,016
He beat up his son for dating
a black girl. I extrapolated from that.

642
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,059
You see racism everywhere.

643
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,979
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

644
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,106
It's not sarcoid.
We would have seen granulomas in his...

645
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,858
She has pretty eyes.

646
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,616
Forget infectious.
Forget environmental.

647
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,828
Defective DNA is keeping them
from making a critical protein,

648
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,164
hence the fluid build-up.

649
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,499
Hits the throat, stomach,
chest and brain.

650
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,043
Angioedema?

651
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,005
Hereditary angioedema.
Symptoms fit perfectly.

652
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,967
It's an incredibly rare disease.
They both would have to have a parent...

653
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,387
Is it a coincidence
that your sister has great hair,

654
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,766
or that these two
have green eyes?

655
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,646
You're not saying...
They're not brother and sister.

656
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,608
God, no. That would be sick.

657
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:09,403
Half brother and sister.
Different moms.

658
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,740
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

659
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,493
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

660
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,328
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

661
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,621
We won't know for sure...

662
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,249
Testing for HAE or paternity
is going to take a day.

663
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:26,128
She doesn't have a day.
Start treating and see what happens.

664
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,929
Any change?

665
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,682
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

666
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,142
I almost hope
she stays in a coma.

667
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,727
That's sweet, Cameron.

668
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,813
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

669
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,107
You don't think
dying will do that?

670
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,032
It's just her oximeter.

671
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,374
Tracy.

672
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,920
She's awake.

673
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,595
Oh, God, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,061
Awesome. Can I tell them?

675
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,397
We've obviously got to
let them know what's wrong.

676
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,735
But the cause,
the brother-sister thing...

677
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:35,281
Good plan. We just gotta keep them away
from doctors, the Internet

678
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,700
and anyone who's
not a total moron.

679
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,034
Tell them.

680
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,288
Yesterday he was willing to die
to save her.

681
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,039
We've gotta give him time to recover.

682
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,584
He might be a little vexed
that you kept letting him

683
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,878
hump his sister in the meantime.

684
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,504
Tell them.

685
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,883
Look, unless their dad was also
the product of an incestuous union,

686
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,635
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

687
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:01,390
Noble of you to take that risk.
Tell them, or I will.

688
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,812
So we just need
to take these pills?

689
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
Twice a day.

690
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,650
Angioedema is very treatable.
You'll be fine.

691
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,029
So, what? We, like,
caught this from each other?

692
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,574
No, it's a condition
you've both always had.

693
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,620
The onset of symptoms are
sometimes caused by stress or trauma.

694
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,788
The incident at the diner.

695
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,998
So we got it as kids?

696
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,795
It's a genetic disease.
It's not...

697
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:37,009
There's no good reason
two unrelated people would get it.

698
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,181
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

699
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,852
How can we be related?

700
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,900
We think you have the same dad.

701
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,446
We won't know for sure
until we do the test.

702
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,240
Oh, God!

703
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,332
Your father.

704
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,376
No. No, this can't be true.

705
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,587
Yeah. Yeah, Jer, I'm lighter.

706
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,631
You know, I'm lighter
than both my parents.

707
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:20,261
And our eyes. Everyone always talks
about how we have the same eyes.

708
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,847
You're not really siblings.

709
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,102
We have the same father!

710
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,939
You didn't fight in
the backseat on car trips.

711
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,108
You didn't change
each other's diapers.

712
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:38,153
You guys just met
and fell in love.

713
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,785
The way you feel,
that hasn't changed.

714
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,151
Hey, Foreman, can you wear the beeper
for a couple of hours this weekend?

715
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,569
What?

716
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,362
We just destroyed
two people's lives.

717
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,197
So I'm not allowed to
run errands anymore?

718
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,949
I'd like to see some sign
that it affects you,

719
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,285
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

720
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,953
So are you going to wear
the beeper or not?

721
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,747
Sorry, I can't.

722
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,334
You just want to punish me.

723
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,794
I'm busy.

724
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,171
With what?

725
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,257
Going out of town.

726
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,011
Where are you going?

727
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:51,018
Foreman, you're not missing
a blue shoe, are you?

728
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,316
Come...

729
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,778
You can't bet when you know
the answer beforehand.

730
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,447
We could spend all day
arguing whether you can bet

731
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,973
when you know
the answer beforehand.

732
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,076
Give me the 200 bucks.

733
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,592
What?

734
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

735
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,611
You okay?

736
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,156
I was just wondering,
do you really like jazz?

737
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,950
I love it.

738
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
Are you lying?

739
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,579
I'm lying.

740
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,419
I want to spend time with you.

741
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,504
Is that so terrible?

742
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,715
No.

743
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,557
Maybe we shouldn't walk out together.
If people see us leaving...

744
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,435
Everybody's got to
find out sometime.

745
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,193
Let me just meet you
at your place.

746
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,248
She got her own room.

747
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,796
She just needs some time alone.

748
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,847
Do you want me to
hang out here a bit?

749
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,401
If you've come to return
the thermometer, don't bother.

750
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:28,569
I've moved on.

751
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:33,031
If you'd actually read my chart,
you'd have known that I'm a cop.

752
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,369
You were going 40 in a 25 zone.

753
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,454
Oh, come on.

754
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,041
This isn't because I was speeding,
this is because I'm Latino.

755
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,377
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

756
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,047
Sorry, cool jacket.
Only pockets for important stuff.

757
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,799
That's a shame.

758
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,969
A 50 buck ticket?

759
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,221
Is that your way of
beating me up,

760
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,307
or is that just the price
for sticking something in you?

761
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,185
You took a pill
while you were examining a patient.

762
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,146
That's serious
addictive behavior.

763
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,484
I'm betting that
you're holding right now.

764
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,655
I wasn't weaving.
I'm not drunk.

765
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,783
- You've got no reason to...
- Pupils dilated.

766
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,620
Appear to be under
the influence of a narcotic.

767
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,790
Would you mind turning around, please,
and putting your hands behind your head?

768
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:27,169
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

769
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:35,135
Most people realize
there's only one answer.

770
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,560
You got a prescription?

771
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,979
I'm a cripple who
works in a hospital.

772
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,946
You don't think
I can get a valid prescription?

773
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,858
Arrogant son of a bitch
like you?

774
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,486
I'm going to bet
you didn't bother.

775
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:59,243
You are under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

776
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,536
You have the right
to remain silent,

777
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,249
which you should take advantage of
for once in your life.

778
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,750
If you give up the right
to remain silent,

779
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:10,337
anything you say
can and will be used against you...
