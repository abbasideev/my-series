1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,129
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,132
The general hands
each of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,636
"Your spouse is seated next door
in a room in a chair."

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,098
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside and kill them."

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,059
Immediately
the Green Beret says,

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,728
"No, sir, I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,854
The General looks at him
and says, "You know what?"

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,025
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife and go on home."

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,360
Navy Seal then heads in.

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,279
Five minutes later, comes out,
tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,448
"I tried, I tried, I tried,
I just can't do it,"

12
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,909
"she looked so beautiful
in the chair, I can't do it."

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,876
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?"

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,246
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,791
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,043
Shots rang out,

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,920
there's banging, there's screaming,
it's going crazy!

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,089
Suddenly,
everything goes silent.

19
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,259
The General says,
"Well, what the hell happened inside?"

20
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,677
The sister from Brooklyn
screams back,

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,762
"The damn gun had blanks in it,"

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,432
"so I had to beat him to death
with my bare..."

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,559
What the hell?

24
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,310
A little bit of warning
would have been nice!

25
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,854
The sound of a saw
cutting a hole in the wall

26
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,896
wasn't warning enough?

27
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,856
Bite me.

28
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,952
What, are you kidding me? Tub of Goo
there's gotta be over six bills.

29
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,829
You ain't gonna lift him
with a couple of blankets.

30
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,289
You got a better idea,
Einstein?

31
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,957
Yeah, just roll him off.

32
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,752
What? He's already dead,
it ain't like he's gonna feel it.

33
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,253
How the hell's
a guy get that big?

34
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,254
You roll him off
from this high,

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,922
he's likely to go right
through the floor and take us with him.

36
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,884
Are you ready?
All right, one, two, lift!

37
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,262
Come on, man!

38
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,764
Me? You're the kielbasa king.

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,015
It wasn't me.

40
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,642
Whoa, it wasn't me, either.

41
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,355
Don't look at me.

42
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,903
Please tell me
dead guys can fart.

43
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,149
Of course. Dead bodies are full
of all sorts of gases.

44
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,448
But a dead body
can't tighten a sphincter.

45
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,214
You need a tight sphincter
to make a fart.

46
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,659
No, you need a loose sphincter.
A tight sphincter...

47
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,369
You check his femoral?

48
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,247
No. He peed all over himself!

49
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,917
Look, I've heard dead bodies
moan, groan, hiss,

50
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,668
hell, I've even seen them
sit straight up on a gurney.

51
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,130
Trust me, his skin's cold, pupils are
fixed and dilated, he's not breathing.

52
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,132
- He's got a pulse!
- No way.

53
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,885
All right, give me an Ambu bag and
an EKG. It's thready, but it's there.

54
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,595
Let's get him in a basket.
Ready?

55
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,680
One, two, lift!

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,760
Forty-six-year-old guy
in a coma.

57
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,679
Doesn't appear to be
anything wrong with him

58
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,973
except for the fact
that he weighs over 600 pounds.

59
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,379
What time
does he usually get in?

60
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,184
Any time between
8:00 and 10:00.

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,978
- Did you say 600?
- At least.

62
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,896
Biggest scale we got
only goes up to 350

63
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,315
but this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

64
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,360
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker than pancake batter.

65
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,195
No mystery there,
not much we can do.

66
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,280
Blood sugar's normal.

67
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,950
Cholesterol's lower than mine,
tox screen's clean, no sign of trauma.

68
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,556
Sure there wasn't
a mix-up at the lab?

69
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,120
Three times?

70
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,455
It's almost 11:00,
where is House?

71
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,876
Hello!

72
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,171
It's 11:00.

73
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,550
Which means my friend is ready for his
sponge bath and I shouldn't be here!

74
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,514
Hey, Gomer Pyle!
I know you can hear me.

75
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,902
I think you mean Barney Fife.

76
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,947
So many great idiot icons
to choose from.

77
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,408
You need time
to think of some more?

78
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,577
Either arraign me or let me go.

79
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,038
No problem.
Which do you prefer?

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,008
What took you so long?

81
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,303
Sorry. I didn't have 15 grand
in my loose change jar.

82
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,639
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

83
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,184
Your motorcycle was impounded,
that explains the speeding, DUI,

84
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,602
and driving without a license.

85
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,189
The fact that you're you explains
the illegal possession of narcotics

86
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,233
and resisting arrest.

87
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,528
Where's your car?

88
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,737
What happened?

89
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,782
Some idiot cop with crotch rot
obviously thought

90
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,535
that I didn't treat him with the
deference due to a man of his stature.

91
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,161
He trumped up a traffic stop,

92
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,830
next thing I know
I'm sharing a cage

93
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,277
with a guy
who thinks that showers

94
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,750
are the way the devil
gets inside you.

95
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,002
Does Cuddy know?

96
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,045
Everything she needs to.

97
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,424
- I'm innocent.
- Till proven guilty.

98
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,301
Guy wanted to punish me,
he did it. It's over.

99
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,549
Gotta get yourself a lawyer.

100
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,554
Already got one.

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,390
You know what they say about the lawyer
who has himself as a client?

102
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,767
Same thing they say
about the doctor who lends 15 grand

103
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,311
to a friend he knows
can't pay him back.

104
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,648
Relax, you'll get it.
Where am I gonna take off to?

105
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,614
Does Salma Hayek
live in Mexico or Spain?

106
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,578
There's nothing abnormal in the EEG
or the neurological exam.

107
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,663
I'm guessing it's food-related.

108
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,248
Improperly prepared puffer fish

109
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,708
can have toxins
that could cause a coma

110
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,419
and might not show up
on the tox screen.

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,046
Where do you think he is?

112
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,505
He's probably at the track.

113
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,674
If he's at the track he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him,

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,343
and if it was a puffer fish, he'd
be dead in six to eight hours, tops.

115
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,803
He's been in a coma
at least 24.

116
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,973
And the guy didn't get to 600 pounds
eating a load of sushi.

117
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,475
What if he was
in a motorcycle accident?

118
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,144
Explains the coma.
But how'd he get back in bed?

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,772
Oh, Cameron's talking
about House!

120
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,106
You ever see how he drives?

121
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,232
No, we haven't.

122
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,193
But I have seen how many pills
he's been popping lately,

123
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,904
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's in a coma somewhere himself.

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,031
If I am, this is
one lame hallucination.

125
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,157
What happened to you?

126
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,452
If you ever end up in a bar with the
Cambridge Women's Heavyweight Eight,

127
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,371
do not accept an offer
of an upside-down kamikaze shot.

128
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,332
- We have a case.
- Fat guy in a coma, I know.

129
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,458
- Cuddy found you?
- Nope.

130
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,043
But the wall
between Wilson's office

131
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,503
and this one
is thinner than you'd think.

132
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,712
Which means
we need to stop talking

133
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,464
about what a pathetic loser
he is.

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,092
Start treating Jabba
for pickwickian syndrome.

135
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,262
His 96 double-Zs are probably putting
pressure on his chest, suffocating him.

136
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,056
CO2 and oxygen sats are normal.

137
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,642
For you and me.
What's normal for a hippopotamus?

138
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,129
And get
a detailed medical history.

139
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,311
From who?
He was brought in alone.

140
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,898
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600 pounds
bothers with annual physicals.

141
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,704
Talk to the neighbors
and search the house.

142
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,028
Let's see what else
Shamu's been up to besides eating.

143
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,863
This conversation is over

144
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,951
because I've officially run out
of clever things to call the guy.

145
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,419
It's hard to believe you can even attach
this much flesh to a human skeleton.

146
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,631
I wouldn't exactly
call this attached.

147
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,674
This is ridiculous.

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,218
A person shouldn't be able to
eat themselves into oblivion

149
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,179
and then just expect everyone
to pull out the stops to fix everything.

150
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,266
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment to anyone who's obese?

151
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,060
Come on, give me a break.
This guy's not obese.

152
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,855
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

153
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,523
People who attempt suicide
get treated.

154
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,441
Plenty of noncompliant
diabetics don't.

155
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,277
We don't give
drug addicts dialysis

156
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,654
or alcoholics
liver transplants.

157
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,114
What is your problem?

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,824
You get beat up
by a gang of fat kids

159
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,159
when you were in grade school
or something?

160
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:16,245
Yeah. I'm the one
with the problem.

161
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,165
So, I think
his bedroom's through there,

162
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,500
and the kitchen's to the left.

163
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,502
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

164
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,838
Any trouble with memory
or balance?

165
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,799
No, but I really
don't see him that often.

166
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,509
He's not unfriendly
or anything,

167
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,678
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

168
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,640
I think he only gave me a spare set
of keys 'cause I gave him mine.

169
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,101
What?

170
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:43,147
Nothing. Just reminds me
of someone I know. Who is unfriendly.

171
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,857
Does George have a job?

172
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,109
He has a headhunting business
he runs from home.

173
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,153
Occasionally
he'll interview people here,

174
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,238
but he does most of it
over the phone.

175
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,531
Wow!

176
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,451
Yeah, he loves to cook.

177
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,745
And eat, obviously.

178
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,289
Four-course gourmet meals
almost every night,

179
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,498
sometimes for lunch, too.

180
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,627
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese or wild game?

181
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,836
I'm not sure.

182
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,756
He gets all his groceries delivered
from that market down on Alden.

183
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,466
They'd probably know.

184
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,386
- He have any friends?
- No.

185
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,014
I mean, sometimes women
do come by.

186
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,227
Young, attractive, never the same one
twice, if you know what I mean.

187
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,186
I see.

188
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,065
There can't be many women
who'd wanna be with a guy like him.

189
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,448
It's usually worst
in the morning.

190
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,033
Especially
if I've slept on my arm.

191
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,036
If I sleep on my back
or with my arms out, I'm usually okay.

192
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:44,166
So your arm only hurts
after you lie on top of it all night.

193
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,251
Yeah.

194
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,047
Well, have you thought about,
I don't know, not doing that?

195
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,008
Yeah. But it's how I sleep,
it's how I've always slept.

196
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,294
Well, there's always surgery.

197
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,262
To do what? Like, clean out
some cartilage or something?

198
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,266
You're not sleeping on some cartilage,
you're sleeping on your arm.

199
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,309
You wanna remove my arm?

200
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,271
Well, it is your left.
You know, a guy's gotta sleep.

201
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,606
Are you insane?

202
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,952
I see spending a night in jail
hasn't humbled you a bit.

203
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,288
While following
my every move is flattering,

204
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:26,041
a single rose on my doorstep
each morning would be more enticing.

205
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,835
Just bringing your boss
up to speed,

206
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,629
which I guess
you didn't feel was necessary.

207
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,631
You gonna add that
to my list of charges?

208
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,010
People who are innocent
tend not to try to hide their arrest.

209
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,264
Is that based on your years of
experience arresting innocent people?

210
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,934
The way
you're going at that gum,

211
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,395
it's obviously not having
the desired effect.

212
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,732
You're the addict. You're gonna be back
on the butts in a month.

213
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,360
You're just taking out your frustration
on me 'cause my meds actually work.

214
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,988
Why don't you quit
while you're ahead.

215
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,698
Before you end up
as a security guard

216
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,159
working the night shift
at some strip mall.

217
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,162
I think working around
a bunch of nurses

218
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,498
has given you a false sense
of your ability to intimidate.

219
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,675
Who was that?

220
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,721
Apparently Cuddy's widened
her sperm donor search

221
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,473
to include Neanderthals.

222
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,017
Cuddy's looking for
a sperm donor?

223
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,355
It was a joke.
Like Cuddy would ever want a kid.

224
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,681
Or a kid would ever want Cuddy.

225
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,900
Hello, that's why it's funny!

226
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,777
Why are you guys here?

227
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,320
It's not pickwick's.

228
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,364
Intubation and steroids
have had no effect.

229
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,240
Except maybe to cause
whatever it is to get worse.

230
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,325
He's got a fever now.

231
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,534
What'd you find out?

232
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,421
That you and George have the same taste
in home furnishings and women.

233
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,206
Danish Modern
and Russian gymnasts?

234
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,499
Pianos and prostitutes.

235
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,426
We should do an LP
and look for neurosyphilis.

236
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,336
- It's not syphilis.
- How do you know?

237
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,546
Because you get STDs
from people you trust,

238
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,873
people you don't feel
the need to protect yourself from.

239
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,468
Whatever he has is connected to his gut,
not what's below it.

240
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,220
MRI his brain, look for clots.

241
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,264
Weight limit
on the MRI machine is 450 pounds.

242
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,641
So do a CT.

243
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,351
Limit's 350.

244
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,852
Then just start treatment.

245
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,771
If we give him blood thinners
and the coma's caused

246
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,439
by a bleed instead of a clot,
we could kill him.

247
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,859
Either start treatment
or start building a stronger MRI.

248
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,277
Whatever you do, do it fast.

249
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,644
The longer
he stays in the coma,

250
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,532
the less likely it is
he'll ever wake up.

251
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,786
There's no way.

252
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,705
His head's the only part
that we have to get in the machine.

253
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,312
If we can just
get him on the table...

254
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,126
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

255
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,545
We break the table,
hospital's out a million dollars

256
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,504
and we're out of our jobs.

257
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,881
The weight limit's
obviously just an estimation.

258
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,092
It's not like if it can hold
450 pounds fine,

259
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,177
it'll instantly collapse
under 451.

260
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,056
He's not one pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

261
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,393
I don't care! He still deserves the
same standard of care as anyone else.

262
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,771
Then you believe the machine
will stand on principle.

263
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,653
You guys gonna help or not?

264
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,240
How much does this guy weigh?

265
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,367
- 440.
- Looks like a lot more than that.

266
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,660
It's 'cause he's lying down.

267
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,121
You guys ready?
One, two, three.

268
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,265
- Here.
- What's this?

269
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,101
I made some calls for you.

270
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,187
The guy's the best criminal attorney
in Princeton.

271
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,354
Thanks, but I don't need it.

272
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,231
I assume
you told Inspector Clouseau

273
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,150
that I have a valid prescription
for the Vicodin.

274
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,861
Yeah, and I assume you did as well.
Did it make a difference?

275
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,112
The guy's pissed!

276
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,157
And with the DEA now treating
pain doctors like Colombian...

277
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,868
I'm not a pain doctor,
I'm a pain patient.

278
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,205
Tell it to your lawyer.

279
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,180
No midline shifts,
no bleeds, clots, infarcts.

280
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,806
I don't see any edema, either.

281
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,517
So what do we do now?

282
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,601
An LP.

283
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,521
Even if it's not an STD, a fever points
toward some sort of infection.

284
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,441
I'm not sure we can do an LP
on a guy his size.

285
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,153
What?

286
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,489
You have to be able to palpate the spine
to know where to go.

287
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,157
We could use fluoroscopy
to guide us.

288
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,493
He still wouldn't be able
to bring his knees up and bend forward

289
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,059
in order to open the space
between...

290
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,625
George, it's all right,
you're in a hospital!

291
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,585
Calm down, man, calm down!

292
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,379
- Get him out already!
- I'm trying!

293
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,547
Come on!

294
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,468
We're gonna get you out!

295
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,396
We still have no idea
why he was in the coma to begin with.

296
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,314
Or why he woke up.

297
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,775
It was probably
just some sort of head trauma

298
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,776
and we missed the swelling

299
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,654
because, well,
his head's already swollen.

300
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,906
Bump on the noggin
doesn't explain the fever.

301
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,872
An infection made worse by the steroids
we gave him for pickwick's does.

302
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,953
He's not worse, he's better.

303
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,956
We just replaced
the last MRI you broke.

304
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,001
Referring to the fund-raising funbags
by the royal "we" now?

305
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,794
Let me explain
cause and effect to you.

306
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,006
I specifically told them
to skip the boring testing part

307
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,424
and jump right to
the dangerous treatment.

308
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,343
You blow stuff up,
makes my life miserable,

309
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,054
makes me need to make
your life miserable.

310
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,764
He's telling the truth.

311
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,647
Kids these days, got no respect
for other people's property.

312
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,524
Repairmen cost less
than lawyers.

313
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,445
Morbid obesity
is a legally defined disability,

314
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,572
which means
if we'd denied access to the MRI,

315
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,075
he could have sued us for discrimination
as well as malpractice.

316
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
This was your idea?

317
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,828
Yeah.

318
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,634
Looks like Cameron's gonna be having
a lot more ideas in future.

319
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,553
Who knew that being bloated and bitchy
could actually come in handy?

320
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
- Shut up.
- What if it is hormones?

321
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,514
It's not hormones.

322
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,891
I'm talking about George.

323
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,894
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

324
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,730
A glandular problem would cause
his temperature to be low, not high.

325
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,056
Maybe the fever's not related.

326
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,691
If it's not related,
there's nothing to talk about.

327
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,735
We should do
an ACTH stimulation test

328
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,779
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

329
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,907
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

330
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,785
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals for chancres.

331
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,078
We should do nothing.

332
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,413
Just keep him a couple of days
for observation.

333
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,660
If he doesn't get any worse,

334
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,293
it was probably just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

335
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,921
Or we do all of the above.

336
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,256
You check his belly
for patches.

337
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,050
You check underneath for sores.

338
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,470
And you just sit on your ass.

339
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,313
Acanthosis nigricans
is a hyperpigmentation of the skin,

340
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,108
usually indicates some sort
of hormonal imbalance.

341
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,151
There's nothing wrong
with my hormones.

342
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,154
It's the first thing every doctor
I've ever gone to has checked.

343
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,990
Then it's the blood pressure,
then it's gotta be diabetes.

344
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,536
They all figure there's gotta be
something wrong with me.

345
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,663
You having any problems
with your vision?

346
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,666
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth, I'm fine.

347
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,835
You're not fine.
You were in a coma for two days.

348
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,044
There's something wrong
with you.

349
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,173
Was something wrong with me,
now I'm better, now I'd like to go home.

350
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,718
A coma's not like
a stomach ache.

351
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,011
You can't just shrug it off
and hope it's not anything serious.

352
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,514
My company places
a lot of insurance executives.

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,853
There are over 300,000 deaths
caused each year by medical mistakes

354
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,857
and hospital-associated infections.
I'll come in for tests.

355
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,527
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by obesity-related illnesses.

356
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,197
The CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

357
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,576
George, you ever notice
you don't see a lot of obese old men?

358
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,828
If I'm gonna
have a heart attack,

359
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:05,542
I would rather it be caused
by a perfect pan-roasted ris de veau

360
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,630
than running 26 miles for no reason
other than to brag that I can do it.

361
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:15,010
Or to have an MRI machine
break in the middle of a procedure!

362
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,470
We're sorry about that.

363
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,722
It was the only way to rule out
a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

364
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,100
And now that you have,
when can I go?

365
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,736
It's probably her mom.

366
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,031
I bet she's huge.
She's from the Midwest.

367
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,784
Since when do you eat beets?

368
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,951
Since I was five.

369
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,287
And who are we talking about?
You know, just in case you need me

370
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,456
to chime in and tell you
you're a lunatic at some point?

371
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,043
Cameron. She's lying,
destroying hospital equipment,

372
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,461
telling Cuddy off.

373
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,880
I gotta find out
where she got the Fat Scratch Fever.

374
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,216
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

375
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,926
I heard Cuddy gave you
the name of a lawyer.

376
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,930
Or it could just be pity. She feels
guilty about being born beautiful.

377
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,682
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

378
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,769
Would explain why
she gets along so well with you.

379
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,395
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her of you, not me.

380
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,355
Call the lawyer.

381
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,690
Cameron sees a clump of dirt
and she thinks of me.

382
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,778
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic. Call the lawyer.

383
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,991
- Very mature.
- You started it.

384
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,036
Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test
were both normal.

385
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,205
He has nystagmus
but it's congenital.

386
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,665
No way it's related
to the coma.

387
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,960
You say, "No way,"
I say... Yeah, no way.

388
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,420
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis.

389
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,297
Looks like
we got ourselves a mystery.

390
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,842
Not for long.
He wants to be discharged.

391
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,219
Oh, sure.
Places to go, people to eat.

392
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,545
He insists his chance of dying

393
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,680
from a hospital-acquired
infection

394
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,007
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

395
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,103
Did you tell him that statistics
also say that he's a big, fat idiot?

396
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,105
- Yeah, I did.
- He's not backing down.

397
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,065
He says if we don't discharge him,
he'll leave AMA.

398
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,652
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative,

399
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,571
maybe you ought to
check his leg.

400
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,826
Do you see what he did there?
The patient's like me.

401
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,744
The patient's three mes.

402
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,746
If I were him...

403
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,919
Maybe it's not
such a mystery after all.

404
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,930
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?

405
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,891
Putting chopped parsley
in a hamburger

406
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,101
does not
a Salisbury steak make.

407
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,313
You must be Dr. House.

408
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,234
And you must be
full of baloney. A lot of it.

409
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,696
Right. Fat joke. Always fun.

410
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,823
The only people
you can still make fun of.

411
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,576
And Christians.
Oh, and black people.

412
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,913
No one in their right mind
comes out of a coma

413
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,320
and immediately asks to go home
with an unknown condition,

414
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,167
which means that either
you're not in your right mind

415
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,710
or it's not
an unknown condition.

416
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,962
So, what is it?
You tried to off yourself?

417
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,133
You figure I'm fat,
therefore I hate myself.

418
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,761
Yeah, that's a huge leap
of logic.

419
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,139
I don't wanna die.
I just don't wanna be here.

420
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,516
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed,

421
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,185
or it's something
you know you've inherited.

422
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,687
Let's see, your stomach
has deep-seated feelings

423
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,174
of abandonment
written all over it,

424
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,274
which points toward
sexual abuse.

425
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,362
While a fear of hospitals, that points
to a more specific traumatic event.

426
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:24,950
So I'm gonna say, your mom
in the hospital with a candlestick.

427
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,328
And by candlestick, of course,
I mean inherited OTC deficiency.

428
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,748
My parents are both alive and well
and living in Boca Raton.

429
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,833
Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?

430
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,335
I have no idea what that is.

431
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,754
- Leukoencephalopathy.
- Will you stop!

432
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,841
If I knew what was wrong,
I would tell you.

433
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,844
I'm not an imbecile,
and I'm not miserable.

434
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,515
I'm just overweight.

435
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,813
What?

436
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,356
When?

437
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,360
To be continued.

438
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,553
What are you doing here?

439
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,888
Executing a search
of the premises.

440
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,850
When you...
When you got bailed out

441
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,853
before we could get a judge
to approve this,

442
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,857
I almost didn't bother.

443
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,944
I thought for sure you'd come
straight home and throw everything out.

444
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,323
Rookie mistake. Never underestimate
the stupidity of an addict.

445
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,954
There's gotta be
over 600 Vicodin in here.

446
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,874
Which most DAs would say
proves intent to traffic.

447
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,128
Even if all you really intended was
to simply be wasted 24/7

448
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,379
while practicing medicine.

449
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,340
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are prescription bottles.

450
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,052
I'm not an expert
on linguistics per se,

451
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:10,180
but I think that means
they were prescribed.

452
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,434
All these
were legally prescribed

453
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,603
to a man who's in constant pain

454
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,969
but never misses a day of work?

455
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,565
Has it ever occurred to you
that's why I don't miss a day?

456
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,152
Yeah. Yeah, crossed my mind.
Among other things.

457
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:28,406
Like what an unprofessional,
unethical, arrogant ass you are.

458
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,869
Because if you're unprofessional
in one area,

459
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,704
it only makes sense.

460
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:40,794
Now maybe just a few of these
are in someone else's name.

461
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,130
Forged prescription,

462
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,926
or just, um, swiped from the pharmacy
when nobody's looking.

463
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:55,141
No, but, well,
you wouldn't do that. Right?

464
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,735
Send him home.

465
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,487
Why? You think he's healthy?

466
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,030
Either I'm right,

467
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,866
he knows what's wrong,
he's just too stubborn to admit it,

468
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,952
or I was right
and it's pickwick's.

469
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,912
The treatment
just had a delayed effect.

470
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,914
You don't have
delayed effects to oxygen.

471
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,641
And Pickwick's
doesn't explain the fever.

472
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,751
Being engulfed
in an electric blanket of blubber

473
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,002
could explain the fever.

474
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,529
Yesterday you insisted
we keep him here because of the fever.

475
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,006
We have no idea
what's wrong with the guy.

476
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,425
For all we know
he could be dead in 12 hours.

477
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,261
He does not want our help.

478
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,471
Which means
he doesn't want your help.

479
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,474
He's obviously just rationalizing.
And so are you!

480
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,934
You would never give up
this easy

481
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,646
if you weren't so busy dealing with
your own personal problems.

482
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,773
Send him home.

483
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,900
What did you tell that cop?

484
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,319
- Nothing.
- Nothing as in nothing?

485
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,988
Or as in nothing
that could cause him to think

486
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,614
I have a stash in my apartment?

487
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,659
He called to see if I prescribed
the pills, I said yes. That's all.

488
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,619
- Obviously not.
- What happened?

489
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,914
He searched my house,
found a buttload of pills.

490
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,458
Guy's gotta be prepared
for a rainy day.

491
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,961
Last I checked pharmacies
were still open when it rained.

492
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,687
And because I never know when
you're gonna be in one of your moods

493
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,799
- and cut me off.
- Oh, it's my fault.

494
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,405
I'm not the one
who talked to the cop.

495
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,470
Well, I'm not the one
who put a thermometer in his rectum.

496
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:18,057
So stop yelling at me
and start talking to your lawyer.

497
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,521
Is there someone
who can check on you?

498
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,606
Oh, don't worry.

499
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,859
There's gonna be a whole crew
of carpenters in my bedroom

500
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,861
for the next week at least.

501
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,657
You know, there's an Overeaters
Anonymous meeting here at the hospital.

502
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,911
If I wanted to jump out of airplanes
or climb Mount Everest,

503
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,663
would you be telling me
to go to Daredevils Anonymous?

504
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,916
I would be worried about you
just like I am now.

505
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,167
Don't be.

506
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,877
I enjoy food.

507
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,006
I like cooking it, I like looking at it,
I like smelling it,

508
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,508
and I especially
like eating it.

509
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,971
Listen, whatever happens
is gonna happen.

510
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,351
Ultimately it's all
out of our control anyway.

511
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,757
Why doesn't
that philosophy apply

512
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,564
to medical mistakes and
hospital-acquired infections as well?

513
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm a complicated man,
Dr. Cameron.

514
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,989
But don't worry, I plan on staying
that way for a long time.

515
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,658
Wait, wait, let us take you
all the way outside.

516
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,992
I'm fine.

517
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,411
It doesn't matter,
it's hospital rules.

518
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,665
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back for four days.

519
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,208
I need the exercise, right?

520
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,085
George, come on,
let us just take you to the taxi.

521
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:31,506
Don't worry, I may not be able
to climb Everest, but I can walk, okay?

522
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,925
- George...
- Now enough already.

523
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,142
George, are you all right?

524
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,775
George? You all right? George?

525
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,202
Disorientation
and loss of balance

526
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,621
could mean a neurofibromatosis.

527
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,039
- Where's Chase?
- Don't know.

528
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,685
Haven't seen him since you told him
to sit on his ass yesterday.

529
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,252
Interesting.

530
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,796
NF2 is also inherited,
which means I was right.

531
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:12,880
You kept saying
it was pickwick's.

532
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,799
Between the first pickwick's
and the second pickwick's,

533
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,758
I said it was inherited.

534
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,927
Whatever.
NF2 doesn't explain fever.

535
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,804
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

536
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,140
Why? The disorientation
and loss of balance are more recent.

537
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,516
The coma was
the most severe symptom.

538
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,894
But he's not in the coma anymore
and he is disoriented.

539
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,771
No, he's not.

540
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,317
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass that begs to differ.

541
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,028
I just mean it's not connected.

542
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,487
You don't know that.

543
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,447
Yeah, I do.

544
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,773
How could you possibly know...

545
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,867
Because I did it!

546
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,956
I didn't think
he should be discharged,

547
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,834
so I gave him
three grams of phenytoin.

548
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,627
I wasn't gonna just
let him leave.

549
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,380
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

550
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,258
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

551
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,302
Nice audible, Peyton.

552
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,055
So, what do we do now?

553
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,058
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

554
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,935
Humpty Dumpty didn't get to be the size
of all the king's horses

555
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,937
by skipping
the most important meal of the day.

556
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,774
What causes coma, fever,
and loss of appetite?

557
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,193
It can't be Chagas',
he's never been outside the country.

558
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,194
But his stomach has.

559
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,738
The food we eat no longer
comes from America's heartland.

560
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,491
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

561
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,160
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

562
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,495
Get a sample of his CSF

563
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,748
before the bugs that are now feasting
on his brain move on to dessert.

564
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,043
How are we gonna do that?
He's too big to do an LP.

565
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,962
So go straight to the source.

566
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,592
You wanna drill a hole
in my head?

567
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,802
It's the only way.

568
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,846
It's gotta be something
other than a parasite.

569
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:48,309
I buy my produce at the best market
in town and I always wash it.

570
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,311
Leafy vegetables
can suck contaminated water

571
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,038
through their roots
right into the plant.

572
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,689
You could have
washed them in chlorine

573
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,608
and it still
wouldn't have mattered.

574
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,319
Then other people
would be sick as well.

575
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,988
The parasites could have been
on only a few items,

576
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,035
or maybe they just didn't eat
as much as you did.

577
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,827
It's always
about my weight, isn't it?

578
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,496
Why can't you people
come up with one theory...

579
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,956
This one fits, George.

580
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:14,293
It explains your coma,
your fever, your loss of appetite...

581
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,051
And the disorientation?

582
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,554
It's all explained.

583
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,889
And if we don't treat it
while it's still in the acute stage,

584
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,057
it'll be too late.

585
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,352
It could go on to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

586
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,194
This is what I get
for eating salad.

587
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,453
Suction.

588
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,704
Suction.

589
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,205
Aspirator.

590
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,424
Your turn.

591
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,719
Irrigation.

592
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,054
Sponge.

593
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,473
What did you do?

594
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,680
Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

595
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,809
I can't see.

596
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,269
Vision's blurry
or you've lost...

597
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,062
I didn't lose it,
you took it from me!

598
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,856
- George, calm down.
- I can't see!

599
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,399
Give me some lorazepam!

600
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,318
- What did you do to me?
- Hold still!

601
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,569
- George! George!
- What's going on?

602
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,614
- No. No. Calm down!
- What did you do to me?

603
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,577
There's no inflammation in
the optic nerve and his retina's intact.

604
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,913
The blindness has to have been caused
by something in his brain.

605
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,081
And not surprisingly
there was no sign of Chagas'

606
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,042
or any other
parasites in his CSF.

607
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,336
So we've ruled out his parents,

608
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,713
prostitutes, the arugula.
Means either...

609
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,131
I took the sample
from the prefrontal.

610
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,217
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

611
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,928
Or you missed a tumor
on the MRI.

612
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,930
Not a chance,
the MRI was clean.

613
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,806
- You mind?
- Where are you going?

614
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,558
To get a $400 butt plug.

615
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,601
What about George?

616
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,103
He's gonna have to
get his own. Come on.

617
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,563
Let's see if we can
get this thing figured out

618
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,440
by the time
we get to the elevator.

619
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,816
It could be MS.

620
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,652
Would explain the coma,
the blindness,

621
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,018
loss of balance, and the fever.

622
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,947
Could also explain
his lack of concern for his health.

623
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,490
MS can cause
excessive cheerfulness.

624
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,116
Yeah, he's a delight.

625
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,327
You don't get to MS
with coma as the first symptom.

626
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,997
Blindness plus coma
says diabetes. Just in time.

627
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,000
No. Blood sugar, urine dip stick
and hemoglobin A1c are normal.

628
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,710
Were normal when you tested.

629
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,836
He's been in and out of a coma,

630
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,564
whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

631
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,507
unlike his pants size,
which only waxes.

632
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,176
Which also points to diabetes.
Test him again.

633
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,679
And this time add
a glucose tolerance test and an HEC.

634
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,389
We already have a CSF sample,

635
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,058
we might as well check it for proteins
to rule out MS first.

636
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,519
Agreed. Except for the part
about doing it first.

637
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,687
Where are you going?

638
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,273
The butt plug was my way of saying,
"Mind your own business."

639
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,441
Apparently too subtle.

640
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,278
George, all it is
is sugar water, I promise.

641
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,030
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic!

642
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,199
You tested me,
everybody's tested me.

643
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,166
Sometimes the blood sugar levels
can fluctuate,

644
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,402
make it difficult to diagnose.

645
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,789
You stuck a needle in my brain
and 10 seconds later I was blind!

646
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,833
How is that difficult
to diagnose?

647
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,252
Who the hell knows
what else you guys done to me?

648
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,087
- I should have never come here!
- You didn't come here,

649
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,048
you were brought here because you were
in a coma and barely alive.

650
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,510
We didn't do that to you,
you need to let us figure out what did.

651
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,848
For someone who insists
he enjoys life as much as you do,

652
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,850
you certainly don't seem willing
to do much to prolong it.

653
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,351
Yeah,

654
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:22,023
because I don't agree with the brilliant
doctors, suddenly I'm suicidal!

655
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,442
Refusing to cooperate with us
does not make you suicidal,

656
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:25,693
it makes you an idiot.

657
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,321
You think
we want to see you blind or in a coma?

658
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,451
I've been fat all my life.

659
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,663
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

660
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,293
You look for a disease
that has nothing to do with my size,

661
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,919
and I will help you.

662
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,050
Otherwise, leave me alone.

663
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:57,350
Speeding, DUI,
reckless driving,

664
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,354
resisting arrest,
possession of a class three narcotic.

665
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
And now it looks like
they've added

666
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:06,359
another possession with intent
to traffic charge as well.

667
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,487
They found some pills
at your house.

668
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,781
All of which
I had a prescription for.

669
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:12,823
That's a lot of pills.

670
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,825
I'm in a lot of pain.

671
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,287
This is all because some cop
came into the clinic,

672
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,207
I was rude to him,
this is his way of getting back at me.

673
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,208
You've made it pretty easy.

674
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:27,129
His insane reaction to a simple
rectal thermometer reading

675
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,841
probably says a lot more
about his mother than it says about me.

676
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,637
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm

677
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,141
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

678
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,018
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

679
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,521
It's your best bet
to make this go away.

680
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,315
There is no this.
There's a him.

681
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,235
The only thing I'm guilty of
is humiliating a bully.

682
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,821
I wasn't speeding,
I wasn't impaired, I didn't resist,

683
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,781
and I certainly was not
distributing narcotics

684
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,907
to anyone but myself,

685
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,159
because I need those narcotics.

686
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,412
Five grand retainer.

687
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,915
If we end up going to trial, there'll
be another 30 due before the first day.

688
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,001
My hourly is 450.
That work for you?

689
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,717
What'd your lawyer say?

690
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,095
I looked up butt plug
in a legal dictionary. What'd he say?

691
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,639
That a smile like mine
can't lose.

692
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,354
What did the tests say?

693
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,436
You were right about MS.
No myelin basic proteins in his CSF.

694
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,812
- What about diabetes?
- Don't know.

695
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,021
He says
we only think it's diabetes

696
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:29,024
because of his weight,
won't let us test him.

697
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,334
So, you would rather be a blind invalid
than admit the fact

698
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,171
that maybe you might have
a little problem with overeating.

699
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,338
By a little problem, of course,

700
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,145
I mean you've eaten yourself
half to death.

701
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,593
And you would rather let me die
than consider the fact

702
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,929
that whatever is wrong with me
has nothing to do with my weight.

703
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,390
I go where the symptoms
tell me to go.

704
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,476
And right now
they're asking why this stuff

705
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,562
is the first thing
you've ever refused to swallow.

706
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,688
I am not diabetic.

707
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,609
Grocery stores giving away medical
degrees with the free turkeys now?

708
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,527
The sooner you drink this,
the sooner I get to go waste my time

709
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,570
with something else.

710
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,322
Get the hell off of me!

711
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,033
No dessert
till you've finished your dinner!

712
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,036
George, just drink it!

713
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,162
Nurse!

714
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,998
Get this jackass off of me!

715
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,708
What the hell is going on?

716
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,155
Just trying to force
a horse to...

717
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,546
Let go!

718
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,694
What's going on?

719
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,615
Get X-rays of his hands.
Then bronc him, do a sputum cytology

720
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,159
and check his CSF
for anti-hu antibodies.

721
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,202
How are we gonna get him
to do all that,

722
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,995
we can't even get him to drink
a bottle of sugar water?

723
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,581
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way connected to obesity.

724
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,000
You don't think
he'll realize we're lying?

725
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,461
You're not. Lung cancer's
got nothing to do with obesity.

726
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,129
I meant about him
having lung cancer.

727
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,465
You didn't notice his fingers?

728
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,675
I noticed they were fat.

729
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,134
You should have pissed him off,

730
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,094
he would have grabbed you.

731
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,262
Then you would have
felt the bones,

732
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,181
they're not just fat,
they're clubbed.

733
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,549
George,

734
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,427
it's me.

735
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,017
Your tests were positive.

736
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,146
You have a small cell
lung carcinoma.

737
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,481
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

738
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,443
which in turn
caused your blindness and coma.

739
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,487
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

740
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,240
It's inoperable,

741
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,118
but there are
radiation treatments available.

742
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,457
They might give you
a few more months.

743
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,046
I never smoked.

744
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,394
C'est la vie.

745
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,724
You were right.

746
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,020
- So was he.
- He said, "C'est la vie."

747
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,605
He's a complicated man.

748
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,856
What about you?

749
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,626
What are you gonna do
about your problem?

750
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,444
Nothing. Just got a call
from my lawyer.

751
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,905
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

752
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,592
Soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

753
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,451
they're gonna drop the possession,
DUI and resisting arrest.

754
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,745
Soon as I pay
my $85 speeding ticket

755
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,472
and the impound fine,
I get my bike back.

756
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,707
I guess that's good.

757
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,709
- You guess?
- No, it's good.

758
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,672
You get to keep going
like you always have.

759
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,385
All right, I give up.
Who was it?

760
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,345
Who in your family
had the weight problem?

761
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,930
You think I can only care
about a patient

762
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,890
if I know someone else
who's been through the same thing?

763
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,308
You care for everybody.

764
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,602
You only lie
and stand up to Cuddy for a few.

765
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,855
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

766
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,523
You're avoiding the question.

767
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,942
I like damaged people,
remember?

768
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,319
It explains everything I do.

769
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,696
Almost everything.

770
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,950
It wasn't you, was it?

771
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,203
- Does it matter?
- Nope, but it'd be interesting.

772
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,371
Sorry to disappoint you,

773
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,624
but sometimes the answers
just aren't that simple.

774
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,631
I know he can be a real ass,

775
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,092
and he has no problem lying
when it serves him,

776
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,802
but he's not lying
about the pain.

777
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,222
He needs the medication,
which is why I prescribed it.

778
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,182
All of it.

779
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,518
Well, I see a lot of cases

780
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,774
where people who have
real injuries end up getting addicted.

781
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:08,322
And then, well, things kind of
spiral out of control.

782
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,241
And lives get ruined,
and not just their own.

783
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,539
I don't know what else
to tell you.

784
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,593
What about these?

785
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,470
This is getting...

786
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,847
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

787
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,516
- You sure?
- Yeah.

788
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,185
Because the signatures on these

789
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,688
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

790
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,323
You look surprised.

791
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,075
No, I'm just...

792
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,705
I hadn't thought about it.
I do sign my name differently sometimes.

793
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,587
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

794
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,798
I just, I guess get bored
signing it the same way.

795
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,759
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

796
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,429
I'm gonna give you a moment

797
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,934
to reconsider that answer.

798
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:23,522
Because if you are,
for some reason, mistaken,

799
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:30,279
we will find out,
and that will not be good for you.

800
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,906
Or Dr. House.

801
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,785
I am sure. Absolutely.

802
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,166
All right.

803
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,170
I guess that's it, then.

804
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:57,975
Thank you for your help.

805
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,683
Okay, no problem.
