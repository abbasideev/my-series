1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,926
Ladies and gentlemen, step around.
Step around. Come on. Gather around.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,755
We'll show you a little way to make
a little easy money today.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,298
You understand what I'm saying?
These are the blacks.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,300
Don't follow the blacks.
You wanna follow the queen. Know why?

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,219
'Cause she's red
and that means she is hot.

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,470
You gotta find the queen.
Find the queen.

7
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,806
The first of the day is free to play.
Who wants to play?

8
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,183
You look interested, my man.
You wanna step on up? Come on now.

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,150
Who wants to play?
Oh, what about you, sweetie?

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,144
- You're cute. Come on up.
- All right.

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,630
Come on here and play.
Cute girls win money. You look lucky.

12
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,856
Now, you look lucky.
Now, follow the queen.

13
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,108
Here we go,
ladies and gentlemen. Follow the queen.

14
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,067
Follow the queen.

15
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,528
Ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this queen is for you!

16
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,988
Which one? Which one?
Which one is it? Which one is it?

17
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,241
- It's right there.
- Right there?

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,953
Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what.

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,359
It takes a woman
to know a woman.

20
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,831
It takes a lady
to find a queen.

21
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,251
There you go...
Wanna double up?

22
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,837
- All right.
- All right, we've got a chancer.

23
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,171
We got a chancer.
We got a chancer.

24
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,423
All right. Here we go.
Here we go.

25
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,949
All you gotta do
is find your queen.

26
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,885
You will not win again.
You will not win again. All right.

27
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,012
Here we go. Here we go.
Find your queen. Find your queen.

28
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,889
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

29
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,224
Can you find her?

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,103
- Right there.
- This one? Oh, my...

31
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,313
She is killing me here.
Taking all my money.

32
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,568
Anybody else wanna get behind
the good-luck girl?

33
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,692
I can do it.

34
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,943
You can do it?
All right. You're next.

35
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,653
Just give me a chance
to recover and get my money back

36
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,405
or else I'm gonna be out here
sleeping on the street.

37
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,698
Here we go. All right? Ready?

38
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,158
This is the last time.
I'm not messing with you no more.

39
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,284
You're taking
all my money, girl.

40
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,452
I'm not messing
with you no more.

41
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,036
Here we go. One more chance.
This is your last chance.

42
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,121
You're gonna follow
the queen, baby.

43
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,414
Follow the queen.
Where's she at? Where's she at?

44
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,458
Just one time.
I'll show you one time and there she is.

45
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,002
Boom. Boom. Boom. Pick a card.

46
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,631
I can't decide.

47
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,508
What do you mean? Just pick a card.
Just make a decision.

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I can't decide.

49
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,428
Come on. Any card will do.
Left? Right? Center?

50
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,888
I don't know.

51
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,556
- Do you want the right?
- I don't know.

52
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,391
- I...
- The left?

53
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,143
- The center?
- I don't know. I...

54
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,394
Move out the way and just
let somebody else play then?

55
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,522
I can't decide. I can't.

56
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,769
You wanna flip a coin for it?

57
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,442
What's wrong with me?

58
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,154
Is she okay?

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,776
Scariest 30 seconds of my life.

60
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,611
I couldn't do anything.

61
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,280
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

62
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,615
It's called abulia.

63
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,868
The inability to
make a decision or exercise will.

64
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,203
Is it going to happen again?

65
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,956
It's part of a TIA.
A transient ischemic attack.

66
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,124
Blood was cut off to a section
of your frontal lobe.

67
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,876
Is it like a stroke
or something?

68
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,919
A little.

69
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,463
What drugs have you
taken recently?

70
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,674
No drugs.

71
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,551
Toxins are another possibility.

72
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,803
You might have been exposed
to something at work, for instance.

73
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,055
No real job right now.

74
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,807
Exposure can build up over time

75
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,433
and lie dormant for a while.

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,894
- What was your last job?
- Pet store.

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,354
Exotic pets?

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,814
Tropical fish.

79
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,815
And before that?

80
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:11,941
Unemployment.

81
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,986
And before that,

82
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
I sold subscriptions
on the phone.

83
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,867
And before that, unemployment.

84
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,121
Before that,
I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

85
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:30,042
Before that, unemployment.
Before that, I walked dogs.

86
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,129
And before that...

87
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,425
Loss of free will. I like it.

88
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,012
Maybe we can get
Thomas Aquinas in for a consult.

89
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,139
What caused the TIA?

90
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,099
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

91
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,512
Could have dissolved.
Most likely came from her heart.

92
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,682
We should do a bubble study.

93
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,051
Clots are unlikely
in a 28-year-old who's not on the pill.

94
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,232
It's probably a vasospasm
caused by drugs.

95
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,943
I don't think so.
She goes from job to job.

96
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,945
Maybe there's some kind
of ADD here.

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,614
Help us pinpoint
where the neurological...

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,408
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

99
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,827
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

100
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,454
then gets fired and gets high.

101
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,539
I still don't think it's drugs.

102
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,999
Did you check for infection?

103
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,417
LP showed nothing. No fever.

104
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,664
White blood count is normal.

105
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,629
Could be toxic exposure.

106
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,796
You're the one always saying
it must be drugs.

107
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,132
You figure she's a minority,
she must be stoned?

108
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,176
- You know that's not what I...
- She seems like a nice girl.

109
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,427
You haven't met her!

110
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,553
She was pregnant at 15,
dropped out of high school.

111
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,889
She's a real overachiever.

112
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,099
Come on. Cut her some slack.
Her baby died of SIDS.

113
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,425
This isn't some romantic story

114
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,102
about a nice girl
scarred by tragedy.

115
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,563
She's a drug-using scam artist
scarred by tragedy.

116
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,232
On the other hand,
the tox screen just came back.

117
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,525
She's clean.

118
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,694
You're wasting my time.
He's wasting...

119
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,952
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson
want money?

120
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,496
I am no longer paying alimony.

121
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,122
She wanted her independence,

122
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,528
so she got her
realtor's license.

123
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,334
Market's doing badly.
She wants money.

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,794
Market's doing badly.

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,295
She's moving into a condo.

126
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
- She wants...
- She wants me to take Hector.

127
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,342
Pool boy?

128
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,052
Dog.

129
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,095
No longer interested.

130
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,347
We got him on our honeymoon.

131
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,516
So I'm like the other parent.

132
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,934
But I can't take him.

133
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,145
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

134
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
I asked Cuddy
to a play Thursday.

135
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,486
Oh, you... Okay.

136
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,363
She said she was busy.

137
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,075
And you didn't believe her,
so you bribed a janitor,

138
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,536
broke into her computer,
checked her appointments...

139
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,413
I asked her as a test.

140
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,540
What would you have learned
if she'd said yes?

141
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,958
A lot about bondage.

142
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,026
She was busy for me
but not for you.

143
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,212
She's not interested
in play qua play.

144
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,922
She's interested in you.

145
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,759
No. I'm not getting sucked into the
vortex of your insanity again.

146
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,045
Don't pass me notes in class.

147
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,493
Don't tell me to
ask her to the prom.

148
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,972
You cannot see her socially.

149
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,140
You're leading her on.

150
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,059
I'll consider that. After I take her
to the Hockney exhibit.

151
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,062
On Thursday.

152
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,898
See, she is busy.
It's not a date.

153
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,944
She enjoyed the play. I enjoyed her
enjoying the play.

154
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,989
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

155
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,243
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity.

156
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,746
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

157
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,755
What's life without the ability
to make stupid choices?

158
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,506
She needs her free will.

159
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,718
Find out why her brain froze before she
can't decide to take her next breath.

160
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,685
You find the toxins.
You run your bubble study.

161
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,085
You won't find anything but
I'll get the office to myself.

162
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,059
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the Internet.

163
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,393
Doesn't download itself.

164
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,440
Eric? Eric!

165
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,816
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

166
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,653
- Dr. Chase. How are you?
- Good.

167
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,072
You're lucky
you caught us, actually...

168
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,281
I'll meet you outside.

169
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,913
Hey, Dad. I've got to go.
Why are you here?

170
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,873
Everything okay?

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,916
Good as ever.

172
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,251
We're staying at a hotel
down the street.

173
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,287
You didn't bring Mom with you?

174
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,714
It's gonna be her
60th birthday in a few days.

175
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,841
I know. We talked
about it on the phone.

176
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,927
You said you couldn't
come home.

177
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,722
You didn't have to come.

178
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,182
You haven't been home
in eight years.

179
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,602
She should see you,

180
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,979
while she still
knows who you are.

181
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,111
Dad. I've talked to her
on the phone.

182
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,490
She only knows
who I am sometimes.

183
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,617
Sometimes

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,662
is important.

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,042
So what's up with your dad?
Didn't know he was gonna be in town?

186
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,001
No.

187
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,132
Building this old, could be
toxic exposure anywhere.

188
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,677
Asbestos, mold, the coloring agents
in the old wallpaper.

189
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,720
Or it could be drugs.

190
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,764
I thought we ruled out...

191
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,144
Clean tox screen means
drugs didn't cause the TIA.

192
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,187
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

193
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,064
Arsenic, rat poison.

194
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,470
The drugs wash out
of her system,

195
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,485
the toxins stick around.

196
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,360
Exposure could come about
any number of ways.

197
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,526
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

198
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,031
Absolutely.
Except for the crack pipe.

199
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,534
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

200
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,744
Yeah. Yeah.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

201
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,081
And your dad asked you out
for dinner?

202
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,752
I'll do the tests.
You're stuck with your family.

203
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,425
You like Hockney?

204
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,759
You heard about that.

205
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,096
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

206
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,849
That's a trick question.

207
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,811
Yes. But you have no idea
how it's a trick.

208
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,772
I like art. I'm open to new things.
What's the problem?

209
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,359
You're going to a gallery to see
Venezuelan pictures that don't exist.

210
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,195
But you won't go
to a play with me. Why?

211
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,489
House, why is my social life
suddenly red hot?

212
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,159
One minute I'm mushing along
with the huskies as usual

213
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,411
and suddenly
it's global warming.

214
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,977
You think you saw somebody else pick up
a toy from the sandbox

215
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,707
and suddenly you want it.

216
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,584
Is that why you said no?

217
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,713
Maybe I just want a friend
and I thought Wilson was a safe choice.

218
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm not safe? Cool.

219
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,846
James Wilson is never
the safe choice.

220
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,307
We're going to a gallery.
We're not getting married.

221
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,017
Sure, you say that now.

222
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,810
He always marries them
in the end.

223
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,867
Is that Eric? Eric!

224
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,035
Oh!

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,664
Oh, baby. Baby!

226
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,377
I wanted to find that picture I took
at your high school graduation.

227
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,753
I had it reframed.

228
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,464
It's in one of these
suitcases, but I don't know...

229
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,924
You can show it to me later.

230
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,100
Your father wants to know
if you've been praying.

231
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,061
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

232
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,855
But I only want to know
if you're happy.

233
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,190
Sure. I'm okay.

234
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,733
You like it here?
You have friends?

235
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,902
Yeah. Everything is great, Mom.

236
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,779
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

237
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,781
I remember when you were little

238
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,993
you liked to look in the back of
the math book because you knew

239
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,953
even though it made
no sense then,

240
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,998
by the end of the year
you'd understand it all.

241
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,667
That's why
you brought the picture?

242
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,504
You wanted to look ahead,
to see how far you'd go.

243
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,924
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might like to look back

244
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,093
to see how far you've come.

245
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,887
It all makes sense now.
Doesn't it?

246
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,770
That isn't mine.

247
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,314
It was in your closet.

248
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,358
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

249
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,820
You might want to let him know
he's got arsenic poisoning.

250
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,197
We should get
a sample of his hair

251
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,657
so we can see the extent of it.

252
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,493
But I don't do...
I don't do drugs.

253
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,716
Get a crash cart in here!
Respiratory arrest!

254
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,931
Are you sure
it isn't from the arsenic?

255
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,267
Dr. Foreman said
I was poisoned.

256
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,394
Your hair showed
only a trace amount.

257
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,896
Not enough to damage
your lungs like this.

258
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,773
We need you to stay still now.

259
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,194
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

260
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,572
Also, I just wanted
to let you know

261
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,158
should you change your mind,
I'll be available.

262
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,037
Aren't you getting tired
of hearing me say it?

263
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,206
I have no intention
of going out with you,

264
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,875
of having sex with you,
of doing anything with you.

265
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:50,834
Except work.

266
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,628
We don't have to make
a big deal about it.

267
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,213
I just thought
I'd let you know.

268
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,466
I decided Tuesdays would be
a good day to do that.

269
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,594
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

270
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,347
You were looking for something
and I happened to be standing...

271
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,057
Cameron, it's fine.

272
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,185
No need to go on about it.

273
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,898
Advancing through
the lung bases.

274
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,893
We need to put this behind us.

275
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,901
Understood.

276
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,987
- But you keep bringing it up.
- You're the one who's still talking.

277
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,907
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

278
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,285
I'm not following you home.
I've got no expectations.

279
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,747
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week is hardly stalking.

280
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,880
There's a mass.
Just outside the lingula.

281
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,177
Biopsy shows
there are white blood cells

282
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,637
in the walls
of the blood vessels.

283
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,973
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

284
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,975
Got to be autoimmune,
something lymphocytic.

285
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,028
White blood cells
are attacking her own body.

286
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,062
Only question is,
what kind of autoimmune?

287
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,021
Doesn't matter what kind.

288
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,565
It always matters what kind.

289
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:55,983
Treatment's always steroids.

290
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,693
Treatment is always boring.

291
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,944
- Diagnosis...
- Okay.

292
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,631
It's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

293
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,449
Gotta be giant cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

294
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,200
It's affecting
the smaller blood vessels.

295
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,535
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

296
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,995
I'll start her on steroids.

297
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,372
- It's affecting...
- Yeah. Got it.

298
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,832
Start her on steroids.

299
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,791
Good idea.

300
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,753
Told you. That was boring.

301
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,047
- I gotta go out.
- Why?

302
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,883
Wilson's got a date.

303
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,011
It's got 15-foot ceilings.

304
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,888
It's got an open floor plan.

305
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,433
You know, I can't believe
you called me.

306
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,477
Hey. I need a condo.

307
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,814
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

308
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,610
Wow! You remember
where our first date was?

309
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,670
I didn't think
you were paying attention.

310
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,031
Really? He's my best friend.

311
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,158
Our first date was in Boston.

312
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,409
Oh.

313
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,828
Not quite as close
to here as I remember.

314
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,580
But we're not here
to talk about him.

315
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,873
Absolutely not.

316
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,283
Wait till you see the kitchen.

317
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,629
All-granite countertops.

318
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,798
Since I wasn't paying
attention back then,

319
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,046
what was it like dating him?

320
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,012
- So this is Hockney?
- No.

321
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,306
I don't know what happened.

322
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,433
I'm sure you don't.

323
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,605
I never knew your tastes
were so eclectic.

324
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,691
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

325
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,151
I thought it was May 20th.

326
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,070
Okay. My bad.

327
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,823
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

328
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,702
Not that this is a date.
Obviously.

329
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,581
I was just thinking...

330
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,209
He's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now.

331
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,964
And they're kind of peaceful
and you're always so busy...

332
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,549
Wow.

333
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,511
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

334
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,013
Oh, it was never a date.

335
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,099
I was coming off
a bad relationship

336
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,309
and he said we could
go out as friends.

337
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,479
You know, just go see plays,
go to a museum.

338
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,386
I didn't think
you liked Trenton.

339
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:00,816
Love it.

340
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,403
So he'd say it's not a date
but then he'd jump you.

341
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,654
Oh, no. He meant it.

342
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,198
James Wilson,
carefully calibrating

343
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,744
his level of protectiveness
for your individual needs.

344
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,997
Did you just compare
Wilson to a tampon?

345
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,039
No.

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,294
It was very endearing.
He really just wanted to be a friend.

347
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,212
So I jumped him.

348
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,799
The bedroom's through here.

349
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,177
That's such a bad idea.

350
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,306
There's no way that won't cause damage
to the large intestine.

351
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,975
Are you keeping us here
to torture me?

352
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,690
- Is that a bicycle pump?
- That's what I'm saying.

353
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,984
It's like walking
into a sticky trap.

354
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,738
And once you're the focus
of all that attention, it's addictive.

355
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,616
This unit's kitchen's
got a chef's oven.

356
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,200
I cook a lot. Go on.

357
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,495
But it's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

358
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,583
He's just so knight-in-shining-armor,
you know?

359
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,670
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

360
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,422
But by then you're hooked.

361
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:11,011
Hey, do you think that you could talk
to him about taking the dog?

362
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,222
He's the only one
that Hector really gets along with.

363
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,434
Hey, we're here to talk
real estate, not Wilson.

364
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,439
So you're saying
if you'd actually had sex

365
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,525
before you connected emotionally,
you'd have gotten over him.

366
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,153
Oh, yeah. Seems weird, right?

367
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,824
'Cause sex with James
is fantastic.

368
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,203
Nobody works harder
to give a woman what she wants.

369
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,247
It's got six burners.

370
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
The chef's oven.

371
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,335
Right.

372
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,303
How you feeling?

373
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,888
That wasn't my crack pipe.

374
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,765
You told me. Are you tired?

375
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,476
I just took a hit off it
a couple of times.

376
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,562
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

377
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,648
Your personal life
is none of my business.

378
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,890
You don't like me though,
do you?

379
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,654
That's your imagination.

380
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,197
I've seen every kind
of drug abuse.

381
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,991
No offense, but you don't even stand out
of the pack.

382
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,537
I'm betting you got money
in the same place you got attitude.

383
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,207
You know, people who quit drinking
and people who lose weight.

384
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,918
They think they're better
than the people that couldn't

385
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,003
and because you got
out of the projects,

386
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,881
you think that
anybody who didn't

387
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,634
is weak and stupid.

388
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,262
I'm not judging you.
Now take a breath.

389
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,264
The only difference
between me and you

390
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,433
is that I made
some bad decisions

391
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,809
and you made some good ones.

392
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,520
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

393
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,772
Stop doing drugs.
Stop having fun.

394
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,607
Go back to school
and get your GED.

395
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,609
Yeah, where's the money
coming from?

396
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,320
The system's not set up
for people like me.

397
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,198
What are you staring at?

398
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,324
Your eyes.

399
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,871
There's yellow in the sclera.

400
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,457
Her liver's failing.

401
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,989
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead in the next 48 hours.

402
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,919
We should increase her
immunosuppressants

403
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,205
and target more specifically.

404
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,130
Add methotrexate.

405
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,381
Yeah, let's do more
of what's not working.

406
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,300
This isn't an
autoimmune disease.

407
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,186
Her white blood cells
are attacking her body.

408
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,261
That's autoimmune.

409
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,138
First brain,
then lungs, now liver.

410
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,182
All getting worse
and all in two days.

411
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,850
It's moving too fast.

412
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,562
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

413
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,857
It's rare even by our standards
but it fits her symptoms.

414
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,651
Explains why the steroids aren't
working, poor fingernail growth.

415
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,069
A lot of people
have bad fingernails.

416
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,655
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems shutting down.

417
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,824
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

418
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,284
She needs total body radiation.

419
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,172
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

420
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
Running those
immunochemistries could take a week.

421
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,206
She'll be dead by the time...

422
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,041
That doesn't make
radiation any safer.

423
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,209
Okay.

424
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,252
Suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

425
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,338
Suppose it's an
autoimmune disease.

426
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,090
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

427
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,801
It suppresses
the immune system,

428
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,762
which is what we're trying to do
with the steroids anyway.

429
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,431
I don't usually
put out on my first date

430
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,934
but I gotta say
that is a rad move.

431
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,937
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

432
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,441
The patient's
not too thrilled with me.

433
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,109
I'll get her consent.

434
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,821
Foreman's got
personality issues,

435
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,739
so you're gonna step in?

436
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,951
Patient doesn't like Foreman.
I'm interested.

437
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,960
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of
damage to the lungs, infertility.

438
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,839
All possible side effects
of radiation.

439
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,050
Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?

440
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,054
He thinks he's better
than he is.

441
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,639
How good is he?

442
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,974
I don't know.

443
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,976
Can we get back
to what's wrong with me?

444
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,604
There's a small possibility of leukemia
at some time in the future.

445
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,565
Hardly worth mentioning.

446
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,984
You can't say he thinks
he's better than he is

447
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,735
if you don't know
how good he is.

448
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,030
No one's as good
as he thinks he is.

449
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,490
I am.

450
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,158
You might also get cataracts.

451
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,202
Sign here.

452
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,496
I don't know.

453
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,623
You're telling me
how dangerous this is.

454
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
We're saving your life.

455
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,587
We're that good. Sign there.

456
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,965
I can't decide.

457
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,762
Would you rather
a pencil or a pen?

458
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,060
Who's the better James Bond,
Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?

459
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,565
You see?
That's not even a decision.

460
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,859
It's happening again.

461
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,487
I can't. I can't.

462
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,347
Up her blood thinners
and get her down to Radiology.

463
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,349
The attack will be over
in 20 minutes.

464
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,059
Then she'll wanna sign this.

465
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,489
Bonnie called last night
to talk about the dog.

466
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,658
Your name came up.

467
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,534
Good Lord!

468
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,036
How do you still have teeth?

469
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,872
She's the worst realtor
in New Jersey.

470
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,999
What is this? Escalation?

471
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,835
I go out with Cuddy,
you hook up with my ex?

472
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,963
I don't even know what
that's designed to do.

473
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,047
You're an addict.

474
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,716
I'm saving you from yourself.

475
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,094
By condo shopping? Thank you.

476
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,137
If I can figure out
where you keep going wrong,

477
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,903
then I can nip this
Cuddy thing in the bud

478
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,558
before she becomes
the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.

479
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,062
Yes. I was worried there was
no way to stop that train.

480
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,939
You have to have sex
with Cuddy.

481
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,652
Wait. To stop the train?

482
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,032
Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?

483
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,325
Huh?

484
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,412
Yeah. She also said

485
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,831
that if she'd slept with you
before she liked you

486
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:13,915
then it would've made it
easier to handle

487
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,002
when you turned into the sorry bastard
who left her alone.

488
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,050
I told her you were
wasting her time, by the way.

489
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,219
You think that's
gonna stop her?

490
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,680
The woman's the worst
realtor in New Jersey.

491
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
How do you feel?

492
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,143
Weak.

493
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,227
Sleeping a lot.

494
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,603
That's normal after radiation.

495
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,063
Deep breath.

496
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,483
A little queasy, too.

497
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,569
When I feel sick to my stomach

498
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,822
I always want
vanilla ice cream. It's soothing.

499
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,759
It's best to stick
with liquids for now.

500
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,745
I'm getting a murmur.

501
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,999
Oh, my arm! It's hurting me!

502
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,168
Take it off! Take it off!

503
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,881
Oh, my God!

504
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,391
Pain is the issue.

505
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,727
Just the pressure
of the BP cuff

506
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,228
was enough
to start her screaming.

507
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,813
That's not cancer.

508
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,732
It sounds like...

509
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,444
Sounds like she's septic.

510
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,200
A lot of things can cause pain.

511
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,993
How much pain?

512
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,995
Too much.

513
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,543
It's not cancer.
It's not autoimmune.

514
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,172
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

515
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,800
But she had no fever.
Her LP was clear.

516
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,720
Do an echo.
Confirm it's in the heart.

517
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:57,060
And then I'll tell our patient
that we just killed her.

518
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,939
I'll tell her.

519
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,284
Hi. You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

520
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,453
I'm busy.

521
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,956
Well, but if you
have half an hour

522
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,082
a little later this afternoon,

523
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,043
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

524
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,503
It hasn't been
on the market yet.

525
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,255
I'm off the market for condos.

526
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,549
James was right?

527
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,678
I never had the teeniest chance
of selling you anything?

528
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,767
Of course he was right.

529
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,766
Wilson doesn't stop giving good advice
just 'cause you're divorced.

530
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,520
He's compulsive about remaining
on good terms with his exes.

531
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,320
Do you wanna know why
I named that dog Hector?

532
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,613
No. Let's keep it a mystery.

533
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,866
Because even when
he was a puppy,

534
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,118
he was the worst-tempered dog
we'd ever seen.

535
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,828
He was supposed
to be house-trained.

536
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,372
He'd pee on the carpet
every morning.

537
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,584
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

538
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,005
"Hector does go rug" is an anagram
for "Doctor Greg House".

539
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,011
That's how early in the marriage
I resented you.

540
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,968
Wow. Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

541
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,595
James at least had the decency

542
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,961
to feel guilty when he hurt me.

543
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,764
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

544
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,018
I didn't even marry you, cleverly
hoping to avoid moments like this one.

545
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,271
You always needed him and
he was always there for you.

546
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,106
If you keep yelling,
I'll think you'll owe me sex.

547
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,433
You knew he had a wife waiting at home.
You didn't care.

548
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,043
Now, I'm not saying you broke up the
marriage, but you didn't help.

549
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,537
First, "Hector does go rug"
is a lame anagram.

550
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,041
You want a better one for Gregory House?
"Huge ego. Sorry."

551
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,834
Second, find a new career.

552
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,285
You're never gonna sell anybody

553
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,670
if you let them
control the agenda.

554
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,196
And third,
I don't owe you anything.

555
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,258
I'm not Wilson. I'm not gonna buy a
condo just to make you feel better.

556
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,102
You okay?

557
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,229
Yeah.

558
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,773
Tell me how to do this.

559
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,733
House says
people thank you after.

560
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,068
It's not typical.

561
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,405
I already killed this woman.

562
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,909
All I can do now
is not make any more mistakes.

563
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,209
First of all, stop thinking
you can minimize the hurt.

564
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,753
A lot of people are afraid
of the word "dying."

565
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,631
If you pussyfoot around it,
she's not going to read your mind.

566
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,383
- Okay.
- No, it's not.

567
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,968
When you look in her face,

568
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,971
you're gonna feel
the instinct to temporize.

569
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,013
Crush it.

570
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,515
Yeah.

571
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,225
Then wait.

572
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,019
Give her time
to process the news.

573
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,023
Let her know you'll be with her
through all of it.

574
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,401
Wait till she's done thinking,

575
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,777
till she meets your eyes again.

576
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,239
Then if you feel it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

577
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,825
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

578
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,787
Let her know she's still connected
to another human being.

579
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,206
You've got this down
to a science.

580
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,293
You're freaking out.

581
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,086
- I told you...
- Give her what she needs.

582
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,244
What she doesn't need
is a doctor who's not there with her

583
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,425
because he made the wrong call.

584
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,678
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

585
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,180
I won't let her see it.

586
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,267
Let her see it.

587
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,693
Hey.

588
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,321
How come no mask?

589
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,782
We think...

590
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,453
You have an infection.

591
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,997
Didn't the radiation work?

592
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,833
It did what it was
supposed to do.

593
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,921
You're dying.

594
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,885
What do you mean? Like things are bad
and that someday I'm gonna...

595
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:05,975
How much time?

596
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,060
We can't know exactly.

597
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,436
A year?

598
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,606
Less than a year?

599
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,608
Less than 24 hours.

600
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,235
I don't understand.

601
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,905
Why are you saying this to me?
You're trying to scare me?

602
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,365
Why would you do that?

603
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,616
I'm sorry.

604
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,909
It's true.

605
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:27,497
How bad is this cancer?
Yesterday you thought I had a chance.

606
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,499
You don't have cancer.

607
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,835
You came in with an infection.

608
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,631
- We didn't catch it.
- What kind of infection?

609
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,590
Doesn't matter.

610
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,345
Radiation was the worst thing
we could have done.

611
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,848
We destroyed the part of your body
that was fighting it off.

612
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,892
It's spread to your heart.

613
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,894
Then give me drugs.

614
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,270
They have drugs for infections.

615
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,773
Antibiotics work
with the immune system,

616
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,901
but your immune system
is nonexistent because of the radiation.

617
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,488
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

618
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,824
People have heart transplants
all the time!

619
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,200
It wouldn't help.

620
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,413
The infection's everywhere.

621
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,544
There's nothing anybody can do.

622
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,597
I'm so sorry.

623
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,605
We'll call your grandparents.

624
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,944
Get the hell away from me!
Get out!

625
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,154
Get out!

626
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,321
I think it's broken.

627
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,532
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

628
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,778
We were wrong, too.
Steroids wouldn't have helped her.

629
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,996
I didn't not help her.
I actually pulled the trigger.

630
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,373
There's nothing left
for you to do.

631
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,458
One of us could go home with...

632
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,126
You're trying to
make me feel better?

633
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,170
- Yeah.
- I killed a woman.

634
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,536
Don't you think
it's appropriate

635
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,216
I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

636
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,301
It won't help her.

637
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,805
Where is he?

638
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,182
He went to the ICU.

639
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,148
What are you doing?

640
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,816
Prepping for an aspiration.

641
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,151
We still don't know
what infection...

642
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,110
It's not gonna help her.

643
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,487
It's not gonna hurt her.

644
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,947
Well, it is gonna hurt her
but it's not gonna...

645
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,114
No.

646
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,783
This'll just take
a few minutes.

647
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,867
I'll grab a piece
of an abscess,

648
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,536
- some pus...
- You really don't care.

649
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,463
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

650
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,822
She's gonna be dead because...

651
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,915
What?

652
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,753
What did we screw up?
What did we miss?

653
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,881
I need to know.

654
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,133
You'll have to wait.

655
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,186
We're moving her back
to her room.

656
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,439
Patients who've had total body radiation
have to stay in ICU.

657
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,149
ICU isn't going to help her.

658
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,397
Let's give her some privacy.

659
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,873
What do you want?

660
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,501
Want to see
if I'm dying on schedule?

661
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,090
Or do you want me
to tell you it's all right,

662
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,341
I'm okay with it?

663
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,554
I'd like your forgiveness.
I don't expect it.

664
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,140
Good.

665
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,060
'Cause this isn't like you ran your cart
into mine at the supermarket.

666
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,187
No.

667
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,982
Your grandparents
haven't arrived yet.

668
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,152
If they don't make it on time,

669
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,113
is there anything
you'd like me to tell them?

670
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,489
I never really knew them.

671
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,161
You got any friends
you want me to call?

672
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,955
It's the middle of the night.

673
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,334
They're not the kind of friends you ask
to help you move,

674
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,919
never mind watch you die.

675
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,507
I never did much.

676
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,886
No kid to leave behind.

677
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,515
When I go, the world's
not gonna be any different.

678
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,771
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

679
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,522
You were right about me.

680
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,941
Yeah? Which time?

681
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,989
I had a problem with you.

682
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,869
But you were wrong, too.

683
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,248
I've made some bad decisions.

684
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,460
Stole cars. Robbed houses.

685
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,587
Killed a woman.

686
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,844
But then I got another chance.

687
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:20,266
Left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

688
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,895
And there's some part of me
I can't get rid of, always thinks,

689
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:31,318
if I'm not the smartest,
if I'm not the first, everywhere I go

690
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,197
they'll figure out
I'm not supposed to be here.

691
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,492
They'll send me back.

692
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,412
You know that's
not gonna happen.

693
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,997
You're out.

694
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,582
I'll never be out of there.

695
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,881
When I came home that last Christmas
I was in college,

696
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,426
it was like the rooms

697
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,971
felt so small.

698
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,432
It was suffocating.

699
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,603
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying goodbye,

700
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,939
my mom put her arms around me.

701
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,487
That was...

702
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,573
That was the last time
I ever felt at home.

703
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,874
I only put distance

704
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,545
between you and me because I know
there isn't any.

705
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,966
You were right about me, too.

706
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:44,058
That stuff about the system being
against people like me...

707
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,602
I know it's crap.

708
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,523
I mean, it's true
but it's also crap.

709
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,528
I just wasn't ready
to try again.

710
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,782
But I always thought
I was young.

711
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,952
I had time.

712
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,177
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

713
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,680
No.

714
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,551
- Yeah?
- Time of death, 3:35.

715
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,177
Do whatever you want.

716
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,209
You wanna go and get drunk?

717
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,461
No, thanks.

718
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,546
I've got paperwork.

719
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,761
Listen, I don't...

720
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,805
I don't know what I believe
but sometimes I need to think

721
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,933
there's something out there
paying attention.

722
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,602
So when I can't
talk to anybody,

723
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,648
I talk to God and pretend
somebody's listening.

724
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,985
We were all wrong. You know?

725
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,237
Even House was wrong.

726
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,783
I know.

727
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,164
I got your consent.

728
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,335
Her bra hook.

729
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,587
What?

730
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,090
She scratched herself
with her bra hook.

731
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,178
That's how
the infection got in.

732
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,896
Staph aureus.

733
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,276
She died from a simple
staph infection?

734
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,196
That and some bad decisions.

735
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,831
I'll be outside.

736
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,932
Go home. Have a few drinks.
Go to sleep.

737
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,311
Get up tomorrow.
And do it all over.

738
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,270
Only better.

739
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,567
If you need absolution,
go to a priest

740
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,779
or give alms to the poor.

741
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,615
Whatever ritual comforts you.

742
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,700
I killed her.

743
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,244
Yeah. Me, too.

744
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,707
This wasn't, "Oh, I should've thought
of that idea sooner."

745
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,835
This wasn't messing up
a dosage!

746
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,713
We see a disease rushing down
on someone like a train,

747
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,840
we can't always get them
out of the way!

748
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,761
But this wasn't that.

749
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,013
No.

750
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,933
And you'll do it again.

751
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,147
For a lot of doctors,

752
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,151
this would be
a once-in-a-lifetime mistake.

753
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,154
But we're not a lot of doctors.

754
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,033
And we'll save more patients
than the guy down the street

755
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,827
but a few of the ones
that he'd save

756
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,705
by doing what
everyone else does, we will lose.

757
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,999
So you're giving me numbers.

758
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,168
Because they don't lie.

759
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,172
I can't forgive you, Foreman.

760
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,592
Because there's
nothing to forgive.

761
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,738
What did you tell him?

762
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,615
That guilt is irrelevant.

763
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,784
You wanna get something to eat?

764
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,494
Can't.

765
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,079
Got a dog waiting at home.

766
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,012
What's wrong?

767
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,975
I did something bad, Mom.

768
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,604
I hurt somebody.

769
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,689
It wasn't your fault.

770
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,359
It was.

771
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,279
Then I forgive you.

772
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,947
I forgive you.

773
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,539
I can see from your face

774
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,586
you'd never hurt anybody
on purpose.

775
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,970
Do you know who I am, Mom?

776
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,308
It's Eric.

777
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,312
Of course.

778
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,276
My little boy's name is Eric.
