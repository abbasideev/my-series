1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,330
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,833
And a happy go to hell.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,877
What's he doing here?
Is he with you?

4
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,339
Detective Tritter and I...

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,300
We worked out a deal.

6
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,803
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,642
I told him I didn't write
those prescriptions.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,936
I spoke with the DA.

9
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:06,816
He agreed to two months in a rehab
facility in exchange for a guilty plea.

10
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,361
Get out of my office.

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,446
No jail time.

12
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,990
Right. So I should get
locked up in some place I don't belong

13
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,451
in order to avoid getting locked up
in some other place I don't belong.

14
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,370
I got you on forgery,
fraud, enough drugs to...

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,955
No sanctions
to the medical board.

16
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,415
And you get your car back

17
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,126
and your bank accounts
and your precious tumor-ridden patients.

18
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,086
I did this to help you.

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,713
Next Christmas,
buy me a sweater.

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,339
You punched out an employee!

21
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,009
You nearly cut a little girl in half
because you were too strung out...

22
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,427
I was in pain!

23
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,988
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

24
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,103
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,481
- But you just selfishly...
- Knock it off.

26
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,692
Look, I don't care why
Dr. Wilson is doing this.

27
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,237
And right now,
it makes no difference to you, either,

28
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,949
'cause you need to deal with
the reality of your current situation.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,161
You want to stand on principle,
you end up in a cell.

30
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,164
And you end up
never practicing medicine again.

31
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,336
So you got two choices,
your principles or your life.

32
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,971
Get out of my office.

33
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,979
The DA put a clock on the deal.

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,273
You got three days to decide.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,070
House! Just give me a minute.
You're afraid of the pain.

36
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,238
You're not?

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,157
You can still have
pain meds in rehab.

38
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,410
- Tramadol, gabapentin.
- Those don't work.

39
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,537
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

40
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,665
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,417
Fine, run to Cuddy.

42
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,670
You don't think
she's going to support me on this?

43
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,679
Well, the stitches are healing nicely,
there's no sign of infection.

44
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:42,972
Whoa.

45
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,309
Sorry.

46
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,437
Just need her
for a tiny moment.

47
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,522
Small favor.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,941
Pills.

49
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,276
Who's the wit?

50
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,821
Doctor. Don't worry,
I'll be firing him soon.

51
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,656
Wait in my office.

52
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,868
Incision looks just big enough
for a chest tube.

53
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,204
Collapsed lung?
Someone mistake you for a piñata?

54
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,208
Delightful. Usually we just get
the elf jokes this time of year.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,544
No on trauma.

56
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,713
Negative PPD.

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,007
What flavor dwarfs
are you guys?

58
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,510
My daughter and I both have
cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

59
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,137
Think you can make
a pun out of that?

60
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,015
Yes. But I don't
want to be insensitive.

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,518
She's got a bit
of a short fuse, doesn't she?

62
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,395
It's a bleb. Wait in my office.

63
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,481
Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion.

64
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,858
We'll schedule
an MRI to make sure,

65
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,611
but a certain number of these cases
are idiopathic.

66
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,155
Let me translate that
into Tolkien for you guys.

67
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,782
It means Dr. Cuddy's
got no idea

68
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,451
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped like a balloon.

69
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,078
You think you do?

70
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,707
Gimme her chart. And my pills.

71
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,212
Santa needs us.

72
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,717
Did you get that looked at?

73
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,427
I'm fine.

74
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,765
Great. I just admitted
a cartilage-hair hypoplasia dwarf.

75
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,351
- Fifteen years old...
- What are you going to do?

76
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,355
I thought I'd get your theories, mock
them, then embrace my own. The usual.

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,440
Wilson told us he ratted.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,567
Your choice of verb, I take it?

79
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,489
It's appropriate. He betrayed you.
And you should take the deal.

80
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,035
Unexplained lung collapse and anemia.
Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic.

81
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,122
"Cuddy" and "idiop" being
the relevant parts of that sentence.

82
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,582
Well, I'd say TB,
but Cuddy's already ruled it out.

83
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,584
Then you'd be just as big
an idiop as her.

84
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,877
Don't you people know
your dwarfs?

85
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,213
There are over 200 varieties
of dwarfism,

86
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,979
each with different
medical complications.

87
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,592
You can't expect us to be intimately
familiar with all of them?

88
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,511
The sick dwarfs
sure expect you to.

89
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,181
Cartilage-hair hypoplasia.
They have compromised immune systems.

90
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,142
Gold star for Cameron.

91
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,020
For extra credit, explain to
the special needs section of the class

92
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,397
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

93
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,066
A PPD involves planting a fragment of TB
under the skin

94
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,832
to see if the immune system
recognizes it.

95
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,820
Because of
a compromised immune system,

96
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,947
our patient could have TB
but not recognize it.

97
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,283
The little people love you.

98
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

99
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,124
Gallium
is a radioactive isotope.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,292
It travels through your veins,

101
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,670
allowing us to see any bright spots
that might indicate infection.

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,842
I'm 4'1".
That's 1.5 canes in metric.

103
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,512
You don't look
a day over four feet.

104
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,099
I saw in the file that her dad
was normal-sized.

105
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,559
It's average-sized.

106
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,062
Compared to you,
I'm sure it was huge.

107
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,563
So did he have a fetish,

108
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,524
or did he just fall in love
with your long-legged soul?

109
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,944
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

110
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,447
Seems like you're the one
with the fetish.

111
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,241
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

112
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,576
Did you stand on a table?

113
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,619
House!

114
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,873
Pretty much,
he'd lay flat and spin me.

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,916
Mom.

116
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,337
So, Abigail, you want to
hop up on the table for me?

117
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,423
That's going to be tough.

118
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,676
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me give you a boost.

119
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,804
Stop treating her
like she's five.

120
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,010
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

121
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,599
Mom, it's okay.

122
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,102
I was just trying
to be helpful.

123
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,438
She also hates Jews.

124
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,565
I've dealt with worse.

125
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,401
Being different,
you get used to people's idiocy.

126
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,113
Still beats the hell out of
actually being an idiot.

127
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,699
What?

128
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,619
Care to go for a spin?

129
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,793
What the hell
were you thinking?

130
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,462
You didn't think ratting out
this hospital's best doctor

131
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,506
merited checking
with your boss first?

132
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,675
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

133
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,843
Which he'll never take.

134
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,637
- He will if we...
- How long have you known House?

135
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,430
Did you think
he'd suddenly become reasonable?

136
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,683
I made the deal. It's done.
You can either keep yelling at me,

137
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,569
or you can help me avoid
a complete disaster.

138
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,187
It already is going to be
a complete disaster!

139
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,065
He's not going to take the deal.
He's going to go to jail.

140
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,317
Because he's a child,
he's too stubborn.

141
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,778
When a child misbehaves,
what do you do?

142
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,697
You take away something
he loves.

143
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,198
We can't take away his Vicodin.

144
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,118
Not only will he be in pain,
he'll start to detox.

145
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,044
And we tell him the only way to get
the pills back is to take the deal.

146
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,330
He won't be able to function.

147
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,498
That's the point.

148
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,876
You going to explain that
to his patient?

149
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,504
What choice do we have?

150
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,554
Gallium scan shows
no bright spots of any kind.

151
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,514
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,642
There are no bright spots
'cause the whole thing's too bright.

153
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,436
Except for the liver.

154
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,480
The tech over-exposed
the image a bit, but it's nothing.

155
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,773
The liver looks fine.

156
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,609
Could be lung cancer.

157
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,528
Tumor causes structural damage.
The lung caves in on itself.

158
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,863
Also explains the anemia.

159
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,656
Doesn't explain
the liver problem, though.

160
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,034
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

161
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,702
Did you guys look at the liver
on this thing?

162
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,953
There's no liver problem.

163
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,538
Seriously, look at the liver.

164
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,623
There's nothing there.

165
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,624
Why not?

166
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,791
Because there's nothing wrong?

167
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,420
Every organ in this scan
is lit up like a hundred-watt bulb.

168
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,798
Except for her liver,
which is hovering around 60 watts.

169
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,593
And not one of them good 60-watters,
but an energy saving...

170
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,400
You're saying her liver's shutting down
because the lighting is off?

171
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,181
You just don't want
a cancer diagnosis,

172
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,766
because then you'd have
to deal with Wilson.

173
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,060
Lung cancer
is a lame diagnosis.

174
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,520
Avoiding Wilson
is an added bonus.

175
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,272
House, we need to talk.

176
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,983
Not taking the deal.
Glad we talked.

177
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,277
Ultrasound her liver.

178
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,737
Sit down.

179
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,405
Stand up.

180
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,865
Your turn.

181
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,700
House, you're off the case.

182
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,577
Your treatment privileges
are suspended

183
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,037
until you accept
Tritter's deal.

184
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,538
Well, I'm obviously
not going to take the deal

185
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,832
just so I can have the fun
of treating a dwarf.

186
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,585
So, I assume
there's more to this threat.

187
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,338
- I'm also cutting off your Vicodin.
- That could work.

188
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,007
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

189
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,467
This is not lung cancer.

190
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,637
We'll find out as soon as
we MRI her lungs.

191
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,396
You're going to come begging me
to save this girl

192
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,649
long before I come
begging you for pills.

193
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,984
I hope not.

194
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,111
For everyone's sake.

195
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,954
This is wrong.

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,374
Cutting House off?
It might not work, but it's not wrong.

197
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,418
Bone windows look clean.

198
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,839
Abigail, we need you
to hold still, okay?

199
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,590
Can I come out?

200
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,592
Just hang in there two more minutes,
and we'll be done.

201
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay.

202
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,646
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

203
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,641
Cuddy's bending the rules
to get a patient to do the right thing.

204
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,436
- Who would work for a doctor like that?
- And the ends justify the means?

205
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,397
If the ends involve
us keeping our jobs, sure.

206
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,110
Lung parenchyma's clean.
No masses, it's not lung cancer.

207
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,905
Abigail, you okay?

208
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,790
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

209
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,127
Endoscopy confirmed the vomiting
was caused by variceal bleeding.

210
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,963
Blood work also confirms
House's hypothesis.

211
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,258
I get it. House was right,
it's the liver. Let's move on.

212
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,053
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

213
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,929
Schistosomiasis,
the parasite could have...

214
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,514
There's no eosinophilia.

215
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,809
- Cirrhosis could explain...
- Could be a hepatoma.

216
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,438
She's 15.
It's not liver cancer.

217
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,106
It's not unheard of.

218
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,484
Cirrhosis fits better.
The question is, what caused it?

219
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,071
- Could be hepatitis, Budd-Chiari...
- Or drugs and alcohol.

220
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,865
If anyone has reason to dull the pain,
it's a teenage dwarf.

221
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,312
I'll do a liver biopsy
to confirm.

222
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:45,079
And I'll search the patient's home
for drugs and alcohol.

223
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,707
Cameron, got a moment?

224
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,175
What exactly
is your problem with me?

225
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,220
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

226
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,138
So this is all about the case?

227
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,182
What else would it be about?

228
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,229
I made this deal to help him.

229
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,439
And helped yourself
at the same time.

230
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,275
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

231
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,445
I gave both of them up to help House
and I would have gone on without them,

232
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,692
if he hadn't almost maimed that little
girl and if he hadn't punched out Chase.

233
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,575
Was it an easy choice?

234
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,953
Of course not. But it's right.

235
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,955
Then why wasn't it easy?

236
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,957
Because he's my friend.

237
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,460
- It's obviously complicated...
- It's complicated?

238
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,256
When you decided to talk to Tritter,
your life got a million times better.

239
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,633
How do you separate that out?

240
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,178
How do you pretend your windfall
isn't relevant to this decision?

241
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,767
It was the right thing to do.

242
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,188
You pretending your motives are pure
is why I have a problem.

243
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,910
Where's Cuddy?

244
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,455
In this drawer. It's a rescue mission.

245
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,832
I've got it under control,
you can leave.

246
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,586
You were right
about the liver failure,

247
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,393
the patient had variceal bleeding,
which suggested cirrhosis, but...

248
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,923
Off the clock.

249
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,929
You predicted this.
You obviously saw something.

250
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,260
Obviously.

251
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:28,348
Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis
but it showed sclerosing cholangitis.

252
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,602
Even weirder, there's no increase
in alkaline phosphatase.

253
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,980
Medical mystery. Sounds like
the kind of thing I'd be good at.

254
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,403
Breaking and entering sounds like
the kind of thing you'd be good at.

255
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,989
I take it that's where
Cuddy's been keeping your pills.

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,284
One theory, one drawer.

257
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,291
Really?

258
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,002
I thought you'd be all for
this "torture House" plan.

259
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,504
It works, therefore it's good.

260
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,464
On the other hand, I don't want
to talk you out of this deal

261
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,830
by pointing out your hypocrisy.

262
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,427
So, patient's life at stake,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

263
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,181
Forget about the specific nature of
the liver dysfunction, it's irrelevant.

264
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,226
The dwarf's problem is global,
that's why the gallium scan was bright.

265
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,937
And it's going to spread throughout
her entire body unless you stop it.

266
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,232
If that were true, more than
her lungs and liver would be affected.

267
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,483
It will be.

268
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,153
It'll spread through the biliary tree
and hit her pancreas next.

269
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,155
Stop retracing your steps,
get ahead of it.

270
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,784
Forget the liver and focus
on the pancreas because after that...

271
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,494
Actually, after that
it doesn't really matter what it hits

272
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,122
because, pretty much,
all roads lead to a dead dwarf.

273
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,043
I get why you
don't want to go to rehab.

274
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,046
But only an idiot goes to prison
for being stubborn.

275
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,259
Only an idiot stands between
Ahab and his whale. Move.

276
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,688
Sorry.

277
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,322
Santa's got gifts.

278
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,034
Olive oil wasn't in the kitchen,
it was in the medicine cabinet.

279
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,400
Home remedy for ear infections.

280
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,830
Ear infections are fairly typical
among CHH dwarfs.

281
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,582
Or, it's a symptom.

282
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,709
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

283
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,919
Or House is wrong
and it's a symptom.

284
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,048
Laxatives. I don't think they were used
to maintain her girlish figure.

285
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,883
Again, intestinal problems
are common.

286
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,177
Again, it might be a symptom.

287
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,972
Glucosamine
suggests chronic joint pain.

288
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,017
Who ordered
an alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency test?

289
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,226
I did.

290
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,186
You think the problem's
in her pancreas?

291
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,753
I think it will be. I think we need
to forget about the liver.

292
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,775
We just forgot about the lungs,
now we need to forget about the liver?

293
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,321
We need to stop retracing
our steps and get ahead of this thing.

294
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,116
House, you've tanned.

295
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,493
You don't think
I could have come up with this?

296
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,953
Did you?

297
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,456
You suspended House because
it'd be dangerous having him in charge,

298
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,415
but getting his opinion?

299
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm sure he gave you that opinion

300
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,169
simply because he was worried
about the patient?

301
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,172
Just because House wants his pills,
doesn't mean his theory is wrong.

302
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,717
No, the test results mean that.
Your test was negative.

303
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,094
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

304
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,056
Do an ERCP to check the liver
for bile duct cancer.

305
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,225
Just because it wasn't alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.

306
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,853
You needed an organ,
he needed a fix.

307
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,565
He'd have made up any story for a pill.
You didn't give him anything, did you?

308
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,691
No.

309
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,912
There's no bruise or nothing,
but it really hurts.

310
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,164
Unfortunately, that pain
and lack of bruising

311
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,083
is typical of a zygomatic break.

312
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,502
Sounds bad.

313
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,712
Bones are aligned properly.

314
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,297
Which ER did you go to
after the car accident?

315
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,926
Princeton Plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

316
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,928
Okay.

317
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,389
I'm going to get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

318
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,100
I tried that,
it makes me nauseous.

319
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,561
There's a drug
called gabapentin

320
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,355
which is good
for certain kinds of pain.

321
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,982
Great!
'Cause I haven't slept in days.

322
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,189
Gabapentin's not really
going to help with the sleep.

323
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,236
Oh.

324
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,698
Is there something else
you can give me?

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,160
Vicodin's your best bet
with sleep issues.

326
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,126
Well, thanks so much.

327
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,332
Unfortunately, our policy forbids
prescribing opiates to new patients.

328
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,293
Well, how could a clinic have a rule
against relieving pain?

329
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,338
Just with opiates. We find that it helps
weed out drug-seekers.

330
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,841
- You think I'm a drug-seeker?
- I'm not saying that.

331
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,968
- Well, then give me the Vicodin.
- I can't.

332
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,494
Because you think
I'm a drug-seeker.

333
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,637
I just said I didn't.

334
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,141
No, you said that the policy
was to stop drug-seeking.

335
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,977
Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker.
Policy doesn't apply.

336
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,895
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

337
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,565
Gabapentin works on
nerve damage.

338
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,316
You're prescribing it
for a broken face.

339
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,736
Might as well hand out Band-Aids
for a severed carotid.

340
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,903
You're a doctor.

341
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,364
Not by this clinic's definition,
since I'm neither a moron,

342
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,074
nor a mindless drone!

343
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,326
- Security.
- Forget it.

344
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,287
I'll throw myself out.

345
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:08,295
That tube is going
all the way down to my liver?

346
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,714
Don't worry, you'll be sedated.

347
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,632
Sometimes doctors
have to do things

348
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,968
that make people uncomfortable
to help them.

349
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
But we always want to respect
the patient's wishes

350
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,390
and not shove things down
their throats.

351
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,935
Foreman.

352
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,397
You haven't given
her the sedative.

353
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,482
No.

354
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,150
Abigail.

355
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,944
Abigail. She's unconscious.

356
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,572
Check her airway.

357
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,450
Airway's clear.

358
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,035
Her breath smells fruity.

359
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,245
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

360
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,873
Hang an insulin drip
at.1 mgs per kg per hour!

361
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,335
Her pancreas is failing.
You ready to call House yet?

362
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,513
You were right.
The patient's pancreas is failing.

363
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,723
Told you you'd come
begging me for help.

364
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,142
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent.

365
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,188
Give me my pills
or lose an arm.

366
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,106
- The girl is dying!
- So give me my pills.

367
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,150
Take the deal and I will.

368
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
You'd rather kill this girl
than give me my pills?

369
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,283
I would rather lose
one patient now

370
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,994
than the dozens we will lose
while you're in prison.

371
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,459
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy grieving mother.

372
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,134
What if we sacrifice this girl
and House still goes to jail?

373
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,720
I'd feel bad.
Can we get on with this?

374
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,597
House correctly predicted
the spread,

375
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,391
means we've got
a global systemic illness

376
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,727
affecting lungs, liver and pancreas.
So far. Ideas?

377
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,981
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ systems.

378
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,024
Histiocytosis usually
starts in the brain,

379
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,511
then moves to the internal organs.

380
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,153
Abigail's brain is fine.
Cystic fibrosis.

381
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,572
Exocrine function's normal.

382
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,782
Hodgkin's lymphoma.
It's a systemic cancer,

383
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,284
which her dwarfism predisposes her to.

384
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,571
- You have any ideas that aren't cancer?
- Cancer fits.

385
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,662
Autoimmune fits better.

386
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,038
We should treat her
with prednisone for lupus.

387
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,249
That'll spike her blood sugar
and put her back in a coma.

388
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,293
It's much safer just to run
a double-stranded DNA test.

389
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,087
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

390
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,505
One of you is probably right.

391
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,799
Why don't we hold the sniping
until we find out which?

392
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,387
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma,
you guys run an antibody test for lupus.

393
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,771
Because of your daughter's dwarfism,
we've had to pick a higher entry point

394
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,899
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

395
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,067
So, why not do
the lupus test first?

396
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:40,071
In the interest of time, we think
it's best to proceed on both fronts.

397
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,532
You have no idea
what's wrong with my daughter.

398
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,577
- We have several theories.
- What does Dr. House think?

399
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,996
He's... He had to go home sick.

400
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,706
My daughter may be dying

401
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,152
- and he's gone home with the sniffles?
- Well, he's not...

402
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,462
He was the only one who seemed to have
any idea what was wrong with her.

403
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,797
He better be really damn sick.

404
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,090
He is.

405
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,181
Unless you've got Vicodin,
go away.

406
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,309
House, it's me, I...

407
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,647
Oh, God.

408
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,817
- I don't have...
- No pills?

409
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,861
No eggnog.

410
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,199
What happened to your arm?

411
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,576
Cut myself.

412
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,708
Wilson was wrong
about lymphoma.

413
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,003
Kid's not losing any weight,
no night sweats.

414
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,964
- Cuddy sent you?
- No.

415
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,633
She doesn't trust me
not to give you pills.

416
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,094
Is she right?

417
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,222
House, these cuts
are straight, in a row.

418
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,933
You did this on purpose.

419
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,022
Cutting releases endorphins,
endorphins relieve pain.

420
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,733
You going to get me some pills?

421
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,860
No.

422
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,154
Well, then you can leave.

423
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,949
No constitutional
symptoms means...

424
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,744
As soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.

425
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,497
You really think
she's going to fold?

426
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,714
Autoimmune fits better
than cancer.

427
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,176
But lupus loves kidneys.
Usually attacks them first.

428
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,886
Kidneys are fine, right?

429
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,138
Yeah.

430
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,639
House,

431
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,850
take the deal.

432
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,518
You can survive
without Vicodin.

433
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,563
After you were shot,
you stayed clean for months.

434
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,647
Yeah.

435
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,133
I wonder if it had something
to do with the absence of pain.

436
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,528
Leave that. I want to be able to pour
alcohol on it so I can distract myself.

437
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,156
Then you can rip off
the bandage.

438
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,038
Kid been sick lately?

439
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,081
There's a history
of ear infections.

440
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,670
See, Abigail's immune system

441
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,965
is like a shy guy in a bar.

442
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,887
The ear infections, they come in
and they try to coax him to...

443
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,892
To hell with the metaphor.

444
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,268
You get the point, right?

445
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,937
Nerd gets drunk,
trashes the bar.

446
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,107
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by a minor infection?

447
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,277
Factor in her age,
elevated sed rate, anemia...

448
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,405
It's Still's disease.

449
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,076
We start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

450
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,828
House.

451
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,247
Stop this.

452
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,500
Please.

453
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,526
- What'd he say?
- Still's disease.

454
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,527
It's chronic, but manageable...

455
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,862
A diagnosis
that's virtually unconfirmable

456
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,280
and with a treatment
that's more dangerous

457
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,575
than what we were considering for lupus.

458
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,452
How bad is he?

459
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,818
Are you asking because you care

460
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,915
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

461
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:19,958
Both.

462
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,627
He's detoxing. In agony.

463
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,505
He's started cutting himself.

464
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,384
But he's still House.

465
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,972
I'll order the treatment.

466
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,620
Your plan isn't working.

467
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,914
Two days down, one to go.

468
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,918
Figured I'd show you
how much it isn't working.

469
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,422
Yeah. Clearly, the drugs
have no hold on you.

470
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,884
We both know that my pride

471
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,928
far surpasses my instinct
for self-preservation.

472
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,890
You want to redeem yourself?
Give up now.

473
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,850
And you'll go to jail.

474
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,144
I've done nothing wrong.

475
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,146
And you'll go to jail.

476
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,775
Which makes this your last chance
to do me a kindness

477
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,236
before ruining my life forever.

478
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,574
Nausea's bad this time.

479
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,498
You can write me a scrip
for metoclopramide so I can stop puking.

480
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,751
They'd give me that in rehab.

481
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,588
Then you should go to rehab.

482
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,423
I have a patient.

483
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:11,486
I'm so sorry, I know it's little
solace, but he went without pain...

484
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,741
House?

485
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,577
Well, look on the bright side.

486
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,997
At least you don't have to go
by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore.

487
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,750
That's got to be a relief.

488
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,294
- You know this man?
- I'm sorry, he's sick...

489
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,298
You hear my diagnosis on the dwarf?
Still's disease.

490
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,384
Did you even consider
those ear infections,

491
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,262
or you just wrote it off
as a dwarf thing?

492
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,554
Are you sure he's dead?

493
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,640
Because Dr. Wilson
sometimes misses things.

494
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,976
Trying to embarrass me
in front of a grieving widow

495
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,812
- crosses lines that even...
- Right. I'm pathetic.

496
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,399
I'm strung out, I haven't slept,
puking every hour,

497
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,234
and I still out-diagnosed you.

498
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,652
But I'm supposed to let you
decide what's best...

499
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,778
Please.

500
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,198
Please leave.

501
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,493
Sorry.

502
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,912
I'm done.

503
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,749
House!

504
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,672
You didn't come in here
just to embarrass me,

505
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,507
you can do that any time.

506
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,847
Stealing Oxy from a dead man.
Yeah. You don't have a problem.

507
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,529
How's the girl?

508
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,864
Much better.

509
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,867
House was right.

510
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,368
It happens.

511
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,872
I thought we could handle this.

512
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,333
Still's disease
never crossed my mind.

513
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,752
Don't beat yourself up,
I didn't get it, either.

514
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,309
I feel like a mob informant.

515
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,773
You want to go inside?
Got a cafeteria in there, right?

516
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,150
I can't testify.

517
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,906
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

518
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,534
House has hurt plenty of people.
You included.

519
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,871
He saves lives.
People that no one else can save.

520
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,750
And, no matter how much
of an ass he is,

521
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:34,504
statistically, House
is a positive force in the universe.

522
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,757
Pills let him do that.

523
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,302
Vicodin does not make House
a genius.

524
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,972
Whatever he does on the pills,
he can do off.

525
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,809
He is just not willing to try.

526
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,021
I won't testify against him.

527
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,983
Then we'll subpoena you.

528
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,237
Your previous statement
will be read into evidence

529
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:03,157
and you'll be charged with
interfering with an investigation.

530
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,411
And you will go to jail.

531
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,168
Again, statistically,

532
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,212
better me than him.

533
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,924
Statistically, the two of you
will be in jail.

534
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,170
Dr. Cameron?

535
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,380
Come quick,
there's something wrong with Abby.

536
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,707
It can't be too severe,
her cardiac alarm didn't go off.

537
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,093
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

538
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,724
Picking up a scrip
under Zebalusky.

539
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,649
This is Dr. Wilson's patient.

540
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,111
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.

541
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:27,033
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying in agony
on account of his metastatic lung cancer

542
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,160
and not having the pills
to relieve that agony

543
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,996
because of some
moron pharmacist.

544
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,999
Sign the book.

545
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,948
The bleeding wasn't a ruptured eardrum,
ear infection or bleeding disorder.

546
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,154
Her heart rate's climbing,
blood pressure's dropping,

547
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,994
she's on the verge
of a multi-system failure.

548
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,914
Head CT was clean, means it's not
a neurological problem.

549
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,080
Basically we have nothing.

550
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,750
The cancer's
still on the table.

551
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,919
Spinal fluid
was negative for lymphoma.

552
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,085
- What other...
- Leukemia.

553
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,449
We need to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

554
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,298
None of the blood tests
suggest leukemia.

555
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,175
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

556
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,761
Unless a small clot
led to a pulmonary infarct.

557
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,767
It's a long shot.
Autoimmune is way more likely.

558
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,848
Autoimmune diseases respond to steroids,
which we've given her.

559
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,892
And she got better for a while,
we stopped the treatment too soon.

560
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,893
Because she crashed.

561
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,565
All we're doing is bouncing back
and forth between cancer and autoimmune.

562
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,025
We're going in circles.

563
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,158
Give me half an hour.

564
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,711
Can I have a French fry?

565
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,505
Get your own.

566
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,757
You took the last ones.

567
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,135
What's wrong with you?

568
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,554
I've got spinal
muscular atrophy.

569
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,725
I guess it's not contagious.

570
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,519
Nice bear.

571
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,146
It's a dog.

572
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,815
House, it's not Still's.

573
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,317
Steroids helped

574
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,445
until the patient started bleeding
from the ears and mouth.

575
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,572
It's a bear.

576
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,033
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

577
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,202
You win, you can have Vicodin.

578
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,289
Words have set meanings
for a reason.

579
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,666
If you see an animal like Bill
and you try to play fetch,

580
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,959
Bill's going to eat you.

581
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,294
Because Bill's a bear.

582
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,962
Are you on something?

583
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,674
You got your hands
on pain meds.

584
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,802
Bill has fur,
four legs, and a collar.

585
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,763
He's a dog.

586
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,806
It's between cancer
and autoimmune.

587
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,392
See, that's what we call
a faulty syllogism.

588
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,937
Just because you call Bill
a dog, doesn't mean that he is

589
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,940
a dog.

590
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,032
We got to x-ray
our patient's leg.

591
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,162
Her leg looks fine.

592
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,705
Weird, huh?

593
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,332
Why aren't you detoxing?

594
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,875
Willpower.

595
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,460
What... What...

596
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,421
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

597
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,382
Did you just take a pill?

598
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,758
No.

599
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,595
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal growth plates?

600
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,515
It's impossible.
We must be missing something.

601
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,517
How many pills have you taken?

602
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,310
Not nearly as many
as I'm going to take.

603
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,938
I'd forgotten how delicious
they were.

604
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,314
I didn't give them to him.

605
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,858
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

606
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,235
We were missing the fact that

607
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,530
just because we called her
a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf.

608
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,573
Everyone assumed she was,
because of her mother.

609
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,450
There's no test
for CHH dwarfism,

610
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,954
so she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

611
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,124
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism,

612
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,837
then her short stature must be
caused by a growth hormone deficiency.

613
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,630
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland

614
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,590
and based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

615
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,719
So what connects
a long-term pituitary issue

616
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,888
with problems in the lungs,
liver and pancreas?

617
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,642
You guys and your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

618
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,436
Obviously, you think
it's something else.

619
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,230
Nope. I think it's both.

620
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,691
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

621
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,942
Also known as,

622
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,028
"You got your cancer
in my autoimmune" disease.

623
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,356
The immune component responded
to the Still's treatment,

624
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,159
led to the short-term improvement.
The cancer portion didn't.

625
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:41,085
We dismissed this earlier, because
there were no neurological symptoms.

626
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,581
Yeah. It's not your fault.

627
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,459
The only neurological symptom
was her height.

628
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,043
Who could have noticed?

629
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,889
This is your pituitary gland.

630
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,600
This is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

631
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:07,062
No pituitary equals no growth hormone,
equals about that much.

632
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,690
She's not a dwarf?

633
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,901
Just hormonally challenged.

634
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,861
What about my mom?

635
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,740
Your mom's the real deal.
But you're just a tiny little poseur.

636
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,201
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

637
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,787
a cascade of the same cells
that made the granuloma.

638
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,833
They attacked your lungs,
moved on to your liver,

639
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,041
then hitched a ride over
to your pancreas.

640
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,918
We can nuke them
with a mild course of chemo

641
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,337
and then remove the granuloma.

642
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,714
And then what?
What will happen to her then?

643
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,219
Well, let me see
if I can make this clear.

644
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,638
This pill represents

645
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,848
a pill.

646
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,851
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

647
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,480
We deposit the pill
in the mouth.

648
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,613
You may never be tall enough
to play in the WNBA,

649
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,075
but you should be able to
post up your mom, no problem.

650
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,536
What if I don't take the pills?

651
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,540
What if you remove the thing in my head
and give me the chemo,

652
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,543
but not the pills?
Would I still get better?

653
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,170
Your body needs growth hormone
for lots of things.

654
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,588
Like

655
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,840
to grow.

656
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,716
I like who I am now.

657
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,636
Nobody your age
likes who they are now.

658
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,720
I do.

659
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,059
You like needing help when
you want something off a high shelf?

660
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,562
Not being able to press an
elevator button above the eighth floor?

661
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,439
Having to smell ass
every time you stand in line?

662
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:34,358
You don't need growth hormone.

663
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,486
It's just your ticket
out of the freak show.

664
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,877
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

665
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,337
without making her feel
that her life isn't worth living?

666
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,839
I'm trying to help her.

667
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,425
You're trying
to make her taller.

668
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,968
Not too tall.

669
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,804
Just tall enough
to wipe her own butt.

670
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,517
Are you high?

671
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,185
Higher than you.

672
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,355
If my daughter doesn't want
to choose the easy path,

673
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,481
I won't force her to.

674
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,650
Then you're a lousy mom.

675
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,277
You want your daughter
to be a freak.

676
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,112
We're not freaks.

677
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,615
You want her to overcome
adversity.

678
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,867
- Yes.
- Then why stop at height?

679
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,245
Poke a stick in her eye.
Imagine how interesting she'll be then.

680
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,955
Being little
is not the same as...

681
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,250
You and I have found out
that being normal sucks.

682
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,461
Because we're freaks.

683
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:39,423
The advantage of being a freak
is it makes you stronger.

684
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,760
Now, how strong
do you really want her to have to be?

685
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,723
You told her
what you had to tell her.

686
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,642
Now you tell her you lied.

687
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,604
Even if you didn't.

688
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,155
This is who
you were supposed to be.

689
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,823
You hate normal.

690
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,910
It's not that simple.

691
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,956
If I grow,
I'll fade into the background.

692
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,457
I'll be boring.

693
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,587
We'll get you a funny hat.

694
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,718
You could never be boring.

695
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,555
You want me
to be like everybody else?

696
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,146
I want you to have
what I can't.

697
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,958
Abigail agreed...

698
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,128
Abigail agreed
to take growth hormone.

699
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,879
Who's Abigail?

700
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,507
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

701
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,717
Good.

702
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,304
Then the growth hormone
makes sense.

703
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,682
Christmas Eve.

704
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,225
Yeah, I know.

705
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,602
Deal expires tomorrow.

706
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,813
You have plans for tonight?

707
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,190
You worried I'm going to be
popping more pills?

708
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,486
Thought you might prefer
people over pills.

709
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,017
Hey, Mom.

710
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,521
I guess you guys are already up
at Aunt Sarah's.

711
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,691
I'm sure Dad's in the eggnog

712
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,779
and you're probably suffering
through another dried-out turkey.

713
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,289
I just wanted to say,
"Merry Christmas."

714
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,235
House?

715
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,988
Are you okay?
I called three times.

716
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,523
I'm ready to take the deal.

717
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,359
Well, that's off the table.

718
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,907
- The clock doesn't expire until...
- Got new evidence.

719
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,117
We don't need Wilson anymore.

720
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,120
Thing about addicts is,

721
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,957
no matter how smart they are,

722
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,294
they are dumb
when it comes to drugs.

723
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,714
So, I've been keeping an eye
on the pharmacy log.

724
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,968
Seems some patient of Wilson's
named Zebalusky,

725
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:40,390
managed to pick up his Oxy prescription
after he died.

726
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,900
Jesus walks, huh?

727
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,743
Merry Christmas.
