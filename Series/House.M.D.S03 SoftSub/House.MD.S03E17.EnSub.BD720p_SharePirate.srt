1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,422
Hey. Thanks.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,383
No, no, no... Here.

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,344
You got this whole thing
wrong, Em.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,513
It's the rock star that's
supposed to be late,

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,889
not the rock-star photographer.

6
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,184
Sorry. Morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,603
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,063
Come on. It's good luck.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,773
Okay.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,567
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,658
So what do you think?

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,452
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,830
Come on.
"All-American Rejects."

14
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:43,543
Juxtaposing a classic image of Americana
with modern pop culture youth.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,920
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,256
Everyone loves
a good juxtaposition.

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,966
My fans were born in the '90s.

18
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,761
You know what? You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

19
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,388
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,890
- I love the Rockwell thing.
- I thought so.

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,852
Okay. Kill the house lights.
Let's go!

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,861
Hang on. Hey, who's in charge
of the backdrop?

23
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,696
- Naomi?
- Yeah?

24
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,781
What's wrong with it?

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,367
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

26
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,662
What, you can read that?

27
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,748
Of course.

28
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,375
- You okay?
- No. Oh, God.

29
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,461
I could be having a...

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,005
What's the mnemonic?

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,842
"F" is for face.
Is my smile crooked?

32
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,261
What are you doing?

33
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,889
"A" is for arms.

34
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:38,848
Arms.

35
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,349
You should really sit down.

36
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,809
Can someone get her some water?

37
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,519
"S" is speech.

38
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,396
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

39
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,194
"F-A-S-T."

40
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,446
"T" is for time.

41
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:58,159
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

42
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,036
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

43
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,038
My boss says you're important.

44
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,957
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

45
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,000
making Scarlett Johansson
look pretty.

46
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,710
Arms out in front of you.

47
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,879
Palms up like
you're holding a pizza.

48
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,798
Close your eyes.

49
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,344
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

50
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,846
Probably make a lot more money.

51
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,807
Dr. Mackman tell you
the clot was clear?

52
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,891
Yes.

53
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,143
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

54
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,395
Yeah.

55
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,106
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

56
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,193
- What's that mean?
- Means Mackman is an idiot.

57
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,195
- May I?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,072
So,

59
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,409
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

60
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,870
but only one has to look good.

61
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,079
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,664
It's not about looking good.

63
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,874
People are always
hiding things.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,294
I just keep shooting until I can see
what's really inside them.

65
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,672
- My eyes okay?
- Eyes are gorgeous.

66
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,674
The vessels don't look so hot.

67
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,635
Microaneurysms predict
further strokes.

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,595
This is gonna happen again?

69
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,431
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

70
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,224
Puff up your cheeks.

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,396
You should be able to keep the air in.
Means there's weakness around the mouth.

72
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,363
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

73
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,777
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

74
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,531
He once told me the FAST mnemonic
could save my life one day. So...

75
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,491
Interesting pet name.

76
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,411
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

77
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,538
He's gay.

78
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,373
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

79
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
You turned him for a night?

80
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,919
Just straight for one date?

81
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,837
Okay.

82
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,841
He took a magazine and a cup
into my bathroom.

83
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,760
A man after my own heart.

84
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,720
Different magazine obviously.

85
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

86
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,892
My lackeys will be in
to do some tests,

87
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,895
take some more blood
and empty your catheter bag.

88
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,654
Not a moment you'll
want to cherish.

89
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,784
This is definitely different.

90
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,078
It looks almost like...

91
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,955
He's caring.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,381
Find anything else in the patient's
folder? Like a diagnosis?

93
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,968
Urinalysis revealed excessive protein
and red blood cells.

94
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,720
Chem panel showed
a creatinine level over 2.5.

95
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,265
So first she strokes,
now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?

96
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,142
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

97
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,895
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

98
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,855
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

99
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,149
Any of you guys
ever been to the Galápagos?

100
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,609
Was our patient there?

101
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,736
Dengue fever, avian pox,
even West Nile.

102
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,946
No.

103
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,614
I'm looking for
a vacation spot.

104
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,949
That mean we get vacation?

105
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,535
How would that differ
from your current status?

106
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,995
You're gonna do what? Relax?

107
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,121
Visiting family.

108
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,664
My uncle's a giant turtle.

109
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,541
What if the kidney failure
came first?

110
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,067
Kidneys could've caused the stroke,
not the other way around.

111
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,170
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

112
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm saying it threw a clot.

113
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,559
Early symptoms of kidney failure are
nausea, vomiting, ankle swelling.

114
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,477
She would've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

115
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,637
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than a kidney.

116
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,890
Echo was normal. The history indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

117
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,184
No, but if one were to read
the history closely,

118
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,603
one would notice that she had six cases
of strep.

119
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,523
In her throat. That's the one about
10 inches above her heart.

120
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,401
Let me rephrase,
six cases of untreated strep.

121
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,819
She was prescribed antibiotics.

122
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,987
No one takes them all.

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,449
They stop when they start feeling
better. All strep is untreated strep.

124
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,095
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

125
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,326
Leads to rheumatic fever.

126
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,619
Which leads to... Cameron?

127
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,996
Mitral valve stenosis.

128
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,082
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... Kidney?

129
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,292
No.

130
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,938
The kidney doesn't have
a mitral valve.

131
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,087
We'll go look at her heart.

132
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,090
Be easy to find.

133
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,094
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches below her throat.

134
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,138
That was weird.

135
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,808
- He was the way he always is.
- Which is weird.

136
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,062
- Very still, Emma.
- Sorry.

137
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,229
No problem.

138
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,566
He caught us with your hand up my shirt.
He's gotta have a reaction to that.

139
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,984
You think that's what
the vacation is?

140
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
Yes.

141
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,781
The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

142
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,115
Coronal slice appears normal.

143
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,409
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

144
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,815
He's gotta be
planning something.

145
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,996
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

146
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,414
Sagittal slice is clean.

147
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,999
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

148
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,485
He knew we were there
and he wanted us to know that he knew.

149
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,128
Or you wanted him to know.

150
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,381
Now he does and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

151
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,549
Right there.

152
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,427
Trans-axial slice.
Calcified mitral valve.

153
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,721
Barely. That's not big enough
to throw a clot.

154
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,182
Obviously it is,
because it did.

155
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,725
House was right.

156
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,853
A valve in your heart
is narrowed.

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,648
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

158
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,443
and the reduced circulation
caused the problem with your kidneys.

159
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,070
And this will fix it?

160
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,573
The balloon will force the valve back
open and you'll be fine.

161
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,158
Can we do this
without a sedative?

162
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,203
It's very mild. There really is no risk
to the fetus.

163
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,539
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

164
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,376
We won't allow it to
decrease anywhere near dangerous levels.

165
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,547
Thank you.

166
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,756
You're both gonna be fine.

167
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,052
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

168
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,099
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,686
Start threading the catheter.

170
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:10,656
No, I don't want a layover in Frankfurt,
Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario.

171
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,862
That's why I asked
for a direct flight to Phnom Penh.

172
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,495
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

173
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,123
Well, then fine.
I'd be delighted to hold.

174
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,292
- What's new?
- Can Cuddy stop interfering?

175
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,668
It's her job. What's new?

176
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,155
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

177
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,548
Bad news is it's not her underlying
problem. Her kidneys are still failing.

178
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,592
You're vacationing in Cambodia?

179
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,843
You gonna unwind in the Killing
Fields?

180
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,802
Nope.

181
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,596
Gonna catch me a fish this big.

182
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,098
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

183
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,600
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

184
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,560
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

185
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,126
All of our operators
are currently...

186
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,688
If the mitral valve had been properly
fixed

187
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,981
the kidney should be getting better,

188
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,567
which leads us to the conclusion that
you screwed up the procedure.

189
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,110
Or you screwed up
the diagnosis.

190
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,820
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

191
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,072
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

192
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,449
Probably never would've
been a problem.

193
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,826
She needs dialysis
and we need a new theory.

194
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,953
There are only
a few possibilities.

195
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,247
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

196
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,749
We eliminated it
before because...

197
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,084
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

198
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,294
Hypoperfusion.

199
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,631
The fetus is basically a parasite
stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.

200
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,840
Put her on telemetry.

201
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,300
Or the pregnancy is irrelevant.

202
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,053
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUS/TTP.

203
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,138
A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

204
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,725
Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down,
clog up small vessels of the kidneys.

205
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,811
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

206
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,729
That's it.
Has to be one of those five.

207
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,858
You know what would be even better? If
we'd narrow it all the way down to one.

208
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,819
Thank you for holding.

209
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,405
We are experiencing
extremely high call volume.

210
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,658
Thank you for your patience.

211
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,623
She's 0 for five.

212
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,128
Either the differential
was wrong or she's faking it.

213
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,464
Kidney failure has to be
precipitated by...

214
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,882
One of the five
we've already ruled out.

215
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,635
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

216
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,220
- The labs must be wrong.
- We did the labs.

217
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,846
No one else had access.

218
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,598
That's not quite true.

219
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,484
You put all your patients through this
many tests or just the important ones?

220
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,989
We wanted to explore
all possibilities.

221
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,659
And?

222
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,704
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

223
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,790
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

224
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,916
Your body is
functioning properly.

225
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,501
So why are my kidneys failing?

226
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,380
The other body isn't.

227
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,301
There's something wrong
with the fetus.

228
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,397
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

229
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,442
Mom's body is like

230
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,737
an intricate
German metro system.

231
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,363
All the trains run on time.

232
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,868
When she gets pregnant, it's like a new
station opening in Düsseldorf.

233
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,829
Bunch or rookies running things.
Bound to be mistakes.

234
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,998
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

235
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,724
Before you know it, the trains are
backed up all the way to Berlin

236
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,836
and you've got a bunch of angry Germans
with nowhere to go.

237
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,755
And we all know
that ain't good for the Jews.

238
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,922
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

239
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,966
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

240
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,385
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth,

241
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,805
a very sick baby
or on rare occasion a time bomb

242
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,891
that kills mom
while it's dying.

243
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,061
Good news is,
we fix the fetus, mom gets better.

244
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,271
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

245
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,483
I have read the outcome of mirror
syndrome is almost always unfavorable.

246
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,611
"Unfavorable."
Is that doctor speak for "dead baby"?

247
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,405
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

248
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,616
We can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

249
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,286
as soon as we diagnose
a person who weighs about one pound.

250
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,915
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.

251
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,044
If only there existed giant machines
that could look through human skin.

252
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,546
Mirror syndrome
has a limited number of known causes.

253
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,758
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma.

254
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,843
All of which are fixable.

255
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,887
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

256
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,764
Could also be trisomy 13.

257
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,600
Ebstein's anomaly,
an aneurysm of Galen's vein.

258
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,229
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over the differential

259
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,106
and killed
the beautiful little baby.

260
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,442
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix. So let's start there.

261
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,945
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look at the fetus's heart?

262
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,532
It was in the range but blurry. The
fetus was moving all over the place.

263
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,367
- So we need another scan.
- Yeah.

264
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,036
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

265
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,081
No need. I'm going to
paralyze it.

266
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,002
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

267
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,088
Let me guess. Cameron?

268
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,257
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

269
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,925
No, Cameron had concerns.

270
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,093
Chase just agreed with her

271
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,179
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass to her love rug.

272
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,597
They're sleeping together?

273
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,017
If by "sleeping together" you mean
having sex in the janitor's closet.

274
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,018
Here?

275
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,813
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

276
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,648
Go, Tiger Cats!

277
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,693
Do you have one of those camera phones?
'Cause I got a MySpace account.

278
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,903
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

279
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
Oh, come on.
Let's gossip some more.

280
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,282
I'm sure she's into bondage.

281
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,826
Paralyzing a one-pound baby
risks damaging...

282
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,204
Not paralyzing the thing risks not
getting a clean MRI of its heart,

283
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,250
which we need to save its life, which we
need to do to save Emma's life.

284
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,335
You're gonna need to
get her consent.

285
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,129
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

286
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,256
"Sign here or you
and your baby both die."

287
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,634
I'm going with you.

288
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,013
Oh, good.

289
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,641
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

290
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,686
The injection goes into
the umbilical cord.

291
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,979
The baby won't feel a thing.

292
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,856
Fetus.

293
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,652
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

294
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,279
The benefits outweigh the risks

295
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,115
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

296
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,411
Must be easier to hear
you might die than your baby might die.

297
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,831
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

298
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,542
it would be Dr. House.

299
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,215
Fetus.

300
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,218
Hold this.

301
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,498
Dr. Cameron.
The MRI results back?

302
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,999
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

303
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,293
The problem's with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

304
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,378
Let me see.

305
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,421
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up the whole torso,

306
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,839
squeezing all the other organs.

307
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,174
There's no room
for the lungs to develop.

308
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,392
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

309
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,909
We can fix that
by inserting a shunt.

310
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,304
I'll give Emma the news.

311
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,181
Are you taking over the case?

312
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,308
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

313
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,020
Doctor Cameron.

314
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,858
Dating Chase can only end
in one of two ways.

315
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,985
House told you?

316
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,487
You get married
and live happily ever after,

317
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,323
or somebody gets hurt
and you two can't work together,

318
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,825
and I have to fire somebody.

319
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,910
I would hate to see my personal life
become such a burden to you.

320
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,078
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

321
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,122
I assume you're gonna have this same
conversation with Chase

322
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,081
for his own good.

323
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,709
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

324
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,644
There's only room for one
but I could scooch over.

325
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,271
My social life
is my social life.

326
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,023
Couldn't agree more.

327
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,525
What goes on in the privacy of a
janitor's closet

328
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,526
is nobody's business except...

329
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,412
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

330
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,416
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

331
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,116
- What are you doing?
- Trying to avoid altitude sickness.

332
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,922
Couldn't score a direct flight
to Cambodia,

333
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,496
so I've decided to scale Argentina's
infamous Mount Aconcagua.

334
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,543
Perfect, except for the fact
that you can't walk.

335
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,793
There's a tribe of Mocoví Indians
who actually carry the elders up...

336
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,794
You're insane.

337
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,755
I'm an insane genius.

338
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,257
I set the chamber to low pressure
instead of high.

339
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,801
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

340
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,011
creates new capillaries.

341
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,181
Few more days in here, I can save myself
six weeks at base camp.

342
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,932
Where's my MRI?

343
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,896
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

344
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,981
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

345
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,817
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

346
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,069
Can you fix it?

347
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,696
We can insert a small tube
in the baby's bladder

348
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,657
that makes the urine
come out straight through his belly

349
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,659
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

350
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,745
The bladder decompresses and the lungs
will be able to develop normally.

351
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,998
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

352
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,000
First we just have to do a test

353
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,878
to determine whether the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

354
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,797
And what if they're not?

355
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,634
If they're already too damaged, then
there's really nothing we can do.

356
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,929
If this doesn't work out,
you can always try again.

357
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,018
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

358
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,272
After the divorce, I tried in vitro like
four times before this.

359
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,652
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

360
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,036
What are you doing?

361
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,824
You're trying to be me,
so I thought I'd try to be you.

362
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,193
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

363
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,875
But I have a much tighter ass.

364
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,337
Think every day should be
naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron?

365
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,924
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

366
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,718
They aren't back yet.

367
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,261
They're gonna be inconclusive.

368
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,929
You think my diagnosis
is wrong?

369
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,682
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

370
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:39,725
Mom's level is fine.

371
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:40,976
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

372
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,853
Could just mean we caught
the obstruction early.

373
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,646
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

374
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,856
The urine you've collected

375
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,816
has been sitting in that fetus's bladder
for weeks.

376
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,319
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

377
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,113
Fine. I'll do another tap.

378
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,322
Just as useless.

379
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,743
Old urine drops down from the kidney
right after the first tap

380
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,910
'cause it's so backed up.

381
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,663
Bladder tap number three
will give you the freshest pee.

382
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,510
That's when you'll find out if this
fetus has even a fighting chance.

383
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,625
Thank you.

384
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,753
I'll run two more taps.

385
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,756
Since when does the Dean of Medicine
run bladder taps?

386
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,965
She's an important patient.

387
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,594
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

388
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,723
Woman in her 40s, single,

389
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,186
using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

390
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,065
Maybe you want to make sure she succeeds
so you'll still have hope.

391
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,819
You can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

392
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,113
- It's your file.
- I don't want it.

393
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,449
Then why did you just
say all that stuff?

394
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,784
To humiliate you.

395
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,244
- You're taking the case back.
- I don't want it.

396
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,330
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

397
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,957
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

398
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,380
Good news.

399
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,801
The fetus's urine had appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

400
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,803
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

401
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,680
Oh, wow.

402
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,766
We're gonna put the shunt in.

403
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,733
Your baby's lungs
should have more room to grow

404
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,229
and your symptoms
should go away.

405
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,190
But he'll still need surgery,
after he's born?

406
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,692
That's when we'll remove the blockage
in the ureter.

407
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,402
You'll be the only mother on the planet

408
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,488
who appreciates the value of a wet
diaper.

409
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,156
Hey, could you hand me that?

410
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,533
I'm keeping
a visual memory book

411
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,036
of this entire surreal process and this
is the best part of the story so far.

412
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,038
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

413
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,375
When'd you take this?

414
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,168
She did the second bladder tap.

415
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,254
You should keep it.

416
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,215
Oh, I see her all day at work.
I don't need it.

417
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,593
Maybe you want to see her
after work.

418
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,221
I'm right, right?

419
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,975
I saw the way you look at her.

420
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,151
Thanks.

421
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,956
The shunt is
in the right position.

422
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,875
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

423
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,501
No infection.

424
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,214
Did House say anything else?
About us?

425
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,885
I thought you didn't care about his
reaction. Trying to make him jealous?

426
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,595
I like my job.

427
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,680
He can't fire you
just because we're together.

428
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,683
We're not "together,"
and House can do whatever he wants.

429
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,731
- How's my baby?
- Doing just fine, Emma.

430
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,733
- So are you.
- My stomach's killing me.

431
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,736
That's not her stomach.

432
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,364
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

433
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,453
What is it?

434
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,665
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

435
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,754
Figures. Just booked my trip
to Johnston Strait.

436
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,882
I thought you were climbing
Mount Whatever in Argentina.

437
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,843
Apparently I'd have to live
with the Mocoví Indians for 20 years

438
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,762
before they'd consider me
an elder.

439
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,182
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead. No legs required.

440
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,560
Can't leave yet. Liver failure puts her
case back into the unsolved pile.

441
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,897
Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's
off the charts.

442
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,858
Even fetuses lie.

443
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:23,657
We diagnosed a lower urinary tract
obstruction because we saw one.

444
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,993
What if that's not
the whole story?

445
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,914
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

446
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,917
The real reason
for the mirror syndrome.

447
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,336
Have we looked under its bed?

448
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,629
We checked its diary?

449
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,297
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

450
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,663
Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome.

451
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,258
- There were no structural problems.
- The lungs.

452
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,135
We won't be able to
get a good look until they develop.

453
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,221
- It'll be weeks...
- She's not gonna last weeks.

454
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,639
What do you want to do?

455
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,809
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

456
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,727
Deliver the fetus.

457
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,021
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

458
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,399
- Fetus.
- Semantics make you feel better?

459
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,565
Pretend it's not a person?

460
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,694
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

461
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,821
Can it take pretty pictures?

462
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,907
Who wants to tell her?

463
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,834
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

464
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,755
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

465
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
Well, can't you deliver him?

466
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,011
Put him on a respiratory machine
till you figure out what's wrong?

467
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,388
We can. And it won't matter.

468
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,393
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away from being viable.

469
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,355
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

470
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,069
You're on dialysis for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

471
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,573
They don't make dialysis
for your liver.

472
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,785
You're not gonna make it
two more days.

473
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,961
I'm not gonna let you
kill my baby.

474
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,255
It's killing you.

475
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,842
I'm not having an abortion.

476
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,387
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

477
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,519
I understand dying for a cause.

478
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,897
Sacrificing your life
so your child might live.

479
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,690
But that's not the choice here.

480
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,863
Either it dies or you both die.

481
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,657
Or you fix him
and we both live.

482
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,034
I can't fix it.

483
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,832
I'm scheduling a D&C.

484
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,917
I won't consent.

485
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,881
So I guess you have two days
to figure it out.

486
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,726
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

487
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,854
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her to terminate.

488
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,899
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed up the baby's lung development?

489
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,611
No. I dropped an anvil on its chest
to prevent lung development.

490
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,906
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race one fetus at a time.

491
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,034
Give the lungs more time
to expand so you can see inside them.

492
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,241
See if they're the problem.

493
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,079
My real patient is dying.

494
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,833
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy any green bananas.

495
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,876
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

496
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,545
Removing it is an instant cure.

497
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,004
You're not gonna get Emma
to see it that way.

498
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,339
She's probably already
named the baby,

499
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,508
read him books,
had conversations with him.

500
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,177
- See, you get it. She'll listen to you.
- No.

501
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,555
If you let this woman
refuse to terminate,

502
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,390
you're helping her commit suicide.

503
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,184
As her doctor
my recommendation is against suicide.

504
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,811
If the baby had a doctor,

505
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,355
I think she would recommend exhausting
all possibilities

506
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,816
- before taking its life.
- Then she'd be an idiot.

507
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,776
Too bad she's your boss!

508
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,446
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

509
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,865
It isn't.

510
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,616
If we assume
she doesn't have mirror syndrome,

511
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,869
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna help her liver at all.

512
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,246
We eliminated
all other possibilities.

513
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,373
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

514
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,710
Emma's kidneys and liver
are failing. The diagnosis is solid.

515
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,796
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

516
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,483
You must be even wronger
than I thought.

517
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,091
Fine.

518
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,760
Let's assume she had
mirror syndrome

519
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,847
but we fixed it when we fixed
the baby's bladder.

520
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,726
That means that her failing liver
would be completely unrelated.

521
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:23,313
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

522
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,399
So her theory is
that our patient's liver problems

523
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,318
were just a giant coincidence.

524
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,944
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

525
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,238
Pregnant women
can develop liver problems.

526
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,117
If this is the case,
we can actually do something here.

527
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,995
Don't you guys
think that's worth exploring?

528
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,998
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

529
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,626
- Thank you.
- Brownnoser.

530
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,796
- Viral hepatitis, HELLP syndrome.
- Oh, look.

531
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,842
Sticking up for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

532
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,845
He's not joking?

533
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,932
Be patient. She's going
through all of us.

534
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,768
She'll get
that jungle fever eventually.

535
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,021
- I'm not going through anyone.
- You love him?

536
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,899
This can probably wait until after you
biopsy Emma's liver, right?

537
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,901
We can't.
Her platelets are too low.

538
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,780
Once we pierce her liver, it'll be next
to impossible to stop the bleeding.

539
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,156
Come in from above.

540
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,284
Instead of going straight in
through her abdomen,

541
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,869
go in through the veins
in her neck.

542
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,830
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

543
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:26,751
If the liver starts to bleed, it'll
bleed right back into her own veins.

544
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,347
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

545
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,856
Threading the guide wire
through the right internal jugular vein.

546
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,693
So, the sleep lab...

547
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,320
You and Cameron not sleeping.

548
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,073
How serious is it?

549
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,032
It's nothing.

550
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,368
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

551
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,829
- Then why are you doing it?
- You kidding?

552
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,873
You're approaching the inferior
vena cava. Slow down.

553
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,918
You better not hurt her.

554
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,255
- She already has a big brother.
- She does?

555
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,299
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

556
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,010
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

557
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,679
A heartbroken, lovesick Cameron

558
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,765
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

559
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,726
You're through
the hepatic vein.

560
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,436
I'm firing the needle.

561
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,148
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

562
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,859
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

563
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,779
- We've got contractions.
- Pre-term labor.

564
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,948
Start a terbutaline drip!

565
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,710
We were able to control
the pre-term labor with tocolytics.

566
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,712
The contractions
have subsided for now.

567
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,757
And the liver biopsy was negative.
This is definitely mirror syndrome.

568
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:56,841
Her baby's doing this to her.

569
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:57,807
We're out of options.

570
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,774
Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

571
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,637
It doesn't make a difference.

572
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,264
Pre-term labor
can be a new symptom.

573
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,933
New information gives us
new theories. Isn't that how it works?

574
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Not in this case.

575
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,605
Her body's trying to do what you refuse
to, get the baby out and save itself.

576
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,232
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

577
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,151
Her liver is on the verge
of shutting down completely.

578
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,402
A torch test could...

579
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,279
We don't have time
for more tests.

580
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,573
We have to terminate
or she'll die.

581
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,743
Then let's work faster.

582
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,829
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you hope real hard.

583
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,035
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

584
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,085
The only organ we haven't been able
to look inside is its lungs.

585
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,371
The problem must be in there.

586
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,089
We haven't been able to see inside
because they're underdeveloped.

587
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,132
We've already got her on
corticosteroids,

588
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,258
but it'll
take weeks for them...

589
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,428
Then let's drown them
in corticosteroids, multiple courses.

590
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,429
Speed up their development.

591
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,475
Giving the baby more than one course
will suppress adrenal gland function.

592
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,602
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

593
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,728
- Worse than death?
- Emma's already on tocolytics.

594
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,815
The combination could put her
into pulmonary edema.

595
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,066
You'll just kill her faster.

596
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,693
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

597
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,572
We're just gonna have to make the baby
better faster than we make Emma worse.

598
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,575
Come on! This is the kind
of thing House does every day.

599
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,412
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

600
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,041
I'll do it myself.

601
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,261
Anybody gonna stop her?

602
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,008
Stopping the madness
is her job.

603
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,678
Somebody's got to be
Cuddy's Cuddy.

604
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,521
Nurse!

605
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,405
- Pulmonary edema?
- Who tattled? It doesn't matter.

606
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,533
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses of corticosteroids.

607
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,993
Gee, thanks.

608
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,411
It's time to terminate.

609
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:49,911
That's not what she wants.

610
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,913
Look at her.

611
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,668
She didn't want to be an incubator for a
dead baby, but that's what you've done.

612
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,463
Either get me a laryngoscope
or get out!

613
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,966
You were right.

614
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,760
You were all right.

615
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,221
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

616
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,266
She's dying faster than the baby's lungs
are developing.

617
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,393
I had to stop
the corticosteroids.

618
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,229
Have you spoken to the family?

619
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,773
The only family she's got
is that baby.

620
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,274
Well, he's biased.

621
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,486
What do you think
House would do?

622
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,029
House wants to terminate.

623
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,156
I mean if he didn't.

624
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,742
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

625
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,786
He wouldn't share your pain.

626
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,372
He'd be objective.

627
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,123
Right.

628
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,461
- He would prioritize his problems.
- He'd terminate.

629
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,381
He wouldn't be afraid of screwing with
her lungs if there was a bigger issue.

630
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,674
There is no bigger issue.

631
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,717
- She needs her lungs.
- Not right now.

632
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,678
She's already on a respirator.

633
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,084
The machine is
breathing for her.

634
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,847
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

635
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,974
If you're playing catch in the living
room and you break your mother's vase,

636
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,311
you may as well keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

637
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,148
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe without that vase.

638
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,026
I'm putting her back on
corticosteroids.

639
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,326
- It worked.
- What worked?

640
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,120
I got the baby's lungs
to expand.

641
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,997
- We should be able to figure...
- Cab's on its way.

642
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,082
I have to finish packing.

643
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,044
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

644
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,463
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

645
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,423
is telling you
that you're wrong.

646
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,508
Helps to know they're idiots.

647
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,052
Do you think I'm an idiot?

648
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,013
You're not objective.

649
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,683
But you're not an idiot.

650
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,855
These lungs are still two weeks away
from being viable.

651
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,440
But big enough for a diagnosis.

652
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,233
These tissue buds are new.

653
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,902
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

654
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,821
or diaphragmatic eventration.

655
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,782
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

656
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,618
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

657
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,036
What about...

658
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,919
Move.

659
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,215
Thought you
started your vacation.

660
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,344
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundus ass.

661
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,763
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

662
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,348
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate...

663
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,475
Thanks. Got the multiple choice
all worked out.

664
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,936
Question is, how do we pick between
A, B, C, D, and none of the above?

665
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,344
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

666
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,400
The fetal lungs are so tiny the MRI
won't give us the details we need.

667
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,655
What would we do if this patient
were not just a tadpole?

668
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:11,906
Say it was an actual person.

669
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,574
He is a person.

670
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,950
Thanks for playing along.

671
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,036
Pretend it's a one-pound adult.

672
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,789
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

673
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,625
How would we get a better look
at what's in the lungs?

674
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,751
Transesophageal echo.

675
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,211
Can't access his esophagus.

676
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,879
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

677
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,674
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

678
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,052
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

679
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,471
You're not me. Collaborate.

680
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,724
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

681
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,436
How do we get a fetus to breathe
in a radioactive isotope, idiot?

682
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,308
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

683
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,899
we'd do an exploratory surgery.

684
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,276
Cut into its chest
and have a look around.

685
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,736
Let's do that.

686
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,615
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

687
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,575
I'll put it back when I'm done.

688
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,038
Me again.

689
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,833
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

690
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,960
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

691
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,004
Open the uterus,
cut out the fetus so we can look around.

692
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:13,342
I know you can't talk so I need you
to look petrified if you consent.

693
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,428
The umbilical cord
won't be cut.

694
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,223
During surgery, your body will basically
serve as the baby's heart/lung machine.

695
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,976
We find what's wrong
and we fix it.

696
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,269
If we can.

697
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,564
Don't lower expectations
if you want them to do something.

698
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,066
She should know
what she's facing.

699
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:34,280
This is incredibly dangerous.

700
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,323
It risks both your lives.

701
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,428
The only reason
why we're suggesting it,

702
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,078
is because there's
nothing else we can do.

703
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,645
You all here
for the fetal surgery?

704
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,898
'Cause we're way over capacity.

705
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,649
Mind each other's
personal space.

706
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,194
There are sharp implements
in the room.

707
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,695
Like this one.

708
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,497
Uterus is fully exposed.

709
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,632
And we're in.

710
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,967
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

711
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,139
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

712
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,391
Where'd you go to college?
Give me that.

713
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,295
Affix the pulse ox to the palm.

714
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
House?

715
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,138
Sorry.

716
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,016
Just realized
I forgot to TiVo Alien.

717
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,193
Fetal heart rate good.
Stats are stable.

718
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,280
Position him for the incision.

719
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,079
I see three well-defined
lesions.

720
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,124
It's definitely CCAM.
I should be able to resect them.

721
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,546
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

722
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,591
Charging.

723
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,428
- Clear!
- I'm clear.

724
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,797
Looks like asystole.
Paddling isn't going to do anything.

725
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,809
It's fine V-fib.
I'm going again. Clear!

726
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,814
We're gonna lose them both.
Clamp!

727
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,276
The surgery's not doing this to her.
The fetus is.

728
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,819
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

729
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,489
The only way to save her is to cut away
the anchor holding her down.

730
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,117
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

731
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,828
Clear!

732
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,332
Going again. Clear!

733
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,462
Heart rate's returning
to normal.

734
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,383
Continue with the lobectomy.

735
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,979
So my kidneys, liver and lungs
are all fine just like that?

736
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,608
- Just like that.
- That's amazing.

737
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,404
What's amazing is how blonde
your baby's hair is.

738
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,408
My baby?

739
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,494
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

740
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,955
You've never called him
a baby before.

741
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,712
Any pain?

742
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,506
Nothing I can't deal with.

743
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,050
You can only get out of bed
to pee, pooh or shower.

744
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,553
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

745
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,306
Sorry.

746
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,270
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

747
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,984
Well, if you call
being born twice normal.

748
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,699
Hey, thank you.

749
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,455
Don't thank me.
I would've killed the kid.

750
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,842
- Wanna grab a bite?
- In a minute.

751
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,052
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

752
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,971
I'll walk with you.

753
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,559
When'd she take
this picture of you?

754
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,687
You look so...

755
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,147
I'm smiling.

756
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,983
I have a nice smile.

757
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,444
No, I've never
seen you like this.

758
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,904
She got you to glow.

759
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,741
What were you doing?

760
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,493
What did she say to you?

761
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,371
I always glow.

762
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,760
House.

763
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,304
Need you to take
a look at something.

764
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,848
- I'm off the clock.
- Just open it.

765
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,148
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

766
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,359
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

767
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,657
- I think it's great.
- Yeah.

768
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,952
- Who doesn't like Canadians?
- It's big.

769
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,289
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to enjoy yourself.

770
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,041
You didn't need to apologize.

771
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,709
I'm not. I told you why I...

772
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,002
Screwed up.

773
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,587
I saved a life.
I saved two lives.

774
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,214
You

775
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:30,052
let your maternal instinct get the best
of you and nearly kill two people.

776
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,721
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

777
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,889
You do what you did

778
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,642
mom and baby both die
9.9 times out of 10.

779
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,770
Sometimes point one
is bigger than 9.9.

780
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,814
No, it's smaller.

781
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,192
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

782
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,737
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

783
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,242
Now go away and be happy.
