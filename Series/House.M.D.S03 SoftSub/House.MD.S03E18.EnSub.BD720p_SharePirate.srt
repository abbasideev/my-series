1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,024
Fran? I'm Robin.

2
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,401
Please come in.

3
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,116
Cute home.
Two bedroom, one bath?

4
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,909
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,456
A guy I know collects those. Says
they're worth a fortune on the internet.

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,666
Yeah.

7
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,795
You've never used
our agency before, have you?

8
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,547
Is it that obvious?

9
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,226
As you can see, we offer
a full range of services.

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,645
- "Round the World"?
- Our deluxe package.

11
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,815
Offers all the services
of A, B, and C.

12
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,779
- How much?
- $1,000.

13
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,616
And satisfaction
is guaranteed. Twice.

14
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,203
- I'll get the money.
- I'll get ready.

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,467
Harrington?

16
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,514
Harrington, what are you
doing up there?

17
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,726
All right, now don't
take this personally

18
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,060
but you're gonna have to go...

19
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,103
Fran.

20
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,943
Is this okay?

21
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,241
Fran.

22
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,001
Fran, you all right?

23
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,547
Oh, God.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,093
Fran?

25
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,915
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

26
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,961
I don't know,
my friend collapsed.

27
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,790
And what were you doing
when you fainted?

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,712
- We were just...
- Looking for her cat.

29
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,756
And have you
banged your head recently?

30
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,716
No.

31
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,847
Is this a motion sickness
patch?

32
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,475
I must have forgotten to take it off.
I just got back from a trip.

33
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,855
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

34
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,650
You probably hit your head when you
fell, and that caused the blackout.

35
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,403
I thought those patches were supposed
to prevent you from getting sick.

36
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,946
Every drug has a side effect.

37
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
But it might be a good idea
to keep your eye on her

38
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,034
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,327
Actually...

40
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,620
She has to get back to work.

41
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,706
Is it important?

42
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,376
We just don't like people
to be alone after they leave here.

43
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,503
I'm fine. Really.

44
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,964
- I'm...
- Fran?

45
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,759
Fran?

46
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,804
I got a seizure. Code cart.

47
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,811
What's wrong with her?

48
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,015
I have no idea.

49
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,851
Where's House?

50
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,689
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie! I want my blankie!

51
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,193
Antique vintner's cane.
Cost me $900.

52
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,736
It had a corkscrew in it.

53
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,821
That would explain
the vintner's reference.

54
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,240
It could be used as a weapon
against the pilot.

55
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,087
Only if he's stuck
in a bottle of zinfandel.

56
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,994
You'll get it back
when we land.

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,372
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

58
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,124
Give her 20 milligrams
of antihistamine. Could save her life.

59
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,709
'Cause if she doesn't shut up,
I'll kill her.

60
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,337
Delivering goodwill
to yet another continent.

61
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,547
You only forced me to
deliver a speech, not goodwill.

62
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,467
You gave a three-minute speech.

63
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,970
You know how much WHO accreditation
means to the hospital?

64
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,937
Well, it may have been short,
but it had girth.

65
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,891
And the room service thing
was just spiteful.

66
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,477
- I was hungry.
- $300 for a bottle of wine.

67
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,812
I was thirsty.

68
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,231
$120 on video services.

69
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,190
I was lonely.

70
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,527
That's 500 in expenses
I can't justify.

71
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,445
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

72
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,406
Right.

73
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,894
Here you are, sir.
You're welcome.

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,328
Welcome aboard, Mr. House.

75
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,080
You're right here in 2-A.

76
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,335
Ms. Cuddy you're in the next cabin
and to the left, 9-C.

77
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,462
No, I booked two
first-class tickets.

78
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,589
- This must be a mistake.
- No mistake.

79
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,759
I just arranged for
a $500 fare reduction.

80
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,136
Expense problem solved.

81
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,228
- Where did you travel?
- Duluth.

82
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,814
- To visit my sister.
- Really?

83
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,316
Is this her artwork?

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,280
"Fire butt"?

85
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,992
I was a little drunk.

86
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,827
Where were you a little drunk?

87
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,667
I turned 58 last March.

88
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,087
Same age my mother was
when she died.

89
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,591
Next week I packed a bag,
I went to JFK,

90
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,845
looked at the big board, took the first
plane that went to a warm place.

91
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,140
- Caracas.
- Oh, my God.

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,267
Did you drink the water?
Eat salads?

93
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,269
- Any raw foods?
- Yup.

94
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,687
And?

95
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,068
I also did mescal shooters

96
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:46,614
and snorted cocaine from
a homosexual man's stomach.

97
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,452
- Did you have sex?
- No.

98
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,499
Not with him.
I had sex with El Gordo.

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
He was a large man.

100
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,504
Oh, my God.

101
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,176
I never do things like that.

102
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,889
I should have gone to visit my sister.
It was stupid.

103
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,391
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

104
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,896
It's possible.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,533
Here you are.
Rib eye, medium rare.

106
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,035
- Thank you.
- Some more Pinot Grigio?

107
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,664
No. I think I will
switch to the Syrah.

108
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,680
Sir, are you all right?

109
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,473
He's drunk.

110
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,486
See?

111
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,532
Does anyone speak Korean?

112
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,743
Is anyone a doctor?

113
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,664
Yes.

114
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,376
I'll go get her.

115
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,857
What do you want?

116
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,235
Do you really think I was gonna leave
you stuck back here for 18 hours?

117
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,653
Go on, enjoy.

118
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,698
With the Vicodin and the wine
I could sleep anywhere.

119
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,497
Thank you.

120
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,217
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

121
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,840
She can't wear motion sickness patches
for the rest of her life.

122
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,552
No, but if it does relive her symptoms
it'll narrow down our search.

123
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,055
Anything else
you two guys wanna agree on?

124
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,581
You have a problem
with us agreeing?

125
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,843
No, I have a problem with the other
thing you're doing,

126
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,393
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

127
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,354
I'll put her
back on the patch. What else?

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,064
It's gotta be something
neurological.

129
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,982
We should do a CT,
look for a brain tumor.

130
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,817
Could also be an allergy
or something environmental.

131
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:29,944
We should check her home.

132
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,529
Bit more likely she got
sick in Caracas than in New Jersey.

133
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,907
Right, I forgot.
There are no toxins in the US.

134
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,201
I think I'm starting to
feel sorry for House.

135
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,621
Get a tox screen, chem-20,
STD panel, blood cultures.

136
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,082
Then you run a CT
and you check her house.

137
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,876
Please.

138
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,716
Not funny.

139
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,260
Wasn't supposed
to be funny ha-ha.

140
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,596
Fever, headache,
severe abdominal pain,

141
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,807
and a rash
all over his lower back.

142
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,101
It's serious. Maybe contagious.

143
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,854
We just attended a symposium
on pandemics

144
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,782
and you run right into one
on the flight home.

145
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,691
Talk about a small world.

146
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,775
If it's meningococcus,

147
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,111
half the passengers on this plane could
get infected and die

148
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,862
before we reach New York.

149
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,698
- Is someone sick?
- No.

150
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,742
Someone has a hangover.

151
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,578
He had a snootload
of Bloody Marys before dinner.

152
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,665
Watch the movie.

153
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,213
That booze did not give him the rash.
It is textbook meningococcus.

154
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,049
It's also textbook
allergic reaction to pollen,

155
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,678
peanuts, and the semen-stained
polyester blanket he's lying on.

156
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,680
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

157
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,058
- We have to turn around.
- What? Why do we have to...

158
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,935
We don't. You misunderstood.

159
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,896
Dr. Cuddy just meant
that he might feel less nauseous

160
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,857
if he was facing
in a different direction.

161
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,824
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

162
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,610
We're about to head
over the North Pole.

163
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,572
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

164
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,782
He'll be fine.
I'm a doctor, too.

165
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,992
You haven't examined him.

166
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,412
Korean male, mid 30s,
5'9", 160, bald,

167
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,623
scar on the right side of his jaw, medic
alert bracelet on his left wrist

168
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,084
indicating that he's allergic to,
at least, penicillin.

169
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,379
Without any way to do an LP
or rule out meningococcus,

170
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,590
our only choice
is to assume the worst.

171
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,260
Good point. On the other hand,
I am a board-certified specialist

172
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,636
in infectious disease.

173
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,389
She assigns parking spaces.

174
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,435
Please let me know
if he gets any worse.

175
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,788
Think we should feed the cat?

176
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,373
Bowl's full.

177
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,834
If he wants it, he can get it.
Cadmium yellow?

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,480
Heavy metal poisoning would explain
the ataxia and the seizures.

179
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,589
Not unless she was painting
with her tongue.

180
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,341
Was Foreman right?

181
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,636
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

182
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,930
- "Relationship"?
- You know what I mean.

183
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,016
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship.

184
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,227
I mean, because
we're having sex.

185
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,354
Yes. Foreman's right.

186
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,606
I thought you were completely wrong
about the medicine,

187
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,816
but agreed with you anyway

188
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,277
because I figured then
you'd do me in some old lady's home.

189
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,696
Then well played.

190
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,118
Come on, we're supposed to be
looking for toxins.

191
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,163
We agreed
it was a brain tumor. What?

192
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,210
He's watching.

193
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,878
Haven't you had
anybody watch before?

194
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,983
- Is that guy really sick?
- No.

195
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,444
- He's all better.
- I don't believe you.

196
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,157
- Look that way.
- Why?

197
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,869
Because you're gonna throw up
and I don't want it on me.

198
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,841
I'll get some towels.

199
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,387
Give her a banana. Monkey see,
monkey barf. You smell vomit...

200
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,645
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

201
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,321
I need help.

202
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,323
Who doesn't?

203
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,699
I need someone to talk to.

204
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,373
Can you say, "Crikey, mate"?

205
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,584
- Crikey, mate.
- Perfect.

206
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,213
Now no matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

207
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,715
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

208
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,552
And you disagree
with everything I say.

209
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,763
Sorry. Not understanding.

210
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,640
That's close enough.

211
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,893
And you get morally outraged
at everything I say.

212
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,937
That's a permanent marker,
you know.

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,730
Wow.

214
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,440
You guys are good.

215
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,362
We are looking for the simplest way
to explain these symptoms.

216
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,035
Organophosphate poisoning. Some
international flights spray pesticides.

217
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,163
Could be.

218
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,790
Sorry, English not so nice.

219
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,500
Is this a joke?

220
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,210
Just passed the halfway mark.

221
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,837
- Can't turn around. Nice call.
- No worries.

222
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,174
- We think it's pesticide poisoning.
- We don't spray these flights.

223
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,425
Dramamine overdose.

224
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,718
Wouldn't explain the fever.

225
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,764
- Jet lag.
- Wouldn't explain the abdominal pain.

226
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,139
- Deep vein thrombosis.
- Wouldn't explain the nausea.

227
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,766
Food poisoning.
What was on the menu?

228
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,352
Steak and sea bass
in First Class.

229
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,145
Fettuccine
and seafood kebabs in Economy.

230
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,481
Since when does food poisoning
cause a rash?

231
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,693
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass.

232
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,194
Please tell me
she had the kebabs.

233
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,655
I think so.

234
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,073
Ciguatera poisoning.

235
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,659
It's an instant-onset toxin.

236
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,453
Symptoms include...
E. All of the above.

237
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,957
It's only found in certain kinds
of tropical game fish such as...

238
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,667
Sea bass?

239
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,377
Make sure you get
a resume from him.

240
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,467
- Hello?
- Excuse me.

241
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,471
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief
announcement concerning your meals.

242
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,099
If you ate the sea bass
or the seafood kebabs,

243
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,809
you have ingested
a dangerous toxin.

244
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,229
However, if you proceed to the restrooms
both on your left and right

245
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,690
at the rear of the plane
and vomit as soon as possible,

246
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,359
the toxic effect should be minimal.

247
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,574
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

248
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,494
Meningococcus makes
just as much sense.

249
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,746
I know.

250
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,591
What did you find?

251
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,635
Nothing in her house.
Big waste of time.

252
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,594
Medically.

253
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
CT was a complete waste.

254
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,098
She was negative for tumors,
her blood was negative for drugs,

255
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,769
heavy metals, tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

256
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,146
Also no sign of
lead poisoning or sepsis.

257
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,608
Apparently Venezuelan
tattoo parlors have standards after all.

258
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,401
Good to know.

259
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,236
We sure she's even sick?

260
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,988
Two more seizures
in the last two hours.

261
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,284
Which is slower than she was having
them before you put the patch back on.

262
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,496
I'm an idiot.

263
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,916
She's exposed herself to so much crap
I just assumed it was a zebra.

264
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,502
It's breast cancer.

265
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,505
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by motion sickness meds?

266
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,883
It's not. But the inflammation
caused by the paraneoplastic syndrome

267
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,637
caused by the cancer can be reduced
by anticholinergics.

268
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,771
Hey, here you go.

269
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,189
Is he gonna die?

270
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,277
We're doing all we can. We don't know
what's wrong with him yet.

271
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,779
Am I gonna die?

272
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,822
No.

273
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,865
Here, chew on these.

274
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,751
Good news is all the pilots
are red meat men.

275
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,380
Although I was kind of looking forward
to landing this puppy myself.

276
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,298
Peng's getting worse.

277
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,717
That makes sense.

278
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,094
First Class ate before Coach.

279
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,221
He digested more of his food
before he threw up.

280
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,558
Or you're wrong and we're gonna start
seeing neurological symptoms soon.

281
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,227
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

282
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,273
We're not gonna see ataxia.

283
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,692
- You're so sure you're right.
- No.

284
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,138
It's just hard to show clumsiness
when you're lying moaning

285
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,779
in a fetal position.

286
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,328
Hey, stand up.

287
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,623
Does nobody
speak Korean on this flight?

288
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,666
I assumed you did.

289
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,802
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18,

290
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,003
I just don't think
that's gonna help.

291
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,757
Hey, stand up. Stand up.

292
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,261
Don't play the cripple card
with me.

293
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,618
Oh, hi. I'm leaving.

294
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Work.

295
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,079
Okay.

296
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,540
- Important client.
- Sure.

297
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,048
Listen.

298
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,969
Are you close?

299
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,429
Why?

300
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,477
She needs a mammogram.

301
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,853
Oh, God.

302
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,191
I know I'm throwing a lot at you.
She just has no family in town.

303
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,612
And I really think she could
use a friend right now.

304
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,625
Okay. Put your hand here.

305
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,381
You don't have to stay.

306
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,218
No, it's no problem.

307
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,719
But why?

308
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,930
You don't even know me.

309
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,267
You gotta be scared.

310
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,313
- I almost hope it's breast cancer.
- No.

311
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,773
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

312
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,025
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

313
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,446
That's not true.
You can control things.

314
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,615
Not everything.

315
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,202
But you don't have to take stupid risks.
I was being an idiot.

316
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,495
You were having fun.

317
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,875
You have regrets?

318
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah.

319
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,047
Robin?

320
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,560
Hold still.

321
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,608
Good.

322
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,155
Okay, we're gonna get just one more.
I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

323
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,823
It's not that.

324
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,202
It's my eye. My right eye.

325
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,955
I can't see.

326
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,794
It's definitely ataxia.
And it's definitely a rash.

327
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,005
You gonna look at it for five more
minutes before concluding

328
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,256
it's also definitely a leg?

329
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,633
Thin leg.

330
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,217
- It's been in a cast.
- So?

331
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,705
So it could be
radiation poisoning.

332
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,762
From a broken leg?

333
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,295
From the x-rays
they took of it.

334
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,348
He could break
every bone in his body

335
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,915
and still not have enough x-rays
to cause radiation sickness.

336
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,604
Unless those x-rays were performed
in Wankoff, North Korea,

337
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,231
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

338
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,025
Which accounts
for the absence of fur.

339
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,319
Radiation poisoning accounts
for all his symptoms.

340
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,572
I have hair. I haven't had an x-ray
since I got my teeth whitened.

341
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,783
You're pregnant.

342
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:25,742
I'm what?

343
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,870
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever,

344
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,415
and why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

345
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,375
And her rash?

346
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,460
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.

347
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,711
I can't be pregnant.

348
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,171
You a virgin?

349
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,882
- No, but...
- You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

350
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,134
Let's get him into the chair.

351
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,137
Two different diagnoses.

352
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,065
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

353
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,683
I believe in statistics.

354
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,979
Two hundred passengers
on the plane, 10 should be gay,

355
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,816
two should be with child,
and one should be incredibly annoying

356
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,818
- with an extra ass chromosome.
- House.

357
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,071
Get him some iodized salt to protect
his thyroid. I'm going back...

358
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,280
House.

359
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,450
You're wrong.

360
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,806
I said we should have turned back.
You should have listened to me.

361
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,599
Now we're eight miles
over the Arctic...

362
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm trying to listen
to you now, so shut up.

363
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,565
Heart's fine.

364
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,609
Breasts are firm.

365
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,069
Is it contagious?

366
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,030
A lot of the passengers
are scared.

367
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,448
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

368
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,284
- Is there something to worry about?
- Yeah.

369
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,789
Tell them there's nothing to worry
about. And get me a flashlight.

370
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,920
Cover your left eye with this.

371
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,557
Photophobia.

372
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,560
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

373
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,104
I'll call down to the pharmacy.

374
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,443
You're creeping me out.

375
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,569
Then get me a lab.

376
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,531
Pseudomonas smell yeasty,
staph smells musty,

377
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,826
and some liver disease
smell of ammonia.

378
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,412
House. I'm not in heat.

379
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:38,625
Citrus-y on the nose with a blush
of toasted coconut.

380
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,430
I need to get a better look
at your rash.

381
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,723
Use your imagination.

382
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,811
Fine, should I go with Lifeguard Cuddy
or Mother Superior Cuddy?

383
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,021
Three more passengers are sick.

384
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,942
If we don't get drugs, we're gonna have
a lot of dead passengers.

385
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,994
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not breast cancer.

386
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,121
It's likely neurological.

387
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,539
I just met her today.

388
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,844
You should go.

389
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,345
She needs someone here.

390
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,472
That's not your job.

391
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,873
Please let me know
that she's okay.

392
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,547
It's just sex.

393
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,636
There's no such thing.

394
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,301
Other eye.

395
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,316
Are you saying women can't separate
the physical from the emotional?

396
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,347
No one does it well,
women do it worse.

397
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,600
You just want us to stop
because you think it's affecting...

398
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,351
Me. Yeah.

399
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,856
Polyspikes are over 01 and 02.

400
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,774
That's her left eye.

401
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,735
Burst suppression
on every lead.

402
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,406
Fran?

403
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,494
She's comatose.

404
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,792
Nothing. Nothing.

405
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,628
Nothing.

406
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,422
Come on, nobody has no meds!

407
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,761
- Excuse me.
- Open your mouth.

408
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,264
Where's the acyclovir?

409
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm not on any meds.

410
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,061
Well, you better get some.
You've got herpes.

411
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:16,407
What do you know? He's got some.
This must be your lucky day.

412
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,161
This is for real.
People are sick.

413
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,249
Some of us will be deplaning in
body bags unless you cough up.

414
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,710
- Here. Over here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

415
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,088
Thank you.

416
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,216
God bless you.

417
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,344
Her brain is shutting down
because of intracranial pressure.

418
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,720
Or her nerves are dying.

419
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,430
Because of
the increased pressure.

420
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,431
She has a bleed in her brain.

421
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,599
You said the CT showed...

422
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,602
No tumors. But if she has an AVM
leading to a cerebral hemorrhage,

423
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,009
we could've missed it.
She needs a burr hole to relieve...

424
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,440
You wanna drill into her brain
because of an invisible bleed

425
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,192
the CT couldn't see?

426
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,820
We should do an LP to confirm
the presence of red blood cells.

427
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,239
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

428
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,324
Right. Better to kill her
in the OR.

429
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,701
Chase, what do you think?

430
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,244
Here's a cliffhanger.

431
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,664
I think it would help to know
what she has

432
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,333
before we start digging into her brain.

433
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,213
Might be better to
play it safe to start. Do an LP.

434
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,508
Sex better be damn good.

435
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,519
Lot of apples,
not many candy bars.

436
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,146
Any antibiotics?

437
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,315
Three caps of Augmentin.

438
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:31,858
For six patients.

439
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,486
Give them to Peng.

440
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,904
He's allergic to penicillin.

441
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,823
The First Aid kit
has two epi pens.

442
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,784
If he has a severe reaction,
10 epi pens won't save him.

443
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,578
- You take the pills.
- He's worse.

444
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,371
He's a guy who doesn't
speak English.

445
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,581
Give him the meds.

446
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,000
If it's not meningitis,
we're risking his life

447
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,501
and flushing meds down the toilet.

448
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,880
Then do an LP on him.
If it's clear, you win.

449
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,634
If it's cloudy he gets
the Augmentin. And we risk a reaction.

450
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,639
Sounds like a plan. All except for the
part where we don't have an LP needle.

451
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,809
And the shaking of the plane means
I'll probably pierce his spinal cord

452
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,980
and cripple him for life. But, I mean,
it totally sounds like a plan.

453
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:17,195
You're right. Let him die.
Give me the meds.

454
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,695
- Got it.
- Damn.

455
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,197
What is it?

456
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,491
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.

457
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,160
Just tell me
what the hell it is.

458
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,164
House. We should have
turned back.

459
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,166
We should have turned back.

460
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,169
House.

461
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,342
Hold this.

462
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,684
Ladies and gentlemen,

463
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,771
we have a passenger with a confirmed
case of bacterial meningitis.

464
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,485
Unless we land as soon as possible,
the passenger will not survive.

465
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,696
It's very likely that some
of you have been infected as well.

466
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,158
As soon as you start feeling symptoms,
we need to isolate you

467
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:31,537
in the First Class cabin.
Fever, rash, nausea,

468
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:36,417
and in the late stages
tremor in the left hand.

469
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,714
- I've got that.
- Oh, God.

470
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,223
- What do we do?
- Break out the bubbly.

471
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,183
Yo, listen up.

472
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,024
The bad news is, you have an illness.
The good news is, it's not meningitis.

473
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,570
It's not fatal,
it's just embarrassing.

474
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,865
It's conversion disorder,
more commonly known as mass hysteria.

475
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,912
It happens often in high-anxiety
situations, especially to women.

476
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,332
I know it sounds sexist, but science
says you're weak and soft.

477
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,291
What can I do?

478
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,335
House, you're wrong.

479
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,836
Look at my hand.

480
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,797
Yeah. Look at her hand.

481
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,882
Shaking left hand.
What is that a symptom of?

482
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,718
Not meningitis. It's basically
a symptom of nothing.

483
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,513
I put the idea
into their heads and watched it happen.

484
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,641
Same thing Peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

485
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,809
The rash is in my head?

486
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,061
Your mind controls your body.

487
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,814
If it thinks you're sick,
it makes you sick.

488
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,358
It just started.

489
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,780
If you'll all just calm down,
your symptoms will soon go away.

490
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,282
And to facilitate this process,

491
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,661
your flight crew will move through the
cabin with a complimentary bar service.

492
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,831
Thank you and, as always,
have a pleasant flight.

493
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,675
- Still feel like puking?
- No.

494
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,063
How did you know?

495
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,315
LP was negative.

496
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,818
I came up with an alternate theory
and I tested it.

497
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:30,448
Couldn't have done it without you.
Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria.

498
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:35,202
Just one more thing to clean up.
Peng set off the mass hysteria.

499
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,747
What set off Peng?

500
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,918
- He really is dying.
- Yeah.

501
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,630
I haven't the
faintest idea why.

502
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,849
What's extension pasturing?

503
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,645
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

504
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,566
Do we really need these three?

505
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,401
Worried they'll make you
look bad?

506
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,988
Could be symptomatic
of head trauma, cerebral infarction,

507
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,158
or intracranial hemorrhage.
Thoughts?

508
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,660
How long until we land?

509
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:16,786
Too long to wait.

510
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,330
His head's as smooth
as a baby's bottom, no bumps.

511
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,790
So I think we can
rule out head trauma.

512
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,251
But you gotta choose between
what's left, a clog or a leak?

513
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,878
You're talking of toilet?

514
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,714
House, is this
actually helpful?

515
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,050
Not so far.

516
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,220
What about syphilis?

517
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,932
Well, first of all, he apparently speaks
a language no one else speaks,

518
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,226
which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

519
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:41,594
We're flying out of Singapore.

520
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:45,439
If he has a credit card and a condom,
he can get anything he wants.

521
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,609
What?

522
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,320
Condoms.

523
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,035
He has focal limb paralysis.

524
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,454
His legs got paralyzed
by a condom?

525
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,956
No, by cocaine.

526
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,791
It was inside the condom.

527
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,961
It's now spreading
through his digestive tract.

528
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,462
You think he's a mule.

529
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,297
I think he's a jackass.

530
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,551
- We're gonna have to operate.
- Cool!

531
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,490
- They're gonna kill her.
- We were wrong.

532
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,367
Which means Foreman was right.

533
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,330
Maybe Foreman's right about us, too.
Maybe we should just stop all this.

534
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,832
I mean, if it's
affecting our jobs.

535
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,584
It's not affecting our jobs.

536
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,255
We had sex in a patient's bedroom.
A bedroom we were examining for toxins.

537
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,215
Yeah, our judgment's right
on the mark.

538
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,385
All right. No more sex in patient's
homes, no more sex with cats watching.

539
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,929
Anywhere else you wanna
cross off the list?

540
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,140
- The bowl.
- What?

541
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,793
Has she eaten
since she's been here?

542
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,604
She's been sick
since she's been here.

543
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,773
- What if it's a symptom?
- Well, why would you think...

544
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,441
The bowl was full.

545
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,372
You're gonna need to
hold him down. He's not gonna like this.

546
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,126
Do you really think
he's a mule?

547
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,127
Fits the symptoms.

548
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,756
You sure he's not contagious?

549
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,090
Pretty much.

550
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,802
You can't be pretty much sure.
Means you're not sure.

551
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, aren't you clever?

552
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,516
Come on.

553
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,520
I know you're pretty much
unconscious,

554
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,273
but as has been pointed out
to me, pretty much doesn't mean squat.

555
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,591
Okay, hold him tight.

556
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,637
The faster we do this, the less likely
he is to die of shock.

557
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,398
Tighter.

558
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,491
- Sorry.
- Do that again.

559
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,078
Ease off and then press down.

560
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,269
Pressure on his joints
relieves his pain.

561
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,521
- Okay.
- Wrong again.

562
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,857
Where's his wallet?

563
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,465
Scuba certification card.

564
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,345
- Big deal. I have one of these.
- Yeah.

565
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,142
But do you also have a receipt from
Tekong's Scuba Rental dated yesterday?

566
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,480
Tell the Captain to drop as low
as he can, under 5,000 feet.

567
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,899
- We're at 38,000...
- Peng's got the bends.

568
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,109
He went diving yesterday.

569
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,029
Like an idiot, he surfaced too quickly,
and like a bigger idiot,

570
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,365
he boarded a flight which is pressurized
to 8,000 feet above sea level.

571
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,034
Low pressure is killing him.

572
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,620
Tell the pilot to dive until we can
club baby seals out of the window.

573
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,373
And get him some oxygen.

574
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:51,513
Fifty years ago, it was one estate. The
two homes shared an electrical system.

575
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,891
Unfortunately,
the exterminator didn't know that,

576
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,684
so when they fumigated
next door,

577
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,479
the poison gas flowed through the
old pipe and into your house.

578
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,648
The scopolamine patch
was masking the effects of the poison.

579
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:06,153
You'll have to stay here for a few more
days, but after that you should be fine.

580
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,531
I'm sorry about your cat.

581
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,909
And your hair.

582
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,122
For 12 years, Harrington
never left the property.

583
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,960
I thought I was being punished
for going away,

584
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,383
but really I was being
punished for coming home.

585
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,704
- Thank you.
- I saved your life. You owe me.

586
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,664
I wasn't sick.

587
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,125
But you didn't know that.
You owe me.

588
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,668
I know it now.

589
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,339
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia, vomit.

590
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,468
How do you know it wouldn't have
shut down your cold, cold heart next?

591
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,722
I don't owe you.

592
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,601
You're mean.

593
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,690
That's how I compensate
for being weak and soft.

594
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,864
I just wanted to say thank you.

595
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,407
You're extremely welcome.

596
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,367
And I'm in New York
every Monday.

597
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,203
Are you handicap accessible?

598
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,133
Hi, Robin?

599
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,095
This is Dr. Wilson.

600
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,931
Fran's doctor. James.

601
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,563
It was a toxin. We caught it in time,
and she's gonna be fine.

602
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,357
Yeah, it is.

603
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:16,408
Listen, I was just wondering if you were
coming back in again to visit.

604
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,996
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

605
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,564
Think even House
would be impressed.

606
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,458
I don't know about that.

607
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,293
Any idea how
you wanna celebrate?

608
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,255
What?

609
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,507
I want more.

610
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,177
I thought you were getting
a little worn out by...

611
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,054
No, that's not what I meant.

612
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,348
I know.

613
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,936
I was just hoping you'd take the hint
and pretend you never said that.

614
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,813
I want this to be
more than it is.

615
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,690
I thought we were clear.

616
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,859
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me...

617
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,238
Yes, I can. And I don't.

618
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,534
It was fun. That's it.

619
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,540
And now it's over.
