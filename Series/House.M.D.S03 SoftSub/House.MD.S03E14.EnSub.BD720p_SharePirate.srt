1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:04,879
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,381
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,635
I tripped on the ice. Eight other kids
tripped. This is embarrassing.

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,012
You said you were just going to
hang with your friends.

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,557
I turn around,
and you're out there on the ice.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,059
I'm fine.

7
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:19,769
You don't know that.

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,146
You fell awkwardly.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,523
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,816
You don't know how to fall.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,068
I'm 16.
I've been falling a lot.

12
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,154
I think I'm getting
the hang of it. And I checked.

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,118
And now the doctors
are going to check.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,912
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,914
I don't need you
to fix every booboo.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,457
Then stop getting them.

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,960
I was just playing around
with my friends. I was having fun.

18
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,253
You know you can't do that.

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,671
Oh, I can't have fun.

20
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,758
You know what I mean. I'm going to have
a talk with your friends.

21
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,510
- No!
- They need to stop.

22
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,179
No, I don't want you
freaking them out.

23
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,976
Fine.
Fine, we'll go to the hospital,

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:00,977
but they're going
to tell you that I'm fine,

25
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,744
and they're going to tell you
that you don't need to worry about...

26
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,065
Mom!

27
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,647
Mom?

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,903
Hello?

29
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,503
Mom, you gotta wake up.
No one's coming. Mom!

30
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,679
911, what's your emergency?

31
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,558
We got into an accident along the Canal
Road just outside Kingston.

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,310
My mom's unconscious.

33
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,521
Are you hurt?

34
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,358
I'm fine.

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,697
Mom? Mom?

36
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,574
Where's Foreman?

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,992
He's down here somewhere.

38
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,578
"Somewhere." Very helpful.

39
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,581
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

40
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,040
Sometime.

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
I realize you can't predict.

42
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,087
I just thought you might be
able to estimate. It's Valentine's Day.

43
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,714
I've planned
a surprise getaway.

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,452
Get away.

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,686
Is my mom okay?

46
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,479
She's gone to surgery.

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:58,613
Foreman, your girlfriend wants to know
if you're available for Valentine's.

48
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,199
Act surprised.
What are you doing down here?

49
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,453
There's a snowstorm. ER's short-staffed.
We're all supposed to be here.

50
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,706
You're supposed to be here.
You're an ass. Act surprised.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,627
This could sting a little.

52
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,632
- Can we hurry this up?
- Make sure that...

53
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,093
Take your time.
What's your name?

54
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,430
Hannah Morganthal.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,516
You have CIPA,
Hannah Morganthal.

56
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,185
No, I don't.

57
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,480
We have to do x-rays to make sure
you don't have internal injuries,

58
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,148
blood tests to make sure
no infections.

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,779
EEG for neurological anomalies
and biopsy a spinal nerve.

60
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:44,575
Congenital insensitivity to pain is one
of the rarest conditions on the planet.

61
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,869
There's only been
about 60 documented cases.

62
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:51,248
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think that she's one of them.

63
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,583
She says she's not.

64
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,502
And that's reason number one.

65
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,348
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

66
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,509
Two, she's still wet from the snow.
She's not shivering. That's odd,

67
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,886
unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

68
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,930
The ambulance was warm.

69
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,098
I want to see my mother.

70
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,058
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,353
When she was a baby, she chewed
on herself without feeling it.

72
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,771
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

73
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,648
Four, when you cleaned
the wound,

74
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,317
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,570
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

76
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,782
It takes an imaginative leap,
Ms. Morganthal.

77
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,867
That's one of them Jew names.

78
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,204
Ashkenazis are a
higher-risk group.

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,540
On the other hand,
she says she doesn't have it,

80
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,126
and she'd be dead by now
if she'd never been diagnosed.

81
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,587
They killed our Lord.
You're going to trust them?

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,425
She wants to see her mom.
She admits having CIPA,

83
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,594
she knows we're not letting her go
anywhere without a battery of tests.

84
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,971
You said you had seven reasons.

85
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,806
I pulled a number
out of the air.

86
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,224
What, five isn't enough?

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,184
Five lame reasons aren't.

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,353
I'm taking her to
see her mom as soon as...

89
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,108
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

90
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,404
Do the tests.

91
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,909
Need to bail on the ER.
I got a case.

92
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,660
Why are you wearing perfume?

93
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,124
Is this a real case

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,085
or one of those imaginary cases
that happen when you're bored?

95
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,837
CIPA.

96
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,589
CIPA is a diagnosis.

97
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,509
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

98
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,845
She's got no idea
what's going on in her body.

99
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,180
There's bound to be
something wrong.

100
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,973
In other words,
she could be perfectly healthy,

101
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,768
but you're curious
about someone who can't feel pain

102
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,729
because you always feel pain,
so you want to go exploring.

103
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,440
She was in a car accident.

104
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,777
She needs x-rays, blood tests, EEG,
nerve biopsy.

105
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,363
I also note that, although snow is
coming down in sheets this morning,

106
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,533
you left your hat at home,
and you used earmuffs.

107
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,951
Do your tests,
except for the...

108
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,359
So while everyone else
was just worrying about getting in,

109
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,498
you were concerned
with hat head.

110
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,086
Blind dates are
never a good idea.

111
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,840
Only reason to wear a scarf like that is
as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.

112
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,676
Do your tests,
except for the nerve biopsy.

113
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,964
- I need the nerve biopsy.
- You'd risk paralyzing her.

114
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,180
It's neurological.

115
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,182
You have no evidence of that.

116
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,934
She tripped.

117
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,812
Do you have any evidence,
other than the fact

118
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,065
that a typically clumsy CIPA patient
tripped on an icy day?

119
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,904
If the EEG reveals a problem,
we can talk then.

120
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,202
Could have left the scarf
at home and just told him

121
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,204
you'd be wearing
a look of desperation.

122
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,502
Spiking on leads C-3 and O-2.

123
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,670
She could be going into
a seizure.

124
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,089
Hello?
I think there's a simpler explanation.

125
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:50,010
You're not going to find anything.
I'm fine! I want to see my mom!

126
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,096
So sedate her.

127
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,597
She won't consent.

128
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,890
She's a teenager.

129
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,892
No dad. Mom's still in surgery.

130
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,061
What do you want us to do?
Hold her down?

131
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,067
Well, only until you inject her with a
sedative. Then you can let her go.

132
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,399
We tried.

133
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,525
Seriously?

134
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,528
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

135
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,530
before we can get her to sit
still enough to inject her.

136
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,283
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

137
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,161
- You're cranky.
- I'm in pain.

138
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,873
Come on,
let's go break her arm.

139
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,504
Nurse Shortie, your biznitch, how long
are you going to waste her time?

140
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,298
I'm so glad
we're walking somewhere.

141
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,133
Another 60 feet,
and this conversation is over.

142
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,859
When you guys are out of this program,
Cameron will find somebody,

143
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,472
Chase will find eight somebodies,
and you'll be alone.

144
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,600
Thirty feet.
You'll date, and you'll date,

145
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,436
but you're the ultimate Darwinian.
You have to fight for everything.

146
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,479
- Anybody else would just slow you down.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,564
I'm still with her, aren't I?

148
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,773
Yeah.

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,651
I can only imagine it's because she
hasn't given you an excuse to break up,

150
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,238
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

151
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,575
I want to see my mother.

152
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,701
Hi again.

153
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,906
I'm sure I could say this
without being condescending,

154
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,081
but then you'd get the false impression
that I respect you,

155
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,711
so you're a kid, you're scared,
you're stalling, grow up.

156
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,631
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

157
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,217
See? How juvenile was that?

158
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,386
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,305
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

160
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,514
It sucks.

161
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,016
Better than being
in pain all the time.

162
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,726
Get in the chair.

163
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,686
Every morning,
I have to check my eyes

164
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,812
to make sure I didn't scratch a cornea
in my sleep.

165
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,108
Oh, God, stop.
I'm in a pool of tears here.

166
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,401
I can't cry.

167
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,611
Neither can I.

168
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,491
Every morning,
I check my eyes for jaundice

169
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,660
in case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

170
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,496
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes

171
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,581
- for swelling.
- I can't run.

172
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
Boys can't hold me
for too long because I can overheat.

173
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,003
Girls can't hold me for too long because
I only pay for an hour.

174
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,299
I need an alarm on my watch
to remind me to go to the bathroom.

175
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,905
Know how many humiliating
experiences before I thought of that?

176
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,846
Bathroom is 50 feet
from my office. Every drink of water,

177
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,223
I weigh the pros and cons.

178
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,475
After everything I do,
I self-check.

179
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,770
Mouth, tongue, gums for cuts, count
teeth, check temperature,

180
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,815
fingers, toes and joints
for swelling, skin for bruises.

181
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,816
I got shot.

182
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,117
I sat on a stove when I was three.
Want to see the coil marks?

183
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,743
- Yeah.
- You think I'm lying?

184
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,662
You think I would just want to
check out your tuchus,

185
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,664
as your people would say?

186
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:37,219
Put her in the chair and run the test.
If she moves again, give her nitrous.

187
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,722
You weren't shot because of leg pain.
You were shot because you're a jerk.

188
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,308
Some think
the two are connected.

189
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,442
He didn't have to do that.

190
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,068
Yeah, he did.

191
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,486
I'm sick?

192
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,447
No, your EEG was normal.

193
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,365
X-ray showed no break.

194
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,652
Blood tests showed no infections.
Urine indicated no...

195
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,619
Hannah?

196
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,374
Call a code! Oh, God.

197
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,877
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

198
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,297
- Got saline in there?
- She's not flushed.

199
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,744
She's not sweating.
You must be...

200
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,966
She has a temperature of 105.

201
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,402
Wow, she's actually sick.

202
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,155
We got her temperature down below
boiling. It could be infection.

203
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,533
No, LP showed normal proteins
and no white blood cells.

204
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,911
High bilirubin.
Could be a liver problem.

205
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,789
- Nope, transaminases were normal.
- Could be drugs.

206
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,415
She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

207
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,125
No again. Tox screen was clean.

208
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,543
We're doing
this case backwards.

209
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,087
We do the tests,
and then she gets sick?

210
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,173
Maybe we did something to her.
Maybe she got sick after the tests.

211
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,092
We should rerun them.

212
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,303
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

213
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,511
You want to risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

214
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,478
I want to risk paralysis because I don't
know what's causing the fever.

215
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,313
- If it's neurological...
- It's a fever.

216
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,943
In a CIPA patient. Obviously things are
different in her upstairs wiring.

217
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,070
And have been since
the day she was born.

218
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,696
Yeah, it's much more likely

219
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,408
that whatever it is was cleverly
waiting and hiding

220
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,814
until you guys
were done testing.

221
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:24,910
Where are you going?

222
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,371
You're all against this, right?

223
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,500
And you're all going to stand on
principle and refuse to do it, right?

224
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,337
I'm going to get
Cuddy's approval.

225
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,260
How long are we going to keep
Hannah in the dark about her mother?

226
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,886
Long as possible.

227
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,305
Side airbags
should be standard.

228
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,266
I'm sure she'll agree.

229
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,061
She should know
her mother's situation.

230
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,524
Breaking that news
is that surgeon's problem.

231
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,693
Any word from House?

232
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,902
No.

233
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,239
Well, maybe Cuddy will say no.

234
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,782
Cuddy never says no.

235
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,117
That's not true.

236
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,162
Nobody ever says no.
We don't say no.

237
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,413
You don't say no.

238
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,582
He'll come back.
He'll browbeat us.

239
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
He'll give us seven reasons,
and eventually we'll fold.

240
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,794
We all will, not just me.

241
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,882
The only way we can avoid biopsying
this kid's spine

242
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,508
is to find the answer
some other way.

243
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,510
All the tests were negative.

244
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,761
We need a better history.

245
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,580
How much more paperwork
do you need?

246
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,558
We've got pediatric records,
a few dozen ER records,

247
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,810
our own admission
questionnaire.

248
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,602
What's the first question?

249
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,439
Insurance coverage.

250
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,648
Okay, second question.

251
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,567
Just make your point.

252
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,653
"Where does it hurt?"

253
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,910
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

254
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,241
You do know CIPA means
she can't feel pain.

255
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,119
No, CIPA means she's
insensitive to pain.

256
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,645
She still has scattered nerve fibers
that could conduct pain,

257
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,582
but the signals don't make
it to the brain.

258
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,587
What if we give her more
pain signals, a lot more pain signals?

259
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,274
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

260
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,548
You want to torture her?

261
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
No.

262
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,428
Yes, we do this
to anybody else, it's torture.

263
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,972
Doing it to her
is no different than pricking a finger.

264
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,391
We keep poking sharp sticks
into her,

265
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:16,355
eventually we'll find the part
that's already tender.

266
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,902
So what does
a Dean of Medicine do?

267
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,279
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

268
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,449
I will talk about anything else.
I'm just trying to get away from work.

269
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,995
Metaphorically, because geographically,
the coffee place

270
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,521
around the corner from the hospital

271
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,249
probably isn't the furthest you could
get.

272
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,625
Well, the snow!

273
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,876
The roads are clearing,

274
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,047
but it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

275
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,093
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

276
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,387
Experience has taught me
to have an escape route.

277
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,931
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

278
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,150
Whatever happens,
I need you to understand

279
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,988
that there are certain aspects to my
life I'm not happy about.

280
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,782
Need a nerve biopsy.

281
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,994
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that?

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,560
And how did you even know
I was here?

283
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,623
I had to bring the file,

284
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,668
and this was the most noncommittal
location in walking distance.

285
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,338
You left your car keys
in your desk. Greg House.

286
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,550
You two must have met online.

287
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,996
Either that, or you've got a friend
who secretly hates you.

288
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,431
Don Herrick.

289
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,269
Yeah, we connected through
SingleBallroomDanceLovers.com.

290
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,066
Why would he volunteer
that information?

291
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,568
Why would I hide it?

292
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,946
You didn't tell him that anything he
said would be held against you?

293
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,688
So what line of work
are you in?

294
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,909
Auto maintenance,
changing oil and filters.

295
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,497
Great, 'cause my place overcharges.
Can't trust anything you guys say.

296
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,624
Where are you located?

297
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,835
In 14 states.
I own Eastern Lube.

298
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,552
Most CIPA complications
are infection, and she's got a fever.

299
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,554
LP? Urine?

300
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,306
Clean. Normal.

301
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,266
Same with
the white-blood-cell count.

302
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,268
- Cancer?
- Nothing on the scan.

303
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,479
I think it's her nerves
messing with the temperature control.

304
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,898
Amyloid, sarcoid,
there's a lot of candidates.

305
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,775
I want a biopsy.

306
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,069
Fine, if that's what
you need, go get it.

307
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,824
He seems a lot nicer

308
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,203
than that one
from WiccaNeedsADaddyFigure.com.

309
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,339
One of these is warm,

310
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,384
and the other is very hot.

311
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:56,181
Start here. Move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds, then back.

312
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,747
We're going to monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

313
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,398
If you feel any response to the heat,
it could indicate a vascular problem.

314
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,947
How's my mom doing?

315
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,741
She's okay.
Do you feel anything?

316
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,785
No.

317
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,162
What does "okay" mean?

318
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,914
She's still in surgery.

319
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,332
They tell me it's going okay.

320
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,209
Can you take your hand out?

321
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,752
And you didn't
ask anything else?

322
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,171
Take your hand
out of the water.

323
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,757
What's going on with my mother?

324
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,261
Hannah!

325
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,974
You just got
second-degree burns.

326
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,895
I'll be fine. What's going on
with my mother? Is she going to die?

327
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,440
They said she's okay.
Surgery this long

328
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,859
is typical when there are
internal injuries.

329
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,238
Naloxone and
kinase proteins in.

330
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,449
And that's going to make
me feel pain?

331
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,118
I didn't feel anything when you guys
screwed this thing into my head.

332
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,663
It'll replace missing chemicals in your
nerves, heighten sensitivity.

333
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,829
We're going to be drilling
directly into your skull.

334
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,752
A response should
indicate sarcoma.

335
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,420
What does it feel like?

336
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,505
It hurts.

337
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,680
Bone pain is the worst
there is, so you need

339
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,526
to let me know as soon
as you feel anything.

340
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,684
She's ready.

341
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,521
So, what, I just sit here
while you guys drill a hole in me?

342
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,192
You wanna talk?

343
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,697
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

344
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,743
We were, until I got arrested.
Third time.

345
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,912
- Drugs?
- Fights.

346
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,004
You got an advantage.

347
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,333
Not really.
Never know when to stop.

348
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,046
You piss a lot of people off, or are you
just trying to piss off your mom?

349
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,673
Those are pretty much
the only two choices you have.

350
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:03,308
Hannah? You want us to stop?
Stop the drill! Stop the drill!

351
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,902
It's okay. What did you feel?

352
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,865
Where did you feel it? Hannah, I need to
know how it hurt.

353
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,499
Hannah!

354
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,966
I am so tired of this.
Did you know

355
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,844
that the new nurse from Cardiology is
sleeping with that weird lawyer

356
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,970
from the board?

357
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,137
The guy with 11 fingers?

358
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,056
He has 11 fingers?

359
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,392
How do you not notice that?

360
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,312
The nurse used to be a man.

361
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,274
- She's not anymore?
- But we can't talk about that.

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,192
- I thought we were.
- We were supposed to talk about that.

363
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,863
I came here to talk about that, but on
the way up, I ran into Cameron.

364
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,282
You've got a CIPA patient?

365
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,325
Tranny nurse
is more interesting.

366
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,662
Oh, it's way more interesting, but
instead I've got to be your conscience.

367
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,331
I'm tired of being your conscience.
I don't enjoy being your conscience.

368
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,058
- No one enjoys...
- You're studying her.

369
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,251
She's actually sick.

370
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,587
Which you found out
after you took her on.

371
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,798
I was curious. Since I'm not a cat,
that's not dangerous.

372
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,135
I don't think that metaphor was designed
to actually warn cats.

373
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,387
You don't care about her illness.
You care about CIPA,

374
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,807
which means your focus is going to be
on getting your answers, not hers.

375
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,393
Thank you.
Forewarned is forearmed.

376
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,279
What do you think
you're going to figure out?

377
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,357
Do you think her lack of pain is
somehow the answer to your pain?

378
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,943
I think if you'd stop
talking to Cameron,

379
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,614
then right now we could be
ranking nurses in order of do-ability.

380
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,033
- I need you.
- What did the nerve biopsy show?

381
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,284
- Never did it.
- Well, then do it.

382
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,785
- Can't.
- Why?

383
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,537
She's gonna jump off
the lobby balcony.

384
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,581
You think I can catch her?

385
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,421
- Get away from me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

386
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,257
Yes, you are.
You're just jealous I can do anything.

387
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,301
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

388
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,302
I don't believe you.

389
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,762
Did you think she would?

390
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,265
This is real. You want me to be in pain.
You even said so.

391
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,893
If we wanted to hurt you,
we'd let you jump.

392
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,686
Just let me see my mother.

393
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,439
Fine, we'll take you
to our OR observation room.

394
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,441
- I don't believe you!
- Your mother is fine.

395
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,652
- I just spoke to her surgeon.
- I don't believe you!

396
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,405
Hannah, what do you
want from us? What do you want us to do?

397
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,991
I can't feel my legs.

398
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,358
You're trying to pull
the same stunt twice in 10 minutes.

399
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,957
I'm not pretending. They don't hurt.
They're just... They're...

400
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,433
Anything?
We're not looking for pain.

401
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,851
Anything at all? Pressure?

402
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,103
Nothing.

403
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,815
You have six broken bones, a fever,
a concussion, erratic heart rhythms

404
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,442
and a complete lack
of sensation below the waist.

405
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,653
I feel fine.

406
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,281
Is my mother
out of surgery yet?

407
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,783
Not yet.

408
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,120
This is excellent.

409
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,163
The paranoia seems
to have dissipated,

410
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,290
but her vitals keep getting worse.
She could be dead in hours.

411
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,919
But if you're gonna die a miserable,
lingering death,

412
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
pain-free is the way to do it.

413
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,136
Are we sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

414
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,636
The paralysis caused the fall.
Spine's clean. No vertebral fractures

415
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,843
or spinal cord compression.

416
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,723
Even better.

417
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,810
The nuttiness and paralysis mean there's
definitely a neurological component.

418
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,103
Could be a nerve disease.

419
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,981
Which is why we need to look at
the nerve that you didn't biopsy.

420
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,315
There are other tests.

421
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,026
HIV? Syphilis?

422
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,197
She was negative for all STDs.
Vascular? No, ANA was negative.

423
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,324
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

424
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,743
Thyroid storm.

425
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,958
Makes sense given her glucose reaction
was slow, and potassium's down.

426
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,380
Yeah, I'll check with
an endocrinologist.

427
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,381
Bennett's on call.

428
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,050
Perfect.

429
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,690
- No.
- Need a consult.

430
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,901
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

431
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,360
Need an endocrinologist.

432
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,445
Bennett's on call.

433
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,696
Won't pick up.

434
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,739
His cell phone must be broken.

435
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,240
Mine's working.

436
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,159
Had to give you the file.

437
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,374
I assume you're thinking thyroid storm.
Have you done a hormone panel?

438
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,086
Normal.
TSH was on the low side.

439
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,340
Is that a cheery fire
I hear crackling nearby?

440
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,093
No, what about CPK enzymes?

441
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,011
Elevated, 275.

442
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:55,642
People light fires for themselves,
but then they don't deny it.

443
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,103
He's here?

444
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,521
CPK isn't high enough.

445
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,191
Potassium's what you'd expect
because of the bronchodilators.

446
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,111
Oh, my God!
You're not wearing a bra.

447
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,695
It's not thyroid storm.

448
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:08,655
You just met him.

449
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,198
I like him,

450
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,201
and I like sex. Do I need to stitch
a letter on my tops?

451
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,163
No. Might be worth taking out
an ad in the local papers.

452
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,920
Do you like me, House?

453
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,092
I was on the phone with Bennett 15
minutes ago. His cell phone's working.

454
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,303
Your MO is to avoid me
at all costs,

455
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,432
and suddenly you need my input on every
move you make. I can only assume

456
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,640
it's because I'm on a date.

457
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,102
When we met, I noticed...

458
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,786
You noticed he was a Shriner
because of the way he parted his hair.

459
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,274
You noticed he was a mama's boy because
of the way he blinked his left eye.

460
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,442
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

461
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,872
There are only two reasons anyone would
want to screw with me tonight.

462
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,865
Either they're an
altruistic decent person

463
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,953
who's worried about my well-being,
or they want me for themselves.

464
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,583
You left out the third option.

465
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:05,044
Evil bastard who just wants
to mess with other people's happiness.

466
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,968
Good night, House.

467
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,023
We won't be bothered again.

468
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,403
It's late. I should go.

469
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,905
Why?

470
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,867
I part my hair on the left,
and I'm a Shriner?

471
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,869
You heard the conversation?

472
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,871
I'm not interested in him.

473
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,623
I don't blame you.

474
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,001
I only said those things
so that he wouldn't come back.

475
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,591
I don't really care
about my job. I do it well.

476
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,094
I provide a service, but my goal
was always to make enough money

477
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,724
to do the things I really like.
Music, travel...

478
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,018
I like those things, too.

479
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,230
You like them, but they're not
really important to you.

480
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:10,902
I don't know whether it's House, your
job, or if you just thrive on conflict,

481
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,989
but you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

482
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:23,122
Nothing else in the world's going on.
You're focused, confident, compelling.

483
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:32,131
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like to go out with that woman.

484
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,761
I can get her on the phone.

485
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,567
Where did you go?
She's getting worse.

486
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,529
It's not thyroid storm.
Give me a spinal nerve.

487
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,072
There are still other tests.

488
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,759
She just said
the girl is getting worse.

489
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,742
You really want to wait?

490
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,529
We'll be risking infection,
maybe make the paralysis worse.

491
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,964
It is worse, and we're making it worse
than worse? Do the biopsy.

492
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,425
We could paralyze her
and get no useful information.

493
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,968
Do the biopsy.

494
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,261
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

495
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,054
we should take a nerve a little further
away from the spine.

496
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,849
A little further from the truth.
We're talking paralysis.

497
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,101
There's a good chance
the spine is relevant.

498
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,146
If this thing is progressing,
it could kill her in hours.

499
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,524
Give me back my papers.

500
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,890
Is he asking
for a spinal nerve?

501
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,903
How did you know?

502
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,071
Give us a minute.

503
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,332
Did you know they recently found a
protein that speeds up nerve growth?

504
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,084
Fascinating stuff.
If you put that protein

505
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,045
with the insulation
from a spinal nerve,

506
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,964
you could grow your own little garden.
If that spinal nerve...

507
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,092
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if it happened to come
from a person with CIPA,

508
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,347
I can grow pain-free nerves and graft
them into my own leg. What an evil plan!

509
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,974
You'd have to be
on immunosuppressors for life.

510
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,893
Risk of infection,
shorter lifespan...

511
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,728
Shorter but normal.

512
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,442
Usually jealousy expresses itself by
trying to destroy what someone has.

513
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:18,196
You're more ambitious. You actually
want to change medical fact

514
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,405
to get this thing...

515
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,032
Medical fact
changes all the time.

516
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,533
You're risking
your patient's life.

517
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,369
That's how medical fact
changes.

518
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,495
A doctor risks...

519
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,040
To serve their
patient's health, not their own.

520
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,287
This is medically justified.

521
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:35,963
Are you sure? Are you sure that you're
the right one to be making this call?

522
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:51,104
Biopsy whatever nerve you figure you
could safely get at.

523
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,606
God, Wilson's annoying.

524
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,070
Past 3:00 a.m.
on Valentine's Day night.

525
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,073
I assume you had
a date with Wendy.

526
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,117
She'll survive.
She knows the deal.

527
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,119
- You're lucky.
- I know.

528
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,790
Someday, when there's time, I would like
to actually have a social life.

529
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,042
Someday? Come on.

530
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,962
If there's one thing a good-looking
woman can have whenever she wants,

531
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,088
it's a social life.

532
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,923
You mean a sex life.

533
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,969
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

534
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,427
until the real thing
comes along.

535
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,803
I had the real thing.

536
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,222
Forgive me
if I don't want to settle.

537
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,016
- Right.
- What does that mean?

538
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Nothing.

539
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,645
You think I didn't have
the real thing?

540
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,148
I have no idea what you had.

541
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,649
And yet you're judging it.

542
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,487
It's late. I'm cranky. Sorry.

543
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,030
I didn't have the real thing.

544
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,407
How could you even know?

545
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,409
You married a dying man.

546
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,705
You thought, "Six months, a year,
it'll be tough",

547
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,151
"but then I'll recover,
and I'll have the rest of my life."

548
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,253
It's like willingly getting the flu or
joining the Peace Corps, short-term.

549
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:01,841
Wow, you nailed it. It's basically like
a wasted weekend.

550
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,051
The sacrifices you made were huge,

551
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,096
but they were at the height of your love
for him.

552
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,517
Commitment is only commitment
because it has no expiration date.

553
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:16,189
You stand next to someone and watch them
floss for 30 years like my parents have,

554
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,817
then ask for sacrifices. That's how you
know the real thing.

555
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,955
Cameron, I wasn't
criticizing you.

556
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:39,086
People who avoid commitment are people
who know what a big thing it is.

557
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,638
This isn't right.

558
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,311
CIPA can't cause
this much degeneration.

559
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,689
A few nerve fibers we teased out of the
center have some insulation left,

560
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,400
but the insulation around the bundles
has been stripped bare.

561
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,567
Means the damage must be coming
from the outside in.

562
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,571
Which means it's secondary
demyelination,

563
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,532
which means
the source is somewhere else,

564
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,219
which tells us it's not
a nerve disease.

565
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,537
It's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves,

566
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,373
which means that we need to...

567
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,166
Where are you going?

568
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,085
Kid's mom is
finally out of surgery.

569
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,838
I'll be right back.

570
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,385
So what?

571
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,970
Hannah should see her.

572
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:33,182
Yes, immediately after we're done
chatting about saving her life.

573
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,643
Most likely causes
are metabolic.

574
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,729
They found brain swelling. They're
prepping her mother for another surgery.

575
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,525
Again, so what?
Get a nurse to take the kid.

576
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,231
There are more than 60 different
metabolic conditions

577
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,738
that could account for what she's got.
There's only three of you guys.

578
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,241
- She's scared.
- She should be.

579
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,243
She'll die if
we don't diagnose her.

580
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,953
So diagnose her.

581
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,257
Mom?

582
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:29,530
How bad is it? Are you okay?

583
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,533
I'm okay, Mom.

584
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,911
I'll get better.
I always get better.

585
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,123
Are you checking yourself,
your temperature?

586
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:46,213
Mom, could you just let it go?
You shouldn't be worrying.

587
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,051
Baby, I'm sorry.

588
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,720
I should have seen
that car coming.

589
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,058
No, Mom, I did this
to myself. I screwed up.

590
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,271
You were right. You were right,
and I was wrong.

591
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,066
No. No.

592
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:10,321
I shouldn't have gone out on the ice.
I shouldn't have fallen down,

593
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,158
and I shouldn't have made you
rush me to an ER

594
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,826
for the 10th time this year.

595
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,668
Mom?

596
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,674
- Mom?
- You okay?

597
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,176
They have to take her
back to surgery.

598
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,930
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

599
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,351
My hand's wet.

600
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,062
You're crying.

601
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,355
I can't cry.

602
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,406
My head's killing me.

603
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,542
So what does the pain tell us?

604
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,428
No tingling or itching,
so we can rule out...

605
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,380
It tells us nothing. It wasn't physical
pain. It was emotional.

606
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,758
Exactly. What were they doing
when she got the headache?

607
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,926
Saying goodbye.

608
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,594
You said they were arguing.

609
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,555
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

610
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,223
What were they arguing about?

611
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,766
Whose fault it was.

612
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,897
Peripheral neuropathy, fever
and intermittent paranoia.

613
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,608
Lots of metabolic conditions
can explain those things.

614
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,485
What if we add guilt?

615
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,197
Guilt? As a symptom?

616
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,492
Alzheimer's can
cause euphoria, pain causes depression,

617
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,997
and B12 deficiency causes guilt,
along with all that other stuff.

618
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,041
If she felt guilty, she wouldn't be
making her mother's life miserable.

619
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,918
She wouldn't be getting
in fights, getting arrested.

620
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,254
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

621
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,715
She's showing her mom she can take
stupid risks and still be safe.

622
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,883
Means mom can let go.

623
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,301
Which is rational.

624
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,428
If guilt is a symptom,
it's caused by the illness,

625
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,722
not by a thought process,
and it would have to be new.

626
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,488
Couple years ago,
she was a model student.

627
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,392
This is pointless.
If the headache was caused by guilt,

628
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,769
she has a B12 deficiency.

629
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,895
If it's just because
she was sad, it's meaningless.

630
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,272
How the hell do we
test for that?

631
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,523
We don't.

632
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,611
Give her a shot of B12.
When she gets better, I was right.

633
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:17,615
We already did.
ER gave her B12 when she was admitted,

634
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:22,578
part of a multivitamin
supplement. Apparently, she's just sad.

635
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,085
Why are you still here?

636
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,631
Trying to get a couple pages into a drug
trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow.

637
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,840
Why are you here?

638
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,884
Still haven't figured out why.

639
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,428
No, I meant here, in my office.

640
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,058
Just dumped a cool B12 theory.
Moved on to leukemia.

641
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,894
Very pedestrian.

642
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,562
I'm not happy.

643
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,524
Her white-blood-cell
count was low.

644
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,611
The ones she's got,
it's just a lot of eosinophils.

645
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,822
The immunoglobulin
E-level's borderline.

646
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,574
If you want to be 100% sure,
check the bone marrow.

647
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,077
The team's doing
a biopsy right now.

648
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,083
It turns out the
weird lawyer knew

649
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,543
that she used to be a man.

650
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,877
And he's cool with that?

651
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,714
Turns out that his previous girlfriend
also used to be a man.

652
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,385
Yeah.

653
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,434
Is it possible for you
to just watch me eat,

654
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,231
or do you get some primeval thrill out
of beating the other hunters

655
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,691
to the food?

656
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,784
See you later.

657
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,162
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

658
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,666
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

659
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,670
Is that nitrous?
What, are you trying to kill her?

660
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,715
We gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

661
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,049
That's what made this thing
rear its ugly...

662
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,426
What thing?

663
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,760
B12 deficiency.

664
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,808
Are you having déjà vu?

665
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,973
We've had this conversation. She was
given B12. She didn't get better.

666
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,727
Because someone else ate it.
Get an abdominal MRI.

667
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,981
What? What are you doing?
Don't touch me!

668
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,858
- Don't touch me!
- See? There's she goes.

669
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,193
- Don't touch me!
- Another paranoid delusion.

670
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,823
At the rate she's going downhill, forget
the MRI. We need an OR.

671
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,991
Leave me alone!

672
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,619
Occupied!

673
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,912
Her hernia can wait.

674
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,663
Help! They're trying
to kill me!

675
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,208
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are trying to kill her,

676
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,836
or you can assume she's suffering from
a medical condition.

677
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,672
Seeing as this is a hospital,
and we're all dressed like doctors,

678
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,591
and there are easier ways
to kill somebody...

679
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,760
- Bev, help them.
- I'm gonna need iodine,

680
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,847
scalpel numbers 10 and 15,
forceps and a largish salad bowl.

681
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,267
Okay, hold her down.

682
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,938
Come on, weenie,
she's in a cast.

683
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,190
Swab.

684
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,653
Fifteen.

685
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,363
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

686
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,115
Relax. It's just a magic trick.

687
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,748
She's faking it.
We're not falling for it this time.

688
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,710
Okay, keep that retracted.

689
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,634
Forceps.

690
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:42,653
Lake fishing can be fun. It can bring
the generations together.

691
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,156
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

692
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,451
you'll be giving
room and board to this fellow,

693
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,330
and by "free board,"
I mean all the B12 you can take in.

694
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,582
I could have a tapeworm in me?

695
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,085
Not likely.
You'd be in a lot of pain.

696
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,344
It's gotta be 25 feet long.

697
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,389
Damn it.
World record's over 60.

698
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,694
Hannah, wake up.
Somebody here to see you.

699
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,699
She's got limited motion
on her left side.

700
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,119
You might have
to take care of her for a while.

701
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,501
You don't feel it, but you're about to
rip your stitches out.

702
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,755
Take care of yourself.
Then you can take care of her.

703
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,392
You haven't gone home.

704
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,644
Sorry I screwed up
Valentine's day.

705
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:03,192
I'm dating a doctor.
I'd be an idiot to expect anything else.

706
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,404
I did get you a gift. MGH.

707
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,116
Best teaching hospital
in Boston.

708
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,079
You want to be a nurse practitioner?
That's as good as it gets.

709
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,291
I made a few calls,
and you're in if you want in.

710
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,587
This is why you've been helping me get
my surgical hours for accreditation.

711
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,798
- I thought you wanted...
- Stupid.

712
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,179
You've got 10 feet of
personal space around you.

713
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,640
I step forward, you step back.

714
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,642
I've shared
a lot of things with you.

715
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,685
Which is why
you're breaking up with me.

716
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,773
You can't stand to be close.

717
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:46,485
Wendy, you think I'll stay with you
because you're angry with me?

718
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,403
I'm upset

719
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,782
because I care.

720
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,953
Only you'd expect
an argument to be rational,

721
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,665
you and that ass boss of yours.

722
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,817
Well, you could ask her
for the spinal nerve.

723
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,528
She's got no reason to give it.

724
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,654
She owes you.

725
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,408
The hospital will
send her a bill.

726
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:39,413
I'm just saying, if you want to do it,
do it while her B12 is still low.

727
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,624
Guilt can be your friend.

728
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,715
Breakfast?

729
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,176
Yeah.

730
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,557
Happy Valentine's Day.

731
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,268
Holiday that only applies
to people who are already paired up.

732
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,395
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

733
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,607
Wow, thank you for
that dash of cold water.

734
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,067
Don't get me wrong. I still think true
love's out there.

735
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:12,654
It's just very far away,
possibly in another galaxy.

736
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,740
We may need to develop
faster-than-light travel

737
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,950
before we can make contact.

738
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,705
So I'm thinking
we should have sex.

739
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,417
That makes sense.

740
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,627
Despite the wisdom
of pop songs,

741
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,713
there's no point putting our lives
on hold until love comes along.

742
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,801
We're both healthy and busy people.
We work together so it's convenient.

743
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,220
Like microwave pizza.

744
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,638
And of all the people
I work with,

745
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,474
you're the one I'm least likely
to fall in love with.

746
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,809
Like microwave pizza.

747
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:46,688
The point here is to make things
simpler, not more complicated.

748
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,274
Someday, there'll be time
to get serious about someone.

749
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,819
Meanwhile, we already had sex once
and didn't get weird about it, so...

750
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:58,325
I get it. I get it. So what if
I'm offended by your judgment?

751
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,704
Then you're not the man
I'm looking for.
