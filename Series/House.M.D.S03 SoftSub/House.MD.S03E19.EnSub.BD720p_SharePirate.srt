1
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:12,011
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming, hold still.

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,513
What did he do now?

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,724
He got in another fight and I can't
get his nose to stop bleeding.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,144
You have to apply
much more pressure than that.

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,438
You had to do this today.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,525
I got office hours, I'm supposed
to have dinner with the Dean.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,652
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,237
He said I smelled like
a monkey.

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,123
Well, you do. You can't
refuse to take a bath

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,866
and then hit kids
who tell you that you smell. Damn.

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,410
Don't you think
we should call 911?

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,621
This isn't his first
nosebleed. He'll be fine.

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,499
- Daddy!
- Hey! Lucy Goosey!

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,875
I'm playing doctor.

15
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,962
So am I. Can you
go back and play?

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,759
- When was this fight?
- Over ten minutes ago.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,094
I feel dizzy.

18
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,554
Maybe you should
make that call.

19
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,222
Okay.

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,849
Daddy, look, I can help.

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,685
No, no, that's great, honey.
Can you just please leave Daddy alone?

22
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,856
One of my kids is bleeding
profusely from the nose. Please hurry.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,401
They're sending an ambulance.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,951
Call them back. He'll be fine.

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,036
How you feeling, bud?
You light-headed?

26
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,246
Lucy.

27
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,082
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:27,253
Lucy? Are you okay? Lucy? Lucy?

29
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,922
Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?

30
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,967
Lucy! Lucy!

31
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,842
Oh, for God's sake.

32
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,094
Stop. Don't move.

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,599
The way the soft evening
light catches your eyes.

34
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,684
The gentle caress of dusk
on your hair

35
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,646
as you turn around and leave my office
without giving me that file.

36
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,397
Restrictive pericarditis.

37
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,440
Boring.

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,525
She's in kindergarten.

39
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,569
Less boring. Or Grandma's
been held back a few years.

40
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,696
It's calcified
and she's hypertensive.

41
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,449
- Better get her into surgery.
- She already is in surgery.

42
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,868
Tricky procedure.
It's gonna take all night.

43
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,620
Sleep tight.

44
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,581
No congenital defects,
no health problems,

45
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,625
but her heart is
strangling itself.

46
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,253
Fascinating.
Since the pathology on the pericardium

47
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,255
won't be back
until after they remove it.

48
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:56,300
Get started on her blood. You can test
for viral infections, bacterial...

49
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,427
Round up the usual suspects.

50
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,681
Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis.

51
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,016
Heck, go wild.
Do all the -osises.

52
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,518
All taken care of. Sleep tight.

53
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,280
This thing is already
all around her heart.

54
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,323
It gets into the muscle,
she's dead.

55
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,409
Best bet's Coxsackie virus,

56
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,536
Parvovirus B19, CMV.

57
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,956
Bacterial infection's more likely to
turn constrictive. It could be TB.

58
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:31,252
Right, forgot about the part
where she did time in a Russian gulag.

59
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,503
Her hematocrit's elevated.

60
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,921
A few extra red blood cells
means nothing.

61
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,287
She's probably just dehydrated.

62
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,717
Yes, and I could assume three or four
things to fit my theory, too.

63
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,677
She's sick! She obviously hasn't
been drinking enough...

64
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,220
Enough!

65
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,225
I take it you two aren't sleeping
together anymore?

66
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,152
We do what House said,
we test for everything.

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,856
Good, then I can go home.

68
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,191
Since when does
we not include you?

69
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,038
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots, anyway.

70
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,030
Might as well be
a well-rested idiot.

71
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,701
You guys are idiots.

72
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,371
Why? Because we stayed up all night
doing exactly what you told us to do?

73
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,499
No, because you stayed up all night
doing exactly what I told you to do

74
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,626
and have nothing
to show for it.

75
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,669
We eliminated dozens
of wrong answers.

76
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,590
I asked you what two plus two equals and
a day later you tell me, "Not 25."

77
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,592
Pathology report
just got filed.

78
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,094
They found granulomas
in Lucy's pericardium.

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,180
Indicates a fungal infection.

80
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,223
Nice work.

81
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,266
He went home.

82
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,145
Work smart, not hard.

83
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,107
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

84
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,443
Take employee of the month
with you.

85
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,363
- I would rather Foreman...
- I know.

86
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,581
I don't want any more shots.

87
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,833
Jasper.

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,877
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

89
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,005
This will tell us why you're sick, so
that we can make you all better.

90
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,924
Where would she pick up
a fungus?

91
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,177
Anywhere moist. Around a pool,
locker room, public shower...

92
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,012
She doesn't have any gym
or swim classes.

93
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,306
She doesn't even like to play
with kids outside.

94
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,643
You haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

95
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,938
It's been hard to get away
since their mom...

96
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,523
Our mom is dead.

97
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,237
- I'm sorry.
- Last year. Brain cancer.

98
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,158
You're gonna stick that thing
in her arm?

99
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,743
Cool!

100
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,997
The cool part is
your sister won't feel a thing.

101
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,589
Nice necklace.

102
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,384
- Thanks.
- You like video games?

103
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,386
Love them.

104
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,224
That should do it. You okay?

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,226
I want my bunny.

106
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,277
Are you being silly?

107
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,696
I didn't know
which one to take.

108
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,033
What do you mean?

109
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,243
What's happening?

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,415
So. What does
the double vision tell us?

111
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,001
Slit lamp revealed the eye's
anterior chamber is swollen.

112
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,920
Uveitis. Means it's not a post-op effect
and it's not neurological.

113
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,132
It's not fungal, either.
Lymph node biopsy was clean.

114
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,418
So, we're back to square one.

115
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,761
One and a half. We've eliminated
two more conditions.

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,472
Yes. Two plus two doesn't
equal 12 or 16, either.

117
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,558
Vision issues plus screwy heart equals
some type of autoimmune.

118
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,004
Lupus and Kawasaki's are
the most common in a six-year-old.

119
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:39,273
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old who
doesn't have Lupus or Kawasaki's...

120
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,567
Did you look at her knees?

121
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,030
Those knobby things in the middle
of her legs. Any scars or scabs?

122
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,198
What does that
have to do with...

123
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,825
Well, most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

124
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,745
Crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump...

125
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,751
Dad says she doesn't like
to run around outside.

126
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,582
'Cause running around
outside hurts.

127
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,000
She didn't mention anything...

128
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,838
Most six-year-olds are not familiar with
the phrase, "My joints feel inflamed."

129
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,382
So, two plus two equals...

130
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,384
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

131
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,097
We're checking her ANA to confirm and
giving her steroids to fix her vision.

132
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,391
Some idiot gave me two tickets
for a play tonight.

133
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,062
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

134
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,564
Sorry, had to take a leak.

135
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,942
Oh, I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

136
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,069
It's an exam room.
What did you think I was doing?

137
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,404
What you usually do.
Hiding from Cuddy.

138
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,533
Well, it'd be stupid to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

139
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,867
You been drinking more?

140
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,369
No, I haven't.

141
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,704
Guy's peeing all the time.
Play. Interested?

142
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,164
Sure. You want me
to pick you up?

143
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,625
- Well, I'm not going.
- You said two tickets.

144
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
You thought this was a date?

145
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,629
Any other symptoms?

146
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,797
My stomach hurts.

147
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,508
I have back pain
and muscle aches,

148
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,303
I feel dizzy and I have trouble
concentrating sometimes in class.

149
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,972
I really should...

150
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,306
You want the tickets or not?

151
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,144
- Why don't you want to go with me?
- It's a play.

152
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,980
Dudes only go to plays
if they're dragged by women

153
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,227
they're hoping to see naked.

154
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,941
So, why are you
giving them to me?

155
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,402
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

156
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,989
All right.

157
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,617
- Any fever?
- No.

158
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,452
Anything in your pee
other than pee?

159
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,787
No.

160
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,193
I'm going to need
a urine sample.

161
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,874
No!

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Yeah, that last one
wasn't a question.

163
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,503
- You might have diabetes...
- I can't pee in public.

164
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,463
We have bathrooms.

165
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,261
I can't pee
in public bathrooms.

166
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,139
Where can you pee?

167
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,017
I only live
a few miles from here.

168
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,270
I thought arthritis
was for old people.

169
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,064
JRA is an autoimmune disease.

170
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,858
Her body's attacking itself,

171
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,570
causing inflammation in the joints,
her eyes, and her heart.

172
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,197
Is it treatable?

173
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,783
It can be crippling, but it can also
go into complete remission.

174
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,077
Well, the good thing is
we caught it early.

175
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,747
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

176
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,290
Dad.

177
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,708
Don't get up, Goosey.

178
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,211
Your stitches.

179
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,276
She's having a stroke.

180
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,664
The stroke was caused by a clot
in her middle cerebral artery.

181
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
Started her on tPA.

182
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,084
Should dissolve the clot
and hopefully prevent brain damage,

183
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,711
but we won't know for sure
until she regains consciousness.

184
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,838
Or she has another stroke.

185
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,842
Arthritis, heart disease.
Why can't this kid act her age?

186
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,929
JRA doesn't affect the blood. That means
the clot's a symptom of something else.

187
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,389
It's a symptom of polycythemia.

188
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,558
She's fully hydrated and her blood's
still thicker than pancake batter.

189
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,269
Well, thick blood
explains the stroke.

190
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,104
It could also have caused
an autoimmune response,

191
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,356
which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

192
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,857
But what explains
the thick blood?

193
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,485
Lack of oxygen forces the body
to overproduce red cells.

194
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,891
What explains
the lack of oxygen?

195
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,030
Carbon monoxide fumes,
cigarette smoke.

196
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,657
I doubt our patient's a smoker.

197
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,867
- Dad could be.
- He's not.

198
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,703
- He says he's not.
- Hey!

199
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,830
Don't make me turn the hose
on you two.

200
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,332
Chase is right.

201
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,294
You two go check the house,
see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man.

202
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,753
You're intentionally
punishing us.

203
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,631
By making you do your job?
Does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?

204
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,998
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks,

205
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,512
and, you, start her on hydroxyurea to
control her red blood cell production.

206
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,514
Dig out a Merck Manual,
Medieval edition.

207
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,268
Tell you how to drain
a pint or two so she doesn't clot again.

208
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,153
Dr. Cameron!

209
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,157
I got you flowers
for helping my sister.

210
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,659
That's so sweet.

211
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,561
Does your dad know
you're down here?

212
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,829
Yes.

213
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,877
"Congratulations
on your bundle of joy."

214
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,963
Something you forgot
to tell me?

215
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,089
You should take these back
to where you found them.

216
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,967
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

217
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,333
Can you make sure these flowers

218
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,137
and this kid both get back
to where they belong?

219
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,263
Sure.

220
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,016
- Thanks.
- Let's go. Come on.

221
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,853
Wait.

222
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,500
So, you're just
draining blood from her?

223
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,168
You're not testing it?
You're not fixing it?

224
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,129
Your daughter's vascular system
is engorged with blood.

225
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,007
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

226
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,844
We're also starting her on a drug that
suppresses the production of red cells

227
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,138
so we don't have to
keep doing this.

228
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,850
Good chance
she'll make a full recovery.

229
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,394
She hasn't spoken yet.

230
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,521
Give her time.

231
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,652
This your boy?

232
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,530
- Where have you been?
- Exploring. See ya.

233
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank you.

234
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,450
You know you can't just
run off without telling me.

235
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,245
Okay. Can I have $2?

236
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,583
Oven's a long shot.

237
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,629
They'd smell the gas
long before anyone got sick.

238
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,671
Yeah, right. House loves it
when we skip something

239
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,965
'cause it's a long shot.

240
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,052
Why did you take the flower?

241
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,720
- Why did you kiss him?
- He did something sweet.

242
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,013
He stole flowers.

243
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,849
He's eight.

244
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,144
You're trying to
make me jealous.

245
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,273
Yeah, I want you to
profess your love for me. Oh, wait.

246
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,152
You already did that and it caused me
to end our relationship.

247
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,157
You're enabling a thief
and a delinquent!

248
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,080
Letters from school. Fights, detentions,
a parent conference...

249
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,209
Oh, I know, I know.
Bad boys, hard to resist.

250
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,878
It's a crush. It's harmless.

251
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,464
- It's never harmless.
- So I'm learning.

252
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,803
So, this is us now?
We snipe at each other?

253
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,597
I'm not sniping,
I'm looking for a vent.

254
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,890
Her room's directly above the garage.

255
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,185
There's all sorts
of CO sources down there.

256
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,939
I found a vent.

257
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,901
I think there's
something in it.

258
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,494
This isn't right.

259
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,289
You dumped me.
You don't get to be mad.

260
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,252
We had a really good thing.

261
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,463
You broke the rules. I'm angry.

262
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,802
I'll get over it.

263
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,031
She's being abused.

264
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,909
A bloody T-shirt doesn't
equal abuse. Kids get hurt all the time.

265
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,203
That amount of blood?

266
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,206
Oh, crap.

267
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,375
You two are agreeing again.

268
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,001
Her father's overwhelmed.
Hectic job,

269
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,629
his wife passed away last year, he could
easily be taking it out on the kids.

270
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,881
Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a T-shirt.

271
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,383
She's so ashamed of a nosebleed

272
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,010
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed?

273
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,930
She's socially isolated, the brother's
always in trouble, it's classic signs.

274
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,181
But no physical signs.

275
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,684
No marks on her body,
no bruises at all.

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,145
What if it's sexual?

277
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,274
We should call Social Services.

278
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,693
Well, this sucks.

279
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,237
Either it's abuse,
or it's not abuse,

280
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,739
which means either it's a symptom
or it's completely irrelevant.

281
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,368
Either way, we got to waste half a day
figuring out which.

282
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,412
Full physical exam.

283
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,790
Look for bruises we may have missed,
check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

284
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,917
We can't do a vaginal exam
on a six-year-old

285
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,083
without the dad's consent.

286
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,130
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

287
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,049
"Never" is just "reven"
spelled backwards.

288
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,809
Have you been abusing
your daughter?

289
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,312
What? Why would you...

290
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,232
We found this hidden in a vent
under her bed.

291
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,992
I don't know anything about this.
Maybe she had a bloody nose?

292
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,452
We need to examine her
for abuse.

293
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,661
You can't really think I...

294
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,204
Maybe you,
maybe the school bully,

295
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,371
maybe the creepy neighbor.

296
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,973
I'm guessing you're not paying as much
attention as you should be.

297
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,835
Do you even know
where your son is right now?

298
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,838
Yeah, he was here just...
Here a minute ago.

299
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,092
She isn't being abused.

300
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,303
Unfortunately, that answer
doesn't help me.

301
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,512
If you have abused her,

302
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,890
- you're obviously gonna lie about it.
- I'm not lying!

303
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,725
- We need to do a vaginal exam.
- No.

304
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,893
She may be dying,

305
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,146
she still can't talk and you're gonna
waste your time with this?

306
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,941
Either you consent and we waste a few
hours doing the exam, or you refuse

307
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,779
and I call Social Services and they
waste three days doing an investigation

308
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,323
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

309
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,505
Okay. I'm gonna look
inside your mouth. Open wide.

310
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,966
I need to look at your chest
and your back next, okay?

311
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,305
I know you can't talk,
so stop me if you get scared.

312
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:07,109
Before you came here, did anyone
hurt you? Make you bleed?

313
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,738
I need to look
in your vagina now. Do you understand?

314
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm a doctor, so it's okay.
All right?

315
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,952
Bend your knees,
keep your ankles together

316
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,788
and just let your knees fall
to the side, okay?

317
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,628
Oh, my God.

318
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,048
She has cuts all over her genital area,
like slices.

319
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,008
Some are almost healed,
but some are new.

320
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,135
She could be doing it
to herself.

321
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,845
She's a little young
to be cutting.

322
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,888
She's a little young
for a stroke.

323
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,183
Depression accounts for the cuts,
molestation accounts for the depression.

324
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,685
But do the cuts account
for all that blood?

325
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,811
They weren't deep enough.

326
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,439
So she's getting cut,
but that's not the source of the blood?

327
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,899
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

328
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,568
The obvious source
of the blood, not the cuts.

329
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,862
There was no tearing,
there's no evidence at all.

330
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,323
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

331
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,700
Where is he?

332
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,453
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

333
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,537
Meaning what?

334
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,166
We found a T-shirt covered with blood
hidden in a heating vent.

335
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,542
How do we know it's even hers?

336
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,877
Her dad identified it.

337
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
Not the shirt, the blood.

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,222
Are those
the urine test results?

339
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,224
- Yes.
- And...

340
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,810
- I'm going to ask you for some blood.
- Why?

341
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,397
To see if your answer will be,
"I can't bleed in public."

342
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,858
This wasn't your urine, was it?

343
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,485
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

344
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,070
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

345
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,322
I'm not an athlete.

346
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,034
Second favorite reason is
because you're on drugs.

347
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,660
- I'm not.
- I am.

348
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,871
Third favorite reason
is you have insurance

349
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,831
but your
friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

350
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,044
So, Eggs describes a list of symptoms
and you repeat them to a doctor,

351
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,547
which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

352
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,051
Need you, now.

353
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,553
My work here is done.

354
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,307
Am I okay? Is it diabetes?

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,309
No, you're pregnant.

356
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,361
Six-year-old abuse victim and you
haven't called Social Services?

357
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,655
She might've been abused?
That's horrifying.

358
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,658
Why are you wearing
extra concealer under your eyes?

359
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,161
The law's clear. You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

360
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,790
You don't proceed as usual while the
possible abuser sits by her bedside.

361
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,751
Dad consented to the exam
which means it's not the dad.

362
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,503
How late were you
out last night?

363
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,548
It's always the dad
and I don't have a curfew.

364
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,217
Panty hamster
get a spin on its wheel?

365
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,679
I went to a play.

366
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,474
House, you are going back to your
office. You are picking up your phone,

367
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,853
calling Social Services and you are
reporting suspected abuse.

368
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,479
Do you understand?

369
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,982
What play?

370
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,659
You're trying to have sex
with Cuddy.

371
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,663
- Fries?
- You took her to a play.

372
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,748
You only take women
to plays because...

373
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,836
No, you only take women to plays for
that reason. That's your theory.

374
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,088
Okay. Then why did you
take her to a play?

375
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,172
She's a friend.

376
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,674
A friend with a squish mitten.

377
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,385
It is possible to have a friend
of the opposite sex without...

378
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,095
Blasphemer!

379
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,098
She's not a friend of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

380
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,145
She's an administrator.

381
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,018
She's going to eat your head
after she's done.

382
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,936
Yes, I slept with her.

383
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,230
- Seriously?
- No.

384
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,484
Yes, you did.

385
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,195
Yes, I did.

386
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,198
- Seriously?
- No.

387
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,035
You've got a problem, House.

388
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,624
We just tested the blood
on Lucy's T-shirt,

389
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,043
it's full of endometrial cells.

390
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,836
So it's not her blood.

391
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,963
We tested that, too. It is.

392
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,174
Your six-year-old patient?

393
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,260
It's menstrual blood.

394
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,472
She's started puberty.

395
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:15,023
How can someone start puberty before
they even start the first grade?

396
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,817
She was in diapers
two years ago.

397
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,237
For some reason her body
has too much sex hormone.

398
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,240
It caused her
reproductive system to get confused,

399
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,326
start operating prematurely.

400
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,454
We need to find out the source
of the hormones and cut it off.

401
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,705
She's so young.

402
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,584
I haven't even

403
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,545
talked to her about sex.

404
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,548
I doubt she even knows
what a period is.

405
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,516
Girls talk to their moms
about that.

406
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,318
You're gonna be okay, Goosey.

407
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,654
I love you.

408
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,116
I

409
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,743
Want

410
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,746
juice.

411
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,754
She got her period
and didn't know what it was.

412
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,256
She was scared and confused.

413
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,758
A friend told her to put a T-shirt
in her underwear.

414
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,468
When she started
growing pubic hair,

415
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,929
she snuck Daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

416
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,473
Apparently forgot to sneak
the shaving cream.

417
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,725
Tumor's most likely.

418
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,477
A pituitary adenoma would send her
hormone level sky-high.

419
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,564
In Puerto Rico, in the '70s, there was
an epidemic of kids growing breasts

420
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,566
because of estrogen
in the poultry.

421
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,610
If it was in the food, it would be an
epidemic. We've got one kid.

422
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,822
She's six, she's tiny, she lives
on chicken fingers and milk.

423
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,615
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels,

424
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,493
he's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

425
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,704
Excellent argument.
It's a tumor.

426
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,916
There's all sorts of environmental
sources. Pesticides, soy products.

427
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,211
Some shampoos are basically a placenta
in a bottle.

428
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,590
If the tumor's not in her brain,
it's in her reproductive tract.

429
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,175
Get an MRI.

430
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,926
- Can I at least...
- Waste your time?

431
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,554
Wouldn't recognize you
if you didn't.

432
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,147
Frontal cortex is clean,
moving caudally.

433
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,277
For the record,
Cameron's the one who broke it off.

434
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,695
Not interested.

435
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,907
No masses in the hypothalamus.

436
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,825
I wanted more.

437
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,745
She didn't share my feelings.

438
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,581
I feel like
I'm in a similar position.

439
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,294
Pituitary's clean.

440
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,505
You're an idiot.

441
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,382
Either she's lying or she's actually
emotionally detached.

442
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,551
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

443
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,886
Neither.

444
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,554
You have to choose one.

445
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,311
There's a bright spot
on her left ovary.

446
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,108
Looks like a solid tumor.

447
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,825
They printed my letter.

448
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,453
You were right.

449
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,622
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

450
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,415
- They printed my letter.
- Great.

451
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,708
Cuddy.

452
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,211
- You want to see her naked?
- No, no, no.

453
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,755
She wants to see me naked.

454
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,008
She sent me flowers.

455
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,718
Just thanking you for the play.

456
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,388
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude.

457
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,557
- There's a card.
- I suspected.

458
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,517
It explains how you knew
who they were from.

459
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,063
"Let's do it again.
Soon. XX, Lisa."

460
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,523
Xs are the kisses, right?

461
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,233
No, I think they're the hugs.

462
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,399
I think Os are the kisses.

463
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,945
No, no. The Xs are
definitely the kisses.

464
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,073
"Soon" is its own sentence.

465
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,535
I gotta go!

466
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,375
I'll miss you.
You were a good friend.

467
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,379
They printed my letter.

468
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,964
How was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?

469
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,465
What's up with Wilson?

470
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,508
He's just a little freaked.

471
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,843
Why?

472
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,345
I sent him flowers.

473
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,733
Jasper, you're not
supposed to be up here.

474
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,152
Is that other doctor
your boyfriend?

475
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,070
No.

476
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,614
Your dad's probably looking
for you.

477
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,341
He's got enough to
worry about right now.

478
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,950
Do you like him?

479
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,994
He's a friend.

480
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,871
Do you like him, like him?

481
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,956
We should get you
back to your dad.

482
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,293
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

483
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,383
I could be your boyfriend.

484
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,596
I think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls your own age.

485
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:01,059
- He seems like a tool.
- He's not. And that's rude.

486
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,102
I'm taking you back
to your father.

487
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,326
The mass is small.
About a centimeter across.

488
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,370
Firing the biopsy needle.

489
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,333
You nick an artery?

490
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,751
No.

491
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,378
She's in V tach. No pulse.

492
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,172
- Charging 50.
- Clear.

493
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:33,925
Clear.

494
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,351
Arrhythmia must have been
a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

495
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,757
We have to stop
the drug therapy.

496
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,021
Her bone marrow will just go back to
overproducing blood cells,

497
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,232
she'll keep having strokes
and we'll have to keep bleeding her.

498
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,316
Forever.

499
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,904
We resect the tumor, hormone levels go
back to normal, her symptoms go away.

500
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,157
Great plan, except for the fact
that her tumor's not a tumor.

501
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,451
It's a benign cyst.

502
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,001
If it's not a tumor, that just leaves
an environmental source.

503
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm feeling another late night.

504
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,341
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

505
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,302
- You're kidding me, right?
- What?

506
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,429
The answer's right there.
It's just a question of finding it.

507
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,972
You don't need me for that.

508
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,526
Don't get the mochaccino

509
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,405
they screwed up
and put hot chocolate in the dispenser.

510
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,073
Thank you.

511
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:43,411
You were right.
The eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.

512
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,372
I shouldn't have
encouraged him.

513
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,958
Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

514
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,543
You were a pervert at eight?

515
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,337
Maybe eleven.

516
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,387
I didn't realize
you were gonna get hurt.

517
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,557
I'm sorry I misled you.

518
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,018
You didn't.

519
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,356
You have feelings for me.

520
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,192
You come back to me
again and again.

521
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,819
- For sex. It's a simple physical...
- Come on.

522
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,864
You have feelings for puppies
and patients that you barely know.

523
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,951
But when it comes to a guy
that you've worked with for three years,

524
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,246
had sex with,
spent the night with...

525
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,000
You telling me
you feel nothing?

526
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,045
Absolutely nothing?

527
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,548
Get away from her! Don't touch her!
I'll kill you if you touch her!

528
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,093
- Jasper!
- Get him off!

529
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,929
He's biting me. Get him off!

530
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,603
What is he gonna do?

531
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,605
He stopped and looked at him
from the top rope!

532
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,817
But now he's scaling... No way!

533
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,077
Somebody better be dying.

534
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,914
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me,
so he bit the crap out of Chase.

535
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,457
And I care because...

536
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,709
Just thought you might
want to know when one of your employees

537
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,420
gets attacked by a sociopath.

538
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,380
Bees or monkeys, yes.

539
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,590
Sociopaths, no.

540
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,846
He doesn't have sense enough
to know he was pinned.

541
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,973
He's not a man,
he is a monster!

542
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,599
No way!

543
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,519
We've got to take
another look at this...

544
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,165
That might be what he needed.
Unable to somehow kick out of a...

545
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,115
- Hello?
- He's not a sociopath.

546
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,533
How do you know?

547
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,326
He's acting logically.

548
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,163
He's got a crush on you.
He's being aggressive about it.

549
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,039
Not just regular aggressive,

550
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,793
he's out-of-his-mind-on-hormones
aggressive.

551
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,086
You think he's...

552
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,215
Better figure out what's killing the
girl, because her brother's got it, too.

553
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,013
Jasper's got
a hundred times more testosterone

554
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,639
than a healthy eight-year-old.

555
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,184
But we scanned his brain
and reproductive tract,

556
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,643
no hormone secreting tumors.

557
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,604
I'm not surprised.
What's more likely?

558
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,732
Brother and sister get the same type
of tumor at exactly the same time,

559
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,151
or they both play
in the same toxic sandbox?

560
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,987
Yes, you would think that if for some
reason you were completely unaware

561
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,531
of the fact we spent the entire night
testing everything from that home.

562
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,366
It was all negative.

563
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,452
You went home?

564
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,330
Good for you. Delegate.

565
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,540
We're not his subordinates.

566
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,959
Making it all the more
impressive.

567
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,503
What if it's genetic?

568
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,216
Well, anyone else think it's
more than a coincidence

569
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,968
these kids have symptoms that
could be caused by a brain tumor

570
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,614
which is exactly
what killed their mom?

571
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,388
You just said
there were no tumors.

572
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,675
We scanned both their brains.

573
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,016
They looked clean.

574
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,559
So did their mom's,
until it didn't.

575
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,187
It can't be genetic.
Mom had none of the same symptoms.

576
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,566
Yes, she did, if the symptoms
were pubic hair and menstruation.

577
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,027
That's ridiculous. If menstruation
is a symptom of brain cancer

578
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,553
then I should be
on chemo right now.

579
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,949
That's ridiculous. You're way
too skinny to be menstruating.

580
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,450
What if the mom
had other problems?

581
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:14,163
Symptoms her doctors ignored on account
of the fact she was already dying?

582
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,250
Pull all her medical records.

583
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,377
Find any similarities
to our patients.

584
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,063
And punch the little brat on the nose
so he doesn't have a stroke

585
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,715
like his sister.

586
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,302
I'm not sick.

587
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,887
Just trying to
keep you that way.

588
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,473
I want Dr. Cameron to do mine.

589
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,768
Trust me, you don't want her
cutting you right now.

590
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,940
So Jasper's
behavioral issues...

591
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,360
They could be a function
of the increased testosterone.

592
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,655
Hopefully, he'll be a delight
as soon as we figure this out.

593
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,699
My tummy hurts.

594
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,950
It hurts!

595
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:51,993
No, it doesn't.

596
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,828
Don't be such a baby.

597
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,079
My tummy hurts!

598
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,124
- Where in your tummy?
- It hurts!

599
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,042
It hurts!

600
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,092
Stomach pain is from
a cyst in her pancreas.

601
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,344
I found two more in her
kidneys and one in her lung.

602
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,179
They weren't there
48 hours ago.

603
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,432
Hormones are making
her body go haywire.

604
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,393
She gets one in her brain
or heart, she's dead.

605
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,271
No pressure, though.

606
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,773
Her mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

607
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,358
She had none of the symptoms
the kids have.

608
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,278
It's not genetic,
it's not environmental.

609
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,946
It's gotta be
a pituitary adenoma.

610
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,033
Yes! That would make
complete sense if they had one.

611
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,829
Just because we haven't found anything
on the scan doesn't mean it's not there.

612
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,707
We should remove
her pituitary gland.

613
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,876
Two siblings, same condition.

614
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,377
It's gotta be genetic
or environmental.

615
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,088
We add in the same time
and we're back to just environmental.

616
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,341
Yes, and that would make complete sense
if there was anything

617
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,300
in her environment.

618
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,760
Just because we haven't
found anything yet...

619
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:55,556
She's been out of her environment for
four days and she's still getting worse.

620
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,269
I'm getting
the father's consent.

621
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,896
No!

622
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,606
We have no evidence.

623
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,484
This is your process, House.

624
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,279
You asked us
what two plus two is.

625
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,991
We've eliminated every number
except for four.

626
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,620
She needs brain surgery.

627
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,208
The ovaries produce
sex hormones

628
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,710
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

629
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,047
Since we know the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause...

630
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,259
"Most likely" means she wants to root
around inside your little girl's brain

631
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,199
without any guarantee
that it'll work.

632
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,430
That's why she's holding off
on doing your son.

633
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,559
Dr. House knows that unfortunately we've
ruled out every other option.

634
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,103
We need to resect
Lucy's pituitary before...

635
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,562
Who else visits these kids?

636
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,050
They don't have
any family in town.

637
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,274
You got a girlfriend?

638
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,818
- No one visits.
- School?

639
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,695
They don't go to the same school.
House, I've covered...

640
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,238
- Nanny?
- They don't have one.

641
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,045
They go to after-school daycare
but none of the other kids are sick.

642
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,283
Yet.

643
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,869
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms as your daughter.

644
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,356
Maybe the other kids
are just slow.

645
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,248
We wait
and your daughter may die.

646
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,582
She does this,
your daughter will need

647
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,793
hormone replacement therapy
for the rest of her life.

648
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,503
The treatments are extremely effective.

649
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,422
She should lead
a relatively normal life.

650
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,215
And isn't that
every parent's dream?

651
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,844
To have a kid grow up to be
relatively normal?

652
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:25,187
My husband died of thyroid cancer
that metastasized to his brain.

653
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,733
I've been there.

654
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,860
I know how terrifying
this can be.

655
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:35,406
And I am telling you this is your best
chance to save your daughter's life.

656
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,122
You did not just play
the dead husband card.

657
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,585
My wife died.

658
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:51,922
Because she signed a consent form that
I didn't want her to sign.

659
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,257
Died.

660
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,139
Thank you.

661
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,770
How did you know?

662
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,481
Know what?

663
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,399
That the other kids
weren't sick?

664
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,109
You've been here for four days.

665
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,611
I just...

666
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,031
I would have heard.

667
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203
Right.

668
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,089
Do you have hair
on your special place?

669
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,883
Miss Janie!

670
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,094
Can I help you?

671
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,596
I'm a doctor.

672
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,682
Two of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

673
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,893
You think they got sick here?

674
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,229
I think
you're dating their dad.

675
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,692
He told you?

676
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,819
No.

677
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,904
And I don't really care
why he didn't.

678
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,615
I just need to know how often you go
to their house and what you bring.

679
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,993
- I don't.
- Shampoos, fancy soaps...

680
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,705
- Kids get in your bag.
- I've never been to their house.

681
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,169
They just lost their mom
and we thought it was too soon.

682
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,885
Why are you staring at me?

683
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,136
Lip wax?

684
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,057
I just had it done over lunch.

685
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,309
- Mani-pedi?
- No.

686
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,978
Just the wax.

687
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,483
Women get a wax as a part of a whole
self-indulgent beauty ritual.

688
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,528
Pedicures, steam,
cucumber masks.

689
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,406
No one runs out at lunch
just to get a lip wax,

690
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,367
unless you woke up looking
like Yosemite Sam.

691
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,369
You're an ass.

692
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,290
- Cameron.
- It's always the dad.

693
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:55,462
Excess facial hair in women.
It's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance.

694
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,172
Exactly what
the little kiddies have.

695
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,925
Is there something wrong
at the daycare center?

696
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,053
There's something wrong
in your pants.

697
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,480
She's a lot younger
than I am. I

698
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,733
use a

699
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,693
male enhancement cream
to keep up with her.

700
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,099
What does this
have to do with...

701
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,404
Never occurred to you
to get a prescription

702
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,449
instead of some penis-pumper
loaded with testosterone?

703
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,742
I keep it at the gym.

704
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,598
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says on the bottle.

705
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,456
It's never been in my home,
it's obviously never been near the kids.

706
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,540
But you have.

707
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,835
We've been through that,
I'm not a pervert or a pedophile!

708
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,464
Thirty percent of our waste
is excreted through our skin.

709
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,507
That sounds high.

710
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,384
It's why you stink
after eating garlic.

711
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,679
Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week

712
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,267
he's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

713
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,073
Every time
you gave the little tykes a hug,

714
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,188
you gave them a dose of testosterone.

715
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,983
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies can handle.

716
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,196
So...

717
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,949
I did this to them?

718
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,035
Just holding their hands?

719
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,787
Uh-huh.

720
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,795
If I stop using it?

721
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,256
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

722
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,929
Give it back!

723
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,764
He'll still be eight.

724
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,702
You okay?

725
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,036
Yeah, I think so.

726
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,290
- Talk to Cuddy?
- No, not yet.

727
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,501
I don't know what to say.

728
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,087
Just be straight with her.

729
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,631
I'm not sure what that is.

730
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,677
I can't stop
thinking about her.

731
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,055
In what way?

732
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,807
Maybe she's right. Maybe...

733
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:15,144
Maybe this is worth exploring.

734
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,108
Are you sure that she feels...

735
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,318
She sent me flowers.

736
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,487
How do I do this?

737
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,364
What do I say?

738
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,243
Cameron would tell you
to say how you feel.

739
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,495
Me? I'd get her drunk.

740
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,875
I'm not gonna say anything.

741
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,172
I'm just gonna walk into her office
and I'm gonna kiss her.

742
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,219
That's a bold move.

743
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,097
Cuddy likes bold.

744
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,824
Yeah, you're right, if you spoke,
you'd just say something stupid.

745
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,229
Yeah, I mean I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

746
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,363
Okay.

747
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,075
Yeah. Okay.

748
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,496
Okay.

749
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,049
You! You! You!

750
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,176
You were gonna let me do that?

751
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,512
You made a compelling argument.

752
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,888
You sent those flowers to me!

753
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,225
Yes! Because you
took her to a play.

754
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,186
And because, actually, you do wanna
march down there and kiss her.

755
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,312
No! I don't.

756
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,480
Yes, you do.

757
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,360
You're right.

758
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,321
Seriously?

759
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,365
No.

760
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,450
You're a jerk.

761
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,287
- Night, Wilson.
- Night, House.

762
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,067
They're beautiful.

763
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,953
I thought about what you said.

764
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,288
And

765
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,792
I really don't want
a relationship with you.

766
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,295
I know.

767
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,006
I also know you like flowers.

768
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,241
I don't get the whole
May-December thing.

769
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,578
Give him a break.
May-October at worst.

770
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,289
Well, why can't it be
October-October?

771
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,000
May is when
things start to get hot.

772
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:27,753
If that guy wasn't trying
so hard

773
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,338
to keep up
with a woman half his age,

774
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,007
he wouldn't have
almost killed both his kids.

775
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,134
Guy gets a little
something-something,

776
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,262
couple of kids
have to die... Circle of life.

777
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,181
So many people,

778
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,933
so much energy and drama

779
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,645
just trying to find someone who's almost
never the right person anyway.

780
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,690
It just shouldn't be so hard.

781
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,365
I got tickets to a play.
