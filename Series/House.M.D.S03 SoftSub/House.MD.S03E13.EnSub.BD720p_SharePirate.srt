1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:13,054
Wait. We shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,015
What? You're not having fun?

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,226
It's not that. I just...

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,019
Rather be with the boys?

5
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,397
No.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,273
Well, then come on.

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,538
You kids need any help?

8
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,956
No. No, we're fine.

9
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,582
Car trouble?

10
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,542
No.

11
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,918
Then why are you here?

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,878
We're just talking.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,965
Does she do all the talking?

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,717
Most of it.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,929
I know what that's like.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,182
I'm gonna come back
through here in 10 minutes,

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,978
and if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,440
Yes, sir. Thank you.

19
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,200
Now, where were we?

20
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,161
We were going.

21
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,829
In nine minutes.

22
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,556
Wait...

23
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,141
Stevie? What's wrong?

24
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,523
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,196
Help! Someone help me!

26
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,630
Sixteen-year-old
with respiratory arrest.

27
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,717
The only thing I hate more
than a thief is a crippled thief.

28
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,719
Yeah, me, too.
No sign of trauma, no history

29
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,512
- of asthma or...
- Who the hell is J. Whitner?

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,850
No idea. Stevie Lipa's EKG
and echocardiogram were normal, but...

31
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,144
Normal is good. Send him home.

32
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,523
J. Whitner, doctor. Who is he,
and where do I find him?

33
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,609
She's the new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

34
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,402
- Is she hot?
- She's in a wheelchair.

35
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,612
Doesn't mean she's not hot.

36
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,238
Just means she can't bend over,

37
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,324
so Cuddy has to
bend over backwards.

38
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,162
Sixteen-year-old kid. ER workup revealed
a bloody pleural effusion.

39
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,915
- That's odd.
- Yeah, that occurred to me.

40
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,666
What took you so long
to mention it?

41
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,668
No tumors or pneumonia
on the CT.

42
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,004
He passed out while making out.

43
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,924
If he's into sex, drugs and rock
and roll can't be that far behind.

44
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,216
I'm guessing cocaine.

45
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,468
Tox screen was clean.

46
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,054
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been using drugs.

47
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,973
Looks like a plumbing problem
to me. Leaky pipes.

48
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,459
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue, not the ER.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,895
That's why you're gonna do a venogram
instead of an arteriogram.

50
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,397
This is not a high-pressure burst.
It's a low-pressure leak.

51
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,233
Still could've been drugs that caused
the pipes to corrode in the first place.

52
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,693
So go look under his mattress.

53
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,821
See if he's got any pills or powder
stashed with the hand lotion.

54
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,633
Sweet ride. I asked for the one
with the sissy bar and the banana seat,

55
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,012
but Santa gave me this instead. Guess
that's what I get for being naughty.

56
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,682
You must be Dr. House.

57
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,641
Yeah.

58
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,311
So looks like there's been some sort
of mix-up at the parking office.

59
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,146
They had to move me closer
to the door.

60
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,858
Had to? You don't look like
the type to pull a weapon.

61
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,694
- Wheelchair.
- Cane.

62
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,322
I think you should do the honorable
thing and let me have my space back.

63
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,617
Oh, well,
since you asked so nicely, wheelchair.

64
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,997
Cane. Walking long distances
makes my leg hurt.

65
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,623
And it's easy for me?

66
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,042
Of course not.
Pushing that little lever?

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,296
The muscles must burn. I'm sure
the last 10 yards are pure torture.

68
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,664
Crossing the parking lot is dangerous.
Cars can't see me.

69
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,010
You ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

70
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,722
No, gosh, on account of the fact
that I can't walk.

71
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,683
Maybe you should ask the parking office
for some crampons.

72
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:55,688
This is about who can most easily cross
the parking lot. You're the winner.

73
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,899
Oh, and the prize
is apparently a parking space.

74
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,299
There's still no answer at either
one of your parent's cell numbers.

75
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,622
Is there any other way
we might be able to contact them?

76
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,209
No, they're in a conference.

77
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,462
They probably had
to turn them off or something.

78
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,829
What does it matter where they are?
I mean, he's in pain.

79
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,965
You gotta do something.

80
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,216
We need them to sign this.

81
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,427
Why can't he just
sign the papers? He's 16.

82
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,928
Still not an adult.

83
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,848
Then call my parents. They know him,
and they'll take responsibility,

84
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,475
- do whatever you need.
- I can't. It won't...

85
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,269
You can't just let him sit here in agony
until his parents finally decide...

86
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,354
Leah, it's okay.

87
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,440
No, it's not.

88
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,862
I feel like there's an anvil
sitting on my chest.

89
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:07,134
You win. I'm doing the venogram now.
We'll deal with the fallout later.

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,106
My fingers feel wet.

91
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,566
That's just the dye.
Your nerves can't tell the difference

92
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,212
between the cold inside your body
and the wet outside your body.

93
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,321
The nerves can't tell the difference,

94
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,782
or the brain can't interpret
the difference?

95
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,952
A little of both.
You like science?

96
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,042
Looks like a diffusion pattern.

97
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,711
That's because it's
the venous side. Low pressure.

98
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,839
So Graham's law applies.

99
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,633
You've taken physics already?

100
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,427
No, I just sort of
read up on my own.

101
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,098
I had to teach myself a lot of stuff,
too. Schools sucked where I grew up.

102
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,142
You go to public or private?

103
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,184
Public.

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,189
Leak has to be in the pulmonary veins
to get in my lungs, right?

105
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,357
Yep.

106
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,192
I don't see anything. Do you?

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,777
No.

108
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,612
It doesn't make sense.

109
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,616
How can I have a bloody effusion
without any bleeding?

110
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,469
This is putrid.

111
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,473
Put food-borne parasites and infections
on the list to check on.

112
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll take the bedroom.

113
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,575
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know
there was anyone.

114
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,786
- We were just...
- Oh, God! I have a gun.

115
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,272
Look, you can take whatever you want.
My wallet's in my suit.

116
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,791
Freeze! Freeze!

117
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,126
I'm calling the cops.

118
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,380
Okay, you don't have a gun,
and you're not calling the cops.

119
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,267
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops unless
you two get out of here right now.

120
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,596
"Unless"? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar does something?

121
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,611
You don't want to
have to explain the affair.

122
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,978
We're not having an affair.

123
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,482
He's got a ring. You don't.

124
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,776
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

125
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,320
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

126
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,156
I'm guessing you're a better lover
than you are a maid.

127
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,118
Maid? You son of a bitch.

128
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

129
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,709
- Sorry.
- And what's wrong with my kitchen?

130
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,255
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here to help Stevie.

131
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,757
Who's Stevie?

132
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,509
Your son?

133
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,306
It was the address you gave.

134
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,952
The ER must have
written it down wrong.

135
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,227
Or you lied because you don't want us
to talk to your parents.

136
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,687
I gave you their phone numbers.

137
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,481
You gave us some numbers.
We haven't been able to reach anyone.

138
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,208
I told you,
they must be in a conference.

139
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,776
- He's lying.
- Leah.

140
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,989
He's Romany, a Gypsy.

141
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,617
So you don't have a home?

142
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,244
Of course we do.

143
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,247
What, next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires

144
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,875
and stealing children?
This is why I don't tell people.

145
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,482
They share everything with each other

146
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,505
and nothing with the gadje,
the outsiders.

147
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,884
Sharing information with outsiders
has not gone so well for my people.

148
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,055
Right now you're making yourself
more vulnerable by lying to us.

149
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,434
You can't go to my house.
You'll pollute it.

150
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,881
All we're gonna do
is look around.

151
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,353
Your presence is enough.

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,567
My parents take it seriously.

153
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,819
It's spiritual
as much as it is physical.

154
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:54,987
You know where he lives?

155
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,447
Don't.

156
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,407
Look, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

157
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,813
If we can't
trust your answers...

158
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,995
I drink sometimes, okay?
I've smoked pot.

159
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,749
I'll tell you anything,
the truth. You just...

160
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,336
You can't go in my home.

161
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,091
The pot wouldn't cause a bleeding
problem. A pesticide on the pot could.

162
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,093
Where did you get it?

163
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,303
Some kid at school.

164
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,597
Stevie. He got the pot from me.

165
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,682
He doesn't even go to school.
His parents made him drop out.

166
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,893
- I'm home-schooled.
- He reads books.

167
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,646
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really a professor?

168
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,357
He's a salesman.

169
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,859
They buy and sell anything
they can get their hands on.

170
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,445
They? So you're with your dad
when he's making these deals?

171
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,781
He was just in Chicago
a week ago.

172
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,993
- You fly?
- No, my dad's got a truck.

173
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,210
You can't be serious.

174
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,336
Actually, I can.

175
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,382
See? It's my space.
I want it back.

176
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,009
It's not your space.
It's the hospital's space,

177
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,221
and the hospital thinks
that the person who's worse off

178
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,056
should get the better space.

179
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,267
Your application for a handicap space
says you can walk 50 yards.

180
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,686
And Whitner's says
she can roll 50 miles

181
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,022
between oil changes.
I can't change my leg.

182
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,609
The space I moved you to is only
46 yards away from the front door.

183
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,236
- I measured. You'll be fine.
- Great.

184
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,407
So I can collapse four yards into the
lobby instead of outside in the cold.

185
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,200
- As long as it's not in my office.
- Do you know who won

186
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,329
the New York City Marathon
six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair.

187
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,331
Then go get yourself one,
and leave me alone.

188
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,792
Give me my space,
I'll be happy to roll around all day.

189
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,087
You couldn't last one week
in a wheelchair.

190
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,672
Wanna bet?

191
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,553
What's wrong with you?

192
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,139
Nothing that a week off
my feet won't solve.

193
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,765
Venogram's negative. No leak.

194
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,016
You mean you couldn't
find the leak.

195
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:48,976
Is your leg worse?

196
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,478
No, my parking spot is.

197
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,022
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

198
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,108
- which means when we find it outside...
- There's no leak.

199
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,776
- I even checked lymphatics.
- So you're gonna spend a week

200
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,320
in a wheelchair just to get a
parking space closer to the front door?

201
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,030
Easier than chopping off my legs.

202
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,437
We've ruled out toxins
and drugs.

203
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,286
Kind of. He's Romany. Apparently,
they feel the need to keep secrets,

204
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,996
so it's hard to know
anything for sure.

205
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,581
Yeah, he's also a human being,

206
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,458
which means you shouldn't be
trusting him to begin with.

207
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,877
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

208
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,462
It's a deep-vein thrombosis.

209
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,298
The kid spent 16 hours
in the back seat of an old pick-up.

210
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,258
Causes a clot,
makes its way to his lungs.

211
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,784
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot, bust it with TPA.

212
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,847
Or we can find the leak.

213
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,221
There's no leak.

214
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,808
Hey, you can't yell at a guy
in a wheelchair.

215
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,687
This is a slow leak.
You've got to speed it up.

216
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,314
Thin his blood.
Redo the venogram.

217
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,107
That could cause
a massive bleed.

218
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,693
Excellent.
Massive will be even easier to find.

219
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,155
Pardon me. I guess you guys
are gonna have to get the next one.

220
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,369
I thought you were
redoing the venogram.

221
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,330
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

222
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,209
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little poke.

223
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,630
Can you maybe do that?

224
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,257
Don't worry. It's just your leg. I don't
have to go any further than this.

225
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,427
Take a look at this,
bones of your forearm.

226
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,262
Radius and ulna.

227
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,472
How about the wrist?

228
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,685
Lunate, hamate, the...

229
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,481
"Scared lovers try positions
they can't handle."

230
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,196
It's a mnemonic for the wrist bones.
It's the only way I can remember them.

231
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,998
You okay?

232
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,293
- My stomach.
- Did you hit something?

233
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,212
- I barely started.
- Lie flat.

234
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,378
- No, I can't. It hurts too much.
- I'm getting out.

235
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,882
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

236
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,759
If he moves,
I could shred his artery.

237
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,718
Get it out now!

238
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,846
It's gonna be okay, Stevie.
Just inject the dye.

239
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,685
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

240
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,092
Clot's gotta be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

241
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,398
It's not constricting it.
It's completely blocking it.

242
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,857
His whole liver's fried.

243
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,078
The kid's liver's failing
because of a massive clot

244
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,957
that's blocking his hepatic vein.
How can he have both a bleed and a clot?

245
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,625
It's not a clot.
You must have blocked the vein

246
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,502
- with a catheter wire.
- Not a chance.

247
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,629
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

248
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,090
There's no heart failure or cirrhosis.
Means it has to be a clot.

249
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,677
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

250
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,680
And since he clearly
has some kind of...

251
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,057
You having a little problem?

252
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,100
Would you mind?

253
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,940
Boy, that was humiliating. How
does Whitner make it through the day?

254
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,401
"Pride goeth before the fall."

255
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,654
Lucky for me,
I'm sitting in one of these babies.

256
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,948
So what other theories
can I shoot down?

257
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,234
DIC would explain both the...

258
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,619
His platelets are normal,
and his PTT isn't elevated.

259
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,455
- Leukemia?
- Normal CBC, and differential?

260
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,000
You guys are thinking like doctors when
you should be thinking like plumbers.

261
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,127
Come on, I wanna see
some butt crack.

262
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,921
Something inside the liver
is punching holes in the pipes.

263
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,633
Blood bleeds through the opening,
sticks to the intruder, forms a mass.

264
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,384
- A clot.
- A mass.

265
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,511
Cancer? A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

266
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,306
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.

267
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,726
Do a CT, MRI,
sputum and ACE level.

268
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,021
Excuse me. Sorry.
Cripple coming through.

269
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,029
He says his throat hurts.

270
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,324
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

271
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,950
No, I don't.

272
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,039
- Good enough for me.
- Where are you going?

273
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,250
Mothers know best.
Get yourself a sucker on the way out.

274
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,379
Look, I think he's just faking
so he doesn't have to go to school.

275
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,547
How did you know
I was a truant officer?

276
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,467
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

277
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,596
Right. He's wasting your precious time,
so you decided to waste mine.

278
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,056
How thoughtful.

279
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,187
I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't
examine him all the way up there.

280
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,233
Hop down. My life is just
one horror after another.

281
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,735
Open.

282
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,237
Does it look like it hurts?

283
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,363
No.

284
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,290
What's that?

285
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,334
Syringe. I'm with you.

286
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,379
Make him hate the doctor's office
more than he hates school.

287
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,548
That's okay.
I don't think that's...

288
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,632
It's just saline.

289
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,719
Hurts like hell when it's injected
directly into the muscle.

290
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,125
So what do you think,
arm or ass?

291
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,513
I think he's
learned his lesson.

292
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,182
Oh, I don't know.
We better check.

293
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:44,020
Jack, is your mommy a big,
fat idiot?

294
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,066
Well, what do you know?
I guess you were right.

295
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,824
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

296
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,203
Sorry, I'm guessing the mike
in this thing doesn't pick up nods.

297
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,580
Smart kid.

298
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,248
Too bad it's all
gonna go to waste.

299
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,774
Nothing wrong
with being a salesman.

300
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,501
He should be able to
pursue his own life,

301
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,045
not be stuck helping his parents
sell old toasters.

302
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,423
He's still young. You never know
what he'll end up doing.

303
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,801
Unless he goes back to school,
I know exactly what he'll end up doing.

304
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,513
Wait. A lesion?

305
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,433
Magnifying times five.

306
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,768
It's a granuloma.

307
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,603
It means Wegener's
is the most likely.

308
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,732
- Stevie!
- Mom, is that you?

309
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,817
Get him out of this now.

310
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,235
Your son is sick.
The sign on the door...

311
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,987
The sign says, "No metal."
We took everything off.

312
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,072
It says, "No admittance."

313
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,325
- What's wrong with our son?
- We don't know yet.

314
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,911
He's not gonna die, is he?

315
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,457
Your son is very ill.
We're still trying to figure out why,

316
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,251
which is why
we need you to leave the room.

317
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,522
What are you gonna do now?

318
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,567
Oh, now I've got to slide my butt
from one padded seat to another.

319
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,778
What if I bump my knee?

320
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,948
MRI showed
a granuloma in his liver.

321
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,658
Fantastic.

322
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,661
- Wanna give me a hand here?
- No.

323
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:25,080
Clotting, bleeding and a granuloma
equals Wegener's.

324
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,124
I know. That's why I said fantastic.
I was being sincere.

325
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,085
- Now, give me a hand.
- Wouldn't be fair.

326
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,878
We're gonna biopsy
the liver to confirm.

327
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,255
Wouldn't be fair not to.

328
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,050
People are good and kind and gentle
and help people in wheelchairs.

329
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,802
- You don't believe that.
- But you do.

330
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,637
No, I don't.

331
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,807
Foreman, forget the biopsy.

332
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,684
His liver will be gone
before you get the results.

333
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,269
Start treatment
with cyclophosphamide

334
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,897
before the Wegener's
punches a hole in another pipe.

335
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,093
What's with the clothes?
You're not being discharged.

336
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,928
I know.

337
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,224
It's my parents.
They insist that I wear this stuff.

338
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,103
We insist on our own food,
gown and furnishings for a reason.

339
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,107
Hey, my chest burns.
Are you sure the treatments are working?

340
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,443
Wegener's causes the body
to attack itself.

341
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,862
That doesn't get undone
overnight. Be patient.

342
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,364
- Where's your soup?
- It's in the garbage.

343
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,741
It has willow-bark extract.

344
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,826
Willow-bark extract
is basically aspirin.

345
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,286
Yes, for the fever.

346
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,413
He's already on meds, our meds.

347
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,166
We can't risk any
adverse interactions.

348
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,585
We need all this stuff to go.
We need to control this environment.

349
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,171
So do we. People get sick
for a reason,

350
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,923
'cause something in their life
is out of balance.

351
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,092
Dad, he's a doctor.
He doesn't want to hear your talk.

352
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,262
Balance is just starting to be restored
now that that girl is gone.

353
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,640
That girl took pretty good care
of your son while you were away.

354
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,725
Yes, we can see that.

355
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,603
Look, all this stuff may make him feel
more comfortable, but it's not gonna...

356
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,812
How long is this treatment
gonna take?

357
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,459
We should start to see
some improvement

358
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,440
in his liver function soon.

359
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,109
Soon. Very scientific.

360
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,074
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,166
I'll be back in a little bit
to check on you.

362
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,633
Ah, yes, if it isn't
Dr. Ironside.

363
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,970
Ah, if it isn't Dr. "I Had No Friends
When I Was Growing Up",

364
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,763
"So All I Did Was Watch TV
by Myself,."

365
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,329
"Which Is Why I Can Now Make
Constant Pop-Culture References."

366
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,184
"Which No One Understands
but Me."

367
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,561
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

368
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,901
Safe from Cuddy, but I guess not
from her trusted rat-complice.

369
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,405
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits of their handicaps.

370
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,324
Reasonable people
make rules based on evidence,

371
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,660
like difficulty
covering a distance,

372
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,330
say, 50 yards, not on
some preordained patheticness scale.

373
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,333
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth heavenly virtue.

374
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,877
It's only pigheaded if you're wrong.
If you're right,

375
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,724
they call it,
"Sticking to your principles."

376
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,381
Give it up.
You're demeaning yourself.

377
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,133
That's what they told
Rosa Parks.

378
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,885
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

379
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,304
Get out of our home.

380
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,432
This is not a home.
It's certainly not...

381
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,933
It's our home as long as
our son is here.

382
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,270
Mom, Dad, will you please
just calm down.

383
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,565
You're not family.
You have no right to be here.

384
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,067
What are you gonna do? Throw me out?
You can't even touch the gadje.

385
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,236
- I'll touch you.
- What is going on?

386
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,114
I'm the one who brought him here.
I should be able to see how he's doing.

387
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,401
He wouldn't even need to be here
if it weren't for you.

388
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,244
Right. I'm so unclean,
I caused his liver to shut down.

389
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,329
Enough. No one is leaving.

390
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,331
He's our son,
and we want her out of here.

391
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,503
- It hurts.
- It's your stomach again?

392
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,589
- No.
- What?

393
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,349
His liver's actually improving.

394
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,685
We plug one hole
and end up poking another.

395
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,411
Are we talking about the patient
or how to get a raise from Cuddy?

396
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,232
The Wegener's treatment gave him
a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.

397
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,027
Which means it's Wegener's.

398
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,473
- What did I just say?
- We were treating him for Wegener's

399
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,156
- when everything went wrong.
- Not everything.

400
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,867
Yeah, it was a very
lovely day outside.

401
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,536
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse.

402
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,747
Treatment made his
bladder worse, not his liver.

403
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,123
Clot in the liver's
breaking up.

404
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,628
And MRI, sputum and ACE
ruled out TB, sarcoidosis and lymphoma,

405
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,962
which leaves us with...

406
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,255
Still could be
a cancer with multiple...

407
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,383
A cancer we can't see
on MRI, CT or blood tests?

408
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,928
It's Wegener's.

409
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,472
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

410
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,141
We could increase immunosuppression.
Add methotrexate.

411
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,645
We can't give methotrexate to a kid
who's already had lung problems.

412
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,482
Methotrexate is carpet bombing.
Hits everything.

413
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
We need a smart bomb.

414
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:09,405
We don't suppress the immune system.
We change it.

415
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:15,620
Immune modulation. FT28. His antibodies
are attacking his blood vessels.

416
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,873
The irritation causes it to bleed
and clot. We change his immune system

417
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,251
so the antibodies don't interact
with his blood vessels

418
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,877
but work fine everywhere else.

419
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,797
FT28 is still experimental.
It's not FDA approved.

420
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,466
It's worked for Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.

421
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,136
He doesn't have Crohn's
or arthritis.

422
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:35,306
Let's say that he does
and start the treatment.

423
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,481
Absolutely not.

424
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,067
My people have been experimented on
before. Never again.

425
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,695
Mister Lipa,
with all due respect,

426
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,157
comparing this hospital
with Auschwitz, it's ridiculous.

427
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,450
FT28 has been proven
safe in hundreds...

428
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,035
People always say
you can trust them.

429
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,287
Why would they
say anything else?

430
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,872
Why do they think
we would listen?

431
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,207
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come from a people

432
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,501
who've been enslaved,
mistreated and experimented on?

433
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,504
Tuskegee went on for 28 years
after World War II.

434
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,882
And the laws that made it illegal
for the Romany to even set foot

435
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:13,303
in this state were still on the books
until 1998. It's not ancient history.

436
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,141
Conventional therapy hasn't worked.
Your son may be dying.

437
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:24,022
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

438
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm sorry. A lifetime of experiences
tells me I can't trust you,

439
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,241
and the past three days
have done nothing to change that.

440
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,953
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

441
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,119
If you don't know how to
do that, then just tell us,

442
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,750
so we can take him
someplace where they do.

443
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,711
They're absolutely right.
Stay away

444
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,756
from that unproven, experimental stuff.
Much better to stick

445
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,091
with the "moving the furniture
until he gets better" approach.

446
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,427
Yes, you're right. We're gonna
have to come up with something else.

447
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,640
Do you mean another last-ditch,
desperation move? You got anything?

448
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,809
Go back and don't take no for an answer.
What kind of salesman are you?

449
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,978
The kind who avoids the house
with the crazy couple

450
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,355
who put tin foil
over their windows.

451
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,602
They got money for tin foil,

452
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,982
they got money for
whatever you're selling.

453
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,859
What's that mean?

454
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,696
It means that if they don't trust you,
you should earn that lack of trust.

455
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,782
What does paying
for tinfoil mean?

456
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,826
Why should I have
to answer all the questions?

457
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,165
Oops.

458
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,834
Sorry. Still getting used to
the power steering.

459
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,202
I assume you've heard the news?

460
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,255
I'm not worried.

461
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,591
From what I hear, what you lack
in shame, you also lack in willpower.

462
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,719
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong

463
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,722
and pain-free
now that I've stopped using the cane.

464
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,975
Of course, it's harder
to look down Cuddy's shirt,

465
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,353
but then the vantage point
on her ass has much improved.

466
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,772
Then that's just me,
always looking on the bright side.

467
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,775
I'm the guy who said
that her C-cups are half full.

468
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,736
They are nice, aren't they?

469
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,493
Oh, no, no, no, you're not
gonna win me over that easily.

470
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,163
You may have a wheel.
It doesn't mean you get the grease.

471
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,082
You gotta squeak.

472
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,265
What's that?

473
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,683
It's cyclophosphamide.

474
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,395
We're continuing
the standard treatment as you requested.

475
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,109
I have to ask everyone
to leave the room for a few minutes

476
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,445
while I apply some bandages.

477
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,447
Why do we have to leave?

478
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,118
They're for his penis.

479
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:01,512
You lied to them. The bleeding's
stopped. I don't need any bandages.

480
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,640
I need to change
your treatment,

481
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,809
but your parents won't let us.
They've got it in their minds

482
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,854
that we want to try some sort
of inhuman experiment on you.

483
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,689
The treatment's experimental?

484
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,275
FT28 has been through extensive
clinical trials.

485
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,320
It's also been used successfully
for other conditions.

486
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,948
The fact that you're recommending
experimental treatment

487
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,493
means you have
no other options.

488
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:28,247
Sorry. We stop the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails.

489
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,333
We save your liver,
the bladder fails.

490
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,584
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this...

491
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,919
What do you need me to do?

492
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,092
Take the medicine,
but don't tell your parents.

493
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,636
I don't like lying
to my parents.

494
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,002
The rest of the world,
though...

495
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,639
The rest of the world
I can't trust.

496
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,682
You can trust me.

497
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,767
How do I know?

498
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,940
Because if you do this, then tell
your parents, I lose my license.

499
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,913
- God.
- Get in here.

500
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,590
Wow, his spleen
basically exploded, huh?

501
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,178
Got another bleeder.
2-O silk on a stick.

502
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,472
Got it.

503
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,109
I believe you ordered
your meat rare.

504
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,570
Keep him open.
If I confirm Wegener's,

505
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,656
might as well stage the disease
while he's still on the table.

506
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,874
What's taking so long?

507
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,334
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

508
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,755
No signs of a clot or a bleed. Normal
follicles, normal lymphoid tissue.

509
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:03,259
His spleen is ripped to shreds. There's
gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.

510
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,888
Come on, can't leave Humpty Dumpty
like this forever.

511
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,474
I don't see anything
but normal spleen. No granulomas.

512
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,850
Means no Wegener's.

513
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,145
That's all I need to know.
Let's go people.

514
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,563
Run his bowel.

515
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,857
No need. I'm closing.

516
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,244
Suture.

517
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,892
Run his bowel.

518
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,936
Nothing suspicious
in the spleen.

519
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,562
Get him out of here.

520
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,897
You missed it.

521
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,815
He had a granuloma
in his liver.

522
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,026
No, it was just scar tissue.

523
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,404
Looks like a granuloma
on the MRI, but it's not.

524
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:10,493
I don't know why I'm debating this.
Pass me the Kelly clamp. I'm closing.

525
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,454
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into this kid's stomach.

526
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,040
Get out of there.
He's unstable.

527
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,794
He's got Wegener's,
which means he's got granulomas.

528
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,878
I'm calling my lawyer.

529
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,129
It's only 26 feet.

530
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,674
If you were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

531
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,094
Blood pressure's dropping.

532
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,845
Hang another bag
of Ringer's lactate.

533
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,431
I'm having nothing
to do with this.

534
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,724
Foreman, hang another bag...

535
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,018
Ringer's lactate. Got it.

536
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:51,200
Come on. Come on. It's gotta be in here.
It's gotta be in here.

537
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,211
It's not.

538
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,921
Mind if we close?

539
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:15,141
It's a good thing we never sold him
on FT28. His parents were right.

540
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,111
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us near him again.

541
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,614
They won't be able to transfer him
until he's recovered from the surgery.

542
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,907
You can add the surgical team
to the list of people

543
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,074
who won't let us near him.

544
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,622
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots,
spleen explodes.

545
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,999
We should test for
Von Willebrand's.

546
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,127
Or just play tic-tac-toe.

547
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:47,548
Okay, X's are bleeds.
O's are clots.

548
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,925
We started in the lungs, right?
What did we do?

549
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,261
CT, sputum, two venograms.

550
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,556
It's one bleed, one clot,
then what?

551
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,101
Liver shut down, MRI, labs,
treated with cyclophosphamide.

552
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:03,606
Whereupon he peed out three units
of O-negative, another bleed.

553
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,650
- Where is this going?
- I don't know yet.

554
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,193
- What's next?
- Bladder, kidneys.

555
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,029
High-resolution CT scan,
UA and urine sediment.

556
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:10,988
GI tract?

557
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,740
You ran his small bowel
in the OR.

558
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,742
The large bowel's fixed
to the abdominal wall.

559
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,619
- I didn't run that.
- Because there was no reason to.

560
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,788
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

561
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,206
Do a colonoscopy.

562
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,791
Because he's had no symptoms?

563
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,669
You lose your keys, the first thing
you do is look everywhere

564
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,504
you might logically
have placed them.

565
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,923
When you don't find them,
then you start looking in other places.

566
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,344
The medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox.
We need to look in this kid's mailbox.

567
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,638
Why don't we x-ray his feet?
They're fine, too.

568
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,932
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

569
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,143
Okay, even if that did make sense,
it's kind of hard to do a colonoscopy

570
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,521
on a kid you can't get near.

571
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,067
He's in the ICU now.

572
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,654
His parent's only have
limited visiting privileges.

573
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,866
I like that kid.
He's got spunk.

574
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,719
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

575
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,095
You're still in that thing?

576
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,388
What thing?

577
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,558
Oh, this?
Forgot it was even there.

578
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,644
You know, even if you manage not to get
struck down by a bolt of lightning,

579
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,646
and make it a week,
Cuddy's not gonna give you the space.

580
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,689
She can't.

581
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,732
A bet's a bet.

582
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,277
Yes, and that rule outranks
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

583
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,697
You think you've got logic on your side,
but Whitner's got the legal system,

584
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,324
and legal beats logic
every time. Just ask OJ.

585
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,868
You're right.

586
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,746
- I am?
- Yeah.

587
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,414
So you're doing this even though

588
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,666
you know you've got no legal leg
to stand on?

589
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,545
Who needs legs when you got wheels?
I'm gonna get that spot.

590
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,132
No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.

591
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,926
What did you say?

592
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,094
I'll see you later.

593
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,806
Gonna have them yelling at me
for the next 20 minutes.

594
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,061
Mucosa looks normal, healthy.
No lonely diverticula.

595
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,606
Blood pressure's dropping.
He's bleeding again.

596
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,940
I'm in his colon.

597
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,862
- Hurry up.
- I am.

598
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,030
There's nothing there.

599
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,865
Wait. Wait. What's that?

600
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,037
A reflection?

601
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,247
No, it's something.

602
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,375
Looks like a...

603
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,462
Toothpick.

604
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,588
Are you sure?

605
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,381
He must have swallowed it accidentally

606
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,176
and just figured
he'd digest it eventually.

607
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,222
When you two were making out in the car,
he must have folded awkwardly,

608
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,266
pushed the toothpick through the wall
of the intestine and into the lung.

609
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,272
Then it moved on to his liver and
made its way to his bladder and spleen.

610
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,979
So that's it?
He's gonna be okay?

611
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,606
Yeah, small holes.

612
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,984
It shouldn't take that long to heal
now that we've got it out.

613
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,571
- See? See what you did?
- Me?

614
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,018
If you hadn't been kissing him...

615
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,616
That's what you heard?

616
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,035
It was the toothpick.
It was that disgusting habit that you...

617
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,039
It would have just passed right through
him if he hadn't been writhing around.

618
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,874
Isn't that right...

619
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
That's it?

620
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,465
Yeah, that's it.

621
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,969
Wood absorbs water, becomes the
same density as the tissue around it.

622
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,138
That's why it didn't show up
on the CT or MRI.

623
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,390
That's cool.

624
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,395
I mean, not cool for me,

625
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,773
but a lot of damage
for something so small.

626
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:38,028
You know, the lab here,
they have a paid intern position.

627
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,490
It's usually given to one of the kids
from the universities,

628
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,785
but if you want,
I could probably get you an interview.

629
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,705
You know, some entry-level
stuff, some gopher work,

630
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:51,292
but you'd also have access
to a lot of cool things.

631
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,173
Thanks, really, but I can't.

632
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,052
Yes, you can.
Stevie, you're bright.

633
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:07,308
You have more curiosity
than 90% of the doctors on this staff.

634
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,895
No, it's not that. It's just...

635
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,816
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

636
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,944
People I've known
my whole life.

637
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,988
I don't want to lose that.

638
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,740
You can have both.

639
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,119
No, I can't.

640
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,913
Because they don't
want to let you.

641
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,875
They shouldn't be
making you choose.

642
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,419
Maybe not, but they are.

643
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,547
I'm choosing them.

644
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,804
Change is hard.
Trust me, I know.

645
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,642
But it worked out for me.

646
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,894
You're a successful doctor.

647
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,650
Your name is on journal articles.
I would love that.

648
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:04,490
It's just I see you
with Doctors Chase and Cameron,

649
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,327
and you all got
empty ring fingers.

650
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,375
You're alone.

651
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,018
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

652
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
So are you gonna tell Doctor Whitner
she's out of my space,

653
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,940
- or can I?
- Why would I do that?

654
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,860
Because you said that
you would, and lying is wrong.

655
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,990
I said I would give you the space
if you made it a whole week...

656
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,866
- Which I...
- Didn't.

657
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,121
The bet didn't stipulate that you
had to be in the chair for a week

658
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,832
unless you had to barge
into an operating room

659
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,917
and shove your hands
in a kid's bowels.

660
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,627
You know about that?

661
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,671
You lost.

662
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,715
I saved a life.

663
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,759
Two minutes out of the chair
to save a kid's life.

664
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,011
You lost, House.

665
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,804
I earned that space.

666
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,514
No, you didn't.

667
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,351
I earn that space every day I limp
into that building and do my damn job.

668
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,311
You lost.

669
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,564
Hey!

670
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:30,409
You were never gonna give me that space,
were you? I saw Whitner the other day.

671
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,911
She knew about the bet,
didn't seem that worried.

672
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,246
She knew I'd win.

673
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,331
She doesn't know me.

674
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,167
In fact, she doesn't know anything,
except what you tell her.

675
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:42,838
You told her that you were never gonna
give me that space, didn't you?

676
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,261
Just tell me,
do you at least feel a little guilty?

677
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,101
You wanna teach me lessons,
don't make commitments you can't keep.

678
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,485
How's it going?

679
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,861
How guilty does she look?

680
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,784
About an eight.

681
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:16,622
That space is mine.
Veni, vidi, vici.
