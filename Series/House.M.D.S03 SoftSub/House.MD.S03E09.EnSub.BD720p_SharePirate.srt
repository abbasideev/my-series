1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,805
All right. Stand here.

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,641
You're just tall enough.

3
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:19,977
I...

4
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,270
I don't...

5
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,314
I don't think I am.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
It just goes around.

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,067
There's nothing to be
scared of, all right?

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,027
I didn't say I was scared.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,028
It'll be fun.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,823
Come on, when I was a kid,
this was my favorite thing ever.

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,242
I don't like rides.

12
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,828
All right. All right.

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,205
I just...
I thought it would be fun.

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,915
I shouldn't be
making you do this.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,208
Uh...

16
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,128
Let's go home.
We can have fun at home.

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,796
No, Daddy. Wait.

18
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,097
The ride does look like fun.

19
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,317
Oh, this is awesome.

20
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,713
Alice? Are you all right?

21
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,299
Honey, you all right?

22
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,471
Alice? Alice? Are you okay?

23
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,381
Nothing happened.

24
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,633
Something happened.

25
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,880
It was a little kiddie ride.

26
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,386
She hates those rides. I don't
understand why you insist on making...

27
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,056
Okay, I appreciate
the fullness of your answers,

28
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,099
but I just wanted
to know if she'd had

29
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,851
any history of
abdominal problems.

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,977
- No.
- No.

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,356
The admitting doctor noted
no family history of...

32
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,149
I have an aunt
with Crohn's disease.

33
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,026
You didn't mention that?

34
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,473
I forgot what it
was called, okay?

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,613
Your aunt's got
a million things wrong with her.

36
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,989
If you paid attention
for five minutes...

37
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,033
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of the other symptoms.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,994
You're alone with her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,913
I'm wondering if
we can focus on

40
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,623
answering the questions,
Mrs. Hartmann.

41
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,876
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann.
We're divorced.

42
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,003
I suspected.

43
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,092
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

44
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,594
We're half a million dollars
from our goal.

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,390
Of course, this is a naming opportunity
for your foundation.

46
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,936
Is there a problem?

47
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,314
There's something on your face.

48
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,318
It's, uh...

49
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,033
- Excuse me.
- Oh...

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,118
Oh, God.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper,

52
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,378
because at least then
the sociopath isn't my employee.

53
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,673
This baby won me second place
in the clinic's weekly

54
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,092
"weirdest thing pulled out
of an orifice" contest.

55
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,304
I am this close
to putting a new lab in Oncology.

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,514
You do not want
to know what came in first.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,515
House.

58
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,017
It rhymes with fucchini.

59
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,144
Give me his pills.

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,442
Where's my prescription?

61
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,968
No more
free-floating prescriptions.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,238
Princeton P.D. has already forced
Wilson to shut down.

63
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,866
A cop says "Boo",
Wilson shuts down.

64
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,660
Every doctor in
this place is afraid

65
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,621
to make a move
without covering his ass.

66
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,206
You think maybe you're shouting
at the wrong person?

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,213
Tritter's obviously
out to get me. He doesn't...

68
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,668
You forged prescriptions!

69
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,045
Allegedly.

70
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,048
Your pain has become my pain.

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,134
From now on, you get reasonable doses
at reasonable times.

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,303
But I hurt in
an unreasonable way.

73
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,930
Then dip into
your secret stash.

74
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,139
Tritter took it.

75
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,350
Then move on to your secret,
secret stash.

76
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,601
- I ran out.
- Then move on

77
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,603
to your secret,
secret, secret stash.

78
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,408
Parents say she's
not on any meds.

79
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,411
If the pancreatitis wasn't set off by
drugs, and she hasn't been sick,

80
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,206
that leaves trauma
or some kind of structural defect.

81
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,624
Put up the CT.

82
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,294
What's that density there?

83
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,505
Shadow. Looks normal to me.

84
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,423
We got a referral from...

85
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,883
Excuse me.

86
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,306
You stash your drugs
in a lupus textbook?

87
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,516
It's never lupus.

88
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,018
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,978
Gallstones?

90
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,189
Biliary duct is dilated,
probably from a stone lodged in it.

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,108
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

92
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,443
She's six. Six-year-olds
don't get gallstones.

93
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,987
So, she didn't
have pancreatitis?

94
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,406
Your theory is
an invisible gallstone?

95
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,242
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

96
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,494
You might want to wait until
he actually tells us his theory

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,496
before you start
kissing his theory's ass.

98
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,415
My theory is...

99
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,500
Vanishing gallstone.

100
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,544
She had it and it passed.

101
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,878
Those things travel in packs.

102
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,005
The rest of them are
probably hiding out

103
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,173
in her gallbladder.
Do an ultrasound.

104
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,301
If I'm right, take out the organ,
so we can analyze the stones.

105
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,853
I wasn't kissing his ass.

106
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,771
It must have
just looked that way from our angle,

107
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
you on your knees,
House bending over.

108
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,859
He predicted the pancreatitis.

109
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:00,901
It's his dad's fault.

110
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,111
My dad was an ass.

111
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,821
But you did
everything he wanted you to,

112
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,707
and in return,
you got everything you wanted.

113
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,491
Yeah, it's that simple.

114
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,743
The strategy worked.

115
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,871
Dad got him a cushy job,
paid for his cushy life.

116
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,540
Cut me out of his cushy will.

117
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,668
Told you. It's just his nature.

118
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,962
Poor guy's
hard-wired to kiss ass.

119
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,465
House was right. Gallstones.

120
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,136
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

121
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,471
It's unusual.

122
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,514
That's why we need to
see what's causing it.

123
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,684
We'd like to remove Alice's gallbladder
and analyze the stones.

124
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,852
- Sure.
- No.

125
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,104
- Just 'cause I said sure?
- I am capable of my own thoughts.

126
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,314
It's a simple procedure.

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,523
The gallbladder
isn't essential to...

128
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,484
The doctor thinks we should do it.
We should do it, Edie.

129
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,985
You think maybe we should
get a second opinion

130
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,155
before we start removing
our child's organs?

131
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,419
It's an effective use
of taxpayer's money.

132
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,421
I'm actually off this week.

133
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,049
I'm guessing
you don't have a family.

134
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,675
Most people have enough going on
in their lives

135
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,303
that they don't have
to personalize every slight.

136
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,222
This isn't personal.

137
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,681
Not anymore.

138
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,975
My head of Oncology
had to shut down.

139
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,896
My entire staff are afraid to make
a move without covering their ass.

140
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,816
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

141
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,820
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized,

142
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,822
his entire practice ruined?

143
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,989
No.

144
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,908
So, you just don't care?

145
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,955
This is how I get what I want.

146
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,292
I put pressure on people,
and if it doesn't work on Wilson,

147
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,420
it'll work on you.

148
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,298
You punish the innocent.

149
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,384
None of you are innocent.

150
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,094
Not one of you.

151
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,639
Not one of you has
told me the truth about Dr. House.

152
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,267
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

153
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,313
No. The pills distort reality.
He is an addict.

154
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,525
He's not out robbing
a liquor store, or...

155
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,860
No, he's treating people.

156
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:11,365
He needs to find a different way
to cope before he kills somebody.

157
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,908
If he hasn't done that already.

158
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,287
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

159
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,581
It should be dealt with
by doctors.

160
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,707
- Not by...
- It's not being dealt with by doctors.

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,502
Doctors are covering it up.

162
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,508
The whole point
of the criminal justice system

163
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,720
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

164
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,139
With all due respect,

165
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,475
you have failed.

166
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,406
Sorry, didn't know
you wanted your kid dead.

167
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,659
Although, for a couple of G's,
I can still make it happen.

168
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,744
Who the hell are you?

169
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,287
I am a complete stranger,

170
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,831
who apparently cares more
about whether your kid dies than you do.

171
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,999
You're Dr. House.

172
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,751
You've seen my stage show.

173
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,212
She's not dying.
She has pancreatitis.

174
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,139
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

175
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,590
And do what, burn sage?

176
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,091
I want you to do the surgery.

177
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,552
My father had gallstones.
They were totally harmless.

178
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,387
Alice had one bad one,
but it passed.

179
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,755
For all we know, this is over.

180
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,807
And for all we know,
she could get sick again tomorrow.

181
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,476
Then I'll take her
to her pediatrician.

182
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,061
She's six, Rob.

183
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,854
She shouldn't have
unnecessary surgery.

184
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,523
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

185
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,069
You're the doctor.
I'm the mother.

186
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,280
I outrank you. Live with it.

187
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,247
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

188
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,958
It's people like this
who killed Copernicus.

189
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,834
- Galileo.
- Either way.

190
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,628
And they just
locked Galileo up.

191
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,714
They killed his spirit,
and nobody likes a show-off.

192
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,384
Luckily, Alice Hartmann
has a dad who's willing to see reason.

193
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,512
Reason, as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

194
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,471
Their doctor.

195
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
Your Honor,
I've had no opportunity

196
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,391
to consult my attorney.

197
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,600
There's no time.

198
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,477
All I want is
a second opinion before...

199
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,979
No time.

200
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,940
Your testimony is
their child will die

201
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,984
if I don't grant
this motion right now?

202
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,318
Am I under oath?

203
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,903
Let's say yes.

204
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,072
My testimony is that this child

205
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,199
might die if you
don't grant this motion right now.

206
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,243
Literally no time
for a second opinion?

207
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,970
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

208
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,239
Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?

209
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,039
She's not
a specialist in this area.

210
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,708
Her opinion is worthless.

211
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,585
Dr. Cuddy, what do
you think of Dr. House?

212
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,422
Is he as big a jerk
as I think he is?

213
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,548
Bigger.

214
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,592
But he knows what
he's talking about.

215
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:04,872
Got a page.

216
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,540
She's complaining
about her stitches.

217
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,292
The nurse just said
that's completely normal.

218
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,298
Did you get the test results
for the gallstones?

219
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,087
- Any minute now.
- No time for a second opinion,

220
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,257
- but the test takes three...
- My skin hurts.

221
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,748
I know I no longer
have the right

222
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,511
to demand it but could
you please take a look?

223
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,471
Sure.

224
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,389
She's pissed, so now she's just looking
for things to go wrong.

225
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,977
You're right, I'm so petty I hope
she dies so it vindicates my opinion.

226
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,690
I didn't mean that, sweetie.

227
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,442
Mommy was being sarcastic.

228
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,195
She's a few years away
from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?

229
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,404
Guys.

230
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,378
I already gave you that number.

231
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,798
Simple surgical procedure turns
a little girl into The English Patient.

232
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:56,757
What gives?

233
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,218
Must be allergic to something
we used in the surgery.

234
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,386
Cameron,

235
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,138
C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

236
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,015
This is my office. I'm talking.

237
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,809
There are people
here who work for me.

238
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,575
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

239
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,437
Tritter froze my account.

240
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,607
They're checking theirs.
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

241
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,573
Call Wilson's lawyer.

242
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,860
He'll tell you exactly how
and why you're screwed.

243
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,445
This kid has no
history of allergies so...

244
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,030
You gotta talk to Tritter.

245
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,115
You gotta make this go away.

246
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,366
Yeah, great plan.

247
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,892
The man is obviously
open to reason.

248
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,036
Well, here's the plan,
we do nothing.

249
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,081
We while away the time
diagnosing the patient.

250
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,791
The stones were
calcium bilirubinate.

251
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,834
Pigment stones.

252
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,252
Which are non-conclusive.

253
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,755
Kid presented
with low-grade fever, mild anemia.

254
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,216
That, plus the stones,
indicates bacterial infection.

255
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,428
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash,

256
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,596
and doing nothing
is not a plan.

257
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,515
It's specifically
a lack of a plan.

258
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,893
We cut into her belly,
the bad boys escape.

259
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,856
They swarm over, colonize the wounds,
and kaplow, vesicular rash.

260
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,234
Allergic reaction is 100 times
more likely, with or without a history.

261
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,821
Fever and anemia could have been
symptoms of pancreatitis.

262
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,114
Hello?

263
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,700
Thank you for your help.

264
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
They froze my accounts.

265
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,078
"Thank you for your help"?

266
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,705
It's not her fault.

267
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,206
He hasn't gotten to mine, yet.

268
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,667
I'm gonna withdraw as much as I can,
as fast as I can.

269
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,377
Lunch is on me.

270
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,796
Do a scratch test.
Check for allergies.

271
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,008
When it comes back negative,
start broad-spectrum antibiotics.

272
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,097
Bullies bully. They don't get
a reaction, they lose interest.

273
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,059
Now go do what I ask
before I stick your heads in toilets.

274
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,526
How'd Otter get here?

275
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,612
Daddy got him last night.

276
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,364
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00. How'd you get it?

277
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,866
I drove over there,

278
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,245
and I knocked for about 10 minutes,
and then I begged.

279
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,256
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

280
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,257
My tummy hurts.

281
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,800
Ginger ale?

282
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,677
Yeah?

283
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,429
I'll take over.

284
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,556
Be right back.

285
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,843
He's always been really good
at the big romantic gestures,

286
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:22,486
but ask him to do the dishes, or show up
for a meal on time, or drive her...

287
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,321
Almost done here.

288
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,299
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

289
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,718
You passively-aggressively
gave up your practice.

290
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,803
I have clinic hours.

291
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,014
And now you're passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

292
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,701
with a big sign
around your neck saying,

293
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,018
"Wilson doesn't have enough cash
for the cafeteria."

294
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,813
You know, before Lenny Bruce died
of a drug overdose...

295
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,859
If you're going to confront me
with everyone who ever abused narcotics,

296
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,319
I think I'm gonna have to get
something to read.

297
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,321
He was arrested
on obscenity charges.

298
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,288
He went through
a series of arrests and trials,

299
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,492
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

300
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,287
He became obsessed
with his own legal problems,

301
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,914
and his act turned into long,
humorless rants

302
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,042
about fascist cops and
the violation of his rights.

303
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,837
I get it, I get it.
I need to change my nightclub act.

304
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,297
You think more props?

305
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,883
House, scratch test
is getting results, a lot of results.

306
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,612
How can she be
allergic to everything?

307
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,280
She can't be.

308
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,198
It has to be an infection.

309
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,201
You see a positive allergy test
and decide it's infection?

310
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,787
The bacteria got
into the scratches in her back.

311
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,414
The infection's radial.

312
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,124
- The shape of this isn't.
- Eat this.

313
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,584
I don't feel like eating.

314
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,590
It'll make you better.

315
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,502
A sandwich?

316
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,670
Magic sandwich.

317
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,758
- There's no such thing as...
- Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?

318
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,653
Amazing how she
didn't go into anaphylactic shock.

319
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,446
That's
diagnostically ridiculous.

320
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,740
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

321
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,535
If she is allergic, antibiotics could
cause a massive systemic reaction.

322
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,163
If she's allergic,
but she's not.

323
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,749
Chase, you're right.

324
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,209
The shape indicates allergy.

325
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,543
The tests indicate allergy.

326
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,350
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts,

327
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,340
doesn't mean she's not allergic
to lidocaine or...

328
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,007
Chase, hang the bag.

329
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,593
You can grow
a backbone tomorrow.

330
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,345
No, I'm not giving
my daughter drugs

331
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,721
that could shut
her system down.

332
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,307
You know what else
shuts down systems?

333
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,433
Death.

334
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,812
Sorry. I can't let you do this.

335
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:10,904
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom,
who is willing to see reason.

336
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,989
You were in here yesterday,
telling me

337
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,951
her father's guardianship
was best for her.

338
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,162
I honestly figured I'd get
a different judge today.

339
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,164
You agree with Dr. House now?

340
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,375
Now my kid actually is sick.

341
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,422
She was sick yesterday.

342
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,961
Her pediatrician
doesn't know what's wrong

343
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:26,920
with her,
says Dr. House is the best.

344
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,464
She loses guardianship,
and all of a sudden House is a hero.

345
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,966
It's got nothing to
do with me deciding...

346
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,134
Hey, zip it!

347
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,135
I've heard enough.

348
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,511
This lawyering thing is easy.

349
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,595
You shut up, too.

350
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,975
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time and mine.

351
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,312
Since her parents can't,
or won't, agree,

352
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,275
I'm awarding
temporary guardianship to a doctor,

353
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,320
who'll place the health
of the child above all else...

354
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,655
I don't think Dr. House
is capable of...

355
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,198
Dr. Cuddy. Yes, Your Honor.

356
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,909
No, I was finishing
my sentence.

357
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,787
The kid's all yours.

358
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,500
3:00, give me the pills.

359
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,918
I don't even know this kid.

360
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,712
How am I supposed to decide
what's best for her?

361
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,963
Fine, I'll choose.

362
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,923
I'm going to side with
the angry doctor's opinion.

363
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,091
Give me my pills.

364
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,718
We're not gonna
go broad-spectrum.

365
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,844
If there's any chance
that she's allergic...

366
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,928
There is no chance.

367
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,855
- Of course there's a chance.
- I'm appealing.

368
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,098
No, you're not.

369
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,850
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

370
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,769
- It's not going to be enough.
- We need to go broad-spectrum.

371
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,105
It kills bugs.
That's what you want.

372
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,357
We'll go with metronidazol.

373
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,864
You don't have to
testify he's broken any laws,

374
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,824
though I'm sure you could.

375
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,826
Just how many pills
he takes in a day.

376
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,705
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't

377
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,334
have that many
legitimate prescriptions.

378
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,004
I really hope no one dies while
I'm sitting here not talking to you.

379
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,257
I, uh, I had a, uh...

380
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,678
Had a buddy at Trenton P.D.

381
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,181
do some digging.

382
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,725
Your brother,
locked up for drugs.

383
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,771
Your own flesh and blood,
and you don't even visit.

384
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,316
But your boss
practices medicine on drugs,

385
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,278
time to start
lying to the cops.

386
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,407
If I run out for coffee, will I
get back before you make your point?

387
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,285
You testify,

388
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,165
I can make sure
that Marcus goes free on parole

389
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,918
in less than two months.

390
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,881
My brother and I, uh...

391
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,094
We grew up in the same home.

392
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,055
But...

393
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,308
I made something of myself.

394
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,519
He didn't.

395
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,438
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk,

396
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,983
you'd think you never committed
any crimes yourself.

397
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,655
Now, you and Dr. House,
you are both cold bastards.

398
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:03,076
You don't give a damn about
your brother, and you can't stand House.

399
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,333
But I do expect you
to take this deal,

400
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,170
because you hate
hypocrisy more.

401
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,923
House has had 1,000 chances.

402
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,174
You've got two chances.

403
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,845
Why is your brother
stuck at one?

404
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,185
Well, if she were allergic
to this antibiotic,

405
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,271
we would have seen it by now.

406
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,025
I think we are out of the woods
as far as that goes.

407
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,736
Guess they occasionally
get one right.

408
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,030
You're going to
be glib about this?

409
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,156
You almost killed her.

410
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,198
I made a choice.

411
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,686
The same choice
you made yesterday,

412
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,143
only when I make
it I'm an imbecile.

413
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,912
Every decision you have made
has been wrong.

414
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,997
When this is over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

415
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,166
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

416
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,835
Because it's not just about
the past two days.

417
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,713
Like you have the hotline
on what's best for Alice. She loves me.

418
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,423
She never does her homework
when she's with you.

419
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,630
She never brushes her hair.

420
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,426
Her heart's racing,
pressure's rising.

421
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,137
The two of you get out.

422
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,972
I'm her mother.
You can't just...

423
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,309
You fight,
she has an anxiety attack.

424
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,519
The two of you are
making her worse.

425
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,605
Get out, and don't come back.

426
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,696
How's the kid doing?

427
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,865
Much better as of
about two hours ago.

428
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,367
You got any money for lunch?

429
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,619
If you like
parsley and croutons.

430
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,955
- Tritter finally froze my accounts.
- Really?

431
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,539
You surprised? Why wouldn't he?

432
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,124
I figured if he
was singling you out,

433
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,001
you must have done
something different.

434
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,544
- What? Like talking?
- Yeah.

435
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,547
And now that he's frozen your accounts,
you probably will.

436
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,674
You need the cash, right?

437
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,676
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

438
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,136
He does freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

439
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,097
Is Alice having
some procedure done?

440
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,306
She's fine. She's resting.

441
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,557
- Where?
- In her room.

442
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,393
- Where you're not supposed...
- I was just at the window.

443
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,644
There's no one in there.

444
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,270
Her backpack
wasn't there, either.

445
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,398
You don't think her
father could have...

446
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,399
Call Security.

447
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,411
Get a gurney.

448
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,204
She's stiff. She can't move.

449
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,539
I don't know what happened.

450
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,165
She seemed fine.

451
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,669
Help her. Please.

452
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,388
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

453
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,182
Muscle rigidity is almost
exclusively neurological.

454
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,518
Neuroaxonal dystrophy?
She's the right age.

455
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,478
Except that her liver's
starting to shut down.

456
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,732
- No dystrophy would...
- Metronidazole, great idea.

457
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,191
"Let's not go broad-spectrum."

458
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,357
"Let's not take any chances
on actually curing her."

459
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,945
House, can you focus
on the case?

460
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,156
No, because I'm in pain,

461
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,366
'cause you think that compromise
is the answer to everything.

462
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,576
I need more pills.

463
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,120
Muscle rigidity plus liver involvement
means Wilson's.

464
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,748
No. No corneal rings,
no mental changes.

465
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,957
Then what?

466
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,546
I need more pills!

467
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,715
No! You are on a reasonable...

468
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,217
What the hell does
"reasonable" mean?

469
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,185
Keep it quiet. Her BP reacts
to stress and yelling is not...

470
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,106
If you think that I'm not in pain,
then don't give me anything.

471
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,524
Keep me away from the aspirin,

472
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,152
but if I'm in a butt-load of pain,
I need a butt-load of pills.

473
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,321
Fine. You need more pills.

474
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,407
You're not getting them.

475
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,115
You can have all
the aspirin you want.

476
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,249
I say we draw straws.

477
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,461
Loser drives down to Trenton
and scores him an eight ball.

478
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,091
Which one of you two
gave her an aspirin?

479
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,967
- What?
- Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome.

480
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,595
Which doesn't make any sense,
unless she took aspirin.

481
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,097
- Rob?
- No way. She's a kid.

482
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,515
I've read
the 800 warning labels.

483
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,642
I'm not even angry.
I just want her to be okay.

484
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,394
She's lying. She's angry,
'cause you kidnapped her kid.

485
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,313
She'll be angrier
if the kid dies.

486
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,898
- I didn't.
- One aspirin

487
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,691
combined with
a pre-existing infection,

488
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,068
that's all it takes
to set off an attack.

489
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,069
I'm not lying.

490
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,780
Well, sure, you've
certainly earned our trust.

491
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,949
Where was Alice
the night before she came in?

492
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,992
With me. Well, at my house.

493
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,911
I went out. She stayed
with the babysitter.

494
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,412
- Where were you?
- None of your business.

495
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,540
You hired someone that might have
poisoned our daughter.

496
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,584
She's 15.
She's very responsible.

497
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,419
Is she a 15-year-old
pharmacist?

498
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,796
Or just some kid
from down the street

499
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,381
who needed 20 bucks
for lip gloss

500
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,716
and a couple of Tiger Beats?

501
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,262
Put your kid
on charcoal hemoperfusion.

502
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,847
Shouldn't we see
what the babysitter has to say?

503
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,808
I know what she's gonna say.
She's gonna lie to save her business.

504
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,643
I need more pills.

505
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,486
We are going to use this machine
to clean your blood.

506
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,321
It goes out of you
and through a filter,

507
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,158
like the filter in a fish tank.

508
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,077
It's kind of cool, actually.

509
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,041
I'm scared.

510
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,880
It won't hurt.

511
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,926
It takes a while,
so it'll be boring, but it won't hurt.

512
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,722
It's going to make you better.

513
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,310
They hate each other,
don't they?

514
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,479
We're never going
to be together again.

515
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,983
Well, you never know.

516
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,786
You're going to break
out the rubber hoses, the bright lights?

517
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,623
I'm not going to testify just because
I have to borrow lunch money.

518
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,419
I know. Women don't give up guys
that they're in love with.

519
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,671
I'm not in love with House.

520
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,008
The guy is
unhinged and unethical,

521
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,552
does what he wants
with no concern for others,

522
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,179
but you stand by him.

523
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,681
It can't just be
loyalty and respect?

524
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,641
No.

525
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,268
I'm a girl, so I must
be in love with him.

526
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,103
Not because you're a girl.

527
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,981
Because 10 years ago

528
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,652
you got an A in calculus,
until you ratted yourself out.

529
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,698
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

530
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,661
- Because you married a man...
- Don't go there.

531
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,373
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

532
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,252
House has changed you.

533
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,714
Do you think it's all
been for the better?

534
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:43,935
How's it going?

535
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,561
- Boring.
- Told you.

536
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,771
So far so good.

537
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,774
Just like five minutes ago,
and 10 minutes before that.

538
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,025
What's the matter?

539
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,158
She's thrown a clot.

540
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,286
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the OR.

541
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,414
You said it wouldn't hurt.

542
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,259
- Found it.
- She's burning up.

543
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,218
Give me a sec.

544
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,345
- Foreman, she is on fire.
- Almost there.

545
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,930
Get me some
cooling blankets now.

546
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
Right away.

547
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,433
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

548
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,561
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

549
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:31,107
You really have to flash
your private stash in front of me?

550
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,193
You find it easier to lie for me
if it's more subtle?

551
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,194
Fine.

552
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,203
You told your associates
that I had frozen your accounts.

553
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,664
- Yes.
- Smart lie.

554
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,793
You figured they'd think there was
a reason that you'd been singled out.

555
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,881
Like that you'd agreed
to testify against House.

556
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,759
Yeah, I assume
that's why you did it.

557
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:03,431
You have a reputation
as a bit of an opportunist.

558
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,683
You already gave your boss up once
from what I heard.

559
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,768
To save my job.

560
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,936
He goes down now,
I lose my job.

561
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,105
You lose your job,
you find another one.

562
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,690
You get fired,

563
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,526
your chances don't look so hot.

564
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,944
Why would he fire me?

565
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,196
Because you rolled on him.

566
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,199
- I haven't rolled on him.
- I think you will.

567
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,950
And he's gonna
think you already did.

568
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,452
As far as he knows,

569
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,538
my accounts are frozen
just like everyone else's.

570
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,667
In 24 hours, all three of you will
have access to your accounts again.

571
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,211
Why would you do...

572
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:38,174
If I was looking
at this as an outsider,

573
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,551
I would say

574
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,970
it was because
Detective Tritter had

575
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,432
what appeared to be
a very pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.

576
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,691
Yeah.

577
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:03,157
The two of them appear
to be working together.

578
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,791
How the hell are
there no ice packs in the OR?

579
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:12,917
Clot's out.

580
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,919
Ice packs aren't gonna hold it for long.
Where are the blankets?

581
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,672
In the ER. They're dealing
with a four-car collision.

582
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,882
We need to cool this kid down
before her brain melts.

583
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,597
What are you doing?

584
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,600
She got a major dose of heparin

585
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,977
to thin her blood
for the procedure.

586
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,687
Could have induced
thrombocytopenia.

587
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,896
That's unlikely.

588
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,024
The charcoal would have absorbed
a lot of the heparin.

589
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,401
She's been anemic.

590
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,111
Could be
a primary blood disorder.

591
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,988
Or we never
cured the infection.

592
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,823
Are you saying
she never had Reye's?

593
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,110
We just put that little girl
through excruciating pain.

594
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,118
The pain wasn't House's fault.

595
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,484
Even if the clot was a reaction

596
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,745
to what we gave her,
we still had to...

597
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,123
I don't need you
to cover my ass!

598
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,333
What I need is my Vicodin!

599
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,753
Two pills every six hours,
like I'm on an allowance.

600
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,631
She's giving a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

601
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,177
What the hell? Why don't we get
a plumber in here, ask his opinion?

602
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:08,055
Hey, Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns
who can weigh in...

603
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,978
Where the hell is she?

604
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,486
Look at her arm.

605
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,530
I told you it was an infection.

606
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,740
We fixed the infection.

607
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:26,949
Well, apparently not.

608
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,315
I asked you for broad-spectrum.

609
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,036
You put her on
the bare minimum.

610
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,915
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom, because you suck at it.

611
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,893
What's so good about this rash?

612
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,526
Good guesses, but no.

613
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,238
It's on parts of her body
that we haven't touched.

614
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,991
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out of consciousness,

615
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,993
but it's not
a reaction to anything we did.

616
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,745
Our mojo is off the table.

617
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,413
Which means...

618
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,875
Oh, so close.

619
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,587
Means thanks to Cuddy's
candy-ass approach,

620
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,882
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

621
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,052
This thing has
grown horns and fangs.

622
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,680
We've gotta figure
out what species it is,

623
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,890
go in with a spear
to the heart.

624
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,186
Okay, you guys are sulking.

625
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,230
I don't really care why,
but apparently

626
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,357
I can't do my job
without finding out.

627
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,025
Tritter released
our bank accounts.

628
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,319
Horrible, horrible news.

629
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,905
Wow, I'm glad we didn't
let that fester.

630
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,200
If she did have Reye's, then it could
be varicella. They're associated.

631
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,660
He released our money.

632
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,953
You do know what that means?

633
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,955
The correct question is,

634
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,666
how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?

635
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,960
Rickettsial pox causes rash,
fever and muscle pain.

636
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,420
Pain, not paralysis.

637
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,426
Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
on the other hand,

638
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,257
rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.

639
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,050
And I didn't say
anything to Tritter.

640
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,010
Neither did I.

641
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,887
Maybe he wants us to think
that one of us talked.

642
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,306
- It worked.
- You were with him.

643
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,557
We were all with him.

644
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,225
We weren't laughing with him.

645
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,852
Maybe he just gave up.

646
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,939
Start the kid on chloramphenicol
for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

647
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:25,901
Can we talk?

648
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,320
- No.
- I really think we...

649
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,904
Either you screwed me

650
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,866
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and you want applause.

651
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,076
Either way, I'm not interested.

652
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,132
I'm busy.

653
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,054
You okay?

654
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,013
Yeah, sure.

655
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,307
What I meant by "Are you okay?"

656
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,517
is "What the hell did House do?"

657
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,519
- Nothing.
- What did he say?

658
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,482
I've seen House be rude 1,000 times,
usually to achieve something.

659
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,611
I have never seen him be mean
just because he can.

660
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,237
Seriously?

661
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,951
- What did he say?
- Nothing. It doesn't matter.

662
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,954
Well, I've seen
House be rude to you 1,000 times,

663
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,498
but I've never seen it
get to you.

664
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,752
People think House
has no inner censor,

665
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,004
but the fact is he
holds himself back.

666
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,589
Because when he wants to hurt,

667
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,300
he knows just where
to poke a sharp stick.

668
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,933
I have been trying
to get pregnant, and House knew.

669
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,477
He told me I would
fail as a mother.

670
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,940
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

671
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,234
I've had three
separate implantations.

672
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,985
The first two never took.

673
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,030
The last one, I lost.

674
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,074
I'm sorry.

675
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,744
You didn't fail.
Those were physical events.

676
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:04,417
A little girl is scared
and in pain.

677
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:10,506
I was awkward, terrified of
doing the wrong thing.

678
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,757
That's normal. That's...

679
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,259
I didn't hug her.

680
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,303
I didn't even reach out
and hold her hand.

681
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,139
I told her it
was gonna be okay.

682
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,515
She needed reassurance.

683
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,685
I told her, her folks
might get back together.

684
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,985
When I see people
with their kids, it's so natural.

685
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,530
It's like they have an instruction book
imprinted on their genes.

686
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,449
Maybe I just didn't get a copy.

687
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,702
Maybe my wanting to
be a mother is like

688
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,662
a tone-deaf person
wanting to sing opera,

689
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,790
- or a paraplegic who wants to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

690
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,464
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking the right spot.

691
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,366
Chloramphenicol isn't working.

692
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,829
What dose did you give her?

693
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,123
Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.

694
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,753
You always end up there.
Just getting a jump on it.

695
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,879
I doubled her up.

696
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,174
The infection's morphed.

697
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,676
It's moved into
her muscle sheath.

698
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,512
Necrotizing fasciitis?

699
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,223
That's impervious to drugs.

700
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,352
The only treatment
is to cut away the infected area.

701
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:48,687
So, we amputate.

702
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,064
Arm and leg?

703
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,525
We can't cut
a six-year-old kid in half

704
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,235
without a confirmed diagnosis.

705
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,946
Moves too quickly,
and we waited too long.

706
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,823
We don't have
time for a culture.

707
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,866
We can at least observe her
for a few hours,

708
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,535
confirm the rash is spreading.

709
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,787
It spreads, she dies.

710
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,914
You're talking
about crippling her.

711
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,874
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

712
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,335
Right! She's six! She's cute!

713
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,088
She can't have
flesh-eating bacteria!

714
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,631
It's just wrong!

715
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,842
Let's cure her
with sunshine and puppies.

716
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,804
Cute kids die of terrible illnesses,
innocent doctors go to jail,

717
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,722
and it's because
cowards like you

718
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,516
won't stand up
and do what's required.

719
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,602
You can sit around and moan about
who's the bigger weakling.

720
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,604
I'm going to go do my job.

721
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,084
What kind of quality
of life will she have without...

722
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,754
Great thing about life,
it's got qualities.

723
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,883
And if we can't agree?

724
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,928
I don't know.

725
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,867
He's yelled at us before.

726
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,327
Because he thought
our theories were dumb.

727
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,120
Not because our theories
were sending him to jail.

728
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,914
He's going through withdrawal.

729
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,457
Could be causing mild paranoia.

730
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,384
It'll pass. We just
have to suffer through it.

731
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,627
We never ruled out allergy.

732
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,633
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

733
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,756
We cut open her belly,
she got a rash on her belly.

734
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,509
We did a scratch test on her back,
she got a rash on her back.

735
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,053
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be a coincidence...

736
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,056
A little late to
play differential games, isn't it?

737
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,225
Get that thing away from me.
I don't want to get burned.

738
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,519
Laser pointers
don't burn you, genius.

739
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,979
Skin, no. Retina, yes.

740
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,105
You don't trust my aim?

741
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,941
Maybe you should
cover any sensitive...

742
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,030
He was wrong about the puppies.

743
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,246
House! You got to stop
the surgery.

744
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,123
She doesn't have necrotizing fasciitis.

745
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,082
Oh, good.

746
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,376
She's got
erythropoietic protoporphyria.

747
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,044
She's allergic to light.

748
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,504
It's genetic. Either parent
could have carried it.

749
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,840
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

750
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,926
She gets worse every time she goes
under surgical lights,

751
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,261
dad takes her outside...

752
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,762
Her liver's shot, too.

753
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,048
Did she swallow a flashlight?

754
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,390
Stop the surgery.

755
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,641
Get the hell out of my way.

756
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,892
No, I'm...

757
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,776
Light damages the blood cells,

758
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,529
the damaged blood cells
contain protoporphyrin,

759
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,365
the protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

760
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,036
That's why
the liver's shutting down.

761
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,773
Stop.

762
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,945
How can she be
allergic to light?

763
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,906
She's never had
this problem before.

764
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,408
The negative reaction
starts at birth.

765
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,577
It reaches critical mass
around this age.

766
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,415
Her blood cells create chemicals
in reaction to light.

767
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,544
When they reach the liver,
it tries to filter out the bad cells.

768
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,713
The chemicals damage the liver,

769
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,965
and one
byproduct is gallstones.

770
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,344
So, she'll just
keep getting worse?

771
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,887
EP can be managed.

772
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,722
We'll give her beta-carotene.

773
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,934
She's gonna need special light bulbs
and filters on the windows.

774
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,644
She's probably gonna need
to be home-schooled.

775
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,106
Her life will be complicated,
but she will live.

776
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,525
How do you get
something like this?

777
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,776
It's genetic.

778
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,985
So, one of us...

779
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,659
Both of you must be carriers.

780
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,540
She's gonna want to see you
when she wakes up.

781
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,835
So, don't screw it up.

782
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,823
So, what's new?

783
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,161
House missed one.

784
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,287
That's happened before.

785
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,039
He nearly maimed a little girl.

786
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,000
And I got it right.

787
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,377
And I told him,
and it didn't matter.

788
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:49,882
Chase, you solved one.

789
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,092
You helped a patient,
that better be enough for you.

790
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,385
Beckett was going
to call his play.

791
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,430
Waiting for House's Approval,
but decided it was too grim.

792
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,806
Trust me,

793
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,018
I'm not waiting anymore.

794
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,353
I'm gonna need
30 pieces of silver.
