1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,338
I'm gonna tickle you!

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,680
I need a refill.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,475
- You've already had three.
- So what? They're free.

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,560
I got a birthday.
Get it yourself.

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,854
No wonder he doesn't
get any tips.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,147
All right.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:27,610
Who's ready to sing the Ralphie's Rumpus
birthday rump shake?

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,201
Let's sing, let's ride,
let's bling, let's slide.

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,705
It's time for Ralphie.

10
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:42,291
We'll dance, eat cake
and do the rump shake.

11
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,877
It's time for Ralphie.

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,962
You okay, man?

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,178
You okay?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,945
Okay. All right.
Let's get you in the back.

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,072
It's gonna be okay,
kids. Sorry.

16
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,834
Got a heartbeat. Jack? Jack?

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,544
- I need you to step back.
- He's my brother.

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,421
- Jack, wake up!
- Call your parents.

19
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,339
Tell them to go to
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

20
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,634
Our parents died.
He's all we've got.

21
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,467
I was not parked illegally.
I live here.

22
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,969
Love note.
From Detective Tritter.

23
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,266
Heart attack.

24
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,478
His cath was clean and echo
showed no structural abnormalities.

25
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,648
Fatigue, night sweats,
weight loss preceded the heart attack.

26
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,535
Eighteen-year-old kid's suddenly
an orphan and a single father of two.

27
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,111
Party of Five. Powerful stuff.

28
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,030
The O.C. of its day.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,951
Stress explains everything
except the itchy feet.

30
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,327
Athlete's foot covers that.

31
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,871
Waiters work 12 hours
a day in old sneakers.

32
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,958
Good idea. Ignore the symptoms.
Makes our job easy.

33
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm not ignoring a symptom.
I'm explaining a symptom.

34
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,964
Kid's been hanging over a toilet
despite antiemetic therapy.

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,411
Persistent vomiting
could indicate

36
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,300
increased intracranial
pressure, tumor...

37
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,095
Sure. Heart problems.
It's gotta be the brain.

38
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,180
Thank God
there's a neurologist in the room.

39
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,350
Right. It's the feet.
If only I were a podiatrist.

40
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,979
Probably caught an intestinal virus from
one of those feral kids running around.

41
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,523
Repeated vomiting causes
an electrolyte imbalance,

42
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,568
which leads to an arrhythmia,
which leads to the heart attack.

43
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,028
- And itchy feet.
- Nope.

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,283
- That's it? Nope?
- I've said too much already.

45
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,453
- This isn't a game, House.
- No, it's not. But it could be.

46
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,999
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

47
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,645
If you know the diagnosis,
why don't...

48
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,168
How are you gonna learn to swim

49
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,755
unless I take off your floaties and
throw you into shark-infested waters?

50
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,482
You can't know what's wrong
after a 30-second perusal of his file.

51
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,803
Apparently, you can't.
Now, what's a game without rules?

52
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,558
No tag-backs. No biting.
You get one test each.

53
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:50,605
And the clock runs until lunch.
If I'm right, he'll still be alive.

54
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,316
If I'm wrong,
this is a very cruel game.

55
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,235
You're late.

56
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,195
I charge for the time
you were supposed to be here.

57
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,031
Tritter towed my car.

58
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,491
He's frozen my assets.
He's on a crusade.

59
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,453
You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,163
You're linked to their suspect
and his activities.

61
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,626
I'm not Pablo Escobar's evil henchman
cruising into Miami in a Cigarette boat.

62
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,243
I'm a physician who prescribed Vicodin
to a pain patient.

63
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,840
This police report you faxed me says
they found 600 pills in his apartment.

64
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,925
You prescribe those?

65
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,969
He's in chronic pain.
This is obviously an abuse of power.

66
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,970
Is that a yes or no?

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,348
Patients build up
a tolerance over the years.

68
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,975
Perfect motive for him
to forge those scrips.

69
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,560
Still don't have an answer.

70
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,520
- What are we, like, role-playing?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,897
And you suck at it.

72
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,525
Which is really unfortunate,
because you're pretending to be you.

73
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,277
I gotta get to court.

74
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,071
Michael told me
you could help me get my car back.

75
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,574
Yeah, divorce lawyers usually know
the ins and outs of drug enforcement.

76
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,742
You want your car back?

77
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,369
You're gonna have to
give the cops what they want.

78
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,414
Thanks. Usually people feel helpless
in these situations.

79
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,000
Dr. House is
probably going to jail.

80
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,670
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along with him.

81
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,716
House was on this page when he got that
annoying "I'm such a genius" look.

82
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,218
- What's there?
- Patient history.

83
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,262
He's 18. Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

84
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,390
How close am I?

85
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,935
Quit drugs when his parents died.
Quit smoking.

86
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,232
House didn't mock my viral idea.
He just said it was wrong.

87
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,025
Which means he didn't want to
give reasons.

88
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,319
Which means
I must have been close.

89
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,030
I'm thinking bacterial.

90
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,657
I'm doing a blood culture.

91
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,243
I am doing an MRI.

92
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,970
If it was a tumor, intracranial pressure

93
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,878
could cause his brain to herniate
before lunch.

94
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,248
Same thing with
the stress test.

95
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,084
- Which is why I'm ditching it.
- What are you doing instead?

96
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,127
Not telling.

97
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,087
Seriously?
You're playing his game?

98
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,548
We're all playing his game.
Might as well enjoy it.

99
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,050
Anybody else sick at work?

100
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,595
I had a stomachache before him.

101
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,848
This isn't your fault, Will.
Keep working.

102
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,558
My brother's in the hospital.

103
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,269
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

104
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,813
Your brother cares
if you finish your homework.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,578
Can I be your imaginary friend?

106
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,955
He's a doctor.

107
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,458
How are the feet? Still itch?

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,463
- Is that important?
- I don't know. Is it?

109
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,092
What kinds of drugs you into?

110
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,719
You don't have to
talk about that right now.

111
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,720
No, it's okay.

112
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,263
I don't keep secrets from them.

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,348
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

114
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:35,102
Clever. Admit the past.
Deny the present.

115
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm clean.

116
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm raising two kids. It'd be
pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?

117
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,776
But confiding in
an eight-year-old is okay.

118
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,070
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

119
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,032
Yeah. Turning the other cheek's
a good strategy in boxing.

120
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,700
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

121
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,869
They lie because
they've got something to hide.

122
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,120
Look at him.

123
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,456
He's sitting there
doing nothing and he's still lying.

124
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,500
We don't lie to Jack.

125
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,794
- Spelling test you failed and forgot...
- No.

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,795
- Math test?
- No.

127
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,879
Fight with the kid
sitting next to you?

128
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,090
He doesn't sit next to me.

129
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,488
And the other one's
probably having sex.

130
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,429
- I am not.
- Yet.

131
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,682
But when you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

132
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,820
- Colder.
- I'm not playing.

133
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,031
Keep very still for me, Jack.
This won't take long.

134
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,701
How much dope did you smoke?

135
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,746
- Does he have to be here?
- No. Ignore him.

136
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,958
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

137
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,460
What about the cigarettes?
How'd you quit?

138
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,088
Gum? The patch? Hypnosis?

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,298
He went from two packs
to nothing, cold turkey.

140
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,844
Or we could just
make small talk.

141
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,804
You still seeing
that nurse in Pedes?

142
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,514
I just don't think
she's right for you.

143
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,476
You need someone detached,
calculating, ambitious.

144
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,478
You need yourself in a skirt.

145
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,689
Jack, he asked you a question.

146
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,109
I didn't really quit.
I just sort of lost taste for it.

147
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,487
Interesting. Sounds like
one of those symptom thingies.

148
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,700
He's still puking, and he had
a heart attack and itchy feet.

149
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,579
- It's not his lungs.
- I never said it was.

150
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,667
Ice cold.

151
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,175
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

152
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,845
was caused by a spasm in the vessels
surrounding your heart.

153
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,223
Let me know if
anything feels... unusual.

154
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,687
If the problems are at my heart, why
did that other doctor look at my brain?

155
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,565
Yeah. Why did that other doctor
look at his brain?

156
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,444
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities as we can.

157
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,655
So because you think
that a spasm caused his heart attack,

158
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,866
you're gonna induce
another spasm?

159
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,242
Did you consent to this?

160
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,286
Everything's under control.

161
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,956
Tests are gonna identify which arteries
are affected so we can repair them.

162
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,250
Your meds don't seem
to be doing anything.

163
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,877
So either you're wrong,

164
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,964
or his system hasn't
been pushed enough to set anything off.

165
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,265
You wanna get back home, right?

166
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,269
I mean, you're probably already falling
behind with the housework and the bills.

167
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,689
How many sick days you think you'll get
before they replace you?

168
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,236
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.

169
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,155
They can't fire me if I'm sick.

170
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,282
Right. You're irreplaceable.

171
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,202
Who else would they find
qualified to dance with a rodent?

172
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,828
How can you even
support your family?

173
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,624
What happens when those kids grow out
of their clothes? When they get sick?

174
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,042
Still no spasm.

175
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,378
They'll take those kids
away from you, Jack.

176
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,924
Maybe I should bring them in here right
now so that you can kiss them goodbye.

177
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,552
Can't you see his heart is fine!
Stop torturing him!

178
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,972
What kind of doctor are you?

179
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,518
Wonderful.
Thank you so much. Okay, bye.

180
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,896
- You're just getting here?
- Busses suck.

181
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,274
- Where's your car?
- It's a hostage.

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,651
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

183
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,069
You're not going to.

184
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,779
Is that a question or an order?

185
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,782
Any sort of conviction
will cost House his license...

186
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,348
Which will cost
this hospital. Relax.

187
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,209
I'm not gonna mess
with your precious resource.

188
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,789
I told my lawyer to tell Tritter
to go to hell. Marco!

189
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,543
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

190
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,254
Sorry, Dr. Wilson. I was trying
to call you. Where's your phone?

191
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,339
In my car. My patients,
on the other hand,

192
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,049
are here and
needed their medications.

193
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,344
I'm sorry. I can't.
Your DEA number's been suspended.

194
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,766
Why so sad?

195
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,811
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

196
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,732
That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

197
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,152
Blood culture was
negative for bacteria.

198
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,112
But positive for hepatitis A?

199
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,615
I wonder who could've ordered
that extra test.

200
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,076
Must be somebody who knew
what persistent vomiting,

201
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,522
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

202
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,080
Hep A doesn't explain
the heart attack.

203
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,959
No. But as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier, puking does.

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,753
And hep A explains the puking.

205
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,548
If this had been real life
instead of just a game...

206
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,512
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

207
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,765
Well, who's gonna
prescribe my Vicodin?

208
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,266
Yes, well, that's why I'm here.

209
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,684
This is a disaster for you.

210
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,061
Relax.

211
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,605
Tritter's just getting desperate.
He's got no real evidence.

212
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,106
He's trying to
squeeze you into ratting.

213
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,442
I'm not gonna
let him squeeze my patients.

214
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,071
They'll be fine. Most of your
cancer medicine sucks anyway.

215
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,699
I'm gonna use your team
to do my prescribing

216
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,535
until this is straightened out.

217
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,372
Suddenly this doesn't seem
nearly as dramatic.

218
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:51,251
Go pump MG into the kid,
cure him and get him out of here.

219
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,713
- Hep A?
- No.

220
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,383
"Chase, blood test
for bacteria."

221
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,593
"Foreman, MRI,
too stubborn to check the lungs."

222
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,303
"Cameron, nice try. No spasm."

223
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,144
"But the princess sat
and sat and sat,"

224
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,189
"pretending not to listen."

225
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,153
Pretending to write
in her journal with the flowers on it.

226
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,033
Pretending she didn't like stories about
eight-year-olds who save the world.

227
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,076
I'm 11.

228
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,744
Which is why
you can no longer save the world.

229
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,871
- I'm eight!
- Yeah.

230
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,082
We're all completely
dependent on you.

231
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,542
- Morning.
- Morning.

232
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,878
Good news.
We can take you off the MG.

233
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,091
The hep A has cleared your system.
You'll be good to go by tomorrow.

234
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,510
How do you think I got it?

235
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,011
Well, it could've been
contaminated food.

236
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,222
It could've been
from cleaning the bathrooms at work.

237
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,391
Or it could've been...

238
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,019
Don't worry.
They've heard it all.

239
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,021
Anilingus is a common way.

240
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,023
You should just tell the people
that you've dated

241
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,359
they should get
themselves checked.

242
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,114
Don't worry. I've been too busy chasing
after these guys to go spelunking.

243
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,114
You're gross.

244
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,535
- I think.
- Does your arm hurt?

245
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,536
Arm's fine, bro.

246
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,664
- Then why's it bleeding?
- It's not. It's...

247
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,919
Raise your arm above your head.

248
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,673
Your ear... And your nose...

249
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,895
High PT and PTT on Jack's
blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.

250
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:38,525
So, we cure the hep A,
something else pops up.

251
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,235
Interesting.

252
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,447
What infections cause DIC?

253
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,325
You okay?

254
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,620
Hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

255
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,330
Shall we discuss
what causes DIC,

256
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,041
or should we just send the kid back
to his miserable life?

257
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,168
- He's not miserable.
- Right.

258
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,462
He's thrilled that his parents are dead
and his life is over.

259
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,757
The restaurant's probably teeming
with E. Coli, Eikenella and strep.

260
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,510
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty and the party and...

261
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,970
Or it's a food-borne toxin.
Jack eats at that cesspool every day.

262
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,889
And Jack's the only one
who got sick?

263
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,974
Kid's got tattoos, piercings

264
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,500
and probably some nasty little girl
who loaned him the hep A.

265
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,437
Could've also given him
syphilis or gonorrhea.

266
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,314
- I need one of you.
- Take Cameron.

267
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,649
Your idea was dumb anyway.

268
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,946
Chase, I need you to head back to that
cesspool and get me the kid's puke.

269
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,741
Foreman, do an LP and have Cameron
run down that potty-party theory.

270
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,160
Why don't I just test him?

271
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,163
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

272
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,421
The amount of vomiting
that kid did,

273
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,716
there wouldn't be enough toxins left
in his system to show up in his blood.

274
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,135
And since he vomited in the toilet here
instead of on somebody,

275
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,222
that restaurant is our only source
of essential vomit.

276
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,848
And you couldn't say that
in front of Foreman?

277
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:57,062
No, I couldn't say this
in front of Foreman. I need a refill.

278
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,648
Detective Tritter knows about
the scrips I wrote before.

279
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,151
Exactly. If you stop now,
it'll look suspicious.

280
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,195
Does anyone fall
for that argument?

281
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,364
Write the scrip.

282
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,865
No.

283
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,158
One prescription
isn't gonna make...

284
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,370
We both know
it's not gonna be just one.

285
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,748
I'd rather lose my job
than lose my license.

286
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:29,386
Daniel Silvers, prostate cancer.
Needs filgrastim, two-week supply.

287
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,888
Andrea Donovan, breast cancer.

288
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,433
Just needs her refill
on her megestrol.

289
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,436
- You're not writing.
- You want me to write?

290
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,397
Well, you could phone them in.
But eventually, yeah,

291
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,358
probably somebody's gonna want
something written down.

292
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,320
- I haven't met these people.
- I have.

293
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,281
- I've diagnosed them and everything.
- I know.

294
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,242
I know. I'm not saying
I don't trust you.

295
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,660
Just my diagnoses.

296
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,387
These are gonna be
my prescriptions. I...

297
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,165
- They're my patients. My prescriptions.
- My name!

298
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,544
That Tritter will read
on the scrip.

299
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:08,133
He wants to make you miserable. You
don't think he's gonna ask questions?

300
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,971
Is there anything Jack does that
no one else does? Any special duties?

301
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,307
No, we got lots of bussers.

302
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,601
What kind of cleaning products
do you use?

303
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,687
We got a bunch of kids running around,
sticking everything in their mouths,

304
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,441
so we can't use anything toxic.

305
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,319
This is it. Monday's trash.

306
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,244
So there's no one
who can maybe help get the bags out?

307
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,580
Sorry. Short-handed.

308
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
I can tip.

309
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,377
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke is in
a blue trash bag with the wrapped gifts,

310
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,880
but if you find spaghetti
that's the wrong vomit.

311
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,016
How much longer
do I have to stay on this medication?

312
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,602
I mean, I'm nauseous
all the time.

313
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,188
Maybe I should go back
on the tamoxifen.

314
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,394
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

315
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,025
I'm reluctant to make a change.

316
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,071
I can't play with my daughter
or pick her up from school.

317
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,739
I can barely get up
and tuck her in at night.

318
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,409
There's got to be
something else.

319
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,827
Who is she?

320
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,287
Well, as you know,
this is a teaching hospital.

321
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,082
- She's a student?
- No, I'm a doctor.

322
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,875
I'm assisting Dr. Wilson today.

323
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
Why? Do you think he got
my diagnosis wrong?

324
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,380
- No. I'm sure...
- No. No.

325
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,466
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

326
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,302
- You think he got my meds wrong?
- No. It's just...

327
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,430
- No.
- Then why is she here?

328
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,770
What are you doing now?

329
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,858
I'm gonna get a sample
of your brother's spinal fluid.

330
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,317
- Where's Will?
- School.

331
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,530
Is that gonna hurt?

332
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,616
It's gonna help us figure out
what's making him sick.

333
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,286
- Shouldn't you be in class, too?
- Teacher work day.

334
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,912
For you but not Will?

335
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,248
Yeah, didn't make
sense to me, either.

336
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,878
Can I help?

337
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,675
Well, I guess it's quicker than
calling a nurse and a truant officer.

338
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,679
Okay, grab his shins
and push his knees up towards his chest.

339
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,558
Now hold him there tight.

340
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,019
This all nurses do?

341
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,689
My boss doesn't trust them
to do anything else.

342
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,614
Is he gonna die?

343
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,702
No. No one's gonna die.

344
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,163
In the whole world ever?
That's so great.

345
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,042
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

346
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,587
But I also know
bad things do happen.

347
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,717
My dad always had a few drinks
when they went out.

348
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,512
Always said
he'd be okay to drive.

349
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,264
Until he wasn't.

350
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,062
I would just like
some warning this time.

351
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:16,154
We're nowhere near anything like that
happening right now. Okay?

352
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,618
Let's get him back over.

353
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,706
What was that?

354
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,000
What did you do?

355
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,003
- You broke his rib?
- I barely touched him.

356
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:32,963
Which means...

357
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,216
- Found it.
- Fix it.

358
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,970
Steomyelitis. Means the infection's
spread to his bones,

359
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,139
which means it's either bacterial
or viral and not...

360
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,770
I hired you to take away the pain.
Was there some confusion?

361
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,398
Ever thought about
using your cane on the proper side?

362
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,816
Yeah, that's the issue.

363
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,820
Friday night my cane suddenly noticed
it was on the wrong side.

364
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,906
- Can you score me some Vicodin?
- No.

365
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,408
I did a needle aspiration
to confirm which...

366
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,784
How long till the culture's...

367
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,205
Why do you only do that
when I'm talking?

368
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,165
You gotta rest your shoulder.

369
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,211
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

370
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,559
- Nice cane.
- If I know what you mean.

371
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,479
- Chase, you can stop doing that.
- I'm almost finished.

372
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,481
He's got osteomyelitis.

373
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,693
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

374
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:42,032
And you can stop, too.
It's syphilis.

375
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,117
- You sure?
- Read the print out.

376
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,916
He's also positive
for Eikenella.

377
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,172
- One of you two screwed up.
- No.

378
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,715
Not a chance.

379
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,055
Or this kid is a lot sicker
than we thought. Finish that test.

380
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,516
Should be impossible to get
two right answers to one question.

381
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:12,646
- It's okay to have three?
- Apparently.

382
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,815
He's positive
for botulism, too.

383
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,988
So, we knock down one infection
and three more pop up.

384
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,658
I think this game is rigged.

385
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,338
Jack? Somebody help!

386
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,904
We've managed to clear
all three infections out of his system,

387
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,884
but now he's having seizures
every few hours.

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,387
- He's gotta be immunocompromised.
- No.

389
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,681
White count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

390
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,974
Well, if he's not
immunocompromised,

391
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,860
why is he acting like
he's immunocompromised?

392
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,102
What do the seizures tell us?

393
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,854
Nothing. There were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

394
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,899
nonfocal neuro exam,
no electrolyte imbalance. Nothing.

395
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,404
What do unexplained seizures and
really sick 18-year-olds have in common?

396
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,865
- You thinking trauma?
- I'm thinking drugs.

397
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,869
He's an admitted user.
The drugs trashed his immune system.

398
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,621
Tox screen was clean.

399
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,041
Clean tox screen means
there's no drugs in his blood or urine.

400
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,254
There could still be drugs trapped in
his fat cells from the good old days.

401
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,840
If they're in his fat,
why would they be affecting him now?

402
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,719
The keen observer would notice that
he's had some digestive issues lately.

403
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,138
His weight loss
could've burned off fat cells

404
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,807
and released the drugs
back into his system.

405
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,060
There's no way to know. It's
impossible to test fat cells for drugs.

406
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,522
But it's not impossible
to make him lose more weight.

407
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,026
You want us to starve him so we can
drive him into another seizure?

408
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,862
Maybe a heart attack?
Just so we can run another tox screen?

409
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,449
That'd be cruel.
Just sweat it out of him.

410
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,788
I haven't touched a thing
since the night my parents died.

411
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,332
Drugs stay in your system
a long time.

412
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,302
I was high the night
the cops came to tell us what happened.

413
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,932
You know the first thing I did
when they told me?

414
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,353
I laughed.

415
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,233
I'm not the person
I was when they died.

416
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,403
I wish they could see that.

417
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,741
Well, I'm sure they're watching,
and I'm sure they're proud.

418
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,578
That's what Will's guidance counselor
keeps telling him.

419
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,413
What do you tell him?

420
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,292
I tell him it's crap.

421
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,506
Our parents live on in our memories,
but they don't live on.

422
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,264
Jack?

423
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,557
Hold him still.

424
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,517
Don't break his arm.

425
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,894
We'll fix it.
We need to get a sample.

426
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,565
House.

427
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,692
Bad news.

428
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,860
Look at you.

429
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,364
You couldn't have sent Cameron down
here to this air-conditioned hallway

430
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,450
to deliver the bad news?

431
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,035
Jack seized again, but his blood
was clean. Completely drug free.

432
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,955
So he just happened to have a seizure
at the exact time

433
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,414
that we stuck him in a sauna?

434
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,462
It's not a coincidence.

435
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,336
He's still seizing every few hours
whether we stick him in a sauna or not.

436
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,840
Oh, my God!
Why are you using that?

437
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,843
I've had it for years.

438
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,138
No, that's...
That's gonna make your shoulder hurt.

439
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,389
You need one of these.

440
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,308
He's a doctor.

441
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,395
- Is he still infection-free?
- I'm sure not for long.

442
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,232
My point being that something other than
those infections caused these seizures.

443
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,817
Means there's something
in his head. Scan him.

444
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,736
- We scanned him.
- Well, that was then. This is not then.

445
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,072
Kid keeps changing.
Scan him again.

446
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,574
Where is Cameron?

447
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,826
I am not writing you
a script for Vicodin.

448
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,162
I've only got two pills left.

449
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,664
Cut them in half.
Then you'll have four.

450
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,500
You're prescribing for Wilson.
Wilson prescribes for me.

451
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,002
Write up a scrip.

452
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,045
- You know you have a problem.
- Yeah.

453
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,412
It's got a badge
and everything.

454
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,133
- You're taking too much...
- Fine! You're right.

455
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,304
What's the correct amount? Write up
a scrip for the correct amount.

456
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,641
No answer? That's 'cause
we're having the wrong debate.

457
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,407
This has got nothing
to do with my problem

458
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,895
and everything to do with you
avoiding a problem.

459
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,730
You're afraid that
if you write me a prescription

460
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,856
you're gonna wind up
like Wilson.

461
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,774
Of course I am.

462
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,779
Tritter wants to win
by giving pain.

463
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,074
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

464
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,951
As a doctor,
how do you do that?

465
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,501
Here.

466
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,755
This'll tide you over.
Takes the edge off my PMS.

467
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,798
Should do wonders for you.

468
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,640
Why are you
looking at my head again?

469
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,643
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

470
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,228
I'm not gonna get better.

471
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,438
Am I?

472
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,233
We'll know more after the test.

473
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,278
I've gotta find out
who can take care of Will and Kama.

474
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,155
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

475
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:19,744
You'll be home yelling at them and
kicking their butts before you know it.

476
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,214
This kid might be facing
a terminal disease,

477
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

478
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,093
Brain stem's clean.

479
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,845
- Nothing in the midbrain.
- What's that?

480
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,974
The frontal lobe,
upper-right quadrant.

481
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,393
- I don't see anything.
- There.

482
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,438
It's tiny,
but I think it's a tumor.

483
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,150
That size should be excisable. Why
didn't we see it earlier? How could...

484
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,652
Oh, God!

485
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,613
Axial view.
There's another one.

486
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,532
Bring up the next slice.

487
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,120
They're everywhere.

488
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,377
Jack's brain is
riddled with tumors.

489
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,547
- And you know what he's doing?
- Moaning?

490
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:16,134
- Setting up play dates.
- Wow, what a guy. Theories?

491
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,553
The obvious one, brain cancer
destroyed his immune system,

492
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,430
left him wide open
for these infections.

493
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,557
House, you're pathetic.

494
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,477
You'll analyze anyone's faults,
hypocrisies, weaknesses,

495
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,883
but this kid's
got some strength,

496
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,690
and all of a sudden there's no time
to talk about anything but the medicine.

497
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,359
He's teaching pre-pubescent kids
that truth matters,

498
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,821
God doesn't and life sucks.
I like him. Treatment?

499
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,531
We need to
start him on radiation.

500
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,742
That'll destroy whatever's left
of his immune system.

501
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,869
And save his life!

502
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,496
I know the notion of self-sacrifice
is foreign to you...

503
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,208
You wanna think that he's sacrificing
himself because if one person can do it,

504
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:53,254
then maybe the world isn't the cold,
selfish place you know that it is.

505
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,757
Radiation could kill him.
Alternatives?

506
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,134
There aren't any.
We saw the tumors...

507
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,803
We could choose
to say they aren't tumors.

508
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,182
They're just pus, which would explain
why they weren't there yesterday.

509
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,476
It can't be an infection.
He got MG,

510
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,603
- broad-spectrum antibiotics...
- Exactly.

511
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,440
Creates a perfect world
for fungus, moves in, gets married,

512
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,566
has little fungi...

513
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,111
If you're wrong about the fungus, you're
wasting what little time he has left.

514
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,365
Not a big sacrifice.
His life sucks.

515
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,160
So let's be right.
Go stick a needle in the kid's head.

516
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,286
If you suck out a liquid,

517
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,704
then I'm right
and we haven't answered anything.

518
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,459
If you suck out a solid, you're right
and no more worrying about play dates.

519
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,592
Okay. Fine.
I'll father your child.

520
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,261
First, you got to write me
a Vicodin prescription,

521
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,930
just so I can
get through the foreplay.

522
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,306
How many days do you have left?

523
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,059
Could probably get through
maybe the next minute or so.

524
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,772
And your coming to me means your lackeys
actually stood up to you. I'm impressed.

525
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,024
Yes, their cowardice
is inspiring.

526
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,859
Well, you should be
thanking them.

527
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,986
If they caved,
it'd give the cops evidence

528
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:02,240
that you intimidated underlings
to feed your addiction.

529
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,117
I hate writing thank-you notes.

530
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:08,037
Would it be weird if I asked Cameron
to write them? You're hooking me up?

531
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,124
Unfortunately, if I cut you off,
it'd give the cops evidence

532
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,500
that you don't really
need the pain meds.

533
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:17,130
I knew that cleavage was a smokescreen.
You're a genius.

534
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,550
- You can't lift your arm.
- You can't pee standing up.

535
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,927
- Gimme.
- You been doing physio?

536
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,554
- Maybe you pulled...
- Yeah.

537
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,056
Been training for Pants-Off Dance-Off.
Give me the script.

538
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,642
Your shoulder problem
isn't physical.

539
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,602
We'll find out
if you ever give me that...

540
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,812
What's new?

541
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,139
What's different? Any big changes
in your life recently?

542
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,941
Fight with the wife maybe?

543
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:41,362
It's good.
Means your shoulder's a human being.

544
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,738
It's a start.

545
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,869
- I'm right. Right?
- Yeah.

546
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,412
Just not about me.

547
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:01,841
I was right, right?

548
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,635
They were abscesses
from a fungal infection. Aspergillus.

549
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,596
But we still have no idea why.

550
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,558
Our kid's immune system
has a factory defect. It's genetic.

551
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,767
It can't be genetic.

552
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,728
He would've been getting infections
since he was an infant.

553
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,190
- Not if he grew up in a bubble.
- Or if he grew up on Mars.

554
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,193
- No germs there, either.
- I don't mean a literal bubble.

555
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,613
A sweet suburban bubble where mommies
and daddies protect their children.

556
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,740
They die. Bubble bursts.

557
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,493
Continuing emotional trauma
triggers the genetic illness.

558
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,994
Question is, which one?

559
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,664
The infections he's contracted
narrow down the possibilities.

560
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,001
Hep A indicates
a problem with his B cells.

561
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,462
- Bruton's Agammaglobulinemia?
- Eikenella.

562
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,005
Points to
a complement deficiency.

563
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,093
- I have a patient. I need...
- Not now.

564
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,095
- I'll go.
- You'll stay.

565
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,181
- Patient's dying.
- So is mine.

566
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,391
Not in the next hour.

567
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,352
What does the syphilis tell us?

568
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,314
What does it tell us?

569
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,484
It could mean
chronic granulomatous disease.

570
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,988
And the aspergillus is a T cell issue.
Common variable immunodeficiency.

571
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,492
Genetic testing's
gonna take time.

572
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,993
Given the rate
he's picking up infections...

573
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,399
Why don't we
turn it into a race?

574
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,038
Little late to be
playing games with us.

575
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,542
- Not you guys. The infections.
- What infections?

576
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,546
The infections
we're gonna give him.

577
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,258
The only way to cure me
is to make me sicker?

578
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,635
Each of the four
possible genetic conditions

579
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,180
is most susceptible to
different types of infection.

580
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:32,807
What's that?

581
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:39,272
This is a cocktail of serratia,
meningococcus, cepacia and rhinovirus.

582
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,691
Whichever germ
gains the most ground

583
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,944
plants the flag of its leader,
gives us our answer.

584
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,114
And how are you gonna know
which one gains the most ground?

585
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,074
Well, that's the fun part.

586
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,287
See, if the meningococcus is king of the
hill, you get to have another seizure.

587
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,080
Serratia will shut down your lungs.

588
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,249
If it's cepacia,
you'll have a heart attack.

589
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,085
And if it's the rhinovirus,
you'll sneeze.

590
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,715
They can't all be dramatic.
We good?

591
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:06,841
Hell, no.

592
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,886
Well, the alternative is we guess,
and there's a three out of four chance

593
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,016
that your little brother and sister
will get to cry over another coffin.

594
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,269
You study fractions in school?
We good?

595
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,786
And this test isn't
exactly FDA approved,

596
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,581
so let's just keep it
our little secret, okay?

597
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,439
Little Orphan Annie and Oliver Twist
slept in our hallways last night.

598
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,816
Are they singing?

599
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,568
They're children.
They need a guardian.

600
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,153
Couldn't find a babysitter

601
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,359
on account of not being able
to make any phone calls,

602
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,657
on account of
not being able to breathe,

603
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,201
on account of his lungs
filling up with serratia.

604
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,870
He has chronic
granulomatous disease.

605
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,831
Game over. Our work is done.

606
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,582
Then he's gonna
keep getting sick.

607
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,334
You gotta call Social Services.

608
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,379
Bone marrow transplant would re-boot
his whole immune system.

609
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,090
He'll be healthy enough to win
Miserable Daddy of the Year.

610
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,967
So see if one of
his kids is a match.

611
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,136
My kids are
already testing his kids.

612
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,223
Will's a match.

613
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,307
You tested him?

614
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,977
- I never consented for that.
- It's just a blood draw.

615
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,583
- There's no danger.
- To the testing.

616
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,815
- What about the surgery?
- The risk for Will is next to nothing.

617
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,489
What if I don't do it?
What are my other options?

618
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,285
Your immune system
can't fight off the germs

619
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,579
we all come into contact
with every day.

620
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,749
Now that we know,
we can use more targeted medications,

621
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,086
but you'll still get sick
all the time.

622
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,130
You'll be in and out
of hospitals...

623
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,715
But I'll live.

624
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,764
Jack,

625
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,602
your lifespan will be
substantially shortened.

626
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,607
And you'll be too sick to care
for your brother and sister anymore.

627
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,858
You shouldn't have pressured him into...

628
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:11,864
There was no pressure.

629
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,028
He's eight years old!

630
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,780
You tell him his brother's dying
unless he helps.

631
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,948
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- He wants to help you.

632
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,950
He has no idea.

633
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:25,873
It's like you asked him to let me play
with one of his toys. This is surgery.

634
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,375
- He could die.
- He'll be fine.

635
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,920
But you...

636
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,256
You're gonna have a hard time
protecting him like this if you're dead.

637
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,762
I'll do it...

638
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,183
when Will's 18
and can decide for himself.

639
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,527
- Noble.
- Moronic.

640
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,155
It's a synonym.

641
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,033
Why can't you accept
he wants to protect his brother?

642
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,619
Has to protect his brother.
Doesn't want to.

643
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,081
Wants to run screaming
from protecting his brother.

644
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,625
You're a hypocrite.

645
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:16,882
"Evidence is everything.
Truth is all that matters."

646
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,052
Except when it comes to people.

647
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,430
Everything we've learned
about this kid says you're wrong.

648
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,350
But you can't accept that.

649
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,894
It's easy to
reject the diagnosis.

650
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,730
Not so easy to
reject your misanthropy,

651
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,734
because then you'd have to give
people a fighting chance.

652
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,779
And that scares
the crap out of you.

653
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,199
Okay.

654
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,579
Let's get some evidence.

655
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,503
It's your lucky day.

656
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,048
Just found another donor
in the registry. Perfect match.

657
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,843
We can do the transplant
with no danger to the rug rat.

658
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,053
Just have to sign here.

659
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,058
Unless there's another reason
you don't want it.

660
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,185
There's a chance I'd die.

661
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,813
A chance you'll be cured.

662
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,566
Maybe you don't
want that, either.

663
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,485
Maybe hanging out in a hospital
getting waited on hand and foot

664
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,029
reminds you of what life used to be like

665
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,032
before you were forced
to play Mister Mom.

666
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,700
I don't like being sick.

667
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,828
But you don't want
to be healthy, either.

668
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,496
This is your way out.

669
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,539
Guilt free.

670
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,335
I said I'd do it
when Will's 18.

671
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,088
And he's able to take care
of himself without you.

672
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,051
Jack, your brother and sister need you.

673
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,887
I know! I know every second
of every day that they need me,

674
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,473
but I'm too young
to be their dad.

675
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,900
Good for you.

676
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,200
Don't pretend you're surprised.

677
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,802
Want to go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

678
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,180
Come on. Mail can wait.

679
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,141
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

680
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,560
- I'm shutting down my practice.
- Oh, good.

681
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,354
'Cause I was afraid
you might overreact.

682
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,189
I can't just ask
my patients to wait

683
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,692
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won't let her come out and play!

684
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,485
I kept you waiting for maybe an hour...

685
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,736
Three hours!

686
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,073
- Anybody die?
- Not this time.

687
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,243
Cameron's available now.
Use her all you want.

688
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,829
So now's a better time for me
to have my life taken away?

689
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,915
- It fits into your schedule better?
- Oh, poor you.

690
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,043
- Think if you suffer loudly enough...
- You committed a crime!

691
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,545
What do you want me to do?
Turn myself in?

692
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,048
Yes! Yes! Do something!
Go in! Show some remorse!

693
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,675
Tell Tritter
you'll get some help!

694
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,051
I don't need help!

695
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,807
House, get out of here.
Get out of here.

696
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,646
You are not gonna make me feel guilty
about what Tritter is doing to us.

697
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,066
You already feel guilty.

698
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,611
Your mysterious shoulder pain
isn't coming from your cane.

699
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,822
It's coming from
your conscience.

700
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,491
That used to be enough.

701
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,661
Despite all your smartass remarks,
I knew you gave a damn.

702
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,829
This time...

703
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,877
You were either gonna
help me through this or you weren't.

704
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,712
I got my answer.

705
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,771
Who's gonna drive me to school,

706
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,065
help me with my homework?

707
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,234
There'll be a mom
where they take you.

708
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,530
A real mom,
someone who can cook.

709
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,163
Don't worry.
I'll still be able to see you guys.

710
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,544
You said you'd make him better.

711
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,880
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,769
Thank you for not telling them.

713
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,273
You're a good kid.

714
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,695
Three months from now,
six months from now,

715
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,533
you'll be visiting them
and you won't be able to say goodbye.

716
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,744
You're gonna know
you screwed up.

717
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,583
You'll take his bone marrow
and you'll take them back.

718
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,171
And they'll be a burden
and a pain,

719
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,633
and your life will never be
what it was supposed to be.

720
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,304
But you'll be proud
of yourself.

721
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,019
And your parents,
they'll be proud of you.

722
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,565
I don't think so.

723
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,365
It's what I wanna believe.
