1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,629
Try not to be
scared when you see him, okay?

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,799
Mom, I've seen him sick.
I'm not scared.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:08,925
This time's different.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,302
The doctors gave him an extra course
of radiation and chemo...

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,845
I know.

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:16,557
And you understand how proud
we are of you, right?

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,310
Gloves, mask.

8
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,978
Matty, you said you wanted to see your
brother before the procedure.

9
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:07,859
I know I look like an alien,
but I promise not to eat your brain.

10
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,365
When this is done, will you be able
to play out back with me?

11
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,326
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,997
Let your brother rest up,
while we take some of your marrow.

13
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,549
You don't need to be
in an isolation room,

14
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,761
but I pulled some strings so you could
be next door to your brother.

15
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,387
How many games will I miss?

16
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,114
Well, you only have
to be here overnight,

17
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,807
but you do have to
take it easy for a little bit.

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,058
- I already missed two.
- Matty...

19
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,810
I know. It's okay.

20
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,812
It must have been a drag.

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,856
We just had to make sure
you weren't exposed to any bugs,

22
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,442
because your healthy bone marrow
is what's gonna cure

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,110
your brother's leukemia.

24
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,924
Go on.

25
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,004
He sneezed.
Maybe it's just an allergy.

26
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,339
Not with an enlarged spleen
and a fever.

27
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,175
He's got one of 10,000
possible infections,

28
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,721
even if it's just the common cold, I do
the transplant, he kills his brother.

29
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,847
How long do we have?

30
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,891
Radiation obliterated
his immune system.

31
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:49,395
Even in a clean room,
he's got four, maybe five, days left.

32
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,398
No way we can solve this that fast.
You need to find another donor.

33
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,608
They're African American.

34
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,902
It makes it nearly impossible
to find a full match.

35
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,905
Tell me about it. I can't even find
the one I've got working for me.

36
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,990
Where is Foreman?

37
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,793
Nothing like a dead patient to send you
back to your choir boy roots.

38
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,797
Hey, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

39
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,133
Wilson just killed a kid
same way you did.

40
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,426
He's not dead.

41
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,764
Five days are gonna fly by. He didn't
look both ways before he nuked.

42
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,516
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

43
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,602
Because I thought, maybe,
you could do your job and just...

44
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,688
Start the donor brother
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

45
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,691
Great idea, if you're looking
to save exactly one kid.

46
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,153
Broad-spec will take at least a week
to work. We need narrow-spec.

47
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,529
How old is Hector?

48
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,239
Our patient's name is Matty.
His brother's Nick.

49
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,951
Hector's my dog. He's about 17?

50
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:49,997
Seventeen? That's, like, a 119 in human
years. Why is he still alive?

51
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,417
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

52
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,545
We need to start testing. Stool samples
for parasites, antibody tests...

53
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,712
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

54
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,800
That's because the
infection is too small.

55
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,761
We start testing now, it's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

56
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,639
We draw blood, odds are we're just
gonna come up with hay.

57
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,808
We need to grow more needles.

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,439
Okay, that probably needs
further explanation.

59
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,191
We make the donor kid sicker.

60
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

61
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,988
Suddenly we're looking at some needle
that a camel

62
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,235
can pass through the eye of.

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,158
Making him sicker risks spreading the
infection all throughout his body.

64
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,952
True, but who cares?

65
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,621
Once we know what the infection is,
we'll know exactly how to treat it.

66
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,348
As long as he isn't dead yet,
we're cool.

67
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,749
We should do
what we normally do.

68
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,002
Go to the kid's house,
check for sources of the infection.

69
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,712
Waste of time.

70
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,256
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

71
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,717
Safer than intentionally
making the kid sicker.

72
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,511
Fine, go.

73
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,313
So exactly how sick
are you gonna make Matty?

74
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,940
He could get quite ill.

75
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,227
It certainly won't be a pleasant
experience for anyone,

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,152
but it's our only...

77
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,904
Ever get caught in the rain
without an umbrella?

78
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,115
That's all we're
talking about here. Sign the form.

79
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,827
It's a little more complicated than
that. We'll also be doing leukapheresis.

80
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,433
We run Matty's blood
through a machine

81
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,788
that filters out
his white blood cells.

82
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,583
But without his white cells,
how could he get better in time?

83
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,627
We'll pump the white blood cells back
as soon as we have a diagnosis.

84
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,297
Then we should be able to cure the
infection in time to do the transplant.

85
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,631
But you can't guarantee?

86
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,718
We're not GM.
No recalls, no rebates.

87
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,804
Anymore questions
while your son's life slips away?

88
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,896
You really think
we should do this?

89
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,522
Yes.

90
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,484
Sorry. Your patient,
you tell them.

91
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,448
This is your family.
It needs to be your decision.

92
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,834
All you had to do was
say, "Yes, I do."

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,253
God knows it's a phrase that you've used
often enough in your life.

94
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,381
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break. They said yes.

95
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,967
That's not enough for you. You need them
to feel good about saying yes.

96
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,888
I treat patients for months,
maybe years, not weeks, like you.

97
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,972
I'm taller.

98
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,739
If they don't trust me,
I can't do my job.

99
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,519
The only value of that trust
is that you can manipulate them.

100
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,978
You should write
greeting cards.

101
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,898
Giving the parents a chance
to make a bad choice was a bad choice.

102
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,274
At least it would have
been their choice.

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,528
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

104
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,197
Kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate.

105
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,157
Whatever the kid's got,
he didn't get here.

106
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,620
No, whatever the kid got, he didn't get
from the kitchen or the bathroom.

107
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,122
Nobody cleans swing sets.

108
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,917
Yeah, because their kid's 10
and hasn't used it since he was six.

109
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,130
You obviously think your time could be
better spent. Why'd you come along?

110
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,799
You feel bad about
what happened last week.

111
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,092
I'm handling it.

112
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,552
Think the family's gonna sue?

113
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,090
She only had her grandparents,
and they weren't close.

114
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,557
Well, that's good.
For you, I mean.

115
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,143
A lawsuit makes it even harder
to put behind you.

116
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,270
You put yours behind you?

117
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,397
Nope.

118
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,861
When I woke up
this morning I...

119
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,387
I couldn't remember what she was wearing
when I admitted her.

120
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:10,865
Memories fade.

121
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,909
I killed her a week ago and I can't
remember what color top she was wearing.

122
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,705
I was grateful when
I could wake up not thinking about her.

123
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,789
I'm not like you.

124
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,376
Your patient died because you were
distracted over the death of your dad.

125
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,336
I made a calculated decision.

126
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:31,093
You acted like a human being.
I acted like House.

127
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,399
Could be Mucor or
Strongyloides in this dirt.

128
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,403
No pulmonary symptoms,
setting well, breathing easily.

129
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,008
Mom, I'm freezing.

130
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,723
How long do I have to wait?

131
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,392
Matty, we found an old water pump
in your backyard.

132
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,439
You ever drink from it?

133
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,312
Yeah, it was gross.

134
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,648
We gotta test
for Mycobacteria, leptospirosis.

135
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,941
When did you drink the water?

136
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,525
Last summer?

137
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,864
You sure? You haven't even taken a sip
to cool off?

138
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,658
It was really gross.

139
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,245
My shoulder's bugging me.
Does that matter?

140
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,248
It could. Did you
do anything to hurt it?

141
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,960
Just threw the ball around
the other day, for a couple hours.

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,963
It's probably just a muscle ache.
Let us know if it gets worse.

143
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,762
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

144
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,430
Is something else bugging you?

145
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,227
Sort of.

146
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,649
- He has acute scrotum.
- Adorable.

147
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,110
Please, I thought you
were dignified.

148
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,321
Come on, how am I not supposed
to make that joke?

149
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,284
Best thing about big, honking gonads,
well, one of the best things,

150
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,869
is that there's only
a few infections that could cause it.

151
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,288
Do urinalysis and cultures

152
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,124
for E. Coli, Klebsiella, TB,
and Brucella.

153
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,835
Blood tests for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

154
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,463
Hopefully, the needles have grown as
fast as his sack, and we can find it.

155
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,382
Can Chase and Cameron
cover that?

156
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,719
Mind if I ask why?

157
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,389
I want to recheck the National Marrow
registry for an alternate donor.

158
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,516
In case we're wrong?

159
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,976
It's been known to happen.

160
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,479
Fine, go.

161
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:58,365
Negative for E. Coli and TB.
Why is House taking it easy on Foreman?

162
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,491
He deserves a break.

163
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,952
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people in need.

164
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,455
No on Klebsiella.

165
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,459
And it's Tuesday.

166
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,421
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

167
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,925
It's the day I remind you I like you,
and I want us to be together.

168
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,928
Thank you, I'd forgotten.

169
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,018
No on Brucella
and both viral antibodies.

170
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,811
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

171
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,023
You take the day off,
I'll pick it up on Wednesday.

172
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,777
What if we're looking for
the wrong thing?

173
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,029
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

174
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,995
Why don't you just say it four times now
and leave me alone for a month?

175
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,533
Well, what if it's
not an infection?

176
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,869
His temperature's through the roof.
There's mucous pouring out of him.

177
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,037
I know he has an infection,

178
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,498
but what if it didn't directly
cause the scrotum issue?

179
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,169
What if it just caused
the thing that caused the scrotum issue?

180
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,046
CK-MB is elevated.

181
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,758
Slightly.
There's nothing wrong with...

182
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,135
Indicates cardiac injury.

183
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,639
We stuck him in that room,

184
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,125
put his stupid, little runny-nose
infection into hyperdrive.

185
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,518
What if it went to his heart?

186
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,942
Pulmonary valve looks clean.

187
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,779
Wait. Stop. Mitral valve,
there's a growth.

188
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,784
He'll need a month
of antibiotics to clear that.

189
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,078
His brother only has
four days to live.

190
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,130
The infection in Matty's
mitral valve rules him out as a donor.

191
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,131
This is perfect.

192
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,799
We drove the infection
into his heart.

193
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,594
Okay, perfect is too strong of a word,
but it's very, very good.

194
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,097
Now we know
where the infection is.

195
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,683
All we've got to do is remove
the valve, ID the infection,

196
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,892
target and destroy it.

197
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:49,852
Remove the valve?

198
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,896
He'll be fine on antibiotics.
He doesn't need open-heart surgery.

199
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,066
He'll be heartbroken,
on account of his dead brother.

200
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,903
Either way he's got a dead brother.
The infection isn't just in the valve.

201
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,405
Even with targeted medication,

202
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,198
there's no way
we can clear his system in time.

203
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,076
We don't have to.
We have to clear his marrow.

204
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,412
After the surgery,
we harvest the marrow,

205
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,874
marinate it in the targeted
antibiotic, simmer and serve.

206
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,918
- Could work.
- It's insane.

207
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,336
It is better than
a dead brother.

208
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,006
I'm running this by Cuddy.

209
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,092
Fine. Go.
In fact, let's all go.

210
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,056
This surgery is dangerous
and life-altering,

211
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,024
and clearly not in
the interest of our patient.

212
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,643
It is, if he likes his brother.

213
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,009
We have a conflict
of interests.

214
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,354
The parents don't.

215
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,314
Of course they do.

216
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,081
They already sacrificed Matty's health
to benefit his brother once.

217
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,818
They made his cold worse.

218
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,154
We screwed up his heart valve
by making his cold worse.

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,697
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

220
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,407
Wilson's right.
Foreman's wrong.

221
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
Your shirt is way too
revealing for the office.

222
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,747
What do you want me to do?

223
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,000
We should call child services and have
them appoint a guardian for Matty.

224
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,877
No.

225
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,339
Go explain the choices to the parents,
and don't let House bully them.

226
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,302
House.

227
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,137
Did he really think I was gonna do that?

228
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,096
I didn't.

229
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,265
- Then, why did you let him...
- I'm trying to cut him some slack.

230
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,642
Nice of you.

231
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,228
I think he's got the yips.

232
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,816
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood,
David Duval all got the yips.

233
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,820
Great athletes, lost their confidence
and immediately started sucking.

234
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,115
And you're giving him time
to work through it?

235
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,286
Four days, and he's fired.

236
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,791
You don't get better
from the yips.

237
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,170
Open-heart surgery?

238
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,258
If you want both kids to live,
it's the only choice.

239
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,926
Due to the valve replacement,

240
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,887
Matty will have to be on blood thinners
to prevent potential clots.

241
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,305
- For how long?
- Forever.

242
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,808
He couldn't participate
in contact sports,

243
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,892
because of the risk of hemorrhage.

244
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,812
What about the marrow registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

245
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,897
Maybe they'll ride it here
on a unicorn.

246
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,108
I'm afraid finding
a viable new donor

247
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,528
isn't something we can
realistically depend on.

248
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,201
Either we cripple one son,
or kill the other.

249
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,415
He won't be able to play baseball.
That doesn't make him a cripple.

250
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,168
What should we do?

251
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,556
You should protect your family as a
whole. You should do the surgery.

252
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,728
- That was awesome.
- Shut up.

253
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,646
I gotta start
pretending to care.

254
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,452
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

255
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,847
No you didn't. You did exactly
what she told me not to do.

256
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,819
You're completely in the clear.

257
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,821
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

258
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,157
You're actually upset.
You just said what you believed.

259
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,451
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

260
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,911
Because it lessens your guilt
if things go wrong.

261
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,831
You're not protecting their choices.
You're soothing your conscience.

262
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,374
By that logic, a sociopath

263
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,918
would make the best patient
advocate in the world.

264
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,046
Am I blushing?

265
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,804
You ready?

266
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,681
Yeah.

267
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,225
Thanks.

268
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,019
You'd do the same for me.

269
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,448
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

270
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,855
You think I'll be better in time
to pitch in the playoffs?

271
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,495
Maybe next season.

272
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,251
We should have told him.

273
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,380
He loves his brother, but if he
understood what we were asking of him...

274
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,049
He loves his brother
more than he loves baseball.

275
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,717
You did the right thing.

276
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,637
Putting any part
of this decision on him...

277
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,224
It's impossible for you guys
to deal with this.

278
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,934
How's a 10-year-old
supposed to do it?

279
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,952
Cannula in place.

280
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,540
Sutures are holding.

281
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,463
We're all set to go.

282
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,966
Switch him over to bypass.

283
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,465
- Yeah?
- I didn't do the surgery.

284
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,759
You woke me up
to tell me that you're lazy?

285
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,969
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

286
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,637
I'm tired. Get to the point.

287
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,972
We didn't replace the valve

288
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,725
because the growth was fibrous tissue.
It wasn't infectious.

289
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,301
We've got to be wrong about...

290
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,686
- Oh, God.
- What?

291
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,729
You know what's wrong
with Matty?

292
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,690
I think Hector's
committed suicide.

293
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,897
What are you talking about?

294
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:30,859
He took some pills.

295
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,527
Is he alive?

296
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,237
He ate half my stash.

297
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,240
Of course he's...

298
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,292
He's stoned. I'll be right in.

299
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,925
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

300
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,678
and all we got was this lousy,
non-infectious fibrous tissue.

301
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,138
How did we miss this?

302
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,266
Matty had a fever. He got sicker when we
suppressed his immune system.

303
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,851
That all points to infection.

304
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not our fault. Fibrous tissue.

305
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,567
Something is turning
his healthy heart valve into gristle.

306
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:17,405
Fibrous tissue, enlarged spleen,
fever... Could mean autoimmune.

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,410
Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along
in bone marrow.

308
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,871
He can still donate.
We confirm, I do the surgery.

309
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,416
Lupus and Behçet's are our best bet.
Do an ANA and pathergy test.

310
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,460
Or it could be infection.

311
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,462
My memory's not
what it used to be,

312
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,048
but didn't we just
rule that out eight seconds ago?

313
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,925
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve,

314
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,260
it doesn't mean
it's not in his system.

315
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,930
Uh-huh, and has the obvious
advantage of making us right all along.

316
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,182
Little disadvantage
of making big brother dead.

317
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,059
That's your argument? A better outcome?

318
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,018
It fits.

319
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,438
The family has one kid
with leukemia and one with autoimmune.

320
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,940
I wouldn't stand next to them
in a rain storm.

321
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,150
That's your argument?
It sucks for them?

322
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,361
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

323
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,905
National Marrow Registry
came up with four out of six donors.

324
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,491
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

325
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,285
I mean, I know two is so small,

326
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,787
but since it means that he's gonna get
Graft-Versus-Host Disease,

327
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,457
the marrow will attack his body,
and he'll die a painful death.

328
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,044
Find out what autoimmune it is.

329
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,971
Is this autoimmune better or worse
than the new heart valve?

330
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,931
It depends on which autoimmune
it is.

331
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,808
With early detection,
most are manageable.

332
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,184
How long will testing take?

333
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,644
That's the other good thing
about this.

334
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,770
There's literally
thousands of possible infections,

335
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,732
but only a handful of
autoimmune conditions.

336
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,567
We'll have the answer
in a few hours.

337
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,776
Hey, Doctor?

338
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,448
Is this bad?

339
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
Wanna catch a movie?

340
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,168
It's one in the morning.

341
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,961
I know a place.

342
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,923
Although, I wouldn't recommend
wearing those shoes.

343
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,509
How exactly does a dog
unscrew a bottle of pills?

344
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,719
Is that a riddle?

345
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,220
It requires an opposable thumb.

346
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,388
I must have left it off.

347
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,556
On the floor?

348
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,141
I think he hopped up
onto the bathroom counter.

349
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,643
He has arthritis.

350
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,775
- Not me this time.
- No! It's your damn dog.

351
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:22,072
He chews everything. I was missing
a file. Found paper in his stool.

352
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,200
An original Sun Record 78
Elvis recording, gone.

353
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,036
Who the hell chews vinyl?
He's vindictive.

354
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,290
He's had a good, long life.
It's his time.

355
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,708
Are you okay?

356
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,878
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

357
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,255
What do you got?

358
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,967
Matty's negative for everything.
It's not autoimmune.

359
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,426
So, we're back to infection.

360
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,637
Nick's starting
to deteriorate fast.

361
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,930
He's got bruising
all over his arms.

362
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,377
His capillaries
are leaking blood.

363
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,933
If it happens in his brain,
he's dead.

364
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,602
We've got to go
with the four-out-of-six donor.

365
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,897
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less than six?

366
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,984
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

367
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,391
Of course, that time,
it was only fatal to their marriage.

368
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,239
It's either that, or we start
randomly testing Matty for infections.

369
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,949
I know how you hate
the word "random."

370
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,786
Do it alphabetically. We're not doing
that damn transplant.

371
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:11,997
Where's Foreman?

372
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,748
We've found a donor.

373
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,711
It's not an ideal match, but four out
of six still gives Nick a chance.

374
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,763
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

375
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,806
Doctor Foreman explained...

376
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,685
Did he also explain what sort of pain
your son will experience

377
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,521
- if he gets Graft-Versus-Host Disease?
- Yes.

378
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,982
Apparently, he didn't explain it
vividly enough.

379
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,108
Let me give it a whack...

380
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,527
He also explained that if we did
nothing,

381
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,030
Nick could start
bleeding into his brain.

382
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:49,117
Matty is a perfect match. Just give us
a little more time to figure out...

383
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,285
How much time?

384
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,162
Doctor House is
the best diagnostician...

385
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,997
How much time?

386
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,708
I don't know.

387
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:01,463
And Nick can start bleeding into
his brain without any warning?

388
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,466
Yes, but the chances of
complications from a mismatch are...

389
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,342
My boys have suffered enough.

390
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,178
Get Matty better,

391
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,640
and give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

392
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,148
Foreman screwed us.

393
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,609
No, you screwed us.

394
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,862
What is the point in being able
to control people

395
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,822
if you won't actually do it?

396
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,784
It's like training a dog and
letting him go on your rug,

397
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
which, by the way...

398
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,661
Once Foreman got his mitts
on them, well, there was no way...

399
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,540
You don't explain chances
and probabilities, you lie to them.

400
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,586
You tell them Foreman's a moron, which
isn't even much of a lie right now.

401
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,461
You've got to talk to him.

402
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,837
I've got no problem
with what Foreman did.

403
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,923
He undercut us,
and he may have cost that kid his life.

404
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,259
Foreman did what he thought was right.
You, on the other hand, sucked out.

405
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,803
When the decision
really mattered,

406
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,849
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

407
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,724
If that kid dies,
it's because Foreman was wrong,

408
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,184
and because you're a coward.

409
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,929
Oh, goodness,
I've left my door open.

410
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:40,186
My poor dog must have run away and been
hit by a car or a truck or a train.

411
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,230
Or an anvil.

412
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,118
Thank God, you're still here.

413
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,537
He's still here!

414
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,417
Where's my stereo?

415
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,155
How are you feeling?

416
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,281
A little itchy.

417
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,534
It's weird, huh?

418
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,121
You still have no idea
what's wrong with me,

419
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,748
but those meds will
make me better.

420
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,336
We put you on a variety of medications
that will fight all kinds of infections.

421
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,674
Nick, you know exactly
what's wrong with him,

422
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,509
but maybe he's gonna die,
anyway.

423
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,094
Hopefully,
the new marrow will...

424
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,721
I can't go in there, can I?

425
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,144
Your infection would kill him.

426
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:09,609
So, I won't be able to
be with him when he dies?

427
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,780
You'll be able to be with him
when he gets better.

428
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,576
What's wrong?

429
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,827
It really itches.

430
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,255
Hello?

431
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,686
Why am I meeting you here?

432
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,939
You're paying for my new cane.
It was your dog.

433
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,276
So, that's it?
You call me a coward, life goes on?

434
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,736
Apparently. You showed up.

435
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,906
Hey.

436
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,786
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,422
You're pathetic.
I didn't actually mean that.

438
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,300
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't to infinity.

439
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,551
Yes, you did.

440
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,511
- You're pathetic.
- Yeah?

441
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,513
When?

442
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,641
What did the labs say?

443
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,025
Why don't you buy your cane
at a medical supply store

444
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,276
like a normal cripple?

445
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,902
Fewer bitching choices.

446
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,197
Okay. What do you got
in bitching?

447
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,657
Right this way.

448
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:41,576
That was Cameron.

449
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,954
The kid that wasn't all that
sick is now all that sick.

450
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,040
- He's bleeding out of his ears.
- Blood counts?

451
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,458
Down.

452
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,834
Schistocytes on the smear?

453
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,796
His body's not making new blood cells.
His bone marrow's crashing.

454
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,423
This is one of our top sellers.

455
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,427
It's a little too Marilyn Manson
in a retirement home.

456
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,929
The meds are suppressing
his bone marrow.

457
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,182
Or the infection's doing it.

458
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,392
Pretty cool.

459
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,937
Genuine bull penis,
stretched over a metal rod.

460
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,275
Penis canes are murder.

461
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,277
Right.

462
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,071
Let me see the one on the end.

463
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,072
You got it.

464
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,865
We need to stop Matty's meds.

465
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,077
If the marrow rebounds, it's the meds.
If it doesn't, it's an infection.

466
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,495
And if it's the infection?

467
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,206
Maybe I was wrong
about which kid's gonna die.

468
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,005
Bitching.

469
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,944
Flames?

470
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,031
It makes it look like I'm going fast.
Now, how's our dying kids?

471
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,404
Nick's developed blisters
all over his feet and legs.

472
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,494
He's got grade four
Graft-Versus-Host.

473
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,287
Increase his dosage
of methylprednisolone.

474
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,206
Already did. It's not working.

475
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,000
Feeling guilty?

476
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,420
I did the right thing.

477
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,921
Always a comfort.

478
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,174
Okay, what's
the other kid's status?

479
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,217
We're done with Nick?

480
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,718
God is done with Nick.

481
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,605
We know what he has.
We know how to treat it.

482
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,932
We're doing it, it's not working.
Life is for the living.

483
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,976
Matty's been off his meds
for a few hours,

484
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,542
but his blood count's still tanking.

485
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,771
Means the meds aren't to blame.
It's the infection.

486
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,859
If we don't get this under control, his
blood will literally turn into water.

487
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,031
Cultures still
aren't growing anything.

488
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,032
Why not?

489
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,412
Because you did the right thing.
Convinced the parents to treat the kid.

490
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,456
All you did was yank the weed
out of the ground.

491
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:55,084
Its roots are still killing their
beautiful lawn. We just can't see it.

492
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,970
If we can't see it,
we don't know what it is.

493
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,846
If we don't know what it is,
we can't kill it.

494
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,634
So we got to wait for it
to grow back again.

495
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,471
Now, the soil is arid.

496
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,725
So both he and his brother
will be dead by the time...

497
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,568
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

498
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,489
What if we take the roots
from Matty, and put them in Nick?

499
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,908
Turn the kid into
a petri dish, only better.

500
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,826
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

501
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,912
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

502
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,719
The very thing we've been trying to
avoid since the brother sneezed?

503
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,667
- Leukemia kid's got no defenses.
- Which is why he'll die.

504
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,712
But before he does,
the infection will spread fast.

505
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,049
Fast enough to tell us
what it is, in time to save his brother.

506
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,806
Do you see any other way?

507
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,313
The infection
is decimating Matty's bone marrow.

508
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:04,237
But if we give that marrow to Nick, his
symptoms could let us diagnose Matty.

509
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,656
- But, it'll kill Nick.
- Yes.

510
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,908
You're...

511
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,410
You're saying we should
kill one son to save the other?

512
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,745
Nick is gonna die either way.

513
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,956
You don't know that. I mean,
he's in pain right now, but...

514
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,792
Nick's Graft-Versus-Host
is not responding to medication.

515
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,835
That can change.

516
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,256
Maybe he... He'll rally.

517
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,133
Hey, my Nick is a fighter.

518
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,010
Graft-Versus-Host
isn't gonna go away

519
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,846
because of Nick's sunny smile
and positive outlook.

520
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,183
Nick has survived
three reoccurrences of his leukemia.

521
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,519
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

522
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,022
His pain's gonna get worse
and worse, until he dies.

523
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,066
You're just dragging it out.

524
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,278
You have only
one decision to make.

525
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,780
You can leave here
with one dead son, or two.

526
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,414
Tell them.

527
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,712
You should let us do this.

528
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,014
No!

529
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,021
We're not giving up on Nick.

530
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,774
Not!

531
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,293
The patient's parents apparently
don't want to be parents anymore.

532
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,297
You're a sneaky bastard.
Any ideas how we get around this?

533
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,299
- Court order?
- It's hardly sneaky.

534
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,842
We can still save Matty.

535
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,720
Run more tests, find out what infection
is destroying his marrow.

536
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,098
Ten-thousand possible infections,
at least 20 minutes per test.

537
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,683
It'll take you
approximately eight years.

538
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,354
Actually, four months, assuming the last
one I test is the right one,

539
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,040
and, if it's the first, it will take me
approximately 20 minutes.

540
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,858
He's right. It's worth a shot.

541
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,570
He's timid. Testing blindly is not gonna
save this kid.

542
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,947
But standing around here will.

543
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,605
Wow, he sure is hurting.

544
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,400
The nurses say he maxed out
on his pain meds.

545
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,361
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

546
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,158
Pharmacy's on the ground floor.

547
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,995
I'm gonna go get you
some more pain medication, okay?

548
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,831
Thank you.

549
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,682
It's not gonna help.

550
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,602
You're dying.

551
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,898
Nothing's gonna change that. These drugs
will just make you go easier.

552
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:29,692
I know.

553
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,864
Fourteen years on the planet,
most of them spent suffering.

554
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:41,328
Dying before you even
got to drive a car,

555
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,290
take off a girl's bra,
drink a beer.

556
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,211
Believe me, there's plenty
you haven't done.

557
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,255
Really good stuff.

558
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,511
Must make it hard
to believe in God,

559
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,891
or fairness, larger purpose.

560
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,564
But your life
doesn't have to be meaningless.

561
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,066
You can save your brother.

562
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,738
How?

563
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,284
Negative for CMV.

564
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,827
Negative for amoebas.

565
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,913
House called you timid.

566
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,748
He's called me a lot worse.

567
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,918
To him, there is nothing worse.
He's gonna fire you.

568
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,920
Even if we run 100 tests,

569
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,446
that only gives us a one percent chance
of saving these kids.

570
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,467
Better than zero.
You don't care if you get fired?

571
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,592
I don't know.

572
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,758
There's got to be a way to better our
odds from a 99-percent chance of death.

573
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,805
You've got to know.

574
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,224
It's not food-borne, because no one else
in the family is sick.

575
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,892
You either care about
your job, or you don't.

576
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,561
And Matty's the only one who drank from
that water pump in the back yard,

577
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,188
and we eliminated Pseudomonas
and cholera.

578
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,566
If you care, you fight to keep it.
If you don't, you quit.

579
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,945
I thought they lived
in the suburbs.

580
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,030
They do. Why?

581
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,448
And they've got a water pump?

582
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,163
Please, I... I want to do it.

583
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:10,000
No, Nicky,
it's not your decision.

584
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,046
I'm dying. There's nothing
that's gonna change that.

585
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:20,094
Hey, hey, hey. Don't say that. Okay?
You can't give up.

586
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,596
It's time for me to go, Dad.

587
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,100
You got to let me go.

588
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,771
No.

589
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,859
Please, son.

590
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:41,657
I can't... I can't... I can't!

591
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:48,080
Let me do it for Matty.
Let me do it for you guys.

592
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,251
So you won't be alone.

593
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,514
- Are you sure?
- No, but he is.

594
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,218
Get Nick back
to the clean room.

595
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,938
The parents agreed
to infect him.

596
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,775
We figured out
what's wrong with Matty, histoplasmosis.

597
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,611
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

598
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,779
Fungal infection.
It grows in chicken feces.

599
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,823
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

600
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,575
must have sat under
a chicken coop.

601
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,411
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

602
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,537
We didn't test for it earlier,
because we didn't...

603
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,916
Can you fix him?

604
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:35,085
Full course of amphotericin
and he should be fine.

605
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,715
And Nick?
I mean, can you clean Matty's marrow?

606
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,289
Just like you were talking about doing
it, but do it fast,

607
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,929
and get it into Nick.

608
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,724
I'm sorry, the reason
Matty is so sick

609
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,102
is because the infection
is attacking his marrow.

610
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:57,024
He doesn't have enough left to safely
take from him and give to his brother.

611
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,284
I'm gonna get better now?
That's it?

612
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,203
That's it.

613
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,746
And what about Nick?

614
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,839
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

615
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,883
Are you willing to
do that for him?

616
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,930
I can't sedate you.
You're too sick.

617
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:12,516
Please, please stop. Please.
Please. You're done, right?

618
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,019
Sorry, I need a lot more.

619
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,439
No, stop! Stop!

620
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,285
How much heat are you taking
from the parents?

621
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,494
They're calming down.

622
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,079
I think it has something to do
with both their kids

623
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,915
being alive, awake, and eating.

624
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,917
The marrow transplant took.

625
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,462
Welcome back, Foreman.

626
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,713
You should talk to him.

627
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:43,839
Tell him how proud I am?

628
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,883
Hey, if you're ashamed of him,
tell him that.

629
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,594
Pride and shame only apply to people

630
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,972
we have a vested interest in,
not employees.

631
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,218
How many hours a day
do you have to spend with someone

632
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,684
before they're
basically family?

633
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,977
Good point.

634
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,604
But, first, I've got to tell
Cameron and Chase

635
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,189
that
they're violating God's will.

636
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:04,276
I'm just asking you to have
an adult conversation to let him know...

637
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,737
That he did a good job?
He knows it.

638
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,615
Adults don't need adult
conversations,

639
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,909
just like I
don't need this conversation.

640
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,869
Have you killed Hector yet?

641
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,412
Obviously not.

642
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,208
Oh. He's quiet. He's...

643
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,128
Is that my stethoscope?

644
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,672
Bad dog.

645
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,968
Listen...

646
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,807
Bonnie joined her homeowner's
association and staged a coup.

647
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,517
Pets are now allowed.

648
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,269
Oh.

649
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,813
If you want to keep him,

650
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,524
she wants a new puppy anyway.
She'll understand.

651
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,734
Why would I want to keep him?

652
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,486
You're sure?

653
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,032
Come on, boy.

654
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,837
Accidents happen.

655
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,216
Candy?

656
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,415
Good boy.

657
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,765
You did good.

658
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,020
I did what you would have.

659
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,940
Well, maybe I'm biased, but...

660
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,233
I tortured the kid.

661
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,611
Because you knew it was right.

662
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,989
You knew you were
saving his brother.

663
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,490
I know.

664
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,785
I don't like that I know.

665
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,873
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

666
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,919
and not even take a moment to question
whether I'm doing the right thing.

667
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,756
I hate that in order
to be like you, as a doctor,

668
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,634
I have to be like you
as a human being.

669
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,512
I don't want to turn into you.

670
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,975
You're not.

671
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,022
You've been like me
since you were eight years old.

672
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,655
You'll save more people
than I will.

673
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,366
But I'll settle for
killing less.

674
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,370
Consider this my
two weeks notice.
