1
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,890
Hey.

2
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,101
Hi!

3
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,603
Car's full of gas.

4
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,439
You sure?

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,483
And if I'm not?

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,277
You'll be paying me back
for those damn invitations.

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,529
Oh. Well, then never mind.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,032
Ted is a wonderful man, Dad.

9
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,284
He's the second
greatest guy I ever met.

10
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,289
Guess that's us.

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,457
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,949
Into this holy estate, these two
persons present now come to be joined.

13
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,577
And so, if any person
may show just cause

14
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,245
why they may not
be joined together,

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,956
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

16
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,959
That's what I like to hear.

17
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,379
Do you, Theodore Philip Taylor,

18
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,966
take Nicole Margaret Murray
to be your wife,

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,635
and promise before God
and these witnesses

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,721
to be her loving
and faithful husband,

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:42,310
in plenty and in want, in joy and in
sorrow, in sickness and in health,

22
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,771
so long as you both shall live?

23
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,863
This isn't funny, Ted. Ted?

24
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,907
Are you all right? Teddy?

25
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,916
Teddy! Ted.

26
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,049
Hey.

27
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,384
Hey.

28
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,221
What time is it?

29
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,764
Happy time.

30
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,102
I'm still asleep.

31
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,980
Just think of this as a dream.

32
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,317
What about House?

33
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,986
I said a dream,
not a nightmare.

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,404
He's in the next room.

35
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,947
Sound asleep.

36
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,224
Esteban,
hope you're getting ready.

37
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,314
Hmm.

38
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,033
I met the neighbors.

39
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,242
Sir, do you know this man?

40
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,166
I don't need a temporary.
I need a permanent.

41
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,169
Yesterday.

42
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,588
Please do.

43
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,091
Good morning. Hardly.

44
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,010
One of my PAs quit an hour ago,

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,930
and I have to reshuffle
next month's schedule.

46
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,266
That's nothing. I woke up in
the wrong bed this morning.

47
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,518
Any bed you're in
is the wrong one.

48
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,273
That's not what your mama said.
Oh, snap.

49
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,069
I'll be going now.
To human resources.

50
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,238
He started it.

51
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,492
I was in
the neighbors' kid's bed.

52
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,620
Luckily, Esteban still
likes sleeping with Mommy.

53
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,996
How drunk were you?

54
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,873
About yay drunk.

55
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,752
Are you okay? You shouldn't be
drinking at all, much less...

56
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,797
You sound just
like Esteban's mom.

57
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,131
I need you in the clinic.

58
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,425
Sorry, I'm busy.

59
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,261
Tell me you have a case.
You know, even if you don't.

60
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,388
I have a case.

61
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,974
Sounds interesting.
I'll take it.

62
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,643
I owe you one. Now tell
me you don't have a case.

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,144
I really do have a case.

64
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,646
We're even.

65
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,525
You guys know how to honeymoon.

66
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,527
This is Dr. House.

67
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,736
Aphasia and syncope.

68
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,904
He can't speak.

69
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,990
"Aphasia" is Greek
for "loss of voice."

70
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,118
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage and stroke.

71
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,329
A lot of guys syncope
at the altar.

72
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,914
It's Greek for
"having the vapors."

73
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,582
We ruled out all the
common causes of fainting,

74
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,836
low blood pressure,
hypoglycemia, dehydration.

75
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,338
Don't say "ah."

76
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,095
Do you know what it is?

77
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,056
Roll on your side
and lift up your gown.

78
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,267
There's one thing
they didn't test for.

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,352
A test for what?

80
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,396
Faking.

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,605
Ow!

82
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,232
Test was positive.

83
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,735
I can talk.

84
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,489
I wasn't faking. My voice
just came back right now.

85
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,035
Hey, I'm not the one
you have to convince.

86
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,703
I know he wasn't faking.

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,289
Boy, if she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

88
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,832
What about the syncope?

89
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,333
Well, that...

90
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,212
She buying this, too?

91
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,673
Why would he fake anything?

92
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,301
Kryo podia.
It's Greek for "duh."

93
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,638
So, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

94
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,769
I don't think he was faking.

95
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,480
That's because you're
more gullible than I am.

96
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,106
For instance, I don't believe

97
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,025
that you called off
your open marriage.

98
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,526
I believe your wife
called it off,

99
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,091
and you called off telling her
that you weren't calling it off.

100
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,199
Guy doesn't throw a golden
ticket in the trash.

101
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,409
Same way a guy doesn't give up
a lucrative medical practice

102
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,827
to come work for you?

103
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,954
That's exactly why you dabble.

104
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,374
You're compensating for your
professional conquests with sexual ones.

105
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,751
I'm not that predictable.

106
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,753
For example, you're
probably not expecting me

107
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,671
to ask you out
for dinner tonight.

108
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,173
No, thanks.

109
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,338
You won't even consider it?

110
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,383
I did, just very quickly.

111
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,929
Truth is, since I
called this thing off,

112
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,597
my wife has been very grateful,

113
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,474
and I could do
with a down night.

114
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,560
If I go out with the boss,
nobody can blame me.

115
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,395
Okay.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,939
If you bring your wife.

117
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,232
No, that's the point.
I need a little...

118
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,399
You're lying.

119
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,776
I'm not lying!

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
Then I'm not going.

121
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,407
Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

122
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,665
You believe me, right?

123
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,875
Of course, I believe you.

124
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,377
Then let's do it.

125
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,963
We'll tell the cab to take us to
AC right now and get it done.

126
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,841
You're serious? You just walked
out of the emergency room.

127
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,718
Exactly, I walked out.
I feel great.

128
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,597
Well, we do have
the clothes for it.

129
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,103
Ted? What's wrong?

130
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,564
Are you... What's wrong?

131
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,108
Oh, my God.
Can somebody help us?

132
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,653
Please! Please, hurry.
Just breathe. Oh, my God.

133
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,283
There's gotta be a better
way to call off a wedding.

134
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,617
A tweet, for example.

135
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,494
Pleural effusion.

136
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,288
You think his lung
is faking it?

137
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,958
There's at least 200 cc's
of fluid in there.

138
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,627
Okay, let's say all his
symptoms are real.

139
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,254
Explain how one of them
suddenly went away

140
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,798
without using the words
"virgin" or "Mary."

141
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,426
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,344
it could explain
his other two symptoms.

143
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,846
So whether
you believe him or not,

144
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,432
all we have to figure out
is what caused the PE.

145
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,977
ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil
count ruled out parasites.

146
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,605
And medication he's
not telling us about.

147
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,191
You really don't trust
this guy, do you?

148
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,526
I don't even trust the ER.

149
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

150
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,323
Tap his lung, send cultures,
run cytology for cancer,

151
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,200
and check his blood pressure.
We already...

152
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,827
This time, talk about
nuptials while you do it.

153
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,287
Check his home
for everything else.

154
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,414
He just moved in with his
fiancée three months ago.

155
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,459
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

156
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,753
You check his love nest.

157
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,172
You two check his
swinging bachelor pad.

158
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,965
That somebody else
now lives in?

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,508
I assume so.

160
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,973
Not the glass!

161
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,315
Place looks like 1960s?

162
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,525
Could have lead paint.

163
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,070
You think
a 27-year-old has pica?

164
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,074
If it gets us out of here before
the owner comes back, yes.

165
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,828
What did you tell
that cute physio?

166
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,747
That I changed my mind.

167
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,582
No, you didn't.

168
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,042
You're more nervous than usual.

169
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:49,546
Because this B&E has actual B.

170
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,757
What...

171
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,134
That's a suspended ceiling.

172
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,430
What are you doing?

173
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,099
I want to see what's above it.

174
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,767
More ceiling.

175
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,107
Made of
40-year-old acoustic tile.

176
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,776
Asbestosis, I like it.
I'll be in the car.

177
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,779
What the hell?

178
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,116
It's okay. We're doctors.
Nobody was home, so we...

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,575
Well, I'm calling the police.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,453
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

181
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,913
Yeah, what about him?

182
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,957
He's our patient
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

183
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,041
Is he okay?

184
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,327
We think he may have asbestosis
from your ceiling tiles.

185
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,255
They're not asbestos. I had
them checked when I moved in.

186
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,381
How sick is he?

187
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,507
Is he a friend of yours?

188
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,134
He was.

189
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,387
Actually, he was my
boyfriend for three years.

190
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,145
- I'm not gay.
- Really?

191
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,981
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

192
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,107
Oh, and the boyfriend.

193
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,984
So you're bisexual?

194
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,652
No, I'm straight.

195
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,155
Cotter, the guy you met,
he's gay.

196
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,240
He had a crush on me. I left.

197
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,366
After three years?

198
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,576
It's possible.

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,953
Doesn't mean you're gay just because
the guy you're sleeping with is.

200
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,371
We weren't sleeping together...

201
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,748
What's this got to
do with anything?

202
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,708
Lung tap turned up
mononucleosis.

203
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,626
ER doesn't
routinely test for it.

204
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,504
It explains the PE and can
be virtually asymptomatic.

205
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,174
We got to wondering, how
does a 27-year-old get mono?

206
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,468
You're a little old
for the kissing disease

207
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,595
unless your immune system
is compromised.

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,221
If there's been
any unprotected sex,

209
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,639
we'll need to test for H IV.

210
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,683
There's been
no sex of any kind.

211
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,851
Okay.

212
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,397
I'll go test your fiancée for H IV.
She the curious sort?

213
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,274
Wait.

214
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,989
There may have been some contact.
But I'm not gay.

215
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,868
Sodomy, one of the top 10 most
common household accidents.

216
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,621
I did a lot of stupid things,
but I turned my life around.

217
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,081
I'm as straight as any of you.

218
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,375
You don't have to believe me.

219
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm just saying

220
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,672
you can test me as long
as you don't tell Nicole.

221
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,300
What business is it of hers?

222
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,428
I don't see anything wrong with
him marrying a straight woman.

223
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,764
How about it'll make
them both miserable?

224
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,557
Just like most
straight marriages.

225
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:09,895
He's got the right to life, liberty
and unhappiness like the rest of us.

226
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,688
Absolutely no reason
to look at me.

227
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,134
I'm not saying
it's a great choice.

228
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,691
Just saying it's his choice.

229
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,819
But it has to be hers as
well, which it can't be

230
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,570
as long as she
doesn't know he's gay.

231
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,822
Which is how it's gonna stay

232
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,267
since we have
no right to tell her.

233
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,741
Like you've never
bent the rules.

234
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,577
You date guys. You date girls.

235
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,746
I assume, at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

236
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,581
I don't lie about who I am.

237
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,083
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

238
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,919
Patients weren't lying about
their sexual orientation before.

239
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,380
So you're only judgmental
when it gets personal?

240
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,507
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

241
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,134
because they're too weak
to face the truth?

242
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,844
Yeah. Sorry about that.

243
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,471
Tell me she's
not looking at me.

244
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,230
He's negative? Yep.

245
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,441
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

246
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,236
So maybe being straight did.

247
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,948
Test was negative, no H IV.

248
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,199
Told you.

249
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,287
What you didn't tell us is how
you turned your life around.

250
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,122
That can be pretty hard.
It was.

251
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,124
Downright impossible
on your own.

252
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,959
I talked to some people.

253
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,919
It was more than
just talk, wasn't it?

254
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,592
I know this is personal stuff.

255
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,094
I'm here to help you,
not out you.

256
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,309
I had therapy.

257
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,102
Conversion therapy.

258
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,314
Went to a camp for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

259
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,984
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

260
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,152
Apomorphine?

261
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,530
Or lithium chloride, or cyclophosphamide.
He doesn't know.

262
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,200
And when that didn't work, they
shot him up with male hormones.

263
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,452
A chemical assault like that
could explain the PE.

264
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,787
And the ECT explains the rest.

265
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,665
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

266
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,709
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

267
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,313
Neural damage accounts
for the aphasia.

268
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,379
ECT doesn't cause
neural damage.

269
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:04,134
Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's
He-man Quackery Camp.

270
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,597
Run an EEG. See if they straightened
him or just scrambled him.

271
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,528
Sorry, I completely forgot.

272
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,114
My wife just started a ceramics
class Tuesdays at 8:00.

273
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,866
It's a half-hour
drive from here.

274
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,493
She won't be back till 10:30.

275
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,706
She's taking it with
her girlfriend, Marly.

276
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,125
She hopes to make
a tea service.

277
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,462
You want to call her?

278
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,797
No need.

279
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,049
I already texted her.

280
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,134
And here she is now.

281
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,640
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

282
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,560
You got a backup suit
in your car.

283
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,812
Don't wanna be
bringing home da stank.

284
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,689
Okay, yes. You're right.
About everything.

285
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,440
But please, House,
don't tell her.

286
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,567
Hi, Rachel.

287
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,569
Hi, Dr. House. I didn't
know you'd be here.

288
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,446
Hi, honey.
Got your text, obviously.

289
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,616
I'm just leaving.
I got a ceramics class.

290
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,119
Really? I love it.

291
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,746
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

292
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,748
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

293
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,542
You're in a ceramics class?

294
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,876
Friday nights, right?

295
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,380
Friday nights.
Sounded like fun.

296
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,466
You should join Chris's.

297
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,093
You know, I should.

298
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,637
Well, gotta go.

299
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,723
Making a tea service.

300
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,776
Hi. I must've fallen
asleep in the lounge.

301
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,903
- What are they doing?
- An EEG.

302
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,864
What's it for?

303
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,388
We're looking for
neurological damage

304
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,783
that could've
caused his symptoms.

305
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,702
Damage from what?

306
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,120
A head trauma.

307
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,955
He had an accident?

308
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,125
It wasn't an accident.
It was before he met you.

309
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,586
What happened?
Was he hospitalized?

310
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,214
You should ask him about it.

311
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,968
They have the results.

312
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,977
Everything looks normal.

313
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,145
Look at this.

314
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,648
Beta waves are spiking.

315
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,857
What's that mean?

316
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,025
I'm not sure.

317
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,235
He's coding! Crash cart!

318
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,488
What's happening to him?

319
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,697
He's having a heart attack.

320
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,619
Charging. Clear.

321
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,500
EKG showed no abnormalities.

322
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,001
So what caused the arrest?

323
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,212
Four ways to stop a heart.

324
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:49,091
Electrical problems, restricted blood
flow, blood where it shouldn't be.

325
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,842
Shocks, blocks or bleeds.

326
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,219
I think that's three things.

327
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,845
And cheating.

328
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,724
No, sorry, that's
how you break a heart.

329
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:03,063
I found a ceramics class in Trenton
on Friday nights that was full,

330
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,857
so my wife couldn't join me.

331
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,611
EP study ruled out shocks.

332
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,864
Now you just have to find
some Pottery by Taub.

333
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,533
The lamer it looks, the better.

334
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,868
So we'll do an angio to see
if it's blocks or bleeds.

335
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,994
You should be a doctor.

336
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm going to check out
this new lesbian bar tonight.

337
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
Your life is awesome.

338
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,051
You wanna come?

339
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,941
I was telling a 33-year-old woman
that she has breast cancer.

340
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,818
No, you weren't.

341
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,445
How do you know?
Because if you were,

342
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,238
you'd need to see
the pain in her eyes

343
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,906
so she can see
the concern in yours.

344
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,118
Why are you setting me up
on dates with my team?

345
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,578
Taub asking me out was quirky,

346
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,705
but Thirteen doing it
is a barking cat.

347
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,914
I'm doing it to help you.

348
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,501
By setting me up with a hottie
that I can't sleep with?

349
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,586
And Thirteen?

350
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,504
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

351
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,756
I know it's been hard on you.

352
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,048
I figured if you
had some company...

353
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,258
I don't need your help.

354
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,261
Then consider it helping our
neighbor's four-year-old.

355
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,263
I gave him a dollar.

356
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,468
How much did you have to pay?

357
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,432
Nothing.

358
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,267
I just told them
you might be feeling down,

359
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,145
and it was in their self-interest
to keep you company.

360
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,692
A hundred bucks.
Foreman held out for 200.

361
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:31,943
House, I'm worried about you.

362
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,780
You could've ended up
in jail or worse.

363
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,948
Racking you with guilt.

364
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,618
So I do something really
stupid, and you reward me.

365
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,546
Read any parenting manual.
That's not helping me.

366
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,413
That's helping you.

367
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,961
Fine, I did it for me, for my
relationship, out of pure self-interest.

368
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,296
Okay.

369
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,548
You'll do it?

370
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,716
For you.

371
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,886
Thank you.

372
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,971
It's not gonna work, though.

373
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,100
Maybe. But how bad can a night
out at a lesbian bar be?

374
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,443
Hey.

375
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,029
How are you doing?

376
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,073
Heart attack at 27.

377
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,245
They said you had
a head trauma?

378
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,626
I fell off a stepladder and hit my head.
It was a stupid accident.

379
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,754
An accident.

380
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,675
We need to prep you
for your angio.

381
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,260
Valium will help you relax.

382
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,638
We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

383
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,807
Ted? He's having
another heart attack?

384
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,892
I don't think so. His
heart rate seems normal.

385
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,521
Mmm.

386
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,356
Are you okay?

387
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,281
You weren't discussing
wedding plans, were you?

388
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,112
No. I guess I just...

389
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,408
Fainted.

390
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:05,871
POTS. Postural Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome.

391
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,330
BP plummets when he's upright,

392
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,291
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

393
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,576
He was lying down both times
we took his blood pressure.

394
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,947
Protracted hypotension could
have induced his heart attack.

395
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,130
Also explains his syncope.

396
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,256
And his aphasia.

397
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,050
He was upright, then you laid him
down on the bed to test him.

398
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,969
BP reverted to normal,
voice came back.

399
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,721
Jabbing him with the needle
had nothing to do with it.

400
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,891
POTS can be brought on by viral or
bacterial infection such as mono.

401
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,810
So load him up
with fludrocortisone.

402
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,563
You didn't read your ceramics
course description, did you?

403
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,565
Yeah. You did?

404
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,900
As I'm sure your wife did.

405
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,444
So we all know they're doing
a Fourth of July theme.

406
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,572
She'll be expecting
something star-spangled.

407
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,744
Nicole?

408
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:46,953
Yes.

409
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,624
Cotter Macklin.
I'm an old friend of Ted's.

410
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,875
Hi.

411
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,920
How's he doing?

412
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,172
He had a heart attack.

413
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,843
Oh, my God.

414
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:07,515
They have him on some new
meds, really knocked him out.

415
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,601
Well, how are you holding up?

416
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,312
I'm okay. Thanks.

417
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,150
I brought this for him.

418
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,444
That's his favorite thing
in the whole world.

419
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,571
I know.

420
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,786
You weren't at the
wedding, were you?

421
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,624
No, I wasn't invited.
Ted and I had a falling out.

422
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,631
How did you know each other?

423
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,133
We met senior year of college.

424
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,386
Yeah, we shared a house
for a while.

425
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,929
You were roommates.

426
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
For three years.

427
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,322
I'm sorry. I just miss him.

428
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,826
I think you should leave.

429
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,204
I shouldn't have done that. Now.

430
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,497
Please?

431
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,675
I hope he gets better.

432
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,609
Hey. How are you feeling?

433
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,903
Mmm. Don't know yet.

434
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,115
Your numbers look good. We're
gonna keep you on these meds.

435
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,179
You had a visitor
while you were asleep.

436
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,597
Oh, yeah? Who?

437
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,808
Cotter. Who is he?

438
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,519
I shared a house
with him after college.

439
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,481
I don't know why
he would show up.

440
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,650
That's it? Yeah.

441
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,403
Why? What did he say?

442
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,211
I need to hear it
from you, Ted.

443
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:59,229
One night, I got really
drunk and I went to bed.

444
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,567
And he came into my room,

445
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,572
and one thing led to another.

446
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,866
The whole thing was a mistake.

447
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,828
Are you saying
you had sex with him?

448
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,789
I was drunk and confused...

449
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,957
You're gay?

450
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,083
No.

451
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,213
I thought I was.

452
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,219
I even made up my mind
to tell my family.

453
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,056
I stood in front of the bathroom
mirror, psyching myself up.

454
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,268
But all I could see
was disgust.

455
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,271
And that's when I realized

456
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:47,277
I didn't hate the thought of admitting
I was gay because I was ashamed.

457
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,072
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

458
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,492
And that was the day
I went to get help.

459
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,329
So you're not gay?

460
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,331
They cured me, Nicole.

461
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,544
That's what all
the head trauma is about.

462
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,590
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but it's all in the past now.

463
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,010
It doesn't matter anymore.

464
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,850
What is it?

465
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,438
Oh, my head!

466
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,151
He's got severe headaches.

467
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,611
So do I.

468
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,698
Should I call or raise
with a double gutshot draw?

469
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,953
Nope. What about infection?

470
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,119
That's what we're thinking.

471
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,041
Cerebral infection would explain the
headaches, could've caused POTS.

472
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,667
If it's fungal, could've
spread to the heart.

473
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,045
I was talking about you.

474
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,339
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

475
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,009
Remind me why that has
anything to do with you.

476
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,345
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

477
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,097
And destroying my marriage
will help me focus.

478
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,641
Probably.

479
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,477
Do a spinal tap, run the CSF.

480
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,147
Still talking about you!

481
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,483
But you can do it on the
patient, too, if you want.

482
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,336
What about her?

483
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,587
The bartender?

484
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,590
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

485
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,259
Trust me, she's not straight.

486
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,427
If your gaydar is so great,

487
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,888
how come you didn't know about the
patient till you met his boyfriend?

488
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,765
Guy walked in with his bride,

489
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,351
it took me awhile
to rotate my dish.

490
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,729
It's unbelievable
what he's doing to her.

491
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,022
You don't think he loves her?

492
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,192
He may love her, but he needs
to have sex with other men.

493
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,821
Taub loves his wife, he needs
to have sex with other women.

494
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,199
Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to
her, too, but it's hardly the same.

495
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,409
To be faithful to his wife,

496
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,327
our patient has to
deny his identity.

497
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,620
Taub just needs to...

498
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,455
Has to resist
the biological imperative.

499
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,624
It is easier to
say no to dessert

500
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,917
than to pretend you don't eat.

501
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,044
Says someone who's obviously
never been on a diet.

502
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,756
My life's a breeze.

503
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:18,511
You're successful, smart, and you
attract everything that moves.

504
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,637
If you wanna focus on the fact

505
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,931
that you're not gonna see
50, that's your choice.

506
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,933
You know what?
I agree with you.

507
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,853
My self-pity's optional.
What about yours?

508
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,068
Yeah.

509
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,154
CSF was negative for infection,

510
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,359
and his headaches are worse.

511
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,740
We were just talking about you.

512
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,283
Please don't.

513
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,243
It's not POTS,
we're back to square one.

514
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,084
Not quite.

515
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,046
You did a spinal tap and
the headaches got worse.

516
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,505
We're maxing him out
on morphine.

517
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,384
He sprung a leak. He's losing
CSF from the tap site.

518
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,969
We made his headaches worse?

519
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,929
Just you, actually.

520
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,398
That still wouldn't explain why he got
the headaches in the first place.

521
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,103
Low pressure in his brain caused the
POTS, not the other way around.

522
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,148
Patch the leak, top him
up with artificial CSF.

523
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,036
There.
That should stop the leak.

524
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,662
You should be feeling
some relief soon.

525
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,002
I spoke to my parents.

526
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,755
How are they doing?

527
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,173
They're still worried.

528
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,509
Well, tell them not to be.

529
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,678
Everything's going to be okay.

530
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,850
Ted?

531
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,935
What's happening?

532
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,103
He's stroking.

533
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,980
Both eyes are responsive.

534
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,232
Tell me your full name.

535
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,358
Theodore Philip Taylor.

536
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,485
This isn't a stroke.
Then what is it?

537
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,154
What's happening to me?

538
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,834
It's really not POTS, we're
really back to square one.

539
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,795
So what's masquerading
as a stroke?

540
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,506
Voted the worst Halloween
costume, by the way.

541
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,883
MRI showed no problems with
blood flow to the brain,

542
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,176
rules out TIA.

543
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,928
Sarcoidosis?

544
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,180
Chest X-rays showed
no hilar masses.

545
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,224
Any luck with the pottery?

546
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,434
Wasn't easy.

547
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,687
Bought a suitably cruddy set of
fife and drum napkin rings online.

548
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,855
Scleroderma?

549
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,232
Skin's fine, ANA was negative.

550
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,900
So what'd that set you back?
Too much.

551
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,403
I got into a bidding war
with some lunatic.

552
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,529
Histoplasmosis.

553
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,030
EIA was clear.

554
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,201
But, hey, could've gone
a lot higher than $215.

555
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,038
You're KissMyAsthma99?

556
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,707
What about MELAS?

557
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,584
Mitochondrial
encephalomyopathy,

558
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,586
lactic acidosis and
stroke-like episodes.

559
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,171
NILLAS.

560
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:04,218
No, idiot, lactate levels are stable.
We're missing something.

561
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,678
We've run every test
that makes sense,

562
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,013
asked every question
we can think of,

563
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,639
gone over his history
a dozen times.

564
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,364
We know how much
we can trust his history.

565
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,060
If history's written
by the victor,

566
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,146
how do we find out
what really happened?

567
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,231
Talk to the loser.
Call the boyfriend.

568
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,483
Let's get them all
in the same room.

569
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,902
Or we could question them
separately and not torture them.

570
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,155
Or we could get them all in the
same room and get the truth.

571
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,077
Oh.

572
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,228
Drinks are on me
and Foreman tonight.

573
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,624
Can't. Pap smear.

574
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,750
We don't want to do it either,

575
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,001
but Wilson already paid us.

576
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,252
It's going to suck.

577
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,420
I know.

578
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,965
Where and when?

579
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,426
Any incidents of dizziness?

580
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,429
Seizures?

581
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,515
Blackouts?

582
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,226
Other than our wedding day.

583
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,645
Don't you think I would've
told you if there were?

584
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,104
My sister's birthday.

585
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,439
I was drunk.

586
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,191
You had one martini.

587
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,317
On an empty stomach.

588
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,027
Look, he was just
sitting on the couch,

589
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,530
and then he fell over
and that was it.

590
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,533
Once I slept it off,
I was fine.

591
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,243
Well, I stayed up that night,

592
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,537
checking on him
every 15 minutes.

593
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,121
What about sex?

594
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,584
Yes, I have sex with my
girlfriend because I'm not gay.

595
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,169
We have sex.

596
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,295
Thank you.

597
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,965
No problems?

598
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,095
Well, there have
been some issues.

599
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,596
Nic...

600
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,722
Erectile dysfunction?

601
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,517
Every guy has it sometimes.

602
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,981
We never had that problem.

603
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,442
Gee, that must be because
Ted doesn't like girls.

604
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,735
Or because it's vascular.

605
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,698
I know we did an MRA, but arterial
disease causing acute ischemia

606
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,660
could explain the heart, neuro
symptoms, maybe even POTS.

607
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,955
Might I suggest
a diagnostic test?

608
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,336
A penile plethysmograph measures
changes in blood flow in your penis,

609
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,089
tells us if there's
a circulatory problem.

610
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,217
You just need to be
in the right state.

611
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,303
What's your pleasure?

612
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,931
I feel terrible, I don't
think anything's gonna work.

613
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,433
Then we'll have
to give you a shot.

614
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,852
Where you don't
want to get one.

615
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,522
Shot it is.

616
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,194
He kept dreaming.

617
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,613
Dreaming.

618
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,532
That someday he'd be a star.

619
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,994
Superstar,
but he didn't get far.

620
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,122
But he sure found
out the hard way.

621
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,000
That dreams don't
always come true.

622
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,205
Dreams don't always come true.

623
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,210
Oh, no.

624
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,671
No No.

625
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,214
He's leaving.

626
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,633
Leaving.

627
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,510
On that midnight
train to Georgia.

628
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,138
Leaving on a midnight train.

629
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,851
Yeah, said he's
going back to find.

630
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,686
Going back to find.

631
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,521
A simpler place and time.

632
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,148
Whenever he takes that ride.

633
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,734
Guess who's gonna
be right by his side

634
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,694
I'm gonna be with him

635
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,696
I know you will.

636
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,407
On a midnight train to Georgia.

637
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,577
Leaving on a midnight
train to Georgia

638
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,289
I'd rather live in his world.

639
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,374
Live in his world.

640
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,085
Than live without him in mine.

641
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,586
World His world.

642
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,088
His tears My world.

643
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,131
His and hers alone

644
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,385
I've got to go, I've got
to go, I've got to go.

645
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,221
His and hers alone.

646
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,226
Nobody wants to follow that.

647
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,186
The night just keeps
getting better.

648
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,354
To Wilson.

649
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,231
Wilson. Wilson.

650
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,817
Everything looks fine.

651
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,151
You sure?

652
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,822
Medically, that's good news.

653
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,533
You feeling feverish
or sweating?

654
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,286
No, I feel lousy, but I don't
know why I'm sweating.

655
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,458
What is it?

656
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,960
You're not sweating.

657
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,256
You're lactating.

658
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,762
If he can't tell
his fiancée he's gay,

659
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,598
how's he going to
tell her he's pregnant?

660
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,602
His therapists loaded
him with hormones.

661
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,731
Male hormones don't
make you lactate.

662
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,607
Except they can
screw up your thyroid.

663
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,932
That was over three months ago,

664
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,527
we just started
milking him last night.

665
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:35,531
So something else screwed up his thyroid.
Graves', Hashimoto's...

666
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,950
No. TSH was normal.

667
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:44,540
Pituitary tumor. Could also explain
his libido and heart issues.

668
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,878
And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

669
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,174
Except we cleared him
for cancer.

670
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,719
Didn't say "cancer,"
prolactinomas can be benign.

671
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,019
Check his prolactin level
and MRI his pituitary.

672
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,867
Sounds like you
had fun last night.

673
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,452
You believe Chase?

674
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
I believe Foreman.

675
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,582
And they had fun with you.
What happened?

676
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,713
I realized that they
could be my friends.

677
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,636
You're serious.

678
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,054
And then I sobered up.

679
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,639
You weren't that drunk.

680
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,683
You managed to find your way into
your own little bed last night.

681
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,561
I think I sleep better
in rocket-ship sheets.

682
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,647
No. You want to
blame this on the booze,

683
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,899
but that's easy.
Change is hard.

684
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,651
And wisdom is knowing
the difference

685
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,403
between what you can change...

686
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,160
And what you were born with.

687
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:07,456
And cowardice is labeling what you
don't wanna change as innate.

688
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,084
I was winning this argument.

689
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,339
Pituitary MRI...

690
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,632
Was normal.

691
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,637
How are the headaches?

692
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,930
Terrible.

693
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,182
Give me your head.

694
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,350
What the hell?

695
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,601
I know, it's the
first time you heard

696
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,562
that sentence with
a possessive pronoun.

697
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,571
Oh, wow, that's better.

698
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,539
Okay. Enough.

699
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,040
How cool is that?

700
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,710
You have a Chiari Malformation,

701
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,672
a narrowing in the base of your
skull that can cut off CSF flow.

702
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,550
But it wasn't a problem until
the ECT at Breeder Boot Camp

703
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,636
caused your brain to swell just
enough to plug the opening.

704
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,097
And when your brain pressed
up against your pituitary,

705
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,017
it signed you up
for La Leche League.

706
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,060
You still won't be pitching
a tent for your lady,

707
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,647
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

708
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,816
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking POTS.

709
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,444
It also does an uncanny
Christopher Walken.

710
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,697
Unfortunately, if you treat
it like POTS, it gets worse.

711
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,700
So, as far as that goes, oops.

712
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,276
Proper treatment is surgery.
We'll get you in right away.

713
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,580
So, how did I get this thing?

714
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
Overbearing mother.

715
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,460
Kidding, CM's congenital.

716
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,379
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

717
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,274
Thought you might
be running low, so...

718
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,443
Thanks.

719
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,031
I'm not coming back.

720
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,285
Ted, this is a mistake.

721
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,162
I know you're hurting,
and I'm sorry...

722
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,873
I'm talking about hurting her.

723
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,166
I love her.

724
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,627
Ted...

725
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,713
Thank you for your support.

726
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,635
We both really appreciate it.

727
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,013
Good luck.

728
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,997
Hey.

729
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,293
You know what
I've been thinking?

730
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,587
It's your birthday
in three weeks.

731
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,260
What do you say we re-book the
church and make it a doubleheader?

732
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,680
I don't know, Ted.

733
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:14,977
Less than a week ago, we were standing
at the altar perfectly happy.

734
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,021
Nothing's changed.

735
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,188
Really?

736
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,149
I still love you.

737
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,569
Do you still love me?

738
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,282
Yes, but...

739
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,992
Then that's all that matters.

740
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,207
But I think that
you still love him.

741
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:43,005
I'm not gay, Nicole.
I promise you.

742
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,509
How can you promise me that?

743
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,305
Because I believe that we get to
choose how we live our lives.

744
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,515
And I've made my choice.

745
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,937
So now, I have to make mine.

746
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,856
I'm so sorry.

747
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
Nic...

748
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,150
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,569
Nic!

750
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,698
No. No.

751
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,203
I'm not saying goodbye.

752
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,496
Yeah.

753
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,377
I want to marry you!
I have to marry you!

754
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,173
Nic.

755
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,056
It's Friday night.

756
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,103
I called it off.

757
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,813
For real this time.

758
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,815
Frees you up for the next one.

759
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,234
One day at a time.

760
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,489
Napkin rings.

761
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,909
My way of saying thanks.

762
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,494
For trying to
wreck your marriage?

763
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,454
For trying to save it.

764
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,541
And I get napkin rings.

765
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,084
Expensive ones.

766
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,561
I hired a replacement
for my PA.

767
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,147
She seems great.

768
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,108
Good work.

769
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,526
You, too.

770
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,987
Your patient's
going home tomorrow.

771
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,947
He doesn't have a home.

772
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,285
You want to grab a bite to eat?

773
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,707
So Wilson got to you, too.

774
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,168
No, this is just me.

775
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,252
Lucas?

776
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,420
Working late.

777
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,425
I'm buying.

778
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,719
Not that hungry.

779
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,598
Okay.

780
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,108
I just want us to be friends.

781
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,906
Funny.

782
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,950
That's the last thing
I want us to be.
