1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,796
So, I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,339
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,592
Uh-huh. That's a fair price
for quality like this.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,344
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,726
What?
I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,270
Who am I dealing with here, Eddie?
Him or you?

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,980
Mickey, relax.

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,068
Now, if things move forward with
Gorski, he lets us into Philly,

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,695
then maybe I cut you a break.

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,115
You cut me a break now or maybe
you don't get with Gorski.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,622
Marco, I thought we
had an understanding.

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,165
Whoa, whoa.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,210
Tommy, don't be stupid.
Put the gun down.

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,878
First, he shows you
some respect.

15
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,090
All right, just listen to
your boss, all right, moron?

16
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,508
Shut up.

17
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,968
Just relax, buddy, all right?

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,893
What the hell are you thinking?

19
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,061
I didn't shoot him.

20
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,980
You sure? Look at him, he's
face down in the pavement.

21
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,274
I nailed myself in the foot!

22
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,530
I don't think he's hit.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,654
Well, then, what happened?

24
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,324
Let's get out of here.

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,662
Come on, Mickey, wake up.
Mickey! Wake up!

26
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,284
We almost done here?

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,370
Assuming you did this
shaving your forehead.

28
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,873
Okay, then.
I'm ordering a head CT.

29
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,917
No, I don't have a headache,

30
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,211
I'm not dizzy.
Eddie, I gotta get back.

31
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,837
You gotta stay here.

32
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,131
We'll straighten out that
mess with Marco tomorrow.

33
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,591
Let the doc do his job.

34
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,845
Actually, stitching you up
is really the ER doc's job.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,723
Yeah. Too long of a wait.

36
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:24,060
Yeah. Also, a lot
of cops in the ER.

37
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,563
Not that you'd care about that.

38
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,565
So, how did this happen?

39
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,363
Yeah, you're right.
It's a stupid question

40
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,657
'cause the answer's
kind of obvious.

41
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,326
No scrapes on your hands means you
didn't try to break your fall,

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,370
means you were either out cold

43
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,831
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

44
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,666
No sign of trauma,
other than the cut,

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,668
means no one hit you
in the head.

46
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,130
And powder burn on your jacket
sleeve means someone shot a gun.

47
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,094
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

48
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,680
I don't care what
you guys are into.

49
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,141
If you don't get this checked
out, it'll happen again.

50
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,768
What will?

51
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,353
This.

52
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,278
Cool.

53
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:21,033
Thirty-two-year-old man recently
developed loud-noise-induced vertigo.

54
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,536
CT was clean, no internal
bleeding, no edema.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,955
Everything else is in the file.

56
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,374
Cameron get your hair
in the divorce?

57
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,293
This guy strained his
back three years ago

58
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,460
and that's it.

59
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,025
All the rest of
these pages are blank.

60
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,214
Yes, he won't tell us anything.

61
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,633
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

62
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,970
So he's dangerous
and withholding,

63
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
which you find irresistible.

64
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,974
But guys like that,
they never call.

65
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,393
He actually said
he was a drug dealer?

66
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,561
Not out loud.

67
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,897
But he was wearing a
solid-gold Patek Philippe,

68
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,400
his friend had a Rolex, but their
phones were prepaid burners,

69
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,736
so they can toss them
as soon as they're done.

70
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,988
It doesn't matter if this
guy's a drug dealer or not.

71
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,073
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

72
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,576
Head CT was clean, so I'm
thinking acoustic neuroma.

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,411
We need to do an ABR
to test his hearing.

74
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,582
Acoustic neuroma fits, so does
lidocaine toxicity or benzocaine,

75
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,584
depends what he's
cutting the coke with.

76
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,086
So now he's not just a drug
dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.

77
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,922
He seemed peppy.

78
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,257
You test his ears, I'm
gonna go test his cocaine.

79
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,800
You think this guy is
just going to hand over

80
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,262
a briefcase full of illegal
drugs because you ask nicely?

81
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,722
I hope not.

82
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,604
So, the best coffee's
at Geena's

83
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,773
and the best pizza
is at Gino's.

84
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,358
Yeah, and don't mix those up,

85
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,027
'cause the coffee at Gino's
could kill you.

86
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,695
And how's the dry cleaner
on the corner?

87
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,322
Go two blocks over to EcoClean,

88
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,034
the one on the corner used to
shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

89
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,369
Good to know. In retrospect,

90
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,080
I should really
thank those cleaners.

91
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,832
We broke up. This is my stop.

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,709
So if you have
any more questions

93
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,212
about the neighborhood,
I'm your girl.

94
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,924
Uh, favorite sushi place? Maybe
we could get dinner sometime.

95
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,301
Sure, if you promise to bring

96
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,220
that good-looking guy
with the cane.

97
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,180
You mean House?

98
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,182
Your boyfriend's name is House?

99
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,644
He's not my boyfriend.

100
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,895
Oh.

101
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,315
I'm sorry. What do
you call each other?

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,068
Husband? Partner? Lover?

103
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,529
We're not gay.

104
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,990
Seriously?

105
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,827
You're going to hear a
series of clicks and hisses.

106
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,664
The sensors measure electronic
activity to your auditory nerve.

107
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,457
How long is this gonna take?

108
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,210
An hour, maybe
an hour-and-a-half.

109
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,422
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

110
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,843
Guy's probably late
to a stabbing.

111
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,511
Impedances look good,

112
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,056
starting at 13 clicks per
second at 50 decibels.

113
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,766
Check this out.

114
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,980
Thirteen's middle name
is Beauregard?

115
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,399
Wave 3 latency is 3.8.

116
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,192
Slightly delayed,
but nothing significant.

117
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,777
That's what sticks out to you?

118
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,905
House is clearly screwing with us.
It's a fake pay stub.

119
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,198
Looks real to me.

120
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,884
There's no way
she makes that much money.

121
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,827
I make that much money.

122
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,457
And apparently, you don't.

123
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,127
I need the drugs.

124
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,463
We're in textiles.

125
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,382
I need the drugs!

126
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,550
Hmm.

127
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,052
Works for Jack Bauer.

128
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,345
Is this really necessary?

129
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,057
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

130
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,476
But way less genre-appropriate.

131
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,269
Okay, here's the deal.

132
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,437
I need information.

133
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,272
You have reasons not to
give me that information.

134
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,941
So either I can
force it out of you

135
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,903
or I can't.

136
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,156
I wish I could tell you.

137
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,493
Okay. Well,
let's work with that.

138
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,246
Forget the drugs,
let's talk about textiles.

139
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,456
What's your major product?

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,835
Is it H? And by that
I mean hosiery.

141
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,923
We deal more with culottes.

142
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,257
Is that with a "C" or a "K"?

143
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,094
"C." Nobody wants K any more.

144
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,387
Does your friend
cut the fabric?

145
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,431
No, he's a sales guy.

146
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,475
Well, he must cut a culotte
here and there.

147
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,603
No one touches the culottes.

148
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,691
Sorry. Can I talk
to you for a second?

149
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,946
I'm interrogating a suspect.
Make it quick.

150
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,494
Everyone in our building
thinks we're gay.

151
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,167
We're grown men, over the age
of 30, who moved in together.

152
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,628
We're two tigers away
from an act in Vegas.

153
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,513
They'll figure out we're
straight, eventually.

154
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,716
"Eventually" is not when I want to
go out with the cute girl in 3B.

155
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,052
Any chance I could get
some water over here?

156
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,554
If only there was some way

157
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,806
to communicate that
information to her,

158
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,142
perhaps using,
I don't know, sounds.

159
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,893
If only the larynx
was capable of...

160
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,605
She didn't believe me. She
sidestepped my dinner invite.

161
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,859
And a woman would only reject
you because she's worried

162
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,485
you might not be
interested in her.

163
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,987
We were chatting, having fun,

164
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,363
there was definitely a spark.

165
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,740
When she thought you were gay.

166
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,742
You sure your friend
isn't secretly trying...

167
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,369
What is a culotte, anyway?

168
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,080
They're pants that
hang like a skirt.

169
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,709
Just...

170
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,004
Mickey hates the stuff.

171
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,797
He's one of
the few guys I trust

172
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,633
to watch the product overnight.

173
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,595
They took him away an hour ago.

174
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
You think he's okay?

175
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,599
It's an ear test. I'm
pretty sure he'll live.

176
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,396
Pupils are constricted.
Pulse is bounding.

177
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,857
Airway's clear. We need
a crash cart in here.

178
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,025
It's gotta be
his blood pressure.

179
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,068
We need to get it down
before he strokes out.

180
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,613
At least we know
his ears are okay.

181
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,202
We put the patient
on vasodilators,

182
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,703
got his hypertension
under control.

183
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
He got worse here
at the hospital,

184
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,208
means thug life probably isn't
what's making him sick.

185
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,960
Which means we can stop
The Bloodhound Gang routine

186
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,420
and go back to being doctors.

187
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,882
But we're doctors all the time.
It's so boring.

188
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,801
Fine.

189
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:13,886
Could be sick sinus syndrome.

190
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,721
No chest pain,
shortness of breath.

191
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,599
Brain aneurysm secondary
to polycystic kidney disease?

192
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,978
Normal urinalysis, kidneys impalpable.
Is that a new watch?

193
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,232
I thought I'd give
myself a little treat.

194
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,441
What if it's not his brain,

195
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,984
but it's on the way
to his brain?

196
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,778
Carotid stenosis.

197
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,697
Get an ultrasound
of his carotids,

198
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,574
see if his arteries
are clogged.

199
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,042
How much money do you make?

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,003
I want a raise.

201
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,130
And I will be happy
to talk about that

202
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,758
at your next review, in August.

203
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,176
I know that you're
paying me less

204
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,303
than everyone else on the team.

205
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,347
I can't discuss other people's salaries.
You know that.

206
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,598
Now that they know
I'm making less

207
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,100
than they are,
they'll never respect me.

208
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,560
And who told them
how much you make?

209
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,897
It's not fair for me to make less
than the people I supervise.

210
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,899
Salary isn't about fairness.

211
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,402
It's about what you can
leverage in a negotiation,

212
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,780
which isn't much without a
competing offer on the table.

213
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,366
And we both know
you don't have one.

214
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,206
Ultrasound showed no narrowing or
obstruction in the patient's carotid.

215
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,411
Not that he's worried, keeps
asking when he can leave.

216
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,335
A place in the business
of healing people,

217
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,753
you'd think they'd
have better chicken soup.

218
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,921
You bugged his room?

219
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,464
Our patient sleeps
in the building

220
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,216
where they keep their stash.

221
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,541
Eventually, he'll say something

222
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,594
that gives away where that is.

223
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,138
Then we'll find out
what's making him sick.

224
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,973
But we ruled out
environmental causes.

225
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,474
You ruled out
environmental causes.

226
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,727
And you pretended to agree

227
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,562
just so we'd take
him out of his room

228
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,063
so you could plant the bug.

229
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,482
Carotid stenosis
was a decent idea.

230
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,985
But an even
decent-er idea is that

231
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,945
he's got toxins stored
in his fat cells.

232
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,780
Every calorie he burns
makes him sicker.

233
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,741
If we're going
with toxic exposure,

234
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,744
we should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

235
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,663
Bug's a better idea than blindly
running tests for days.

236
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,711
Tell him it'll take weeks.

237
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,921
It'll be faster.

238
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,465
What do you mean, weeks?

239
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,217
These tests take time, there
are a lot of possibilities.

240
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,887
I can't sit here this long.

241
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,430
I got things
I gotta take care of.

242
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,724
If you're worried about
all the poor schoolchildren

243
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,351
going without their drugs,

244
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,437
I'm sure someone...
I want to be discharged.

245
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,190
I'll get the forms.

246
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,705
This is ridiculous.

247
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,165
Beats sitting in a lab all day.

248
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,000
In the lab,
there is significantly

249
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,752
less chance of getting killed.

250
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,957
You're too close, slow down.

251
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,124
We're in a car in broad
daylight, what's gonna happen?

252
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,882
You honestly think he doesn't
have a gun in that car?

253
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,300
That he's gonna use
to shoot doctors?

254
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,553
Just back off.

255
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,558
Hey, well played with
the watch, by the way.

256
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,935
Borrowed it from a friend.

257
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,686
How much longer are we
gonna keep lying to him?

258
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,772
Until it's no longer fun.

259
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,234
We all thought he needed to
be taken down a few notches.

260
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,445
So, we're just having fun,
not getting even?

261
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,155
Oh, crap.

262
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

263
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,117
He's gonna get away.

264
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,626
Shut up.

265
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,845
3B. You're Nora, right?

266
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,680
My roommate tells me
you're the one to thank

267
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,224
for all the tips about
the neighborhood. Greg.

268
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,934
Nice to meet you.

269
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,354
I hear you thought
that Wilson and I liked

270
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,023
to polish each other's swords.

271
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,110
And by swords, I mean pistols.

272
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,279
Of course
he told you about that.

273
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,991
Don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised
that it doesn't happen more often.

274
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,868
We're both straight.

275
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:18,005
Oh, my God, that is beautiful.

276
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,800
We finally have the room to
display it the way it deserves.

277
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,805
Would you help me
get this upstairs?

278
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,265
Absolutely.

279
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,437
Nice shoes, by the way.
Louboutins?

280
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,397
Did you talk to Cuddy?

281
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,982
Shot me down.

282
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,442
So, what are you
going to do now?

283
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,985
I'll wait for
my review in August.

284
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh.

285
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,239
What?

286
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,577
Nothing. That's what I would do.
But I'm a coward.

287
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,295
His friend brought him
in 15 minutes ago.

288
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,714
Temp's 105,
pulse is weak and thready.

289
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,466
He's not making any sense.

290
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,842
It's too much money, Eddie.

291
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,386
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal.

292
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,554
Is he gonna be okay?

293
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,680
Eddie!

294
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,355
We gave him anti-pyretics
and soft steroids

295
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,106
to reduce the fever
and prevent organ damage.

296
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,483
He's no longer delirious.

297
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,401
Patient went out, came
back worse than before.

298
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,767
Points us back to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

299
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,280
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,032
Where's Foreman? He had
a meeting with Cuddy.

301
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,408
What do you mean,
no, it doesn't?

302
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,494
We screwed up the tail,
my car was impounded.

303
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,788
True, amusing, and irrelevant.

304
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,291
Foreman fall for
the pay check thing?

305
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,504
Yeah.

306
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,465
Mazel tov.
Should be fun to watch.

307
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,593
You're off environmental?
Wherever he went,

308
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,886
it wasn't for long enough.

309
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,972
Add in the fever and
infection's way more likely.

310
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,557
And if it is an infection,

311
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,727
his symptoms suggest it's moved
to his brain, which means...

312
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,522
We'll do a lumbar puncture.

313
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,237
Next time you're tailing
someone, take two cars.

314
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,198
You knew we were following you?

315
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,077
I'm sorry, had to lose you.

316
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,954
I had business to take care of.

317
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,374
Right, because
you're a businessman.

318
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,959
You know how many junkies
come into the ER

319
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,502
every week with
their brains melting?

320
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,589
I bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out,

321
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,299
but a liquor store owner
laying on this table,

322
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,009
I'm guessing he doesn't
get attitude.

323
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,928
I hit bone.

324
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,139
His old back injury must have
flattened out his discs.

325
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,433
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

326
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,976
Are you okay? Yeah.

327
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,436
An adult wants to get wasted,

328
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,230
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

329
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,317
Because some of those
substances are against the law.

330
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,278
So your problem isn't
that it's immoral,

331
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,530
your problem is
that it's illegal.

332
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,993
I got the same problem.

333
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
I'm in.

334
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,083
Look at his heart rate.

335
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,960
It's normal. I know.

336
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,300
I ran into Nora this morning.

337
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,928
She told me about your
Evita listening party.

338
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,808
The London and New York
recordings are so different.

339
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,394
You were supposed to tell
her that we're straight.

340
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,647
She didn't believe me either.

341
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,065
You're doing this
to mess with me.

342
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,692
Correction. I started doing
this to mess with you.

343
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,944
Now I'm honestly
trying to hit that.

344
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,114
By pretending you're gay and
in a relationship with me?

345
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,909
We're in a relationship,
but we're really unhappy.

346
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,327
Communication's
never been easy for us,

347
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,162
probably because
we're so closeted.

348
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,413
I've got it all figured out.

349
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,166
Nora and I spend the next
few weeks hanging out,

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,836
become best girlfriends, I
confide in her about our issues.

351
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:49,341
I can't decide if this plan is
more despicable or illogical.

352
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,219
Then one night, we get drunk,

353
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,014
backrub turns into a front
rub, and the next morning,

354
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,141
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

355
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,686
That's quite
a commitment you've made

356
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,188
to jumping the girl
I'd like to date.

357
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,856
I'd like to date her.

358
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,025
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

359
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,318
I saw her first.

360
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,196
Seriously? You're
invoking the Guy Code?

361
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,865
We're guys. It's a code.

362
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,200
You're only bringing this up

363
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,724
'cause you know
you're going to lose.

364
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:18,995
It's not an infection,

365
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,915
but it might be an
autonomic nerve disorder.

366
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,709
The hair's still bumping me.

367
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,169
Did you get it cut because you're
ready for the next chapter or...

368
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,047
We stuck a needle into his
spinal bodies, twice,

369
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,632
his heart rate stayed normal.

370
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,592
If we add that to
his other symptoms...

371
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,928
That would be a mistake.

372
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,681
She's never gonna fall for it.

373
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,517
Well, then, you've got nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

374
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,982
You're a wuss.

375
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,609
Say that when I'm better.

376
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,821
What, are you gonna beat me up?
That sounds stressful.

377
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,408
Maybe you should pop one of
your beta-blockers first.

378
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,243
You have a heart problem?

379
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,871
Medically, no. He would've
told us about that.

380
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,497
Metaphorically...

381
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,052
It's an effect from operating
outside of the law.

382
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,139
Sometimes,
I have to do bad things,

383
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,641
and not always to bad people.

384
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,312
Last few months,
that hasn't been so easy.

385
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,609
A guy got me the pills,
and they control the stress.

386
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,237
Look, don't say anything
to Eddie, all right?

387
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,282
Last thing I need is the guys
thinking that I've gone soft.

388
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,118
When was your last pill before
we originally admitted you?

389
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,954
Um... The night before.

390
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,916
Then we stuck you in here and you
went into beta-blocker withdrawal.

391
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,459
That's what caused
the hypertension.

392
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,127
When he got out of here,
he took another pill,

393
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,462
and the hypertension went away,

394
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,755
which means
it was never a symptom.

395
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,716
We take that off the table,
we've got vertigo, fever...

396
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,469
And stress. He's been in
this game for a while,

397
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,805
either he grew a conscience
over the last few months,

398
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,474
or he's producing
excess adrenaline.

399
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,976
Pheochromocytoma.

400
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,311
What? That's Greek for

401
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,606
"you'll be back doing bad things
to good people in no time."

402
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,275
MRI his adrenal glands.
You're okay with that, right?

403
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,402
You're not gonna put
a pillow over his face?

404
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,911
Oh, great, the cable guy came.

405
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
Hello.

406
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,921
Hi, James. We've got
some Kung Pao left.

407
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,925
Oh, God. Right there.

408
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,636
We're having a picnic.

409
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,179
With wine.

410
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,597
I'll pour you a glass.

411
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,682
He doesn't drink.

412
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,808
Oh.

413
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,518
More for us then.

414
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,897
Well,

415
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,445
I think I might
have a little Kung Pao.

416
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,417
How did it go with Cuddy?

417
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,420
She told me I needed leverage,

418
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,922
so I told her about an offer

419
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,425
I had to help run the neuro
department at Mercy.

420
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,635
Wow.

421
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,680
Are you really
gonna take the job?

422
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,765
There is no other job.

423
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,018
I bluffed, she called it.

424
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,103
I'm not gonna beg
to be underpaid.

425
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,481
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

426
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,903
House is lying to you.

427
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,238
I know.

428
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,907
And so are you.

429
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,202
It's 2010. I mean, nobody
cares if you're gay any more.

430
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,967
I mean, you don't have
to be in the closet.

431
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,831
I'm not.

432
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,042
Look around you.
Does this really

433
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,253
look like a place gay men live?

434
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,297
Apart from the poster.

435
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,299
Those stools are
our only furniture.

436
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,551
There are no window treatments.

437
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,014
My ex-boyfriend didn't even know
what window treatments were.

438
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,309
Is that Greg's Carpenters
album, or yours?

439
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,480
Look, House hates musicals
and fashion and meringue.

440
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:18,068
This whole thing is an act
designed to earn your trust

441
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,696
in order to sleep with you.

442
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,575
I get it. Finally.

443
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,203
You're jealous.

444
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:33,083
If you want to spend more time with
Greg, you should just tell him.

445
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,713
You were wrong.

446
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,341
MRI revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

447
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,259
which means Mickey's
stress is just stress.

448
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,469
We're back to
vertigo and fever.

449
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,953
And environmental is back at the
top of our list of suspects.

450
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,306
We're trying to narrow
down the possibilities.

451
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,017
That receiver doesn't respond
to manual stimulation.

452
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,268
Maybe if you took off
your shirt...

453
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,604
Actually, I've resorted to
something more exotic.

454
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,773
I call it reading
the instructions.

455
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,318
Turns out, if you screw the
antennae into the wrong sockets,

456
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,404
it doesn't actually work.

457
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,490
We lost Mickey just
outside of Trenton.

458
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,040
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

459
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,043
Most buildings there were
built between 1920 and 1940.

460
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,586
We compiled a list of
toxins most common...

461
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,673
There's got to be at least
one open frequency.

462
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,598
I need a few minutes
with your friend.

463
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,435
Or stay if you want.

464
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,353
Rectal exam.

465
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,648
I'll check out the cafeteria.

466
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,992
Why the beta-blockers?

467
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,869
What do you mean?

468
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,706
Valium or Xanax
actually reduce stress.

469
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,541
Beta-blockers just control
the symptoms of stress...

470
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,625
Whoa.

471
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,961
Keep the heart from racing,
hands from shaking,

472
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,213
and all those
stage fright issues.

473
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,216
That's why some people
take them when they

474
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,593
perform.

475
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,679
What the hell is that?

476
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,347
This is my bug.

477
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,974
And this...

478
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,310
This...

479
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,563
This is yours.

480
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,736
You bugged your own room?
Are you an informant?

481
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,988
An informant would've
sold his pals out to us

482
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,698
at the first sign of a sniffle.

483
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,117
This guy is a cop.

484
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,667
I don't see
how this is relevant.

485
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,130
In the land of No Fun, you got a
really sensible piece of property.

486
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,840
Give him a break.

487
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,384
Knowing this guy's
an undercover cop

488
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,886
doesn't get us
any closer to curing him.

489
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,596
Good point.
You know what they say,

490
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,432
information is not power. Wait.

491
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,310
You're saying we should use the
cop thing to force him to talk.

492
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,064
Force? I'm talking about the
womanly art of persuasion.

493
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,483
I said womanly.

494
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,119
If you won't talk to us,
we'll find someone who will.

495
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,705
I mean, you must have a
supervisor, a handler.

496
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,251
Good luck with that. You
don't know my real name.

497
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,921
You don't know if I'm
local or state, FBI, DEA,

498
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,965
but by all means,
get on the phone.

499
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,633
I get it.
These guys are lowlifes,

500
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,051
you want them off the street.

501
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,846
Look,
they're not just lowlifes.

502
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,306
Eddie killed a snitch
three weeks ago.

503
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,600
Boss's orders.

504
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,604
The boss,
he's one of the biggest

505
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,482
cocaine importers
in the entire state.

506
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,235
And he wants to
expand down to Philly.

507
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,656
Tomorrow night, he and Eddie
are meeting the big fish,

508
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,533
and the cops are gonna bust it.

509
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,202
But if you guys get caught
poking around there,

510
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,038
the whole thing
gets called off.

511
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:03,001
That's noble, but you can't
put your life at risk.

512
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,753
I've been undercover
for 16 months.

513
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:12,093
I haven't seen my wife,
my house, my dog.

514
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,679
I've put far too much
into this,

515
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,599
and I will not let it fail.

516
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,020
So, just...

517
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,440
Just keep me alive
for another 24 hours

518
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,776
and I will tell you
everything you need to know.

519
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,407
Hey. Can I come in?

520
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,160
Nurses out here can't keep
their hands off of me.

521
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,122
Casanova, huh?

522
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,000
You bring me my sandwich?

523
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:48,755
No, because, guess what,
I don't read minds.

524
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,592
You okay?

525
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,392
He had a GI infarction
caused by a clot

526
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,478
in his superior
mesenteric artery.

527
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,938
We had to remove
a foot of bowel.

528
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,815
Any more clots keep forming,
he may not last 24 hours.

529
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,734
And the moron still won't talk.

530
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,903
Bad guy, cool, good guy, moron?

531
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,071
Pretty much.

532
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,322
Guy's a hero.

533
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,406
He's risking his life to
put these dealers in jail.

534
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,742
Well, I'm sure the dealers

535
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,286
who take their places
will be very grateful.

536
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,081
So, vertigo, fever,
and thrombosis.

537
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,124
We already ruled out
cancer and infection.

538
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,211
He got worse on steroids, which
suggests it's not autoimmune.

539
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,004
So we're stuck
with environmental.

540
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,547
But what kind of
environmentals?

541
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,508
Toxins? Parasites? Allergens?

542
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,219
We should just pick the top 10
possibilities and treat for all of them.

543
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,595
Except that treating
for everything could

544
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,639
kill him faster than
whatever's killing him.

545
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,765
Got a better idea?

546
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,849
Sort of.

547
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,434
Chase is right,
our patient's holding out

548
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,436
for noble reasons,
protecting his bust.

549
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,021
Anybody else in
that crew got sick,

550
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,983
I'm guessing they'd be
a little more self-serving.

551
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,905
Thanks.

552
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,536
Surgery went well. You'll
be able to see him soon.

553
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,792
Used to be all about
Ferberizing your kid,

554
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,627
now they're saying
it could mess them up.

555
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,840
Mine's six-and-a-half.

556
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,884
Mickey's getting worse.

557
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,595
The clot is a very bad sign.

558
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,056
We really need you to
tell us where he's been.

559
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,559
I do that,

560
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,105
a very good chance that I could
end up John Doe at the county ME.

561
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,025
Look, Mickey got sick because
he had the most exposure.

562
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,278
Other guys are at risk,
too, you don't want to...

563
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,238
Are you okay?

564
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,158
I feel dizzy.

565
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,576
Are you diabetic?

566
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:42,952
No.

567
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,746
When was the last time
you were at your office?

568
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,830
Whoa.

569
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,915
Did you drug me? What?

570
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,751
You're trying to make
me think that I'm sick

571
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,462
so I'll take you to the stash.

572
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,255
Of course not,
but if you are sick...

573
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,258
I don't feel sick,
I feel drugged.

574
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,719
Trust me,
I know the difference.

575
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,140
You didn't even
drink half of it,

576
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,184
you'll be fine in an hour.

577
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,394
You think Mickey could die?

578
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,568
It's just a deal.

579
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,446
I'll take you.

580
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,536
You couldn't have
given us a heads up

581
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,246
that he was living
in a dry cleaner?

582
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,998
It's like living
in a vat of poison.

583
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,250
Is that it?
Can we get out of here?

584
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,418
I've got to
cover all our bases.

585
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,838
Okay, fine, look.
Back there. Hurry up.

586
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,774
What are these? More chemicals?
Not exactly.

587
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,235
If this stuff was the problem,

588
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,799
there would be
a lot more sick people.

589
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,658
Did you call the cops?

590
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,742
No.

591
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,204
No one's supposed to be here.

592
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,957
Come here.

593
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,417
I said no kissing.

594
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,044
Eddie, I didn't know
you'd be here.

595
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,922
Look, the deal
was just for you.

596
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,800
This guy wants to watch,
it's an extra 50.

597
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:25,054
Yeah, private party, man.
I got it covered tonight.

598
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,236
Nice.

599
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,533
The jealousy is killing me.

600
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,659
Well,

601
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,787
he clearly cares
about you very much.

602
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,374
Why can't he show it
in a normal way?

603
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,463
I'm so tired of all the
silence and the resentment.

604
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,008
I don't know if I can
go back there tonight.

605
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,304
I need some time.

606
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,308
Come stay at my place.

607
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,810
Really?

608
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,103
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,607
It'll be fun, like a sleepover.

610
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:25,198
That would be such a help.
Thank you.

611
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,325
House.

612
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,787
What are you doing here?

613
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,414
I'm here because...

614
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,919
Nothing you can say is
going to change anything.

615
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,679
I love this man.

616
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:54,852
And I am not wasting another
moment of my life denying that.

617
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,609
Gregory House,

618
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,153
will you marry me?

619
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,364
Wow.

620
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,616
This is unexpected.

621
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,747
Say yes.

622
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,295
I'm going to go. No, no, no.

623
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,384
You two obviously have some
talking to do. Excuse me.

624
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,316
How's it coming?

625
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,568
So far, nothing.

626
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,238
Carpet, paint, insulation, even
the gross food in the fridge,

627
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,322
everything's coming up clean.

628
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,408
Which leaves
the dry-cleaning chemicals.

629
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,742
Should have the results
in a few minutes.

630
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,288
Foreman's already started
him on inhaled albuterol.

631
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,582
Chances are this case is over.

632
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,458
We have to tell him.
We can't tell him.

633
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,085
It won't change the fact
that Cuddy let him walk.

634
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,171
It'll just let him know it was
all because of a stupid prank.

635
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,759
We have to tell Cuddy. We confess
and beg her to take him back.

636
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,680
If begging worked, he would have a
raise and we wouldn't be screwed.

637
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,265
Albuterol's not helping,

638
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,641
patient started coughing blood.

639
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,227
What about adding ipratropium?
That might...

640
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,478
Don't bother.

641
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,273
We assumed this place
was using perchloroethylene.

642
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,900
Turns out, petroleum solvents.

643
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,446
The drug dealers are running
a green dry cleaner.

644
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,072
I hate to push past the irony,

645
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,949
but our patient's
bleeding into his lungs

646
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,534
and we've got nothing.

647
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,459
The V/Q scan last night
showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

648
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,877
Explains the coughing blood.

649
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,212
Did an embolization
and stopped the bleeding,

650
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,758
but then it started up again this morning.
Three more aneurysms.

651
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,801
These look like
mycotic aneurysms,

652
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,303
indicates a fungal infection.

653
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,972
That'd be consistent with his other
symptoms, the vertigo, the fever...

654
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,558
I didn't see any fungus at the
location, and none of the samples...

655
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,852
Looks like somebody
missed something,

656
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,146
which is embarrassing
for somebody.

657
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,148
And the steroids
we gave him would

658
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,733
have suppressed
his immune system.

659
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,111
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

660
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,197
Somebody's got a good point.

661
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:15,201
One bleed to four in less than 12
hours seems like an uptake to me.

662
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,952
We need to start him
on antifungal meds

663
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,789
before he drowns
in his own blood.

664
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,417
Do it.

665
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,421
How long till it
starts working?

666
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,758
Give it a few hours. I'll
be back to check on you.

667
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,279
There you go. Take it easy.

668
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,789
You shouldn't have taken
her there, you imbecile.

669
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,582
They found nothing,

670
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,378
and you could've got
your brains blown out.

671
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,841
I had to do something. I couldn't
just sit and watch and...

672
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,474
You're my friend.

673
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,186
Thanks.

674
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,816
You'd do it for me.

675
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,486
Ah!

676
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,905
I should get going.

677
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,450
Got the big man from Philly
coming in tonight.

678
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,792
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

679
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,837
I mean, Jimmie knows
everything that we know.

680
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,214
No.

681
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,634
For the six months
we put in on this,

682
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,389
you gotta be there.

683
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,731
I'll swing by tomorrow.

684
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,275
Hey, Eddie.

685
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,027
Yeah?

686
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,072
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,368
You know,
that I can't go with you.

688
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,801
It was all our fault.

689
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,761
We were screwing with Foreman,

690
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:42,097
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

691
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,308
Obviously, things got
out of control.

692
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,603
Someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

693
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,397
I always figure it was House.

694
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,525
Good to know it's catching.

695
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,818
Look, there is no other job.

696
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,223
He was just trying
to get a raise.

697
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,822
Even if you gave him a little
more money, I know he'd stay.

698
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,824
I'm not giving Foreman a raise

699
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,493
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

700
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,453
We know. And that's
why we want you

701
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,747
to take it out
of our pay checks.

702
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,416
You two okay with this?

703
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,710
Is there any other option?

704
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,338
We're okay with it.

705
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,674
Foreman is a good team leader.

706
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,843
He deserves it.

707
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,594
Okay, then.

708
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,930
That is what I will do.

709
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,141
And just so you know,

710
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,853
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

711
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,314
I haven't seen Foreman
in three days.

712
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,538
The phrase "Who's your
daddy?" comes to mind.

713
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,719
You wanna grab some coffee?

714
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,554
Kind of a bad time.

715
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,015
Sorry. You told me to drop by,

716
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,766
so this is when
I could make it.

717
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,810
Right. Come in.

718
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,655
This whole thing with
Wilson, it's all my fault.

719
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,533
We're not closeted
because we're not gay.

720
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,328
For real.

721
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,455
Wilson thought you were cute,

722
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,498
I was just yanking his chain.

723
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,585
Maybe that's not
the best phrasing.

724
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,422
So you were only spending time
with me to screw with him?

725
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,424
God, no. I was
spending time with you

726
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,051
because I want
to touch your boobs.

727
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,387
Enough to listen to Evita,
twice, and I really hate Evita.

728
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,890
That's how much
I like your boobs.

729
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,897
Wait. Wait, wait.

730
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:01,612
Wilson, he's a really good
guy and he really likes you.

731
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,034
Well, it's really...

732
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,120
It's sweet of you to stick up
for your friend like that.

733
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,669
And you're still trying
to sleep with me.

734
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,797
Maybe I will call him,
it would serve you right.

735
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,715
Wilson's a jerk, too.

736
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,842
At least he tried to
do the right thing.

737
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,636
He's been divorced three times,

738
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,388
he slept with a dying patient.

739
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,432
Sure, he looks like
a Boy Scout, but that...

740
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,287
The aneurysms look mycotic,

741
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,915
but they're not,
they're inflammatory.

742
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:58,002
Because it's not
a fungal infection.

743
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,170
The hypertension
was a real symptom.

744
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,506
You've been unwittingly
treating it with beta-blockers.

745
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,093
You stopped taking them and
your blood pressure went up.

746
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,054
It's Hughes-Stovin.

747
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,018
Okay, so how do we treat this?

748
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,316
We don't.

749
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,861
Hughes-Stovin is
an autoimmune disease.

750
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,156
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

751
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,366
The aneurysms keep multiplying.

752
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,703
Eventually,
one of them will rupture.

753
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,041
Are you sure?

754
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,295
If you die in the next
day or so, I will be.

755
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,091
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

756
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,427
it wouldn't have
made a difference.

757
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,140
You did the right thing.

758
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,731
I think I should
call my wife now.

759
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,682
I'm sorry about your patient.

760
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,936
He died a hero in his own mind.

761
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,688
I guess it's
better than nothing.

762
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,065
Ran into Nora in the elevator.

763
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,151
She no longer thinks we're gay,

764
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,778
now she thinks we're
mendacious dirtbags.

765
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,116
Mendacious dirtbag comes
much more naturally to me.

766
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,286
At least we can
get rid of that.

767
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,330
I kind of like it.

768
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,373
Unlike this sofa.

769
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,500
It's 500 bucks.

770
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,629
And it reclines.

771
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:37,429
One singular sensation
Every little step she takes

772
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,389
I will punch you in the face.

773
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,808
I'll stop if you
get rid of the sofa.

774
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,686
No chance.

775
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:50,317
One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes.

776
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:57,991
One smile and
suddenly nobody else will do
