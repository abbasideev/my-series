1
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,277
Mr. Randall? They're here.

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,547
Fifty-two million
includes over six million

3
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,091
already issued pursuant to
the over-allotment option.

4
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,509
When can we close?

5
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,054
It would be subject to regulatory
approval in both Toronto...

6
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,807
I didn't say how,
Oliver, I said when.

7
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,809
What?

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,770
You sure this is a direction
you want to go, Roy?

9
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,398
This would move us from
energy service into energy...

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,899
You don't think oil's going up?

11
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,068
Of course it's gonna go up.
The question is when.

12
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,278
The question is always when.

13
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,822
And if we wait until the deal
makes sense to everyone else,

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,867
we're gonna be waiting in
line behind everyone else.

15
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,993
All I'm saying is...

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,996
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

17
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,883
We're gonna have to wrap this up.
I gotta go.

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,417
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.

19
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,586
Get the regulators on it. I want
to close by the end of the month.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,750
Come on, Roy. There are 10
other items on the agenda.

21
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,089
Which'll have to wait
until next week.

22
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,091
You can't drag us
all out of the office,

23
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,552
get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

24
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,012
Yeah, I can.

25
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,622
The antibiotic
treatment had no effect.

26
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,960
Both the fever and the
pain are getting worse,

27
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,047
which means it's not
Clostridium difficile.

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,217
But you said that was the only
diagnosis that made sense.

29
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,970
It was. We need to get
him to a hospital.

30
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,222
Dad.

31
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,895
I don't want to go.

32
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,399
I know, buddy.
But we may need to.

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,486
Am I gonna die?

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,405
No. Of course not.

35
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,784
How do you know?

36
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,870
Well, I just do.

37
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,333
And I'm always right, aren't I?

38
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,086
Yeah.

39
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,082
I want House.

40
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,586
I understand, but I told you
Dr. House isn't available.

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,753
Dr... Call him.

42
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,924
Tell him I'll have a private jet
pick him up from whatever island...

43
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,011
He isn't on vacation. Dr. Foreman
is one of our best doctors.

44
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,554
Is House in jail?

45
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,142
No. Foreman is currently working with
two of House's most veteran associates.

46
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,476
Rehab?

47
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,728
No.

48
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,814
Mr. Randall, your son
will be in good hands.

49
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,357
My son

50
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,446
has already been in good
hands, and he's still dying.

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,573
I'm through dealing with good.

52
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,869
I want the best, and everyone
I've asked says that's House.

53
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,040
So unless he's dead,
comatose, or insane,

54
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,336
I want him treating
my son today.

55
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,011
You could have said no
in good conscience.

56
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,055
The kid'll still be
Foreman's patient,

57
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,599
but his dad wants you
making the decisions.

58
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,059
Then he's not my patient.

59
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,771
You want to give me none of the
responsibility and all of the liability?

60
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,731
Which means I get...

61
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh, cool.

62
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,196
Don't let him do
anything crazy.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,407
When is he getting his license back
so we can stop playing this game?

64
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,826
Maybe never. This game is fun.

65
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,871
You also need to prepare
President Dibala's case

66
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,999
for this week's Morbidity
and Mortality conference.

67
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,920
Oh, unfortunately, I'm overdue
on a mani-pedi appointment.

68
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,381
Not you, Foreman's department.

69
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,300
Oh, right. Well, he's got
all the time in the world.

70
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,804
We made the wrong call, he died,
there's nothing to present.

71
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,806
It obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

72
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,650
And we don't have more
important things to do

73
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,185
than satisfy everyone's
idle curiosity?

74
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,728
It's not idle.

75
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,982
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses

76
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,610
whose treatments are contraindicated
is worth discussing.

77
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,490
Abdominal pain increasing
in severity and frequency,

78
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,493
fever, dehydration,
diarrhea, weight loss.

79
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,121
Mom died from kidney failure
caused by type 1 diabetes,

80
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,205
which has been ruled out.

81
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,165
Seventeen doctors.

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,836
Everything's been ruled out, which
means we have to re-rule out.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,424
Get a new history and physical.
Unless that's crazy, boss.

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,762
Been out of the country or
on any recent camping trips?

85
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,349
No camping. But we were in
Montreal back in January.

86
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,144
We went to see the NHL
All-Star Game for my birthday.

87
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,520
Awesome.

88
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,356
Where's Dr. House?

89
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,983
In his office.

90
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,736
He's really more of
a decider than a doer.

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,821
He's decided we
should start over.

92
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,241
You never know what previous
doctors may have missed.

93
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,287
Like this.

94
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,956
Does that hurt more
when I push there?

95
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,332
Not really.

96
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,876
What is it?

97
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,420
I'm not sure.

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,839
Just keep it clean, simple.

99
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,592
We did a test that called into
question our initial diagnosis,

100
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,093
so we changed our mind.

101
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,637
And if they ask how
the test was done?

102
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,890
Why would they do that?
It's a routine lab test.

103
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,393
Routine lab tests don't involve
blood you stole from a corpse

104
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,562
to trick me into giving the
guy the wrong treatment.

105
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,147
Yes, and if you
brought that up,

106
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,751
it'd certainly make
for a lively debate

107
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,151
about the morality
of murdering murderers.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,115
But since you burned the
only evidence of that...

109
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,072
To cover for you, not me.

110
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,991
You're protected. The
decision was a coin flip.

111
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,577
There was no right
or wrong answer.

112
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,582
The body's underground, 8,000 miles away.
Nobody can prove anything.

113
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,293
That room will be filled,
not because of a coin flip,

114
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,130
not because of the patient, but because
House's department screwed up.

115
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,133
They're gonna be like sharks in
a chum-filled swimming pool,

116
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:10,179
and there's no way I'm jumping
in unless I'm in a steel cage.

117
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,264
So what do you want?

118
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,059
I want to know you have
everything covered.

119
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,769
Got what covered?

120
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,439
We're just reviewing
the Dibala case.

121
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,067
Making sure we
didn't miss anything.

122
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,695
We didn't. Except, of course,
the thing that killed him.

123
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,949
He's constipated.

124
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,785
Physical revealed a mass in his
abdomen, so I repeated the X-ray.

125
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,413
Old one was clean, new one shows that his
colon is almost completely impacted.

126
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,291
Obstruction would
explain the pain.

127
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,044
You think they just
screwed up the old X-ray?

128
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,295
Nope.

129
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,633
Hirschsprung's?

130
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,511
It's a congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

131
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,346
Very rare in a child
your son's age.

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,014
Most doctors would
never think of it.

133
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,349
And you came up with this?

134
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,475
It's House's idea.

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,686
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

136
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,356
Let me guess,
it tastes really bad,

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,358
but it's gonna make
me feel a lot better.

138
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,238
Actually, you're not
gonna taste it.

139
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,378
You should try searching for
"Misty May digs for gold."

140
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,922
Make sure you put it in quotes.

141
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,341
I'm making travel plans.

142
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,928
I just need to get away,
have some time to myself.

143
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,514
You getting the hint?

144
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,434
So that's it?

145
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,688
You're done with your little
experiment with Foreman?

146
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,524
It wasn't an experiment,
it was a relationship.

147
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,776
You may wanna look
into the difference.

148
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,698
I'm glad you're better, House.

149
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,869
I actually liked working for
you, but I'm not coming back.

150
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,120
Good.

151
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,372
Because if you came back,

152
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,750
Foreman would try
and save the relationship,

153
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,169
and he'd give up
being the boss.

154
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,672
Are you here to try to save
my relationship with Foreman?

155
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,384
God, no. I'm trying to save
my relationship with Foreman.

156
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,972
Right now, I'm Kobe, playing the game
I love, however the hell I want,

157
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,935
and Phil Jackson has to listen
to everyone else bitch about it.

158
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,436
Enjoy Cabo.

159
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,983
I'm going to Thailand.

160
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,486
Really?

161
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,738
Interesting.

162
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,323
Goodbye, House.

163
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,117
Goodbye, Thirteen.

164
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,873
Last week, yesterday, today.

165
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,999
I can't believe it.

166
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,836
He's pain-free for the first time
in months, he's even hungry.

167
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,255
I'm starving.

168
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,798
We're still waiting
for the biopsy results,

169
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,299
but obviously it's a good sign.

170
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,759
You're gonna
want to take it slow.

171
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,179
Don't try to regain all the
lost weight in one meal.

172
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,140
What's wrong?

173
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,352
The abdomen feels normal,
but looks bigger.

174
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,691
Jack, are you feeling...
Jack? Hey, Jack, you okay?

175
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,653
Right eye is fixed.
Lateral rectus palsy.

176
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,366
He's seizing. Need five
milligrams of diazepam.

177
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,118
What's happening?

178
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,744
Hold down his head
and turn off the lights.

179
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,121
I need to see his optic disk.

180
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,123
Heart rate's elevated.
Come on, hold his head.

181
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,916
I'm trying.
Wait. Where's House?

182
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,209
Mr. Randall, we need
you to step back.

183
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,814
His optic disks are swollen. He's
got intracranial hypertension.

184
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,463
Furosemide, 20 milligrams, IV.

185
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,631
If we could intubate him...

186
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,467
Need five more
milligrams of diazepam.

187
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,512
DC the monitors. Push 500
milligrams of phenytoin.

188
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,597
You can't push that much.
We gotta relieve the pressure,

189
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,724
or his brain can herniate.

190
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,225
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,521
Fifty milligrams
of phenytoin in.

192
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,774
Page Chase. Tell him
to meet us in the OR.

193
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,609
We need your consent.

194
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,986
What's happening to him?

195
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,510
The pressure in
his skull's too high.

196
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,656
If we don't reduce it, it could
irrevocably damage his brain.

197
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,366
But he was just talking.
He was smiling.

198
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,701
We need to drill burr holes.

199
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,994
Drill into his head?

200
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,912
Phenytoin's not working.
Paralyze him.

201
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,247
Three milligrams
of pancuronium.

202
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,665
Then intubate
and hyperventilate.

203
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,209
Where's House?

204
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,670
House isn't here.
Do we have your consent?

205
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,425
Do we have your consent?
Ready? One, two, three.

206
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,722
Injecting three milligrams
of pancuronium.

207
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,148
Look at the monitors. He's still seizing.
We need to do this now.

208
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,276
Go!

209
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,169
Electrical seizure
activity's stopped.

210
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,883
Intracranial pressure's declining.
Come on, keep going.

211
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,968
Pressure's down to eight.

212
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,679
I'll go tell the dad.

213
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,974
What happened?

214
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,352
I have no idea.

215
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,564
He hasn't had
any more seizures,

216
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,236
and cytological examination of the
subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.

217
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,572
Don't usually see brain
damage after a rectal biopsy.

218
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,074
He was fine
after the procedure.

219
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,076
No headaches,
no mental status change.

220
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,327
It wasn't anything we did.

221
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,662
It's not just his brain.

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,416
He's continuing to build up fluid in his
abdominal cavity as well as the dura.

223
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,418
We've inserted shunts
to drain it.

224
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,586
It's got to be some sort
of systemic infection.

225
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,757
Not after spending the last week
getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.

226
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,760
You notice anything odd about the
shape of the fluid collection?

227
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,137
Oh, God.

228
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,014
Virgin Mary!

229
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,185
The edge should be
tapered, lens-shaped.

230
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:59,445
Unless the dural layer was
already separated from the brain

231
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,030
when the fluid
started to build up.

232
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,659
Get a dural biopsy
to confirm brain cancer.

233
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,288
Nice catch.

234
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,544
Bangkok. Flight 799.

235
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,756
Wow, Bangkok. That sounds awesome.
How long?

236
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,341
Not sure yet.

237
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:27,514
Luckily, I have a friend who's staying
at my place taking care of my dog.

238
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,101
He's really big, so he
needs a lot of exercise.

239
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,605
Remy Hadley. H-A-D-L-E-Y.

240
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,857
What, you think
I'm gonna rob the place?

241
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,484
No. Of course not.

242
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,153
In case you haven't
noticed, I have a job.

243
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,654
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know you.

244
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,500
You're either honest or dishonest, I
figured the safer choice is to...

245
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,618
Is to treat a stranger
like an ass.

246
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,412
Nice way to live
your life. Bitch.

247
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,623
I said I'm sorry.

248
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,293
Oh! Hello. I was wondering if there
are any Business Class seats open

249
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,087
that I could use
my miles to upgrade to.

250
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,756
I don't know you,

251
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,092
but I assumed I could trust
you, welcomed you into my car.

252
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,011
Okay, you're a saint.

253
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,015
That's impossible, I confirmed
my reservation last night.

254
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,683
So re-book it.

255
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,188
Well, obviously, it was a
mistake on your end, not mine.

256
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,233
No. I'm on my way
to the airport right now.

257
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,615
They didn't believe you, huh?

258
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,163
Brain cancer?

259
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,123
We should know
for sure by the morning.

260
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,545
Our luck just keeps
getting worse, huh?

261
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,338
Treatment options are
getting better every day.

262
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,216
There's no visible mass, so even
if the biopsy comes back positive,

263
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,425
we've caught it early.

264
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Oh, so, you're telling me
this is good news?

265
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,347
I'm saying we will do
whatever we can.

266
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,224
Right.

267
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,812
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,151
I gotta go. Foreman needs
more help with the M&M prep.

269
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,238
Okay. I'll come up and help
after I finish the biopsy.

270
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,865
We can handle it.
I'll see you at home later.

271
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,534
If you're here,
I might as well be.

272
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,661
Go home. Get some rest.

273
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,622
'Cause I'm gonna be waking you
up as soon as I get home.

274
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,590
Stay out of my life.

275
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,925
Okay.

276
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,677
I know you canceled
my reservation.

277
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,014
You obviously saw me log in when you
were spying on me in the coffee shop.

278
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,432
I was talking to you.

279
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,357
I was spying on the MILF
in the running shorts.

280
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,768
I'm not coming back
on the team.

281
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,978
I don't want you
back on the team.

282
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,732
I cannot work for, with,
or around Foreman.

283
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,526
Which is why I don't want
you back on the team.

284
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,852
Now that you're out of the
picture, he's better than ever,

285
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,743
which is gonna make me
less miserable than ever,

286
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
which is why neither
of us gives a damn

287
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,744
how, when, or on what island in the
Bahamas you wanna get away from it all.

288
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,287
The Bahamas?

289
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,289
Costa Rica?

290
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,957
I told you, Thailand.

291
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,168
I assumed you were lying

292
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,338
because it would have been idiotic
of you to tell me the truth.

293
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,132
Yet another reason
I have no use for you.

294
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,554
We've got a problem.

295
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,556
When Cameron sent
Dibala's blood to the lab,

296
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,517
she specifically asked for the
anticentromere antibodies test.

297
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,810
So?

298
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,272
The printout they sent you included
just the anticentromere antibodies,

299
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,650
but the lab also did
a full blood panel.

300
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,652
So? I'm not an idiot.

301
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,905
I obviously made sure the cadaver I got
the sample from had the same blood type.

302
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,908
You apparently didn't
check his cholesterol.

303
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,535
How far off?

304
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,662
Twenty percent.

305
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,474
Dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

306
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,518
Why would anyone even bother
to compare the two reports?

307
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,144
The same reason I did.

308
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,271
Because they're looking for
anything we might've screwed up.

309
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,940
We could claim the
blood analyzer broke.

310
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,108
We can't.

311
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,152
Cameron documented that it was perfectly
calibrated when she did the test.

312
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,905
So the numbers are off.
It's weird, who cares?

313
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,407
If it comes up,
just act surprised,

314
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,367
like it's some
irrelevant curiosity.

315
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,454
I can't do this. I can't go in
there and stack lie upon lie.

316
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,208
You've got to figure out
a way to explain this.

317
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,627
Hey. Hey.

318
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,879
Missed you this morning.
Yeah, sorry.

319
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,506
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

320
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,911
I thought you did
want to wake me.

321
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,718
At least that's what you said last night.
I'm out of here.

322
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,138
No, no. I got the biopsy results.
It's not cancer.

323
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,562
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

324
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,064
Since when is cancer
being considered nothing?

325
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,025
I just said it's not cancer. The
cell morphologies were all normal.

326
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,777
And so are the most
recent CT scans.

327
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,237
On the other hand,

328
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,365
adenocarcinoma of the
stomach would cause pain,

329
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,578
constipation, and nutritional
deficiencies that could cause seizures.

330
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,788
And wouldn't show on a CT.

331
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,210
You were right about the cancer,
just wrong about the place.

332
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,215
Continue to say
nothing if you agree.

333
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,678
Go scope him, get another
set of biopsies.

334
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,771
I get canceling her ticket,

335
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,065
if you then showed up with two
more to somewhere better.

336
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,231
What are you talking about?

337
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,110
Or showed up at all.

338
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:36,156
But how does just ruining her
plans get her to agree to yours?

339
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,118
You talking about Thirteen?

340
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,495
Where's she going?

341
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,121
Nowhere this week,
thanks to you.

342
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,999
I didn't stop her.
I'm not gonna stop her.

343
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,215
I've already done all I could.
Now all I can do is move on.

344
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,971
I think I actually believe you.

345
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,390
If you're telling the truth,

346
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,601
you're even more
rational than I...

347
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,228
Well, not more.

348
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,023
Then again, more sane.

349
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,236
You're gonna be
a good boss, boss.

350
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,156
I told you,
there's nothing wrong.

351
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,616
There's obviously
something wrong,

352
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,618
and I'm not even saying we need
to talk about it right now.

353
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,162
I just don't see
why you have to deny it.

354
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,664
I'm not.

355
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,999
Now you're denying
you're denying.

356
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,418
No. I'm denying that
there's anything to deny.

357
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,088
Robert, you can't do this.
You can't hide things from me.

358
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,178
There's a problem
with the Dibala M&M.

359
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,350
The HDL numbers on one of his early
blood panels don't match a later panel.

360
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,768
That's weird.

361
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,687
Yeah.

362
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,943
It's no big deal.

363
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,029
Cholesterol didn't have
anything to do with his death,

364
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,532
but after being
let go from Mercy,

365
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,993
and then that thing
with Thirteen's drug trial,

366
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,662
Foreman's paranoid about people
questioning the way he handled the case.

367
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,081
Well, that's ridiculous. If anything,
Foreman should be feeling secure.

368
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,625
He's the one who had the right
diagnosis, we talked him out of it.

369
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,503
I know. Don't tell
him I told you.

370
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,755
He doesn't want to show
any signs of weakness,

371
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,718
especially now that House is claiming
he wants him to stay in charge.

372
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,969
All right.

373
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,139
So it's still cancer.
It's just somewhere else.

374
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,265
That's what we're looking for,

375
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,434
but it would explain
all the symptoms

376
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,728
and all the normal tests
and imaging studies.

377
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,397
Got biopsies of the
mucosa and the submucosa.

378
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,482
I'm moving towards the pylorus.

379
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,650
It's my fault.

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,323
Adenocarcinomas aren't caused by
diet or environmental factors.

381
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:47,454
I inherited a $10 million
pipeline business when I was 24.

382
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,458
By the time I was 30,
it was worth over a billion.

383
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,211
Since then, I have been
involved in over 50 deals

384
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,340
that make that first one
look like a loser.

385
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,345
Everything I do, everything
I touch, turns to gold,

386
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,602
except my family.

387
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,358
First, my wife and now my son.

388
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,198
This is my fault.

389
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,909
It's karma.

390
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,371
That's obviously not true.

391
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,125
He's seizing again.

392
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,460
Get the scope out.

393
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,462
We need five
milligrams diazepam.

394
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,922
How's the ICP?

395
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,507
It's eight.

396
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,384
But the shunt's open and clear.

397
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,427
This isn't
intracranial pressure.

398
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,554
Then what the hell is it?

399
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,357
Seizure's stopped, but he
hasn't regained consciousness.

400
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,735
No sign of any masses in his
stomach or esophageal lining.

401
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,989
And he's still accumulating
subdural and peritoneal fluid.

402
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,951
And every time we look to see where
it's coming from, he starts seizing.

403
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,828
You think
we're setting this off?

404
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:10,996
I think something is.

405
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,791
One of his stomach biopsies shows
an arteriole partially occluded.

406
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,543
But with no abnormality
in the other layers,

407
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,170
and no evidence of a cellular
inflammatory reaction.

408
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,380
It's definitely not cancer.

409
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,340
Then it has to be
some sort of infection.

410
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,009
We already ruled out infection.

411
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,720
Only because he was treated
for it and got worse.

412
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,887
Seems like a sound reason.

413
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,348
Unless it's a
drug-resistant strain.

414
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,726
Drug-resistant strain of what?

415
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,186
Bacterial cultures,
viral serologies,

416
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,563
ANA and ANCA were all negative.

417
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,024
Everything's negative.
We obviously missed something.

418
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,110
Maybe the seizures aren't a new
symptom, they're an old one.

419
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,862
No doctor noticed
a thrashing kid?

420
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,572
Abdominal epilepsy.

421
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,034
The seizures would just look like pain
until it spread to his motor cortex.

422
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,368
Wouldn't explain the fevers.

423
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,412
Protein malnutrition
can cause fevers.

424
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,707
And nothing causes malnutrition
like excruciating stomach pain

425
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,293
that gets worse
every time you eat.

426
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,758
I'd be a lot more certain if it was
my idea, but it's the best we got.

427
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,509
Start him on gabapentin,

428
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,388
hook him up to an intracranial
EEG for continuous monitoring.

429
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,400
I gave him statins.

430
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,568
What?

431
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,071
If they ask about the cholesterol,
just say I prescribed a statin

432
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,238
and forgot to put it
in the chart.

433
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,782
You want to solve
a problem in the records

434
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,076
by creating another
problem in the records?

435
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,202
There's no problem
with the records,

436
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,995
there's a problem
with my recordkeeping.

437
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,914
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

438
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,458
How did you get
access to the statins?

439
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,585
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy to confess

440
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,088
to yet another
recordkeeping problem?

441
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,757
I saw an open cart.
I just took it.

442
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,426
Why would you steal a drug you
can just as easily ask for?

443
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:51,513
'Cause I'm trying
to get you off the hook.

444
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,182
A story that raises more
questions than it answers

445
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,102
only puts the hook
deeper down my throat.

446
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,853
It's all right. I'll handle it.

447
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,355
How?

448
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,440
By telling the truth.

449
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,109
The truth is,
I don't have the time,

450
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,152
I'm not in the mood,
and I don't see the point.

451
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,696
You don't want to do the M&M
because you're not in the mood?

452
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,781
This kid is dying,

453
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,506
and I've got House trying to push
all his responsibilities onto me.

454
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,120
They're not his responsibilities,
they're yours.

455
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,454
You're the one who
wanted to be in charge.

456
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,957
I wanted to be in charge,
not a figurehead.

457
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,000
Then do the M&M,
it's all yours.

458
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,961
You want me to get
flogged? For what?

459
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,504
So you can have
an academic debate

460
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,258
about a diagnostic dilemma no
one's ever gonna face again?

461
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,803
What the hell's going on here?

462
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,180
I just don't want
to do the M&M.

463
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,561
Did it work?

464
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,812
Not even close.

465
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
Everything okay?

466
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,499
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

467
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,750
Thirteen called.

468
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,837
She have a theory that makes more
sense than abdominal epilepsy?

469
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,423
She said someone hacked
into her e-mail account

470
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,176
and canceled her
airline reservation.

471
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,552
I'm guessing Foreman.

472
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,678
Really?

473
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,265
You're accusing Foreman,
not me. Cool.

474
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,061
You really want Foreman to
stay in charge of the team?

475
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,730
Makes sense.

476
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,482
He loves power, I love puzzles.

477
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,611
You love power and puzzles.

478
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,404
True.

479
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,866
And when I had them both...

480
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,789
It wasn't Foreman.

481
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,875
How do you know?

482
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,294
He said he's moved on.

483
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,254
And you believe him?

484
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,381
I believe that he believes him.

485
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,141
Looks like it's time for
me to get off the bench.

486
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,233
What's up?

487
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,610
Are you Dr. House?

488
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,403
I understand you're a big fan.

489
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,656
I'll have my guy send
over a signed glossy.

490
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,743
Continuous EEG shows no interictal spikes.
It's not abdominal epilepsy.

491
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,411
You paged me to tell
me what it's not?

492
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,164
I paged you to show you this.

493
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,836
That, I did not expect.

494
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,256
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

495
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,967
Darn it. I knew
I should've stayed outside.

496
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,802
The fantasy is always much
better than the reality.

497
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,887
You think this is a joke?
That's my son.

498
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:42,475
He's dying, and not one of you seem
to have the slightest clue why.

499
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,728
I know. That's why
it's so interesting.

500
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,360
Fever, stomach pain, seizures,

501
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,281
peritoneal and subdural fluid
collection and now spots.

502
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,408
Could be an allergic
reaction to one of his meds.

503
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,286
That suddenly developed eight
hours after he started the meds?

504
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,663
If it's not cancer or infection,
it has to be autoimmune.

505
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,207
Systemic lupus complicated
by a CNS vasculitis

506
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,960
would explain the rash,
fever, ascites...

507
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,879
CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff
neck along with the headache.

508
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,757
And would've showed up
on the dural biopsy.

509
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,928
What about polyarteritis nodosa?
It can occur in kids.

510
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,723
Except you can't have arteritis
without inflammation.

511
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,559
Okay, you come up
with something better.

512
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,104
Go on.

513
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,064
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy.

514
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,067
Plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

515
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,610
It's barely elevated,

516
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,215
which you'd expect given the number
of procedures he's undergone.

517
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,907
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

518
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,204
Not my decision.

519
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,666
But if it was, I'd say
start him on prednisone

520
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,752
and get a testicular biopsy.

521
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,526
If he's gonna have any real
inflammation, it'll be down there.

522
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,630
Cameron and I will do it.

523
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,799
Why? It was Chase's idea.

524
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,552
Kid's father is not gonna be happy
about a fourth set of biopsies,

525
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,096
and you've got
a better rapport.

526
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,474
What's really going on here?

527
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,143
You need Chase to help you
over-prep for the M&M?

528
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,353
Yes.

529
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,606
Then say so, don't be a child.

530
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,526
Is it on his penis?

531
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,446
The kid's rash?

532
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,906
Yeah, why?

533
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,368
Means it's most likely affecting
the small blood vessels.

534
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:27,163
That's why we didn't see any
inflammation on the biopsies.

535
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,667
It's not polyarteritis,
it's Degos disease.

536
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,385
I'll do it.

537
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,776
Your son has Degos disease.

538
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,071
It causes micro-blood
vessels in the brain,

539
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,950
skin, and GI tract to
break down, clot off.

540
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:11,582
It sometimes manifests early on
with atrophic papules on the penis.

541
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,129
In your son's case, we don't know
why, but they came much later.

542
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,049
What's the treatment?

543
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,011
There isn't one.

544
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,013
It's incurable.

545
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,938
You're wrong.

546
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,109
You've already been
wrong a bunch of times.

547
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,821
We rechecked the biopsies.
It's definitely Degos.

548
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,704
I'm sorry. I wish there was
something we could do.

549
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,712
How long?

550
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,631
Not much longer.

551
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,719
What does that mean?

552
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,555
A day at the most.

553
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,643
All right. Great.

554
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,353
We need to talk.

555
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,271
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

556
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,106
It's about Dibala.

557
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,025
Let me rephrase,
unless it's a current...

558
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,778
Foreman can't present
the case at the M&M.

559
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,199
I know you guys are busy, but he's just
gonna have to suck it up and make the time.

560
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,242
It's not the time.

561
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,826
Then what is it?

562
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,704
The anticentromere
antibodies test,

563
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,665
the test that caused us
to change the treatment

564
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:20,962
from blastomycosis
to scleroderma, it wasn't...

565
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,297
It wasn't what?

566
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,218
Dr. Cuddy, they need you
in the Pediatric ICU.

567
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,803
Who's they? I don't know,

568
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,138
but I think they're lawyers.

569
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,686
If you guys screwed something
up, just come clean.

570
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,939
It's not gonna be that bad.

571
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,278
With all due respect, you don't
know what's at stake here.

572
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,196
What's going on?
You need to stop him.

573
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,402
He's about to ruin his life.

574
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,865
Like you give a damn
about my life.

575
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,117
Roy, he's right.

576
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,245
You're borrowing money to buy options
that are already out of the money.

577
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,163
Even you won't be able
to cover the losses.

578
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,625
Your house, cars, bank accounts,
you'll lose everything.

579
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,377
That's the point.

580
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,924
The billionaire thinks that the gods
will treat him better if he's broke.

581
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,259
I suggested he give it to me...

582
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,636
There has got to be
some sort of balance.

583
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,889
You can't have all the good fortune
in just one area of your life.

584
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,851
That's not how the world's
supposed to work.

585
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,394
Who said the world
was supposed to work?

586
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,998
Don't just
wipe everything out.

587
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,981
Put your assets in a trust,

588
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,608
give it to a charity...
I can't get anything back.

589
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,901
He's insane. He's irrational,

590
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,113
so are most people. Unfortunately,
it doesn't make them insane.

591
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,950
If he signs that paper, he's not
only gonna destroy his own life,

592
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:36,412
but the lives of thousands of people who
rely on this company to make a living.

593
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,256
If he is insane,
we will sue this hospital...

594
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,207
Mr. Randall,

595
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,630
I know you're upset, but you shouldn't
make a decision like this right now.

596
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,381
Give it some time.

597
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,426
My son doesn't have any time.

598
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,888
Your son's dying from an incurable
disease, not bad karma.

599
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,891
No. He's not dying.

600
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,019
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

601
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,228
Roy.

602
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,648
Please.

603
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,696
I'm sorry. I can't let him die.

604
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,823
People don't get
what they deserve.

605
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:17,495
They just get what they get, and there's
nothing any of us can do about it.

606
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:30,049
Deliver it, or I'll make sure you
end up the ones with nothing.

607
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,688
Call a code. He's flat-lining.

608
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,331
Thanks.

609
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,000
You're welcome. For what?

610
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,921
For thinking I was worth
breaking the law to keep around.

611
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,715
That's just the way I am.

612
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,550
But still don't know
what you're talking about.

613
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:17,346
Cuddy had IT trace all the IP addresses
who've logged into my e-mail account.

614
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,766
There were two. Mine and yours.

615
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,854
Obviously House decided he needs
you more than he's willing to...

616
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,480
I already asked House.

617
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,774
And he'd certainly never lie.

618
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,278
No, he'd lie.
Except he wants me gone.

619
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:36,240
And he'd do a lot better job
of lying than you just did.

620
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,784
Really? It was that bad?

621
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,536
No, actually.

622
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:47,626
But it doesn't matter any more. Why?
Because of House or Foreman?

623
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,631
You're good for both of them, but
Foreman's not my best friend.

624
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,508
House will be fine.

625
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,135
Maybe.

626
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,512
But with you on the
team, he'd be better.

627
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:03,267
He needs someone
who doesn't need him.

628
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,897
You're the only one he's never really been
able to suck into his crazy House vortex.

629
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,816
Keeps him grounded,
his ego in check.

630
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,359
Why didn't you just come to me?

631
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:20,618
I figured you'd only stay if House asked.
And I knew he would, eventually.

632
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,706
Bye, Wilson.

633
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,836
This is a great job.

634
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,632
Maybe even better, now that
House is at least trying

635
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,176
to have real relationships
with people.

636
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,470
I said trying.

637
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,180
It doesn't matter.

638
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,557
The job you love
doesn't matter?

639
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,770
Don't throw it all away just
because of a bad breakup.

640
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,274
Bye, Wilson.

641
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,703
I just confessed.

642
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,749
I told Thirteen I was the one
who canceled the plane ticket.

643
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:09,834
Why?

644
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,169
You mean why did I confess,
or why did I do it?

645
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:15,506
I know you didn't do it,
so I guess the first.

646
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:20,469
You want her to stay because you want
her back, or because Foreman does?

647
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,763
Why would I care
what Foreman wants?

648
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,599
Because you're not as big a
jerk as everyone thinks.

649
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,684
Yes, I am.

650
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,102
No, you're not.

651
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,565
I just made a $10,000 short sale
on a stock I know is gonna crash

652
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:36,277
because of what I saw a grief-stricken
dad do on his son's deathbed.

653
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,653
No, you didn't.

654
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,779
Yes, I did.

655
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,574
You are a jerk.

656
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,535
She's making a mistake.

657
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,911
So you did it for her?

658
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,496
She's a good doctor.

659
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,456
So you did it for you?

660
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm not the one
in charge any more.

661
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,586
So you did it for Foreman?

662
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,381
She's a smoking-hot,
newly-single bisexual.

663
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,217
Why don't you just admit that
you like having her around?

664
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,927
She's good for you.
You need her.

665
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:05,639
Because I was born with a
heart three sizes too small.

666
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,392
No, you weren't. Yes, I...

667
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,812
What?

668
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,787
He still alive?

669
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,039
Yeah.

670
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,043
Good. Start him on heparin
and IV immunoglobulin.

671
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,711
For Degos? The cardiac arrest

672
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,464
wasn't just an "everything goes
to hell in a hand basket" arrest.

673
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,050
It was a coronary event.
Coronaries are large vessels.

674
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,760
Means it can't be Degos.

675
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,004
But the biopsies confirmed...

676
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,721
Obstructed blood vessels.

677
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,307
They can't be obstructed
because of Degos.

678
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,352
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

679
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,230
Are you sure? Nope.

680
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,027
But I will be if he responds to
the heparin and immunoglobulin.

681
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,951
By the way,

682
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,119
someone screwed
over your girlfriend,

683
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,706
and she ran to me, Cuddy, and
Wilson, everyone but you.

684
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,543
She's not over you.

685
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,629
Or she is.

686
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,576
Where did you find it?

687
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,744
Find what?

688
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,665
Niacin-bound
chromium supplements.

689
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,502
It was right on top of the file.
You don't know about it?

690
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,587
No, been here all night.

691
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,508
One of Dibala's previous docs was
prescribing ultra-high doses

692
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,261
of niacin-bound
chromium to boost his HDL.

693
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,512
So?

694
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,597
So, it gives us
something to point to.

695
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,475
We can explain the wide variation
between the HDL numbers.

696
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,228
We're safe. We're covered.

697
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,274
You really didn't
request the info?

698
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,693
No.

699
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,112
And obviously
you didn't either,

700
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,157
which means...

701
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,651
It worked.

702
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,987
The medicine worked.

703
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,573
It worked.

704
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,840
How did you find it?

705
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,345
Fat, old, black guy.

706
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,557
I knew he had to be taking
something for his cholesterol.

707
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,142
And what now?

708
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,853
I'm not the boss.

709
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,688
You don't think
I should be fired?

710
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,940
Why?

711
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,693
I doubt we'll ever be treating
a genocidal dictator again.

712
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,863
Better a murder
than a misdiagnosis.

713
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,995
Whether you want to be
in charge or not,

714
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,123
you are.

715
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,042
And you always will be.

716
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,813
75-year-old African
man presented to our hospital

717
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,691
following a rapid
onset of hemoptysis.

718
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,860
He had been fine
prior to onset.

719
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,155
No chest pain, fever,
coughing or chills.

720
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,867
He does note a
nine-hour plane flight...
