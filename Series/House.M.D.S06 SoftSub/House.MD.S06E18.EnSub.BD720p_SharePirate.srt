1
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,112
Who is it?

2
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,238
It's Tom.

3
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,825
Tom, your husband?

4
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,244
What's he doing here?

5
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,003
Uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,296
I'm sorry. I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

7
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,258
But Evelyn's school
contract is due tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,844
I knew I was forgetting something.
Let me find a pen.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,974
Hey.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,100
Hey.

11
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,785
Not quite sure what
Emily Post recommends

12
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,854
in this situation, but I'm Tom.

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,148
Damien. Hi.

14
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,486
Sorry to intrude, I just... I wasn't
quite sure when she'd be coming home.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,653
No problem.

16
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,572
Thank you so much
for catching this.

17
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,906
Yeah.

18
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,285
I'll get out of your way.
It was good to meet you,

19
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,870
and I'll see you later, hon.

20
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,163
Bye.

21
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,923
So, he seems like a nice guy.

22
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,843
Ooh.

23
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,013
Jules, you okay?

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,181
No, my stomach...

25
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,682
Here, lie down.

26
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,187
Ow!

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,688
Try to...

28
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,231
Get Tom. Okay.

29
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,025
Ow!

30
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,193
Tom!

31
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,438
You know what would be perfect?

32
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,481
Hmm.

33
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,483
French Toast Tower.

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,236
You still go to Mickey's?
What's your cholesterol?

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,696
It's my one vice.
I'm keeping it.

36
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,741
As much as I would love
to clog my arteries,

37
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:44,121
I have a 10:00 CT, and I still
have to race home, get changed.

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,918
Maybe you could keep
some clothes here.

39
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,088
Maybe I could.

40
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,884
He's just trying to
get into your skirts,

41
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,303
and I don't mean
metaphorically.

42
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,014
Well, he's got the legs for it.

43
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,019
So, I will see you tonight?

44
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,437
Yeah.

45
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,778
Bye, House.

46
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,113
Have a nice day.

47
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,911
"Have a nice day"?
How civilized.

48
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,205
I said I'd stay out of it.

49
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,044
What? Nothing.

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,462
Clearly something.

51
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,630
Nope.

52
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,257
House, on a list
of your attributes,

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,260
there's nothing that
even rhymes with "coy."

54
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,431
Okay, I may have seen
something in the fridge.

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,641
Like the end of
your relationship.

56
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,104
She put the milk in the
door and not on the shelf.

57
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,564
It's not a big deal.

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,849
You hate that she did that,
but you didn't say anything.

59
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,735
You're trying to
get us to fight.

60
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,946
No, I'm trying to help. If you
got an issue, let her know.

61
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,450
I should've known that you
weren't done sabotaging this.

62
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,286
Fine. Stew in your irritation.

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,039
Sure, last time it bubbled
over into resentment and rage,

64
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,832
leading ultimately
to a painful divorce

65
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,252
that neither of you have
ever really recovered from,

66
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,213
but I'm sure this time,
it'll be great.

67
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,769
Interesting case,
35-year-old woman

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,145
with fever and abdominal pain.

69
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,481
ER ruled out all
the usual suspects.

70
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,566
Stop before you
interest me to death.

71
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,735
And she's in an open marriage.

72
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,905
That's not interesting.
It's just weird.

73
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,073
Know what's weirder?

74
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,117
That other humans are
monogamous in the first place.

75
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,620
No other species on the
planet mates for life,

76
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,121
and if you're
gonna bring up swans,

77
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,581
they cheat like everybody else.

78
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,583
They just have better
PR than rabbits.

79
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,503
Animals also eat their young
and kill their rivals.

80
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,421
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

81
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,256
Says the guy
whose opposable thumbs

82
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,926
have been all over how many
women who aren't his wife?

83
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,303
A functional open marriage
is like a unicorn.

84
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,972
It's a mythical creature
that doesn't exist.

85
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,431
Someone always ends up unhappy.

86
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:11,811
Our patient's unhappy because she's
suffering from an intestinal blockage.

87
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,981
Boring. Now, I'm gonna have to
find a reason to rule it out.

88
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,816
What about herpes colitis?

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,026
She picks up the infection
from one of her partners.

90
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,192
It takes root in her colon.

91
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,278
STD panel was clean.

92
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,322
Chances are this couple was
unhappy in the first place.

93
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,492
This is their attempt to
save something that never...

94
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,998
Go on.

95
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,251
Herpes might not register if she
was exposed in the last six weeks.

96
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,715
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

97
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,342
Wait. You're going to do it?

98
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:47,972
Gotta see if our patient is a
unicorn or just a slutty horse.

99
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,475
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,937
Barium coats the inner
lining of your colon,

101
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,024
lets us get a good
look at it on the X-ray.

102
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,525
I can get somebody else
to pick up Evelyn.

103
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,360
I feel like I'm abandoning you.

104
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,029
I'm on painkillers.

105
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,363
I'd rather this not be
what you think of

106
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,783
every time you look at my butt.

107
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
Okay, roll onto your side.

108
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,919
It's fill 'er up time.

109
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,220
So, is Evelyn his new squeeze?

110
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,555
She's our daughter.

111
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,933
Must be interesting, growing up
in a production of Oh! Calcutta!

112
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,769
She's six.

113
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,563
She knows as much about our sex
life as any other kid her age.

114
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,900
You can explain
that she's the reason

115
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,184
the two of you stayed married.

116
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,236
You've been in the room
five minutes.

117
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,363
You got us all figured out.

118
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,449
Of course, you left out the
part where we love each other,

119
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,493
and we wanna grow old together.

120
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,994
But you just don't
wanna be young together.

121
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,954
Look, when you think about it,

122
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,915
tons of couples do what we do.

123
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,124
It's just that
with most of them,

124
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,877
one spouse doesn't
know about it.

125
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,253
We decided things work better

126
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,256
when people tell
each other the truth.

127
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,511
Tank's full.

128
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,264
I'll page the radiology elves.

129
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm not saying I hate it. It
just doesn't go with your eyes.

130
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,897
You hate it.

131
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,232
Little bit.

132
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,568
Any more heartless critiques
of my general appearance?

133
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,028
Nope. All done.

134
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,326
So, is she
as bendy as she looks?

135
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,703
Maya and I are just friends.

136
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,288
No, you and I are friends.

137
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,453
And you don't have coffee
with me three times a week.

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,501
She's an interesting person.

139
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,586
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

140
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,422
Fascinating. Last week that
Cambodian lab tech was telling us

141
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,341
how he survived
the Killing Fields,

142
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,218
and you left to go get a donut.

143
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,845
So we flirt. It's fun.

144
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,138
It's dangerous.

145
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,056
That woman would
totally do you.

146
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,891
You think?

147
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,143
Nothing is gonna happen.

148
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,068
All I'm saying is, if you
want to be on a diet,

149
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,107
you might want to stop hanging
out by the dessert cart.

150
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,319
X-ray was clean. She doesn't
have herpes colitis.

151
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,654
Or abdominal pain.

152
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,573
It stopped hurting
during the X-ray,

153
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,741
which means it was just an
intestinal blockage that passed.

154
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,826
We should discharge her.

155
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,329
Absolutely, there's no need
to find any underlying cause.

156
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,957
These things
never happen twice.

157
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,168
Take her digestive system
for a test drive.

158
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,003
Give her
a radio-opaque milkshake.

159
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,688
X-ray every 15 minutes
to see if it makes

160
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,007
any unscheduled stops
on the way through.

161
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,216
We'll be here all night.

162
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,510
No, Taub will
be here all night.

163
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,097
Go talk to the unicorn, then
tell me you don't believe.

164
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,600
I did an abdominal CT
on a kid today,

165
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,478
and found a six-inch bezoar
made entirely of gum.

166
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,566
I mean, who gives a three-year-old
an endless supply of gum...

167
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,197
You okay?

168
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,281
Yeah.

169
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,786
I mean, there was hair in it
and maybe a piece of paper.

170
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,210
So, how long have
you been married?

171
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,839
One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.

172
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,717
Nobody ever asks me about
current events or the weather.

173
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,386
The Yankees look
good this season.

174
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,558
Seven years.

175
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:24,480
And how long have you,
you know...

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,274
After three years, we realized

177
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,236
that traditional marriage
was making us both miserable.

178
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,031
Most people get divorced
at that point.

179
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,115
Yeah, we didn't want
to get divorced.

180
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,408
We still loved each other.

181
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,995
We just realized that
expecting one person

182
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,665
to fulfill all of your needs
forever is unrealistic.

183
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,252
There are happy monogamous
couples out there.

184
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,879
Sure, one or two have
the perfect marriage.

185
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,383
Everybody else has figured
out how to settle for less.

186
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,762
I don't want to settle and
end up resenting my husband.

187
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,932
I'd rather get the 10% he
doesn't give me somewhere else

188
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:05,187
so that I can really appreciate
him for the 90% he does.

189
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,860
I think something's wrong.

190
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,445
With your stomach?
My heart is racing.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,580
Try to take deep breaths. I'm gonna
try to slow your heart down.

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,250
Is this because
of the blockage?

193
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,626
No. It's not working.

194
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,005
Need a crash cart in here!

195
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,931
I need a list of all your sexual
partners from the last six months.

196
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,099
Why?

197
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,392
Your wife had an arrhythmia.

198
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,644
The progression of symptoms
from bowel to heart

199
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,646
makes a parasitic
infection most likely.

200
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,648
Since Julia hasn't been
out of the country...

201
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,816
The only place that
I've been recently

202
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,484
is a business trip to Nebraska.

203
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,570
But either of you could
have picked up a bug

204
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,196
from one of your partners.

205
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,618
It's kind of complicated.

206
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,080
How many partners are we talking about?
Ballpark.

207
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,833
None.

208
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,251
None?

209
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:13,255
We have a great sex life.
I don't need anyone else.

210
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,215
So why not just tell her that

211
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,675
and close this whole thing up?

212
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,843
You married?

213
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,220
I was.

214
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,848
Did you ever agree to go see
a chick flick with your wife

215
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,767
or pretend to
enjoy classical music?

216
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,812
Stravinsky never groped my
wife in a Midtown hotel room.

217
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,106
She needs this.

218
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,818
I don't, but I don't want
her to feel bad about that.

219
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,281
He's lying.

220
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,699
Guy's got a license to drill.

221
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,701
Why would he lie
about not using it?

222
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,869
That's not the lie.

223
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,705
The lie is that he gives a
crap how his wife feels.

224
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,791
If they're both screwing
around, that's one thing.

225
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,918
But she has a piece on the
side, and he doesn't?

226
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,419
The only way he'd
be okay with that

227
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,546
is if he's betraying her
in some other way.

228
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,423
Then in his mind,
it makes them even.

229
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,884
My unicorn isn't a unicorn.

230
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,261
It's a donkey with a
plunger stuck to its face.

231
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,305
Right, even a guy
who's not cheating

232
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,307
is doing it for
underhanded reasons.

233
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,975
No, no, no,
he's not being cynical.

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,853
He's assuming the husband is doing
something to even the score.

235
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,564
Which means he thinks
there is a score.

236
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,650
Which means,
cheating swans aside,

237
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,735
House believes in monogamy.

238
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,737
He's being romantic.

239
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,366
What I believe is that men are
genetically engineered to be jealous.

240
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,285
Doesn't matter if I think there's a score.
I guarantee you he does.

241
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,829
Any of the wife's
partners pan out?

242
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,124
She's been with two people other
than Tom in the last six months.

243
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,288
Neither of them have been
outside the Tri-State area.

244
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,585
So we're back to the husband.

245
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,711
You just said you
believed he wasn't...

246
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,797
He's doing something
behind her back.

247
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,675
What better cover than a
business trip to Nebraska?

248
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,718
Like that's really a place.

249
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,431
Let's find his travel records
and get back to work.

250
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,436
You seem pretty mellow
about this couple's deal.

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,147
Thought you'd be first in
line to shake a finger.

252
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,191
They're still married. I'm not.

253
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,277
Not that I could ever do it.

254
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,238
I was jealous of House, and
Cameron never touched him.

255
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,032
Not counting the
emotional fondling.

256
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,787
When my mom was dying,
my dad had an affair.

257
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,790
He told you this?

258
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,126
I'd seen them
get out of his car.

259
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,890
Two years after Mom died,
they got married.

260
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,629
Must've sucked.

261
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,631
At the time, yeah,

262
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,260
but looking back,
it makes sense.

263
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,553
My mom never knew about it,

264
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,972
and he needed someone
to make him feel less alone.

265
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,641
He took care of my mom,
day in and day out,

266
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,477
for two and a half years
before she died.

267
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,772
He was devoted to her. Loving
someone else didn't change that.

268
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,150
So loving two people
at once is fine

269
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,651
as long as
one of them is dying?

270
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,737
Whoever's taking care
of me when I get sick,

271
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,407
I hope they've got someone
else to take care of them.

272
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,536
Tom was telling the truth.

273
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,747
He really did go to Nebraska.

274
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,500
Plane ticket and
restaurant receipts.

275
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,418
Forget Nebraska.

276
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,423
Maybe they just bought their
parasites at the mall.

277
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,427
You know, we should really
throw away that loofah.

278
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,346
They're imported. Sometimes
they're not sterilized.

279
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,556
We think our patient got
amoebiasis from hers.

280
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,642
She going to be okay?

281
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,352
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

282
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,190
It's actually kind of bizarre.

283
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,568
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

284
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,323
They sleep with other people?

285
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,618
Well, she does. Her husband's
totally fine with it.

286
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,744
That's crazy, right?

287
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,584
And you're bringing
this up because...

288
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,715
I thought it was interesting.

289
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,968
More interesting than your
other cases, I guess.

290
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,847
You talk about your colleagues.
You rant about House.

291
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,600
You don't usually
mention your patients.

292
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,731
Is open marriage
something you want?

293
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,067
No. I mean...

294
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,197
I know you'd never...

295
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,079
All this time and
energy you spent

296
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,582
convincing me
you weren't cheating.

297
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,791
And there's somebody else.

298
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm not... Would you like
some more water, sir?

299
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,807
Okay.

300
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,605
There's a woman at work. People
say she's attracted to me.

301
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,107
But nothing's happened.
Nothing's going to happen.

302
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,692
I'm not having an affair.

303
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,277
But you want to.

304
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,281
No, honey,
I'm trying to be honest.

305
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,451
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

306
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,328
Be honest then.

307
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,872
Are you attracted to her?

308
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:06,798
Look, she's attractive.
There's an attraction.

309
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,593
Aren't there men who
make you feel that way?

310
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,927
Of course, there are.

311
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:15,182
But it never occurs to me to act
on it, because I'm married.

312
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,435
To you.

313
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,647
And that's enough for me.

314
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,856
Aren't I enough for you?

315
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,691
Of course, you are.

316
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,156
Our patient's lost
all movement in her legs.

317
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,660
There are other doctors,
Chris. We're talking.

318
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,581
I'm sorry.
The woman's paralyzed.

319
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,542
I'll get a cab.

320
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,975
Tests show
no spinal cord injury,

321
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,061
no cerebral lesions,
no hemorrhage.

322
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,438
We finally got a stool sample.
The loofah's innocent.

323
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,191
No sign of amoebas
or any other parasite.

324
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,112
So paralysis, arrhythmia,
intermittent abdominal pain.

325
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,323
And he nicked himself shaving.

326
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,496
Sorry, that was Taub. But
it was easier to solve.

327
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,707
Means he used the crappy
razor in his locker,

328
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,083
which means he slept here.

329
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,251
Thanks to you.

330
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,589
I brought up open marriage
with Rachel.

331
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,841
It was a disaster.

332
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,681
On the medical front, we've knocked
out sex and foreign travel.

333
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,766
Could be
an electrolyte imbalance.

334
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,476
So the only time
you're not interested

335
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,769
in my marriage is
after you blow it up?

336
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,647
You were the moron who took
marital advice from Tila Tequila.

337
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,274
You pushed me into this.

338
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,818
Figured it would either blow up your
marriage or make it more honest.

339
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,361
Either way, you win.

340
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,280
What about sex?

341
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,406
I'm talking about the patient.

342
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,611
Is that cool with everybody?

343
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,700
We ruled out sex.

344
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,994
We ruled out sex
with other people.

345
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,788
Tom said he and Julia have been doing
it three or four times a week.

346
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,707
And she's got boys on the side.

347
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,210
Increased libido can be a symptom
of adrenocortical carcinoma,

348
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,171
which also explains
her other symptoms.

349
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,507
A woman who likes sex
must be sick?

350
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,050
Just because
everybody in this room

351
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,888
wishes that all women were horny
all the time doesn't make it so.

352
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,932
Get an MRI of
her adrenal glands.

353
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,734
Hi.

354
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,653
Okay if I take the sports page?

355
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,113
Sure.

356
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,747
Would you mind using a coaster?

357
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,625
Oh. Sure. Sorry.

358
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,834
It's okay.

359
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,801
Also, it'd be great
if you'd replace

360
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,511
the toilet paper
when you finish a roll.

361
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,179
And when you load
the dishwasher,

362
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,640
you can't put a big,
flat bowl on the bottom.

363
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,185
It traps the water so nothing
on the top gets clean.

364
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,604
And please don't throw banana
peels in the bedroom trash...

365
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,024
I haven't done
any of those things.

366
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,734
You're probably
not even aware...

367
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,985
I hate bananas.

368
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:23,036
Oh, my God. It was House.

369
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,331
I'm sorry. He's been
trying to get us to fight.

370
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,625
Why would he think that
stuff would make us fight?

371
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,629
Because of the milk.
You put it in the door.

372
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,549
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

373
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,842
The temperature in
the door fluctuates,

374
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,047
which decreases shelf life...

375
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,972
Wow. When did you get all OCD?

376
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,432
I just want clean dishes
and unspoiled milk

377
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,642
so we can all stay healthy.

378
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,436
Oh. It's about health?

379
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:53,024
What about the coaster? Does that
replenish my B12 or something?

380
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,192
Can we just drop it?

381
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,360
Sure.

382
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,412
You have this
list of annoyances

383
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,747
the entire time
we were married?

384
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,793
Get better, Mommy.

385
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,670
I love you, rabbit.

386
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,008
Julia, you have a guest.

387
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,806
Hi. This isn't a good time.

388
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,019
Dr. Hadley, did you say there was
a video game in the playroom?

389
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,938
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them?

390
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,356
See you in Radiology.

391
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,405
Get out of my wife's room.

392
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,449
Your relationship with her
stays out of our space.

393
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,658
I was worried about her.

394
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,161
Tom's right. You should go.

395
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,414
So it's fine if we have sex,

396
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,999
but if I drop by
to see if you're okay...

397
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,418
This is our family.

398
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,258
Sorry.

399
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,184
I spent two years of residency

400
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
wearing shirts that
were a size too small.

401
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,189
How hard is it to ask me not
to put them in the dryer?

402
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,566
And I only did your laundry
because you were never home.

403
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:17,734
I didn't ask you to.

404
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,277
Of course you didn't.
You just got annoyed

405
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,071
whenever you didn't
have clean underwear.

406
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,238
I never said I was annoyed.

407
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,950
That's the point.
You didn't say anything.

408
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,993
So I'm getting a lecture
on communication

409
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,246
from someone who had her lawyer
inform me our marriage was over.

410
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,878
Asking for an open marriage.
You got stones.

411
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:41,383
Conversation sort of got away from me.
It was a train wreck.

412
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,867
I think it's good
you brought it up.

413
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,136
I read a study that found men
who have multiple copies

414
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,554
of a certain
vasopressin receptor

415
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,140
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

416
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,351
Maybe you're just
one of those guys.

417
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,480
So my cheating is biologically
predetermined. Fantastic.

418
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,983
Multiply times five. We need a
better look at the medulla.

419
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,192
I thought you'd be relieved.

420
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,117
This gets you off the hook.
It's just genetics.

421
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,571
"I'm 5'6" and have
a receding hairline.

422
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,032
I hate genetics.
Medulla's clean.

423
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,837
I don't see you wearing
lifts or hair plugs.

424
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,911
That's because being short and
bald doesn't hurt anybody.

425
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,664
The only thing hurtful about your
other genetic predisposition

426
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,290
is that you keep denying it.

427
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,668
It's not good
for you or Rachel.

428
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,588
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

429
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,215
And maybe you're
right about me,

430
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,579
but I'm not going
to stop trying.

431
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,759
Rachel's worth it.

432
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,805
Look up there. The lung.
What is that?

433
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,641
You served me
with divorce papers

434
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,806
in the middle of a medical
conference in New Orleans!

435
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,687
I threw a bottle
into an antique mirror.

436
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,481
You exhibited an emotion. I wish
I'd known you were capable.

437
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,607
I loved you.

438
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,860
I thought I was gonna be following
you to Baltimore, remember?

439
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,279
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

440
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,031
How could you think that we
still had a real marriage?

441
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,866
We hadn't had
a conversation in months.

442
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,035
Maybe because I was working
two jobs to support us.

443
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,245
No! No, it's because
when you were home,

444
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,830
it was like talking
to a block of ice.

445
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
You were obviously
so pissed off at me...

446
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,591
I was killing myself so that you could
take that non-paying internship.

447
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,711
That you said
that I should take.

448
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,795
I was trying to be supportive!

449
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Why do I have to
be the bad guy?

450
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,382
Expressing yourself does
not make you the bad guy.

451
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,594
Okay, then, you were
being a selfish bitch.

452
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,515
V/Q scan confirmed the spot
on Julia's lung was a clot.

453
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,351
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

454
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,813
If he has a secret, I highly doubt
it's more relevant than the clot.

455
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,578
Clotting disorder
would explain everything.

456
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,901
Question is, which one?

457
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,071
Do you read any of
your departmental memos?

458
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,073
Only the ones labeled NSFW.

459
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,868
Accounting notified you two days ago
about your patient's insurance.

460
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,953
Sorry. That's N NSFW.

461
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,083
Here. He doesn't have any.
Try not to bankrupt them.

462
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,753
I'm long past the number of
procedures that'll bankrupt them.

463
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,255
Julia's got insurance. I saw the
policy number on the forms.

464
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,341
The policy lapsed
due to non-payment.

465
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,905
I already made
three calls about this.

466
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,095
She should have
been aware of that.

467
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,142
No, that's just a mistake.

468
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,020
Of course we have
health insurance.

469
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,525
We're actually a little
behind on the premiums.

470
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,153
But I pulled money out of my
retirement account to cover it.

471
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,655
They said that we'll
be fine in a few...

472
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,783
Why the retirement account?

473
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,746
We'll just give you
a few minutes to...

474
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,207
By "we," she means "she."

475
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,087
I lost all of our savings.

476
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,385
Sounds like a secret to me.

477
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,266
I started her on heparin
to prevent further clots,

478
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,059
but we still don't know
what's going on.

479
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,311
Of course the husband's
secret was money.

480
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,355
If it's not sex,
it's always money.

481
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,899
Unless it's sex for money.

482
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,025
How did he lose it anyway?

483
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,278
It's not medically relevant.
You're not going to care.

484
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,280
Wilson's been teaching me
how to care. Try me.

485
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:53,700
He builds wind turbines and leases
them out to local power companies...

486
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,243
You're right. I don't care.

487
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,372
Clotting disorder. DIC, Factor V
Leiden, Antiphospholipid syndrome.

488
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,040
Vitamin K deficiency also fits,

489
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,445
causes thrombophilia and is
consistent with abdominal pain.

490
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,921
Congratulations, House.
Sam ended it.

491
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,256
What happened?

492
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,675
Go test our patient's blood.

493
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,051
It can wait five minutes.

494
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,429
For everything we discussed.

495
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:26,482
Well, at least you're actually taking
responsibility for once in your life.

497
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,986
I'm sorry that she left,
but it's not my fault.

498
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,487
I didn't even want
to get involved.

499
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:32,655
You dragged it out of me.

500
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,659
What about the dishwasher
and the banana?

501
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,704
Yeah, she left
because of the banana.

502
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,708
I just wanted you to stand up for
yourself, tell her what you want.

503
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,462
If doing that causes her to
walk out for the second time,

504
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,631
well, then your relationship
wasn't going to last anyway.

505
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,216
Or you could've
stayed out of it.

506
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,500
I could've kept my mouth shut,

507
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,219
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy,

508
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,763
because I'd still be with her.

509
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,224
Now all I have is cold milk.

510
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,770
As long as you're free,
you want to grab some dinner?

511
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,568
Did Tom go home for the night?

512
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:14,405
For starters. I told him to leave.
I don't want him here.

513
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,743
Money is a complicated subject.

514
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,495
Yeah, it's not the money.

515
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,664
I mean,
the money is bad, but...

516
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,615
When we first
opened our marriage,

517
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:32,298
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

518
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,801
And one day, his wife calls me.

519
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:39,764
She's crying, and screaming,
and totally out of control.

520
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,725
And I felt

521
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,770
superior.

522
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,023
I thought, "I don't ever have to
worry about feeling this way",

523
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,735
"because Tom and I are
honest with each other."

524
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,865
Well, here I am.

525
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,707
Hi.

526
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,628
Sorry I didn't make it
home last night.

527
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:14,757
I needed to run some tests.

528
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:19,679
You know what the worst part
was when you had your affair?

529
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,516
It wasn't the sex.

530
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
It was the lies.

531
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:32,483
Realizing that the narrative
of my life was totally wrong.

532
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,652
You weren't stuck in surgery.

533
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,738
You weren't out of town.

534
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,241
I don't wanna go
through that again.

535
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,744
I told you, nothing's going...

536
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,162
Thursday nights.

537
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,584
You have to be home
by midnight.

538
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,047
You don't bring her here, you
don't talk to her about me,

539
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,842
and I don't want to meet
her ever in any context.

540
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:08,686
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

541
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,439
It's what you want, isn't it?

542
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,149
I want you.

543
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,903
No, you want more than me.

544
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,197
You want that thrill.

545
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:27,455
But I love you, and I really
believe that you love me.

546
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,041
And we have
a good life together.

547
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,545
And at this point,
either I walk away,

548
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,382
or I try to accept
who you really are.

549
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,844
Tomorrow's Thursday.

550
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,304
Yes, it is.

551
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,854
All our tests
came back negative.

552
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,731
It's not a clotting disorder.

553
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:57,110
Which means we need to come
up with a better idea.

554
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,114
So what causes problems in the
stomach, heart, nerves...

555
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,534
Oh, my God.

556
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,995
You know what it is?

557
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,422
Taub's wife gave the green
light for an open marriage.

558
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,800
He's wearing cologne
but not the stink of shame.

559
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,468
You've got a date?

560
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:27,348
I am going out with Maya tonight
with Rachel's blessing.

561
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,393
Mazel tov?

562
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,105
Maybe the problem
isn't her blood.

563
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,857
Maybe it's the vessels
carrying the blood.

564
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,692
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

565
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,445
So you're actually going to
sleep with another woman,

566
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,779
then go home to your wife?

567
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,866
Thank God someone's keeping us
focused on what's really important.

568
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,118
Taub was going to do
all of that anyway.

569
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,828
Pulmonary
arterial hypertension?

570
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,373
Imaging showed normal diameter
in her pulmonary artery.

571
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:57,545
Here's a thought. Taub's wife
is now totally on the market.

572
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,088
Mind hitting me
with her digits?

573
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,887
She would love that,
but duty calls.

574
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,852
What's the matter?

575
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,145
My stomach.

576
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,396
Same pain as before?

577
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,148
Yeah. Worse.

578
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,441
Get the portable
ultrasound in here.

579
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,526
We need to get
a look at her belly.

580
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,028
Help me.

581
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,787
Pain, pain went away,
came back another day.

582
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,664
Question is,
what brought it back?

583
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,751
Physical exam was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

584
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,835
So afterwards, you gonna shower

585
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,170
at your girlfriend's
or at home?

586
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,088
Patient. Abdominal pain.

587
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,425
Yeah, he's right. Let's get
this wrapped up before 6:00.

588
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,886
Taub turns back into a
faithful pumpkin at midnight.

589
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,097
The patient was out with her
boy-toy before she came in.

590
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,974
Maybe the pain was triggered
by sexual excitement.

591
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,727
Because lying alone
in a hospital bed,

592
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,896
contemplating bankruptcy? Hot.

593
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,148
My point was that
arousal is a function

594
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,858
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

595
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,360
If that's where the problem is,

596
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,237
the pain could be triggered
by crying, which seems...

597
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,864
PNS also controls digestion,
which she's been doing

598
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,033
without screaming her head
off since she's been here.

599
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,838
What if what matters isn't when the
pain started, but when it stopped?

600
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,247
It was during an X-ray.
You think that cured her?

601
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,208
No, but House prepped her for
the X-ray with a barium enema.

602
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,126
That wouldn't treat
anything except...

603
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,047
Go.

604
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,217
You're in pain because part of your
intestine folded in on itself.

605
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,541
It's called an intussusception.

606
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,053
It's cutting off blood flow.
We need to fix it

607
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,930
before your bowel
gets necrotic and dies.

608
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,473
Once you do that,
will I get better?

609
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,639
When this happens in adults,

610
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,203
it's usually a sign
of abdominal cancer.

611
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,895
We'll fix the overlap, and then
search your intestine for tumors.

612
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,528
Foam?

613
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,658
I have a bad feeling
about this.

614
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,451
A friend can't
spontaneously buy

615
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,539
an overpriced Italian espresso
machine for another friend?

616
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,499
What did you do?

617
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,251
Nothing, that's the beauty.

618
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,129
I genuinely tried
to help Wilson.

619
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,422
I told him to
stand up for himself,

620
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,132
which you know is
legitimate advice.

621
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,259
And his relationship blew up.

622
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,011
Is he okay? He'll be fine.

623
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,138
Point is, I realized something.

624
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:16,017
I do nice things, nice things happen to me.
Karma works.

625
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,394
So you're paying it forward?

626
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:24,859
If this should somehow lead
to Lucas dying or oral sex,

627
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,902
so be it.

628
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,706
You think I should
wear a tie tonight?

629
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,915
This isn't weird at all.

630
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,212
I mean, where's Rachel
eating tonight?

631
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,464
Home.

632
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,801
What if she's going out, too?

633
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,678
She's allowed to, right?

634
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,640
Of course, it's only fair.

635
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:56,805
But I don't think she will.

636
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,227
Your wife only
eats dinner at home?

637
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,566
If she did go out,
that'd be tough.

638
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,985
But I think I can handle it.

639
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,362
Don't do it unless you're sure.

640
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,989
I know I'd rather be
jealous than a liar.

641
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,452
Got something here.
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

642
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,412
Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,

643
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,081
which suggests IBD.

644
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,208
Only that doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

645
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,293
Or her declining
kidney function.

646
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,671
We ran panels during surgery.

647
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,341
Actually, IBD does make sense,

648
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,052
'cause it can trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

649
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,471
which would explain the
heart and the kidneys.

650
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,849
Start her on sulfasalazine
and TN F-inhibitors.

651
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,227
And Taub, I'm not gonna see you

652
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,591
before you head off
for Gomorrah.

653
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,127
Just remember,
if you get disoriented,

654
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,984
breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

655
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,627
I can't.

656
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,797
I really thought
I could do this.

657
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,219
Logically,
it makes perfect sense.

658
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,932
But all afternoon,

659
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,480
all I kept thinking about
was the two of you together,

660
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,025
and you touching her...

661
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,863
Nothing's happened. It's okay.

662
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,823
I'm sorry.

663
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,992
'Cause I really wanted...

664
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,660
No.

665
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,465
I've been an idiot. I
don't need anything else.

666
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:45,916
I just need you.

667
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,585
You mean that?

668
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,045
I do.

669
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,218
I love you, Rachel.

670
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,595
I love you, too.

671
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,597
Let's go home.

672
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,931
Is that okay?

673
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,185
There are other doctors.

674
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,404
The treatment's not working.

675
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,822
Her left kidney
failed last night.

676
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,147
The other one's
right behind it.

677
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,367
It's not
ankylosing spondylitis.

678
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,120
Kidney biopsy showed
she had IgA nephropathy,

679
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,999
which could be caused by or associated
with any of these conditions.

680
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,335
We've gone from too few
ideas to too many,

681
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,629
and our patient is
running out of time.

682
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,715
Why the lack of afterglow?

683
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,884
Physio girl not as freaky
as you'd hoped?

684
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,178
I went home with my wife.

685
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,973
After all that?
You chickened out.

686
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,685
I can't hurt Rachel like that.

687
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,396
Sickle cell anemia would've
shown on blood tests.

688
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,858
No flattened intestinal
villi rules out celiac...

689
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,445
Seriously?

690
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,824
Our patient is dying, and we
can't move past my sex life?

691
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,700
Seriously?
You think it'd kill her

692
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,786
if we spent 15 seconds
mocking you?

693
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,871
Time's up.

694
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,834
Normal liver enzymes
rules out Hep B and cirrhosis.

695
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,045
Alport and Anti-GBM antibody
are both untreatable,

696
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,256
so if she has them,
we can't help her.

697
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,424
And it can't be
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

698
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,594
No inciting respiratory
infection and no rash.

699
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,846
I don't care what it's not.

700
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,130
I wanna know what it could be.

701
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,225
Well, everything
left on the list.

702
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,477
The list was not created equal.

703
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,854
Neither was man, by the way.

704
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,190
Hemochromatosis is a possibility.
Excess iron builds up,

705
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,441
causes problems
throughout the body.

706
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,611
Weil's Syndrome also affects
multiple organ systems.

707
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,196
And it wouldn't
have been treated

708
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,198
by the antibiotic
the ER gave her.

709
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,701
Sarcoidosis makes sense, too.

710
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,829
Good. Treat for those three.

711
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,587
I think you should call Tom.

712
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,631
Am I going to die?

713
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,342
I don't know.

714
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,887
If he walked in here right now,

715
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,890
I'd look at his face, and all
I would think is "liar."

716
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,225
Don't you think
that's kind of unfair?

717
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,768
You say honesty
is all-important,

718
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,293
but you conveniently
ignore the truth

719
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,731
that some truths hurt people.

720
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,400
Tom lied to protect you.

721
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,235
He was covering his ass.

722
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,696
I'm not talking
about the money.

723
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,911
Tom hasn't slept with
anyone else in over a year.

724
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,915
He told you that?

725
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,753
So my entire marriage
is a sham.

726
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,254
No.

727
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,716
Your husband,
who only wants you,

728
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,551
lied so that
you could be happy.

729
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,055
That seems pretty real to me.

730
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,852
Yeah?

731
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,524
Hey. Hey.

732
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,953
Listen, I'm sorry.

733
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,205
Me, too.
I shouldn't have said...

734
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,249
No. You were right.
I was selfish back then.

735
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,088
I'm trying to change.

736
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,049
And I don't know if
it's House or what,

737
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,843
but you're different, too.

738
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,638
I'm trying.

739
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:35,187
I always thought that
I was keeping the peace.

740
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,272
But I was just resenting you

741
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,608
and giving you
a reason to leave.

742
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:49,243
I wish we had this fight
10 years ago.

743
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,501
Is it okay if we don't
give House the credit?

744
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,170
I recommend it.

745
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,056
0-for-3, her kidney function
is still declining.

746
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,350
We're going to need
to start dialysis.

747
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,227
Glad the husband's back.

748
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,229
After missing
so many little deaths,

749
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,189
he should be here
for the big one.

750
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,566
Top six, anyone?

751
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,401
Polyarteritis Nodosa?

752
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,779
We would've seen some
improvement on prednisone.

753
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,659
Guy's wife is dying.
He stops to buy flowers.

754
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,537
They're from his garden.
Mercury poisoning fits.

755
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,456
Those are lilacs.

756
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,712
My mom used to grow lilacs.

757
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,630
My dad made her get rid of them

758
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,050
'cause there were
too many bees.

759
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:50,095
We ruled out HSP because there was
no inciting respiratory infection.

760
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,390
But in rare cases, it can also
be triggered by a bee sting.

761
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,351
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

762
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,312
Maybe we just didn't see it.

763
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,488
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

764
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,615
About a month ago.

765
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,993
What's going on?

766
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:17,581
I think your wife has
Henoch-Schonlein purpura,

767
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,751
systemic vasculitis
that can cause lesions

768
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,461
and inflammation
throughout the body.

769
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,171
It's pretty awful,

770
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,453
which explains why it was
named after a German.

771
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,675
Actually, two Germans.

772
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,053
Lesions can pop up
in the heart,

773
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,846
sometimes in the kidneys.

774
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,434
But always on the skin. Means
you'd have a rash somewhere.

775
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,727
I don't.

776
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:39,978
Not that you know of.

777
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,679
Okay, I'm going to have
to check your holes.

778
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,526
I'll start with the mouth.

779
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,570
If there's nothing there, then
things might have to get kinky.

780
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,030
Say "ah."

781
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,198
Ah.

782
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,244
I was kind of hoping for kinky.

783
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,870
Is that good or bad?

784
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,374
We'll treat her with high-dose
Mg and cyclophosphamide.

785
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,917
You should be fine.

786
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,170
I'm going to be okay.

787
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,300
I love you.

788
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,636
That is adorable.

789
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,140
Other than you still wanting
to have sex with other dudes

790
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,474
and him bankrupting
your family,

791
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:20,853
I think you kids are
pretty much home free.

792
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,570
And...

793
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,322
You two made up?

794
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,241
No.

795
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,493
You can thank me later.

796
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,078
I'm all in.

797
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,206
All right.

798
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,585
Fold. Jesus.

799
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,010
Nervous?

800
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,597
I'm getting there. I'm
getting some nervousness.

801
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,503
You need a hand?

802
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,634
Thanks.

803
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,974
Sorry about canceling
the other night.

804
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,644
Me, too.

805
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,499
You wanna go somewhere?
