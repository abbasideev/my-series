1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,107
Okay, therafy me.

2
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,034
You're late.

3
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,285
You're fat.

4
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,248
It's unusual.

5
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:44,752
You know how far the parking lot is?
My leg's been hurting.

6
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,255
Anything been on your mind lately?
Any particular stress?

7
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,966
Nope. Probably just gonna rain.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,050
Hmm.

9
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,512
You like the new Monet
reproduction in the waiting room?

10
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,431
The Water Lilies?

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,685
I was late. I wasn't
focusing on the decor,

12
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,938
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,315
Stress can also make
you absent-minded.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,317
I'm not stressed.

15
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,321
Beyond the stress induced by you
telling me how stressed I am.

16
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,116
Just an ordinary week.

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,995
Okay.

18
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,832
Tell me about it.

19
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,504
I had a patient...

20
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,006
House?

21
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,509
Good, I have a case for you.

22
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,094
Beer?

23
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,345
Amnesia.

24
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,140
She was found jogging in
the street, disoriented.

25
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,267
She almost got hit by a truck.

26
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,561
The MRI showed
no abnormalities.

27
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,148
No ID on her, just her jogging
clothes and her heart rate monitor.

28
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,484
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,277
We know she has money.

30
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,238
Blaze Outriggers,
400 bucks a pair.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,407
People who have money
don't just disappear.

32
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,118
Sooner or later, someone is
gonna show up looking for her.

33
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,328
Can I have something to eat?

34
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,955
She just ate 15 minutes ago.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,123
She keeps forgetting.

36
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,460
You don't eat because you
remember it's time to eat,

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,753
you eat because you're hungry.

38
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,963
Her metabolism is in high gear.

39
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,633
She is an extreme
long-distance runner who...

40
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,760
Why were you in the ER?

41
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,720
That's your question?

42
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,183
You're a psychotherapist, you're
hearing about a great amnesia case,

43
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,976
and all you're
asking me is geography?

44
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,895
Just curious.

45
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,109
I was avoiding Wilson.

46
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,281
It's not something you couldn't
have seen eight miles away.

47
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,826
Wilson's a processor.

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,746
I knew there were some things that
he'd want to process with me.

49
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,206
At length.

50
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,999
Sam's moving in.

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,711
If it's before Friday, your
assistant wins the pool.

52
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,257
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

53
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,260
Tonight? In life.

54
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,763
Sam likes you...

55
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,181
But she wants me to move out.

56
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,516
No.

57
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,936
I want you to move out.

58
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,690
I didn't know things with Sam
would happen so quickly.

59
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,442
I didn't... I don't want
to make a mistake here.

60
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,652
I've made a lot of mistakes.

61
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,320
By moving too quickly.

62
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,864
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

63
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,116
I'm surprised you're
not already re-divorced.

64
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,995
I could help you find a place.

65
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,121
What's wrong with my old place?

66
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,042
Nothing. I just thought you might
want to find somewhere new.

67
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,627
Somewhere...

68
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,839
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate?

69
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,550
Yes.

70
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,385
I'm fine.

71
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,469
You're fine?

72
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,724
Your best friend is tossing
you out, and you're fine?

73
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,351
Why wouldn't I be?

74
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,685
You're not feeling a
little betrayed and angry?

75
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,730
Wilson bought
a two-bedroom condo

76
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,315
specifically so that you
could move in with him.

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,275
It wasn't that long ago.

78
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,362
You don't feel
a little jerked around?

79
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,658
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

80
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,077
That's a very rational
defense of your friend,

81
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,454
and I'm not buying it.

82
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,664
Based on what?

83
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,041
Based on the fact
that you were late,

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,286
and you didn't notice the
pictures in the outer office.

85
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,461
Those aren't symptoms.

86
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,629
They are to me.

87
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,840
And here's another one,
you took the case. Hmm.

88
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,551
No negotiating. No bargaining.

89
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,929
No clinic hours changed hands.

90
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,472
Were you looking for
something to distract you

91
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,717
from the fact that your best
friend just threw you out?

92
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,476
The case was interesting.

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,604
It's not organic,
it's not mysterious.

94
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,857
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

95
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,319
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

96
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,487
Or not.

97
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,447
Here.

98
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,159
Loss of differentiation between
gray and white matter.

99
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,494
It's subtle.

100
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,121
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

101
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,123
Not likely it's a coincidence.

102
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,125
Bacterial infection?

103
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,585
Do I need to know this?

104
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,015
Fine, I'll give you
the Cliff Notes version.

105
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,215
Chase, MS.
Taub, physical trauma.

106
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,967
I could tell you
why we ruled them out.

107
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,427
Or not.

108
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,806
It's probably a toxin, and we need
to find it before it kills her.

109
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,099
We should search her house.

110
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,392
Good luck with that.

111
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,937
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

112
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,606
The distributor can match the
number to the store that sold it.

113
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,941
She's a serious athlete.

114
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,651
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

115
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,194
Brilliant.

116
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,863
Did he really say that?

117
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,114
Subtextually.

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,198
Long shot.

119
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,868
Even if the store clerk
does know who she is,

120
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,494
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

121
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,455
Just seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

122
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,873
You want us to take her there?

123
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,291
No.

124
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,293
I'll take her.

125
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,128
Really?

126
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,798
It's unusual for you to spend
time with a patient, isn't it?

127
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,801
Patients are boring, as people.

128
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,386
This one, I'm sure,
was no exception,

129
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,306
but her situation
was interesting.

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,725
Besides, I was
still avoiding Wilson,

131
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,061
and no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

132
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,439
Maybe. Or were you
avoiding going home?

133
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,316
There's a reason
they tell addicts

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,776
to stay away
from old geography.

135
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,403
I wasn't avoiding going home.
I'd already gone home,

136
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,281
before I came in
to work that day.

137
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,283
I went straight
there from Wilson's.

138
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,581
Hey! Take it easy.
You're gonna kill me.

139
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,208
God, why don't people knock...

140
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,753
House, it's you! Where you been?
Hold up a second.

141
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,421
Alvie?

142
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,466
Juan Alvarez? You let
him stay at your place?

143
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,676
Not exactly.

144
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,423
I was beginning to wonder if
you were ever gonna show up.

145
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,188
Why are you here?

146
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
When I left Mayfield, I went
back to the old neighborhood.

147
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,943
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

148
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,946
Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson.
Why are you here?

149
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,489
Like I said, when I went
back to the neighborhood,

150
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,253
I found out Immigration
was looking for me.

151
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,952
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House.

152
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,788
And turn his apartment into
a giant prison jumpsuit.

153
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,123
Juan Alvarez is no freeloader.

154
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,791
I do my part, earn my keep.

155
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,210
The first week, I made you
dinner, but you never showed up.

156
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,045
The second week,
I organized your stuff.

157
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,214
My stuff?

158
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,382
But still, you never showed up.

159
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,884
So this week, since I'm a real good
painter, I decided to feng shui...

160
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,220
Coffee table.
Where'd you put it?

161
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,141
In the bedroom?

162
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,810
The paint's not cheap, House.
It's a custom color.

163
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,645
It's a mix of titanium
yellow and ochre.

164
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,980
Ochre. I don't even
like that stuff.

165
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,481
It's like a fruit,
it's got hair on it,

166
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,607
but they say
it's a vegetable...

167
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,361
You sold my table to pay for
paint that I don't want?

168
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,241
I had to sell some
other things, too.

169
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,496
Get out.

170
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,165
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

171
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,625
Look, I'm going to work now.

172
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,419
And when I come back,
the walls will be

173
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,546
a less exciting color,
and you will be gone.

174
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,665
So Wilson threw you out,
and you threw Alvie out.

175
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,429
Just another week?

176
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,222
But unlike me,
Alvie didn't leave.

177
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,099
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

178
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,435
When I went home to get my car,

179
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,896
he was painting
the ceiling magenta.

180
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,940
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

181
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,692
Why?

182
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,527
To protect the apartment.

183
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,946
Whoa, déjà vu.

184
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,324
Tossing him out, or sending
him to the movies,

185
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,326
or locking him in the bathroom

186
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,828
would also minimize
Alvie's destructive force.

187
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,707
But you chose his company
deliberately. Why?

188
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,876
Obviously, because
he's a Wilson substitute.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,711
You can barely tell the
difference between them,

190
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,546
especially when Wilson
raps about the 'hood.

191
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,381
I'm not suggesting
Alvie's a substitute,

192
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,383
but he would make
a great distraction.

193
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,635
From what?

194
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,470
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

195
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,474
Go on.

196
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,272
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

197
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,732
That's why no one
recognized her.

198
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,525
Shut up, Alvie.

199
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,821
Anything familiar?
Church? Grocery store?

200
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,907
Sorry.

201
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,200
It's okay, Miss X.

202
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,118
Maybe she's never been
to this town before.

203
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,412
Bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

204
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,581
You know that Puerto Ricans
are US citizens, right?

205
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
Instead of working the case,
why don't you contemplate

206
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,002
the inanity of an American with
American immigration issues?

207
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,171
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

208
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,173
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

209
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,133
But the town hall had burned
down when I was a kid,

210
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,593
destroyed the records.

211
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,844
There's only one copy?

212
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,514
They tried to make me fill
out a whole bunch of forms

213
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,719
before they'd give it to me.

214
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,643
I decided it'd be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

215
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,769
How'd that go?

216
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,053
They figured out it was forged,

217
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,189
and now, for some reason, they
don't believe anything I say.

218
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,650
They actually think I'm lying
about being Puerto Rican.

219
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,569
Told me I had to go to a
special hearing to prove it.

220
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,155
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

221
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,995
Then someone will show
up, a spouse, a friend,

222
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,371
to tell you who you really are

223
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,831
and what you should be feeling.

224
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,207
They always do.

225
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,545
I don't know who that
is, but I miss him.

226
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,134
What did they say
at the hearing?

227
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,678
I didn't go. I lied once.

228
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,971
Your mother's Puerto Rican,

229
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,255
therefore you are Puerto Rican.

230
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,765
All you gotta do is prove
your mom is your mom.

231
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,975
Find some documentation...

232
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,519
People like that don't
listen to people like me.

233
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,187
Donuts. Hey, House,
let's get donuts!

234
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,272
Alvie, the hearing...

235
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,440
Everyone loves donuts.

236
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,318
Glazed, crullers, elephant
ears, even donut holes.

237
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,569
Much better than
the sporting goods store.

238
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,279
I bet Mrs. X went there
all the time.

239
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,905
We're not here...

240
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,408
And then I realized...

241
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,410
You make a good point.

242
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,078
Really? I was making that up.

243
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,123
Dozen glazed,
dozen jelly-filled?

244
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,834
You want the usual, right?

245
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,046
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

246
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,589
She needed the
calorically dense food

247
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,673
to support the running habit.

248
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,592
Do you know her name?

249
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,930
Sandy or Shelley, I don't know.

250
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,932
The guy she's with
called her that once.

251
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,184
I just work here.

252
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,935
Do you know where they live?

253
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,689
He left a business card
in our free donut jar.

254
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,316
It's up on the Wall of Winners.

255
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,575
Sidney.

256
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,164
God, I was
so worried about you.

257
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,125
What happened?

258
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,221
The police said it was
too soon to do anything,

259
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,723
so I started calling
hospitals on my own.

260
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,934
Princeton-Plainsboro
wasn't even on my list.

261
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,353
You really think something around
here could have made her sick?

262
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,398
Here, work, anywhere she
could have been exposed.

263
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,733
Why wasn't Princeton-Plainsboro
on your list?

264
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,487
Well, I mean, it's a long
way to run, even for her.

265
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,949
What is it I do besides run?

266
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,039
You're a lawyer. Civil
rights, class-action suits.

267
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,876
It's a stressful job, running's
the way you deal with it.

268
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,796
That doesn't sound like me.

269
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,048
Do you have any idea
what would sound like you?

270
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,050
Good point.

271
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,095
So what were you thinking
during all this?

272
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,764
That it was a strange
position to be in.

273
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,952
At that moment,
she was more comfortable

274
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,935
with me than with her husband.

275
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,187
And he was picking up on it.

276
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,690
What about you?

277
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,483
What about me how?

278
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,405
There was a sort of artificial
intimacy between you.

279
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,357
She had been dependent on you.

280
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,034
Did you find that
attractive on some level?

281
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,787
Disturbing?

282
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,080
Those are my two choices?

283
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,374
None of the above.

284
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,752
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

285
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,384
So we're really married.

286
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,928
For four years.

287
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,431
Miss X, you lead
a lemon-fresh life.

288
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,475
I found three different
cleansers under the sink.

289
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,976
Cleaned out
the medicine cabinets, too.

290
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,645
You know, she just won a
settlement for some families

291
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,440
whose housing development was
built on an old methane field.

292
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,067
A toxic exposure to methane
could explain this.

293
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,487
I surf?

294
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,863
You stopped before we met.

295
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,699
You've been too busy.

296
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,785
And we're married?

297
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,038
Yes.

298
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,664
All right,
it's nothing personal.

299
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,874
I bet she didn't think
you were her type

300
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,001
back when you first met either.

301
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,753
We'll take her
back to the hospital,

302
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,506
test her blood and
urine, start treatment.

303
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,009
Are you okay? I'm all right.

304
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,802
What happened?

305
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,472
I don't know. My foot
suddenly went numb.

306
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,098
Her pants are wet.

307
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,143
Urinary incontinence.

308
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:18,607
She's having complex partial seizures.
This isn't methane.

309
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,776
And you can leave the bucket.

310
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
We need to get her...

311
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,903
Seizures?

312
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,954
This is the second diagnosis
you've come up with

313
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,699
that has a personal
resonance for you.

314
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,036
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

315
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,330
You think she fell down the
stairs and peed her pants

316
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,614
'cause Wilson dumped her, too?

317
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,251
You're choosing to tell me about this case.
So let's look at it.

318
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,003
First, you were fixated on a
harmful toxin from her past,

319
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,088
possibly because you're worried

320
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,297
about a harmful
toxin from your...

321
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,175
Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe
he's obsessed with my past.

322
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,843
And now you're talking about
a seizure disorder...

323
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,303
Which is also not a toxin.

324
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,349
But which is most likely caused
by an old injury to the brain.

325
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,477
Why do you see your past
as such a threat?

326
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,980
Not only am I
unthreatened by it,

327
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,185
I was trying to get it back.

328
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,149
There's a ding mark.

329
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,861
It's a piece of junk. It was
dinged when it came in.

330
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,739
Sure. The cup marks,
the scuffs,

331
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,032
and the paint,
and those three chips.

332
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,409
This fourth one is new.

333
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,495
I run a pawn shop, not a storage company.
Do you want it or not?

334
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,206
That should be it.

335
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,586
You said you pawned five books.
There's only four.

336
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,462
That's all there is.

337
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,174
Where's Approach to
the Acute Abdomen?

338
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,595
Sold it.

339
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,556
To? I can't tell you.

340
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,391
It's the law, and it should be.

341
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,853
Crazy bastards like you
try to hunt down their stuff.

342
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,690
How much for the pile?

343
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,194
$500.

344
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,488
You said it was junk.

345
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,283
No, no. It's your
junk, you want it.

346
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,160
$500. Take it or leave it.

347
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,379
Why is it so important that
you get your stuff back?

348
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,549
Unlike the rest of humanity,

349
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,218
who's okay when their
belongings are taken?

350
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,262
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

351
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,473
Everyone doesn't pay five
times what it's worth.

352
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,726
I like my stuff. I hate
it when Wilson moves...

353
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,894
Oh.

354
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,605
This is not about Wilson!

355
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,867
Say it.

356
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,877
I wasn't gonna say anything.

357
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,930
Thirty-one, thirty-one! Hike!

358
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,850
First down!

359
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,135
One more, you get a touchdown.

360
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,311
Whoo!

361
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,605
Hike!

362
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,531
House, you can't run
for the touchdown.

363
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,119
And hike!

364
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,247
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

365
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,624
You seriously thought you're gonna
tell me that Wilson showed up,

366
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,869
but not tell me what he said?

367
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,419
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

368
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,462
who didn't need the obvious
spelled out to him.

369
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,799
Wilson noticed that I didn't
come to my office all day.

370
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,050
He came to find me.

371
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,053
Wanted to make sure I'm okay.
Boring, boring, boring.

372
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,056
But you thought it was important
to tell me about Nerf football?

373
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,644
Sorry, your story. Continue.

374
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,483
House! House! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop.

375
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,152
You okay?

376
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,361
Yeah.

377
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,999
It was my mother's. She
died when I was four.

378
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,409
It's all I have left.

379
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,245
That's very sad, Alvie.

380
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,122
Listen, I set up
an immigration hearing.

381
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,291
No, House. I'm gonna
end up in jail.

382
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,335
Or worse, the Dominican or
someplace, qué sé yo qué. No.

383
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,629
That is interesting.

384
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,757
You present yourself
as not giving a damn

385
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,049
about other people's emotions,

386
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,677
but your actions
indicate otherwise.

387
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,764
You dismiss Alvie's story
about his mother,

388
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,599
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

389
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,185
I cared for eight seconds.

390
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,479
Then I got distracted.

391
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:31,943
Yeah.

392
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,278
We've kept the patient up
for 12 hours now.

393
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,989
No hint of seizure-like activity.
We should shut this down.

394
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,283
Try a strobe light,
add more stress.

395
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,993
I think there's
plenty of stress in here.

396
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,662
Don't we ever do
anything but work?

397
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,164
You run.

398
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,582
That's just more work!

399
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,586
What about fun? God, how
can we be this boring?

400
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,546
Apparently, without her memory,

401
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,381
the patient's
personality has returned

402
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,885
to what you might call
its natural state.

403
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,639
Seems she had a wake-up call
while she was at college.

404
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,058
Her brother died
in a car accident.

405
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,853
She decided to make her life mean
something, went to law school.

406
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,481
Now that's all gone.

407
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,109
The thing that caused
the change is gone,

408
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,570
so the change itself is gone.

409
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,824
Yeah. I knew the
psychological aspects

410
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,575
of this case
would interest you.

411
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,495
Bet you got a theory already.
What is it?

412
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,746
It's not relevant.

413
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,915
What is it?

414
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,793
Why do you care
about my theory?

415
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,756
I think he just bores her.

416
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,801
I think she's at an earlier
stage of development,

417
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,972
she's looking at her grownup
future, and it puts her to sleep.

418
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,600
If he just bored her,
she'd hide it to be polite.

419
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,769
Their problem is synchronicity.

420
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,397
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

421
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,025
He talks to her like someone
he shares history with.

422
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,150
But from her point of view,

423
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,529
he's a stranger
forcing intimacy on her.

424
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,365
Of course she doesn't like him.
He's not helping.

425
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,577
He can feel he's
losing his wife,

426
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,982
and it makes him
come on stronger.

427
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,626
He almost did lose his wife.

428
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,239
The breathing problem was caused
by fluid overload in the lungs.

429
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,741
Diabetes insipidus.

430
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,160
And the DI came from damage
to the hypothalamus.

431
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,746
Hypothalamus here, that's
the DI and incontinence,

432
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,915
they mingle here,
that's the global amnesia,

433
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,708
and the motor cortex,
that's the foot paralysis.

434
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,918
What do they all
have in common?

435
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,922
Okay, now you're just doing
this to mess with me.

436
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,381
What possible relevance does this
differential have to your problems?

437
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,677
It ends with a diagnosis
of Spongiform Encephalitis.

438
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,555
I convinced the team to cut out
part of this woman's brain.

439
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,432
That's not interesting to you?
No.

440
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,226
Not even if it's the amygdala?

441
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,312
She'll lose all her
long-term memories.

442
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,596
Well, this is where you tell me

443
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,065
that being cavalier with
someone else's past

444
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,400
has nothing to do with
avoiding your own past.

445
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,363
The case is irrelevant, you
just found it interesting.

446
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,991
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

447
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,328
Nowhere is that in the manual.

448
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,457
Look, you've been
in therapy for a year.

449
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,792
You know when I ask you
to talk about anything,

450
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,752
I mean anything
that affects you.

451
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,798
What upset you, what made you
mad, or relieved, or joyful.

452
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,551
You want me to believe that
this case means nothing?

453
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,721
Then

454
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,559
why should I listen to it?

455
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,165
Are you charging me
for this time?

456
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,375
Yes.

457
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,754
This is ridiculous.

458
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,010
What's that?
On the back of your arm?

459
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,056
It's just a bruise. I fell.

460
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,350
You remember falling?

461
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,729
No. I was drunk.

462
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,273
Hence the balance issues.

463
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,027
It looks like you fell on
the tip of someone's boot.

464
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,619
I said something that
someone objected to.

465
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,371
Well, if you don't
remember, then how...

466
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,791
It's usually the way it is
when someone hits me.

467
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,377
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

468
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,713
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

469
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,237
You got drunk enough to get into
a bar fight and not remember,

470
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,510
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

471
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,764
Why go out and get blind drunk?

472
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,390
Were you looking for a fight?

473
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,393
I don't know.

474
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,233
What have you screwed up?

475
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,401
What?

476
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,570
You say that when you've
been hit in the past,

477
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,490
it's because you've provoked it
with something that you said.

478
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,575
Which means you're
well aware of the risks.

479
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,619
So, on some level,
you were in that bar

480
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,080
looking for someone
to hurt you.

481
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,501
Logically, people punish
themselves for something they did,

482
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,711
or something they didn't do.

483
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,341
So, what did you screw up?

484
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,101
I don't know.

485
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,030
Okay, there may be a problem.

486
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,373
All right.

487
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,126
Let's talk about Wilson.

488
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,339
I told him your book was
contaminated with anthrax spores.

489
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,592
Then I gave him $300.
The address of the buyer.

490
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,222
Maybe I was hasty
in asking you to move out.

491
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,975
Why don't you stay with me
and Sam for a little while?

492
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,726
There's no need
to hurry things.

493
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,396
What prompted this?

494
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,818
Look, the whole idea was that after
Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own.

495
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,486
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

496
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,988
if you're staying
with me than...

497
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,489
For God's sake, Wilson.

498
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,243
You really span the chasm
from wishy to washy.

499
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,913
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass. Stick with it.

500
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,166
Why were you being
so hard on the guy,

501
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,584
when he was being conciliatory?

502
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:07,922
Come on, Cuddy played on his guilt.
She put him up to this.

503
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,507
How do you know that?

504
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,843
How do you know this wasn't
entirely his own idea?

505
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,679
Two reasons.
First, he wants to create

506
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,681
the perfect environment
to be with Sam.

507
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,517
He's been thinking about asking
me to leave for a while.

508
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,062
Finally, he does it, and immediately
turns around and changes his mind?

509
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,439
No. He talked to somebody.

510
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,649
Maybe it was Sam.

511
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,986
Yeah, that's a possibility.

512
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,782
I want this to be the last serious
relationship I ever have.

513
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,367
I want this to be the one.

514
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,577
Me, too.

515
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,876
Where's House? It's not as
meaningful without him.

516
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,921
Okay, not Sam.

517
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,882
That still doesn't
answer why Cuddy.

518
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,675
Because they've
been talking about me.

519
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,345
She called me to
check on the patient,

520
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,597
which she never does
without a reason.

521
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,349
I asked why, and she said...

522
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,726
She's a barracuda
attorney, House.

523
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,978
These are the kind of patients
we like to keep happy.

524
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,605
Right now, the patient's lucky

525
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,690
if she can spell
"jurisprudence."

526
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,902
Yeah, but when she
gets that memory back,

527
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
which we're trying
to make happen,

528
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,199
she'll be able to spell "lawsuit."
I'm just touching base.

529
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,372
"Touching base." Wilson used
exactly the same phrase.

530
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,916
Colluding about me is
their favorite pastime.

531
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,294
Okay, you think they talked.

532
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,383
How do you think
that conversation went?

533
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,013
I'm worried about House.

534
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,185
Me, too.
Couldn't you have waited?

535
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,564
It's way too early for him to be on
his own, back in the old apartment.

536
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,129
What makes you think
he can handle it?

537
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,651
I offered to find
him a new place.

538
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,111
You have to let him
back into your condo.

539
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,988
Sam and I just got
him out of the condo.

540
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,074
You know what House is like,
he's self-destructive.

541
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,409
Without constant supervision,

542
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,953
he's gonna slide
back into drugs.

543
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,914
If you're not watching
him, I've got to.

544
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,124
Yeah.

545
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,294
So they don't trust you.

546
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,879
They assume you'll fail.

547
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,215
Are these their fears or yours?

548
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,887
Let's turn on the lights. Hmm?

549
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,308
In your brain.

550
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,227
Maybe they did talk about you,

551
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,857
but how do you know it
didn't happen like this?

552
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,900
I'm worried about House.

553
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,027
Why?

554
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,903
It's the first time he'll be
on his own since Mayfield.

555
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,488
No, you're being
over-protective.

556
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,657
House doesn't need to be
wrapped in cotton wool.

557
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,744
But you know that, or you wouldn't
have asked him to move out.

558
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,621
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

559
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,082
It's just I feel like a jerk.

560
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,003
Sure, Sam and I are gonna wanna
be on our own eventually,

561
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,756
but I kind of
sprang this on him.

562
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,424
The right way would've
been to just tell him

563
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,508
to take as long as he needed,

564
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,510
that there's no hurry.

565
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,056
So it's not what you did,
but how you did it?

566
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,768
That matters in a friendship.
I need to fix this.

567
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,605
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

568
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,774
Just touch base.

569
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,736
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

570
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,863
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.

571
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,031
Yeah, he is.

572
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,783
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

573
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,577
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

574
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
of a scene with
Wilson and Cuddy?

575
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:28,414
Your version needed to be ended.
Because it's crap.

576
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,541
It's all sweetness
and light and faith

577
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,066
that I'm gonna choose
the right path.

578
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,212
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.

579
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,594
I have as much evidence for
mine as you do for yours.

580
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,471
I know Wilson's your friend,

581
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,724
so he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

582
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,934
And I know he wouldn't
have asked you

583
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,178
to move out in the first place

584
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,467
unless he was convinced you
could handle life on your own.

585
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,440
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

586
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,527
to strategize about
"the House problem."

587
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,779
So there's truth
in both versions.

588
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,614
But you choose to
focus on the parts

589
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,158
that make you
uncomfortable. So...

590
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:15,670
Why are you and Wilson friends?

591
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,427
Do you think this friendship
is the best you can do?

592
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,013
Wilson is not
a consolation prize.

593
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,599
There, you're defending him.

594
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,601
And a minute ago, he was skulking
around in the background

595
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,312
like some sort of
manipulative lago.

596
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,065
He's my friend.

597
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,443
So what do you value in him?

598
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,743
I can say whatever I want to
him, and he'll never leave.

599
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,662
He's sort of leaving.

600
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,457
At least, he won't
be around as much.

601
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,086
Because he's putting Sam first.

602
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,504
For now.

603
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,592
After the divorce, he'll probably
ask me to move in again.

604
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,218
I take the long view.

605
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,346
You say that to Wilson?

606
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,431
Are you kidding?

607
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,851
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hit you.

608
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,411
Maybe you've been right
from the beginning.

609
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,817
Maybe this isn't about Wilson.

610
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,197
You say that now that I
finally agree with you?

611
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,324
Do you just argue the
opposite of whatever I say?

612
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,202
I don't mean the Wilson
thing doesn't bother you.

613
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,828
But it sounds like
he's the closest

614
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,663
you could come to
a safe relationship.

615
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,374
You'd have to do something
major to screw it up.

616
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,003
What else have you been
involved in this week?

617
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,590
What would you want to
punish yourself for?

618
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,427
I told you I don't know.

619
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,599
Okay, let's approach it
from a different angle.

620
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,605
Have you gotten any other people
angry at you over anything?

621
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,318
Well, yeah. That's why I
called it an ordinary week.

622
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,904
Okay. Tell me about it.

623
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,039
You'd be losing
a part of your brain.

624
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,334
It is my brain. Why is it
not my right to consent?

625
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,338
I'm sorry, but I'll take this to
court, if necessary, all right?

626
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,174
Sidney's in no position to make
decisions about herself right now.

627
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,592
She doesn't even
know who she is.

628
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,104
I read your consent form
and I understood it.

629
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:29,554
I want the surgery.

630
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,763
Why wouldn't she?

631
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,891
Of course she's willing to risk
losing her memories permanently,

632
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,061
she has no idea how important
those memories are.

633
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,938
Does she even know
what "risk" is?

634
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,565
She's never lost anything!

635
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,442
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

636
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,444
The prion infection
will continue to advance

637
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,737
and destroy her whole brain.

638
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,031
There has to be another way.

639
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,200
Please.

640
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,454
I'm speaking for my wife,

641
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,331
the wife I lived with
for four years,

642
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,209
who isn't here and
can't defend herself.

643
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,045
Dr. House, are you listening?

644
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:07,508
Well, you can stop arguing 'cause
it doesn't matter anymore.

645
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,386
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

646
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,763
The SE's spread
into the brainstem.

647
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,558
Wherever it is,
you can still cut it out.

648
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,605
No. We can't cut the brainstem.

649
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,064
This thing's
moving too quickly.

650
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,442
Surgery is no longer an option.

651
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,528
Which, I guess, means you've won.
Congratulations.

652
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,032
Put in a pacer, and start
her on chemo and radiation.

653
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,242
It won't cure her, but
it'll buy a couple weeks,

654
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,703
so she can find out who
she is before she dies.

655
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,207
That was pretty rough.

656
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,703
Do you always break the news
to your patients that way?

657
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,338
Or were you
shorthanding it for me?

658
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,465
Husband was being an idiot.

659
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,008
Well, he was asking for it.

660
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,596
But to punish him, you had
to punish the wife, too.

661
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,806
Why did he make you so angry?

662
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,851
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

663
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,980
He'd rather risk his wife's
life than their marriage.

664
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,650
People's brains stop
working when they think

665
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,276
they're gonna lose
someone they love.

666
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,404
Your leg hurting?

667
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,534
It's all right.

668
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,578
Okay.

669
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,664
Anyone else you pissed off?

670
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,840
Fifty bucks for the book.

671
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,092
Forget it.

672
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,220
You paid $25.
That's 100% return.

673
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,388
That's what I paid.

674
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,224
But it's a rare surgical
text, nearly 100 years old,

675
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:42,687
plates in mint condition. That book's
worth several thousand dollars.

676
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,939
$2,000. I'll write you a check.

677
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,065
Nice try.

678
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,526
Face it. I had
the wit to recognize

679
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,444
something valuable
when I saw it.

680
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:55,825
In the great Darwinian race, I get
my just reward, you become roadkill.

681
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,548
Yo, House, you wanna
stop by the library?

682
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,832
'Cause I got a book to return.

683
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,511
Old professor
tried to hoard/hog.

684
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,139
You can't stop Alvie
with no guard-ass dog.

685
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,306
Anyone see you?

686
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,111
Yeah, Prof saw me
walking down the driveway.

687
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,893
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

688
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,653
I didn't know there was a section
of the brain just for hope.

689
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,405
It's very, very tiny.

690
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,742
We used fluoroscopy to guide pacemaker
placement in the patient's heart.

691
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,993
Hello.

692
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,622
Hello. Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

693
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,207
This isn't SE,
and whatever it is,

694
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,375
it's not just in her brain,

695
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,918
it's attacking her whole body.

696
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,805
You work for House? I
guess we're teammates.

697
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,630
Isn't that cool?

698
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,674
Hello.

699
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,010
Juan Alvarez?

700
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,094
What the hell?

701
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,805
We're taking you into custody.
Deportation order.

702
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,391
I'm a citizen. You're
disrespecting Puerto Rico.

703
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,352
If you're a citizen, why
did you miss your hearing?

704
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,690
You called them?

705
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,947
What's going on?

706
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,084
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

707
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,669
She's still tachy
and hypotensive.

708
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,881
Brain, heart,
and rapidly progressing.

709
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,884
Endocarditis. Slow-moving
infection in her heart

710
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,552
throws clots to her brain.

711
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,930
I'm not talking to you.

712
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,183
How could you turn me in?

713
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,227
Her extreme exercise
suppresses her immune system,

714
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,853
allows the infection
to smoulder.

715
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,190
Or allows an old infection
to re-activate. TB.

716
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,318
Start her on
a multi-drug regimen.

717
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,655
I don't like you, House.
I hate you.

718
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,032
Even IV antibiotics
will take time to work.

719
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,661
A gentle reminder, the use of
cell phones is prohibited.

720
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,497
Give her the first dose directly
into the lungs in the OR.

721
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,624
Before the less-gentle
arrest for contempt.

722
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,668
Put her in an isolation
room with UV light.

723
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,921
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

724
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,676
Docket number 4378.

725
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,684
You are?

726
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,644
I'm Mr. Alvarez's doctor.

727
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,112
Your Honor,
DNA evidence proving

728
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,948
the matriarchal lineage
of Juan Alvarez.

729
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,203
My mother's DNA was
still on that cross?

730
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,454
It could be.

731
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,833
You faked it?

732
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,881
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them, too.

733
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,675
But I'm better at it
than you are.

734
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,636
I'm gonna re-paint
your whole apartment now.

735
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,638
Make the drapes
match the carpet now.

736
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,560
Lungs sound wet.
O2 sats are dropping.

737
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,521
We may need to tube her.
Grab some IV furosemide.

738
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,776
Wait. Wait.

739
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,903
She's crashing.

740
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,154
We need to get her on a vent.

741
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,406
There's something on her ankle.

742
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,296
A tattoo.

743
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,549
"Eddie would go."
It's a surfing phrase.

744
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,343
Must be from her earlier life.

745
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,220
She tried to get it removed.

746
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,106
But they only took off
the top layers of skin.

747
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,891
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

748
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,851
It set off
an allergic reaction.

749
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,854
She was fine until she started
the long-distance running.

750
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,398
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system

751
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,817
and set off
the allergic reaction.

752
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,780
We did a full-thickness skin
graft and she'll be okay.

753
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:09,203
So, you were right in the end.
It was her past.

754
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,456
Did she get her memory back?

755
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,875
Not yet.

756
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,169
Will she?

757
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,129
No way to know.

758
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,173
I think roses are my favorite.

759
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,969
But I guess I told you
that at some point.

760
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,679
I don't remember.

761
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,809
He's treating her
as though they've just met.

762
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,981
He's courting her.
Whose idea was that?

763
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,401
He was doing the opposite
of everything he should,

764
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,568
suddenly he's changed.

765
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,820
Taub thought it might...

766
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,655
That was your idea.

767
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,200
And you asked me what I thought
was going on between them.

768
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,369
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

769
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,496
That's why you've been
thinking about this case.

770
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,081
Relationships.

771
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,750
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with Alvie...

772
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,419
Not exactly.

773
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,006
Alvie!

774
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,526
You gonna tell me
what the note said?

775
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,410
Alvie was very grateful that
I'd gotten him out of trouble.

776
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,537
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

777
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,207
without worrying about Immigration
looking for him there.

778
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,586
You didn't think he was
gonna stay forever?

779
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,754
No.

780
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,215
What happened next?

781
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,681
Nothing happened next.

782
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,919
That's all I got.

783
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,092
Relationships.

784
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,638
Bergman. What do
you want me to say?

785
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,765
I don't know, you're the
one who set the theme.

786
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,267
Something about relationships

787
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,103
made you go out
and provoke a fight.

788
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,898
Wilson and Sam
have a relationship.

789
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,567
You're not thrilled about it.

790
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,902
They're happy.

791
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,032
Why should I screw that up?
Everyone's happy.

792
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,202
Everyone's moving in together.

793
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,414
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and
Lucas, even Alvie and his...

794
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,792
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

795
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,836
You didn't mention that.

796
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,963
They've talked about
moving in together before.

797
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,048
It's not big news.

798
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,345
Cuddy.

799
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,019
Cuddy.

800
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,441
Approach to the Acute Abdomen.

801
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,994
Written by
Ernest T. Cuddy, M. D.

802
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,453
Any relation to your Cuddy?

803
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,374
Her great-grandfather.

804
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,711
I've had it for years.

805
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,131
Always meant to give it to
her for a special occasion.

806
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,925
Like her housewarming?

807
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,303
It's just a gift.

808
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,431
A woman you care about has taken
one step further away from you

809
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,600
and closer to someone else.

810
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,185
I think I can safely say, yes,

811
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,395
it's significant
if you don't mention it.

812
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,231
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

813
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,650
because you identified
with him.

814
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,529
He was also losing
someone he loved.

815
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,054
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

816
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,075
because a woman I'm not even
with is moving in with someone.

817
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,952
That'd be pathetic.

818
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,290
To hell with this.

819
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,628
When I first came to you,

820
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,215
I told you that
I wanted to be happy.

821
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,636
I followed your advice, and
instead I'm just miserable.

822
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,472
How is this working for me?

823
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:41,016
It takes time.

824
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,602
For a year, I've done
everything you've asked,

825
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,812
and everybody else is happy.

826
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,524
I run my treadmill, you
just sit there and watch.

827
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,653
You're a faith healer.

828
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,823
You take advantage of
people who want to believe.

829
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,537
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

830
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,999
House!

831
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,963
Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.
