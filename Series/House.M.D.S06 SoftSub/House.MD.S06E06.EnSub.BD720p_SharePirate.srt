1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,010
Sure, let's give up now.
It's no big deal.

2
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,554
It's just Pharmacide,
just their tour kick-off.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,809
I mean, who cares if we miss the
most insane party in the world?

4
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,275
Come on, Phoeb.
Victory or death.

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,361
Or possibly cake.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,198
Look, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,284
Sorry, your caffeine fix
is on its way.

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,578
Will you hold on?

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,623
Hi, we're the DJ's assistants.

10
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,134
Hold on.

11
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,222
No. I said we both
work for him.

12
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,059
You mean "her."
The DJ is a she-jay.

13
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,979
It's okay, Dave,
she's my plus one.

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,482
Make that plus two.

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,995
You weren't worried, were you?

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,079
Yes.

17
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,124
And there will be punishment
unless you tell us everything.

18
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,792
You've been here all night?

19
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,171
After the party, we went up to the
Presidential Suite with the band.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,590
It was ginormous,
like 10 rooms.

21
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,425
We had a few drinks
and some weed,

22
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,927
and played Drummer God
on this giant plasma TV.

23
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,971
Which she rocked, by the way.

24
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,598
I think I hate you right now.

25
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,435
Colt took me up to the roof, but by
then the gate to the pool was locked.

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,483
So no one was up there. So we just
climbed over and jumped down,

27
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,694
and went skinny dipping.

28
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,614
Did you do it?

29
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,283
No. He was so sweet.

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,995
Later, he played his guitar
and he wrote a song for me.

31
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,334
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,657
Jord, what happened
to your foot?

33
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,838
Maybe you twisted your
ankle when you jumped.

34
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,673
Or it could be your allergies.

35
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,675
My aunt was allergic
to some cold medication,

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,137
and her hands swelled up
like the Marshmallow Man's.

37
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,056
Jord, are you okay?

38
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,683
Jordan!

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,348
Foreman expects me to read an
x-ray on this itty-bitty screen.

40
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,059
He should have e-mailed
me a larger phone.

41
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,894
Why are you packing?

42
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,189
We're leaving this afternoon
for the conference

43
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,024
on pharmacology
and public policy.

44
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,484
We? We discussed this.

45
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,902
It's been on your
calendar for weeks.

46
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,070
So has Ramadan.

47
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,408
Think of it as a vacation.
Nice, healthy Adirondack air.

48
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,869
Or not, I don't care.
You're coming with.

49
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,414
You should come with me. State
Pillow-Fighting Championships.

50
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,541
Dollar beers, wet t-shirts.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,501
In the words of the
philosopher Eddie Money,

52
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,211
"I've got two tickets
to paradise."

53
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,673
House, when you moved in, I promised
your therapist I'd be here for you.

54
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,759
I can't be here if I'm there,
unless you're there, too.

55
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,052
So it's not a discussion.

56
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,721
Fine.

57
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:46,142
I'll let Foreman know that the 16-year-old
patient with the severe edema can wait.

58
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,563
Relax, I got no idea what's wrong
with her, so odds are not fatal.

59
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,316
Still not going.

60
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,154
She's got rhabdo.

61
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,282
Who wants to come to the
Pillow-Fighting Championships?

62
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,950
Rutgers has got a
great team this year.

63
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,577
So glad their anchor
didn't turn pro.

64
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,914
Sixteen-year-old girl suddenly has
the joints of an 80-year-old.

65
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,415
You think we can discuss
this for a second?

66
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,042
It's rhabdo.

67
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,207
Patient gave you the answer.

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,836
She fell down and went boom.

69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,089
We have to leave in an hour,
so should we eenie meenie?

70
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,343
The fall would explain the lower leg
damage, but not the swollen hands.

71
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,219
Hard landing caused
crushed muscles,

72
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,344
crushed muscles released
toxins into the bloodstream,

73
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,557
toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

74
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,894
Just another way of saying it's rhabdo.
Fifty-nine minutes.

75
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,187
She's a credit-card kid.

76
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,774
Parents are architects. They're
working on a project in Shanghai.

77
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,402
Could you be sitting any further away
from Chase and still be in the same room?

78
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,695
It doesn't have to be rhabdo.

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,021
The swelling could also be
caused by deep vein thrombosis.

80
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,783
She has allergies,
could be anaphylaxis,

81
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,284
or some heart condition
that we don't...

82
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,788
It can't really be any of those
things since it's rhabdo.

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,374
I know it's rhabdo,
Foreman knows it's rhabdo,

84
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,793
deep in his heart, even
Chase knows it's rhabdo.

85
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,046
Isn't it annoying when everybody in
the room knows something you don't?

86
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,341
I'll test for everything.

87
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,640
He's an ass.

88
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,975
Contrast is ready.

89
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,310
She already thinks
I'm cheating on her.

90
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,646
Maybe this is House's way
of telling you to talk to her.

91
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,566
Sure. "How was your day, honey?
By the way, I killed someone."

92
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,154
If I tell her, that's dumping
a burden on her forever.

93
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,242
Okay.

94
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,205
No sign of
obstructions or clots.

95
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,009
Tell me what you
came here for, House.

96
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,760
I've got a legitimate
medical reason.

97
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,179
You must be so proud.

98
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,515
I've forgotten it.

99
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,018
I guess it's no big deal
since I was only using it

100
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,104
as an excuse to come check
out Patty and Selma.

101
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,482
I feel bad. I haven't
named your testicles.

102
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,777
Word on the street is you set a
new personal best for low-cut.

103
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,864
I don't know why you chose to give
them the names of somebody's aunts.

104
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,783
It's a compliment.
They're always smoking.

105
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:12,705
I remember. I need you to authorize
the medical discharge of a minor.

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,499
That's why I'm holding
this in my hand.

107
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,962
Haven't finished
testing yet, but it's...

108
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,426
Your outbox is three times normal size.
That's not a metaphor.

109
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,056
There's a lot to be done
before the weekend.

110
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,977
You could take papers home with you.
Unless you're not gonna be home.

111
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,398
Unless you were, for example,
going to a medical conference.

112
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,775
I'm driving up with Wilson.

113
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,901
Me, too.

114
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,444
You aren't on the
registration list.

115
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,237
I love that you checked.

116
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,322
But Wilson said...

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,032
That I have a case? Yeah.

118
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,453
You're authorizing the discharge right now.
That was a metaphor.

119
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,342
I'm busy right now.

120
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,302
Is he dying? Yeah.

121
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,764
In the next 10 minutes?

122
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,267
Unfortunately, no.
He's in a lot of pain.

123
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,147
I thought about it. You're right,
I should go to the conference.

124
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,982
You found out Cuddy's going.

125
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,984
Oh, God, no.

126
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,445
She'll ruin everything.

127
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,281
We leave in two hours.

128
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,080
Please, morphine.

129
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,131
I'm right here.
I'm right here, Joseph.

130
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,098
Two days away. You think
I should pack Bally?

131
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,270
You can't leave. You lit a fuse,
you need to watch the bomb go off.

132
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,773
The bomb was gonna go off on
its own if you kept quiet.

133
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,317
So now you either have to
come up with a convincing lie

134
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,570
or tell her the truth.
Your choice.

135
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,739
CK levels point to rhabdo.

136
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,991
Of course.

137
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,870
Except for the part where imaging
shows no sign of muscle crush.

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,012
Hi. I'm your doctor,

139
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,098
and this is Lars Ulrich, greatest
metal drummer of all time.

140
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,851
You know the song?

141
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,478
Good. Drumstick.

142
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,856
Here's another drumstick.

143
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,943
I want you to rock out to the
music, the way you did last night.

144
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,530
Come on. This is a
classic medical test.

145
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,033
Hippocrates used it. Let's go.

146
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,000
Come on, you gotta keep time.
Crossover on the high-hat.

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,669
Let's head-bang.

148
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,632
House, what are you doing?

149
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,842
Chart said her potassium's low.

150
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,761
Rhabdo elevates potassium.

151
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,846
And the monkey drums.

152
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,684
Ergo, her levels must have
been really low last night.

153
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,478
Which causes...

154
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,066
I can't move them.

155
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,239
Temporary muscle paralysis.
Given this rate of muscle fatigue,

156
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,243
there's no way she could have climbed
stairs and then a fence to the pool.

157
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,704
Low potassium means no
jump, means no trauma.

158
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,123
Tests mean, yes, rhabdo.

159
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,378
Ergo, something else caused both
the rhabdo and the low potassium.

160
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,631
This time, start by getting
an accurate history.

161
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,176
Be careful, our patient's
a big, fat liar.

162
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,766
What did you
really do last night?

163
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,102
We need to find the cause
of your low potassium.

164
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,938
You could have a kidney
disorder, leukemia, adenoma.

165
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,232
We need to know about
any drugs or alcohol,

166
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,526
anything that might have
threatened your health.

167
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,152
Come on, Jord.

168
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,574
Okay, we didn't spend the
night with the band.

169
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,368
You can't tell our friends.

170
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,663
Have you heard of
Warrior Queen of Space?

171
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,872
It's a comic book, right?

172
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,082
Thank you, yes... Yeah.

173
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,459
And a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series,

174
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,086
and they're filming
the motion picture now.

175
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,088
It's a prequel.

176
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,257
The other girls
wouldn't get it.

177
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,301
Only Phoebe understands
my passion.

178
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,846
Only Phoebe understands
"the bushido of the heel."

179
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,684
So what actually
happened last night?

180
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,977
We were with our friends,

181
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,688
trying to get into the Pharmacide
tour party at the Adams.

182
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,775
And then I found out that Jeffrey
Keener was gonna be there.

183
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,236
I follow his tweets.

184
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,157
It's tragic that
I have to explain this.

185
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:11,003
He's the creator of Stiletto issue
number one and the TV show.

186
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,797
He's a god.

187
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,716
So did you guys go up to him?

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,884
God, no.

189
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,428
We keep a 10-foot rule.

190
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,153
It's not stalking if you don't go
up to the person and bother them.

191
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,224
So we just followed him around.

192
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,351
Discreetly.

193
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,313
He ditched after half an hour and went down
to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.

194
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,190
And you went with him?
Discreetly.

195
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,278
We played it so cool.

196
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,741
For two hours,
we lived his life.

197
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,787
We did everything he did, ate
the exact same meal he ate.

198
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,997
Cool.

199
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,791
The rest of
their story checks out.

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,919
Hotel manager says Mom and Dad
were charged for food and a room,

201
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,380
three pay-per-view
episodes of Stiletto...

202
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,966
You trying to kill yourself? It's
from the same batch the girls ate.

203
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,387
They ate what he ate, and what
100 other healthy people ate.

204
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,972
Dig in, lunch is on the Adams.

205
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,682
What if food is the answer?

206
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,812
Not this food, any food. Jordan
says she ate all of this.

207
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,814
She's 16, all about body image,

208
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,024
and she obviously
worries about fitting in.

209
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,818
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

210
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,022
We should do a barium swallow
for Mallory-Weiss tears,

211
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,864
start her on nutritional
supplements, get a psych consult.

212
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,744
Why are you reading
my program guide?

213
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,872
It's not like you plan on attending
any of the presentations.

214
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,166
I like to know how much
boredom I'm missing.

215
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,631
"Patient perceptions of complications
in end-stage chemotherapy."

216
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,758
You didn't tell me
you were giving a paper.

217
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:40,968
And that was wrong?

218
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,344
The last time you
presented a paper,

219
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,847
you gave me an advance copy
and asked for feedback.

220
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,143
And you're wondering why I wouldn't
want to repeat that experience?

221
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh, look, an '80s party.

222
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,524
Just when you think you've left Flock of
Seagulls behind in your rear-view mirror,

223
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,943
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

224
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,611
Cuddy's going.

225
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,657
Did you pack my legwarmers?

226
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,119
If you want her, ask her out.

227
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,871
My God, man.

228
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,790
She's not some floozy in a bar,

229
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,917
she's the floozy I work for.

230
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,004
There's gotta be no radical
steps here, gotta be subtle.

231
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,797
We happen to attend
the same party,

232
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,716
the chat happens
to turn personal.

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,302
Like the frog in
gradually boiling water.

234
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,553
Exactly.

235
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,055
She'll be red and delicious
before she knows it.

236
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,391
That's fun.

237
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,061
What could possibly go wrong?

238
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,232
Chase went to the gym
five times this week.

239
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,484
Okay.

240
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,360
One of those times,
I followed him.

241
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,570
What?

242
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,657
I followed him. And, yes, I know
how humiliating that admission is.

243
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,452
Where'd he go?

244
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,078
The gym. That time.

245
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,163
But I know that something's...

246
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,414
I'm stopping you right there.

247
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,209
This is a conversation you should
be having with Chase, not me.

248
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,211
I've tried having this
conversation with Chase.

249
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,838
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

250
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,089
Is he having an affair?

251
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,842
No.

252
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,552
Why should I believe you?

253
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,763
You shouldn't.
You should believe him.

254
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,768
Baby, how are you? Sweetie.

255
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,022
Jordan.

256
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,626
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate's fine.

257
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,692
BP's dropping. What's
happening to her?

258
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,818
No pulse.

259
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,197
Oh, my God. You said her
heart rate was fine.

260
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,325
Cardiac tamponade,
drain the fluid now.

261
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,077
What is going on?

262
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,205
She's bleeding
around her heart.

263
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,212
Blood constricted
her heart muscle.

264
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,632
She's on antiarrhythmics, but we don't
know how long we can keep her stable.

265
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,218
Seemed to be triggered by stress.
Her parents had just...

266
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,762
Did her blood pressure drop
during the barium swallow?

267
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,764
Dropped to 50 systolic
in three minutes.

268
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,140
Rules out chronic conditions.

269
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,102
Acute conditions limit us
to toxins, infections...

270
00:14:55,186 --> 00:15:00,274
Could be anything. A gas leak, arsenic in
the wallpaper, fungus in the shower...

271
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,484
I'll get samples from her
room and the restaurant.

272
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,027
Talk to our little Gossip Girl.

273
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,904
You need to know
exactly where she's been

274
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,824
and what she's done
in the last 24 hours.

275
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,992
Oh, I think...

276
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,544
Welcome to the convention,
Dr. Perlmutter.

277
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,879
It's my 25th consecutive year.

278
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,259
Perlmutter loves the '80s.

279
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,563
Do you need me to leave, too?

280
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,607
You might remember
stuff she doesn't.

281
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,443
We didn't do anything
we haven't told you about.

282
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:49,615
We hung out at Jordan's all day, and then
we called a limo to go into the city.

283
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,367
We stopped at Bruce
Springsteen's house.

284
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,788
Jord, don't joke around, okay?

285
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,125
You're really sick.
Just tell him the truth.

286
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,421
Bruce let me play the first
electric guitar he ever owned.

287
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,632
My God, why are you lying?

288
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,717
How can you not believe me?

289
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,136
Turn to your right.

290
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,982
Mr. Keener, I really
appreciate you coming.

291
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,152
Oh, it's not that much of a hike.
My room's only six floors up.

292
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,364
Last night, do you remember
two girls, about 16?

293
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,366
That table right there.

294
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,076
They made an impression.

295
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,495
They were hard to miss, with
the giggling and the staring.

296
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,664
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot.

297
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot more.

298
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,340
She can't control it.

299
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,594
A bleed in her brain is affecting
her thalamus, causing her to lie.

300
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,098
We need to know everything.
You two were never apart?

301
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,601
Except for when
she went to go get ice.

302
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,520
But that couldn't
have taken very long.

303
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,604
You don't know?

304
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,022
It was in the
middle of the night.

305
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,274
I woke up when she came
back into the room.

306
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,985
And she told you
she went to get ice?

307
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,466
House.

308
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,386
1980s.

309
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,598
Are you sure?
They weren't specific.

310
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,892
How much did it
cost you to rent that?

311
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,811
It was in Wilson's bag.

312
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,815
Dr. Perlmutter. I read your
article on neural degeneration.

313
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,276
You didn't really take
that seriously, did you?

314
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,695
I just wrote that
for the money.

315
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,241
Well, hey, there, Jane Fonda,
would you care to dancercise?

316
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,286
Sorry, we were just
about to hit the floor.

317
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,704
Thank you.

318
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,873
Your leg?

319
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,168
I'm okay, as long as you
don't expect rhythm.

320
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,274
You remember the
last time we danced?

321
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,194
Med school. The week we met.

322
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,362
No.

323
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,409
I saw you in Endocrinology,
tracked you down to the hoe-down.

324
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,704
I meant we met before that.
In the bookstore.

325
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,291
Ah.

326
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,587
My third day of school.

327
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,215
I hand my syllabus to the
guy behind the counter.

328
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,842
He barely looks at me,
just skims the sheet

329
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,803
and tells me
I'm overly ambitious,

330
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,223
I have a chip on my shoulder
and I know how to party.

331
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,435
I'd forgotten you
knew how to party.

332
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,188
I said, "You're
making that up."

333
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,565
Then you said, "Your class
schedule is overloaded",

334
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,901
"but none of your classes
are before 11:00,"

335
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,323
"and no one takes Professor Lamb's course
unless they have something to prove."

336
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,993
Because Professor Siegal covered the
same ground and was the easier grader.

337
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:26,706
I tracked you down.
Endocrinology, the party.

338
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,252
And one thing led to another.

339
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,671
And then it didn't.

340
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,508
I was gonna call you.

341
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,261
No, don't do that.

342
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,680
There was no expectations.
I was just as into it...

343
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,474
I was gonna come see you.

344
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,435
Figure out where things
would go from there.

345
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,188
That was the morning I got
the call from the dean,

346
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,283
and I was expelled from
my first med school.

347
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,317
There didn't seem any point.

348
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,243
I should go to my room and review papers
for the infectious disease panel.

349
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,346
Hello.

350
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,977
Yeah. Thanks for telling me.

351
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,277
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Somebody better be dead.

352
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,488
My patient. Joseph Schultz.

353
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,912
Oh.

354
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,959
Under the circumstances, it was the best
thing that could have happened, right?

355
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:56,338
Yeah. I just wish
I'd been there.

356
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,258
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

357
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,802
Yes, it was almost 9:30.

358
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,763
Things didn't go
as you planned?

359
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,806
We've moved on to a new phase.

360
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,693
I tell Cuddy that I've
always been interested

361
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,518
in her, and she walks
out of the room.

362
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,771
Well, either she
just wasn't ready for that,

363
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:18,026
or maybe she was just surprised
and didn't know how to react.

364
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,613
What are you doing?

365
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,448
Interesting reflex
of guilt just now.

366
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,117
Your patient's been
dying for six weeks,

367
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,995
you couldn't have predicted
that he'd go this weekend.

368
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,538
Or could you?

369
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:43,009
"Euthanasia. Let's tell the truth.
We all do it."

370
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,180
It's a great opening line.

371
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,807
Are you insane?

372
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,060
I didn't want
your notes before,

373
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,687
and I don't want them now.

374
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,864
Well, she didn't get ice.

375
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,951
She got out in the lobby.
She could've gone anywhere.

376
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,954
Let's start with for
how long. Fast forward.

377
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,376
Stop. Rewind. Back.

378
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,089
Wherever she went, she was only
gone for like five minutes.

379
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,507
She's holding something.

380
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,758
That's Keener's journal.

381
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,177
He must have left it in the
restaurant that night.

382
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,179
She went back, claimed
it belonged to her.

383
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,265
She was looking for an
excuse to knock on his door.

384
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,356
I know what you're gonna say.

385
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:42,694
I'm not insane.
Doctors are rarely indicted.

386
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,866
I was just thinking
of your career.

387
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,162
But, yeah, if you're one of the
doctors occasionally indicted,

388
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,663
I guess it could affect that.

389
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:59,210
Someone needs to say what life is really
like, now, for people who are dying.

390
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,535
What doctors
have to go through.

391
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,672
The decisions we have to make.

392
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,299
Alone. Without guidance.

393
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,636
Someone should say that, in an
unsigned letter to the Times.

394
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,241
I'd be telling the truth. I'd be
saying what we're all thinking.

395
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,557
Who cares?

396
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,893
The oncology department is
subsidized by drug companies,

397
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,853
they don't want it
run by a murderer.

398
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,980
We're all murderers. We just
don't have the guts to admit...

399
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,815
And once again, who cares?

400
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,026
You won't be hirable. Anywhere.

401
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,904
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

402
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,906
it's that I should do
what I think is right,

403
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,617
and not worry about
the consequences.

404
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,331
Yeah, it's worked
out great for me.

405
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,468
I don't mean to be rude,

406
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,595
but I'm expecting a notes call from LA.
Can we make this quick?

407
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,472
Did Jordan come to your
room the other night?

408
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,726
Let me put it another way. We know Jordan
came to your room the other night.

409
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,187
Look, I've tried to be helpful.

410
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,648
I don't know why you want to
pretend I'm lying to you,

411
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,732
but this is getting
too weird for me.

412
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,400
We need to search your room.

413
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,653
You don't, because
she was never here.

414
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,947
Allison, calm down.

415
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,158
You would cover your ass at the
expense of someone's life?

416
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,911
We know she brought
up your journal.

417
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,043
That was helpful.

418
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,214
He'd be crazy to risk his marriage for
a one-night stand. With a teenager.

419
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,425
Sensible people only risk their
marriage for something more serious?

420
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,344
I'm not having an affair.

421
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,595
We're talking about Keener.

422
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,013
Fine.

423
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,474
He doesn't care about his
marriage, what about his career?

424
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,767
Statutory rape would ruin it.

425
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,311
It's admitting statutory
rape that could ruin it.

426
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,730
Which is why we'll never
hear the truth out of him.

427
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,482
Roofies OD explains
all her symptoms.

428
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,693
We should start treating
her with flumazenil.

429
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,656
Isn't the MRSA panel going on?

430
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,033
We got kicked out.
She started crying.

431
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:58,204
Yeah, well, discussions of urinary
catheterization will do that to me, too.

432
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,123
The babysitter
had an emergency.

433
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:05,587
Oh, how did you
like '80s Night?

434
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,796
House talked with you?

435
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,260
I was being subtle about it.
You left suddenly.

436
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,180
I know House can be
a little much sometimes.

437
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,058
He was sweet. I just know
better than to rely on that.

438
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:21,978
He's trying.

439
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,479
Yeah. I know.

440
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm a mother now. I need a guy I
can count on every single day.

441
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,031
That's never been House.

442
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,000
It's not roofies. She's
bleeding behind her kidneys.

443
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,336
We're transfusing another
two units packed red cells,

444
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,837
but she keeps springing leaks.

445
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,048
It looks like a toxic reaction.

446
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,716
Keener must have
given her something.

447
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,469
The guy's a comic book
writer, not a drug dealer.

448
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,596
There's a lot that wouldn't show
up on a standard tox screen.

449
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,848
But he's never gonna
tell us the truth.

450
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,601
We're not going to get the
truth out of her either.

451
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,606
We will if we drug her.

452
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,568
Amobarbital would
suppress her thalamus.

453
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,988
She's on antiarrhythmics.
Amobarbital could stop her heart.

454
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,907
She's already dying.

455
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,743
You're angry at me.

456
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,871
You're taking it out on this guy 'cause
you think he's lying to you, too,

457
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,791
and you're going to kill our
patient in the process.

458
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,460
We need to know the truth.

459
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,045
We should call House.

460
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,340
Yeah, he'll recommend
we take the cautious approach.

461
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,890
Pretzel?

462
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,060
Those are gonna show up on my
credit card at seven bucks a bag.

463
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,187
There's an all-you-can-
eat buffet downstairs.

464
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:51,025
Studies show that $10 wine tastes better
if you're told that it costs $90.

465
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,696
I'm sure the same thing
must be true of grape soda.

466
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,698
Have one.

467
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,910
We can toast your
impending unemployment.

468
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,337
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

469
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,881
or you can go get the
woman of your dreams.

470
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,135
I didn't know Angela Merkel
was attending the conference.

471
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,680
I just spoke with Cuddy. She
doesn't think you're reliable.

472
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,143
And you will remain friend-zoned
until that changes.

473
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:29,147
I can't convince her that I've changed
my entire personality in a weekend.

474
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,108
Yeah, but you could
make the first step.

475
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,192
What does she need?

476
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,069
Today, a babysitter.

477
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,783
What are you thinking about?

478
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:41,951
Fjords.

479
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:46,831
You see? Seriously, I know this
is out of your comfort zone,

480
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,918
but don't scheme, don't...
Just do the deed...

481
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,844
You tell me that I gotta
show her I've changed,

482
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,882
and yet you act like
you don't believe I can.

483
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,134
If I can't convince
my best friend...

484
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,513
I'm sorry, and that's... I didn't mean...
I didn't mean...

485
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,059
I didn't mean...

486
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,940
You drugged me.

487
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,488
She's better off without you.

488
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,162
Words can hurt, you know.

489
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,709
I thought truth serum was only stuff
they gave people in lame spy movies.

490
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,088
We know you're scared, and we
know you want to tell the truth.

491
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,881
We're going to
help you do that.

492
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,765
What happened between you and Keener
the night you went up to his room?

493
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,392
I couldn't believe
he even talked to me.

494
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,063
I told him how much
his work means to me.

495
00:28:55,192 --> 00:29:00,029
I figured I must sound like a
moron, but he was nice about it.

496
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,865
He said I was special.

497
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,244
Heart rate's increasing.

498
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,329
140's acceptable. Let her talk.

499
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,290
Did he give you
anything, a drink, pills?

500
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,751
He said it was Ecstasy.

501
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,503
But it didn't
look like Ecstasy.

502
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,507
And it didn't really make me
feel how Ecstasy usually does.

503
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,259
How did it make you feel?

504
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,261
It just made me really tired.

505
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,180
What did it look like?
A capsule? Tablet?

506
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,766
It was a tablet. Round.

507
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,017
Could be lithium.

508
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,062
He just started touching me.

509
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,732
At first, it seemed
nice, but then...

510
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,319
I didn't want to insult him.

511
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,571
That's enough.

512
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,617
I'm so sorry.

513
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,414
I love you guys
so much and I just...

514
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,208
I feel like I've let you down.

515
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,336
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna
kill that son of a bitch.

516
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,797
Before you do that, look here.

517
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,468
Increased periorbital
blood flow throughout.

518
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,929
It means everything she's
been saying has been a lie.

519
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,183
Everything?

520
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,479
So you still don't know
what's wrong with her?

521
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,938
Sorry.

522
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,488
I thought you
were room service.

523
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,491
Is something going on
with your patient?

524
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,452
It's quiet in there.
Is Rachel asleep?

525
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,748
I thought maybe you
could use a babysitter.

526
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,879
Actually, I've got her
in daycare downstairs.

527
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,963
Oh.

528
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,425
Great. Maybe later.

529
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,696
Hey, House.

530
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,366
Hey, Lucas.

531
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,992
This is awkward.

532
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,202
A bit.

533
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,708
That awkwardness would
probably go away if I left.

534
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,187
Hello? It's Foreman.

535
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,152
I'm trying to update House,
but his phone's off.

536
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,650
House!

537
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,778
He's not here.

538
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,239
Patient's losing blood faster
than we can transfuse.

539
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,004
Cameron did an online search, found
out Keener travels with his dog.

540
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:54,078
We're treating for Rickettsia.
Any idea where he is?

541
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,165
Oh, no! I was supposed to be
giving a paper five minutes ago.

542
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,837
Okay. Okay.

543
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,217
Dr. Wilson has asked me to tender
his apologies for his absence.

544
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,678
You'll be hearing
my paper instead.

545
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,473
Unfortunately, there wasn't time
to correct the program schedule.

546
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,145
Euthanasia.
Let's tell the truth.

547
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,524
We all do it. We just
don't talk about it.

548
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,404
We play the game. We use other words,
or we don't use any words at all.

549
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,655
Hmm.

550
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,449
Nice phrasing.

551
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,161
Hello.

552
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,459
I don't know what department I want.
I need

553
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:44,920
pants.

554
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:49,800
Patient S, 55-year-old man
end-stage lung cancer.

555
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:54,347
His pain was beyond the point where
we could even pretend to treat it.

556
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,599
I showed him how to use
the morphine pump.

557
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,893
I told him too much
morphine would kill him,

558
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,938
but not to worry, the machine
only gives out so much.

559
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,275
To override it, you need
to enter a special code.

560
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,486
I went to the door
and told the nurse,

561
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,573
"The code is 328."
I said it loudly.

562
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,578
When he first
came to my office,

563
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:21,540
I'd told him I would be with
him every step of the way.

564
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,336
But I left him
alone at the end.

565
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,129
I broke that promise.

566
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,258
To cover my ass, I failed...

567
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,271
I was wrong when I wrote that.

568
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,733
I've never given
any less than my best.

569
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,613
I'm incapable of turning
away from a responsibility.

570
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,994
My friends take advantage
of that fact far too often.

571
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,707
I know that I gave that
man everything I could.

572
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,251
And I know that
he knew that, too.

573
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:13,008
This is a burden no one
should have to carry alone.

574
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,430
And this is a decision
no one should make alone.

575
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,392
Because, frankly,
I don't trust all of you.

576
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,186
Doctor! Doctor!

577
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,814
Doctor! Question!

578
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,236
Excuse me, Doctor. Not many
people would have your courage.

579
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,947
Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter.

580
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,500
Hey!

581
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:52,757
Before I start shouting, Foreman
says they're looking at Rickettsia.

582
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,259
Thanks for the
message. Continue.

583
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,510
What the hell?

584
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,471
You think that little shout
out is gonna make me forget

585
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,682
that you drugged me, hid
my pants, stole my speech?

586
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,518
You wanted the paper out there.
It's out there.

587
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,936
And your job is safe.

588
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,229
That was my paper.

589
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,941
You don't ask what I want, you
ignore my wishes, you drug me...

590
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,861
I'm waiting for you to name
something new to our relationship.

591
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,363
You got no good reason
to be angry with me.

592
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,074
Oh, really? I should
be thanking you?

593
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,619
If this was about getting the
story out there, then, yeah.

594
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,871
Of course, if this is actually
about something else,

595
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,540
maybe you feeling impotent
because patients keep dying,

596
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,668
and you think you need to make some
grand, stupid gesture, need to be a hero,

597
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,464
well, then, yeah, sorry,
I did screw it up.

598
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,468
You stepped over the line.
This was not your decision.

599
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,597
My God, there are 10,000
oncologists in this country,

600
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,182
every one of them
loses patients,

601
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,017
but only you would
feel guilty enough...

602
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,984
Of course. We can't even
argue on my schedule.

603
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,697
It's House.

604
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,913
Take down the bags.

605
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,373
It's too soon to tell
if the meds are gonna...

606
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,833
It's not the meds.

607
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,793
It's the blood
that's killing her.

608
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,629
What's everybody doing?
You're stunned, right?

609
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,214
I mean, blood?

610
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,342
She's had internal bleeding,
she needs the blood to...

611
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,595
Is that the mom? I got a good
comeback if it's the mom.

612
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,931
Yes, I'm her mother.

613
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,142
Sure, she needs blood,
if you want to kill her.

614
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,145
Then you'd have nobody left to neglect.
Great plan.

615
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,606
Your daughter has
Vibrio vulnificus,

616
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,860
courtesy of a few scrumptious
oysters on the half shell.

617
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,028
I didn't eat any oysters.

618
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,531
Thus proving that she did.
Boy, that's neat.

619
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,992
A hundred other people
ate those oysters. I ate...

620
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,202
Is that the dad?
I got a good comeback if...

621
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,537
It's Chase.

622
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,245
Oh. Thought the dad might
have been Australian, too.

623
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,043
There was nothing wrong with the oysters.
All oysters have Vibrio.

624
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:56,088
But almost no one
has hemochromatosis.

625
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,384
It'd give her a unique susceptibility
to Vibrio, cause the swollen joints.

626
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,679
It got attributed to bulimia,
so she got supplements.

627
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,972
With iron.

628
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,558
Which overcooked the liver,
which caused bleeding.

629
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,561
More blood, more iron,
more bleeding, more blood.

630
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,104
Is she going to be okay?

631
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,149
Only if we give her high-dose
ceftazidime for the Vibrio

632
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,318
and chelate for
the hemochromatosis.

633
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,321
Now, Cameron, pick up the phone
and give me a dramatic exit.

634
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:37,171
So, how did you
two crazy kids hook up?

635
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,049
I suspected someone in
accounting was skimming money,

636
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,134
and I wanted to
investigate quietly.

637
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,347
And since you introduced me to
the only detective I know...

638
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,182
One thing leads to another.

639
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:59,026
Why keep it a secret? Were you
protecting me in my fragile state?

640
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,486
You think I was
an unhinged loony

641
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,906
who was about to go off the rails
at a badly-timed bit of news?

642
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,742
I just don't advertise
my personal life.

643
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,370
I needed help with the
baby, Lucas drove up.

644
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,163
Yeah, she was worried.

645
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,043
A little worried. As a friend.

646
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:21,507
I had to hide in our room and be the
dirty little secret. Kind of sucked.

647
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,300
I told her it wasn't necessary.

648
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,762
So you had some hallucination
about having sex with her.

649
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,431
I don't think
we need to talk...

650
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,644
I mean, I imagine having sex with
women all the time. No big deal.

651
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,273
Though I guess if they knew what I
imagined, it could get awkward.

652
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,153
And I guess it's different because
in the fantasy, she was your savior.

653
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,280
But I mean, that was
months ago, right?

654
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,908
All the work that you had
to do to get straight.

655
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:51,286
You've been institutionalized, you've
had way bigger stuff to deal with.

656
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,080
I should shut up.

657
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,212
Can I buy you a ginger ale?

658
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,591
Ginger ale would
be good. With lemon.

659
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,139
Infection's clearing up nicely.

660
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,682
You should be out of
here in a few days.

661
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,684
That is wonderful.

662
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,855
Jack, how are you?

663
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,189
Sweetie,

664
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,027
your father and I think we should reward
ourselves with a little time off.

665
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,237
That meeting's gonna have
to wait a couple of weeks.

666
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,531
We're staying here.

667
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,742
You should think about
where you'd like to go.

668
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,952
Honey, they're saying the specs
are off for the whole foundation.

669
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,412
Can you at least
come talk to him?

670
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,205
Let me see.

671
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,713
You okay? Yeah.

672
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,760
No. Soil engineering
report was fine.

673
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,261
I'm used to it.

674
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,306
So, about what
happened that night...

675
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,898
I never even got up the
courage to knock on his door.

676
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,700
Well, you'll have to
send me their numbers.

677
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,581
Yay!

678
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,342
You want to go driving?

679
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,553
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

680
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,517
Mini-bar's re-stocked. I say we
grab some pretzels for the road...

681
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,936
When you do what I did,

682
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,689
it's not enough to tell
yourself you did nothing wrong.

683
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,650
You need to hear it
from someone else.

684
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:51,740
If not God or society, a friend,
otherwise you go crazy.

685
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,035
What you said to me up there...

686
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,540
Thank you.

687
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,293
You're a good friend.
Cuddy should know that.

688
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,338
Yeah, you should let her
know that I drugged you

689
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,050
so you wouldn't confess to murder.
Let's get out of here.

690
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,680
Someone could have
recognized you.

691
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,975
First US conference
I've attended in 15 years.

692
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,351
Perlmutter?

693
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,146
Toronto, all weekend,
airtight alibi.

694
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,116
I'm sorry.

695
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,121
I don't know why I always
suspect the worst.

696
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,832
If you say you're
not having an affair,

697
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,710
you're not having an affair.

698
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,179
Oh, God. You are? I'm not.

699
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,639
Okay. Sorry. Again.

700
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,940
If you don't wanna tell,

701
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,943
okay.

702
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,947
But I could help.

703
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,160
Whatever this is,
it's eating away at you.

704
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,788
We could get past it together.

705
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,211
I love you no matter what.

706
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,351
We lose patients sometimes.

707
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,314
One of those patients,

708
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,984
Dibala,

709
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,405
we didn't actually lose him.

710
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,038
I killed him.
