1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,258
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,343
Then don't eat it.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,179
Used to be a full breakfast service.
They're trying to starve us.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,014
You're worried about the food?

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,350
No, I'm worried about
what the food represents.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,353
I've got seven scenes to shoot today
on half of what we used to spend.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,605
We're going through a recession.
It is what it is.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,482
Yeah, but nobody's
gonna bail us out.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,819
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet,

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,155
now the back-office bean counters
are vetoing half my ideas.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,450
So we can kind of make it
about the performances.

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,868
You okay?

13
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,078
Bit of a headache.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,329
If you need an ibuprofen...

15
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,054
I need you to put your
game face on, right?

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,291
Screw the bagels, screw the
sets, screw the wardrobe.

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,377
You have any idea
how lucky we are?

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,045
We get to do something we like,

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,590
we get to touch people's
lives, and we get paid for it.

20
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,175
Let's make a movie.

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,677
Hey, baby.

22
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
All right. Roll camera.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,770
And

24
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,565
action.

25
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,781
What's wrong?

26
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,869
My eyes. They
feel like they're exploding.

27
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,497
All right. Turn off
the damn light.

28
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,624
Get an ambulance. Now!

29
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,456
We're gonna be late for work.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,707
Then we'll be late.

31
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,131
You took a patient's life.
You lied about it for weeks,

32
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,760
you broke who knows how many
laws and oaths to cover it up,

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,387
but I can live with it.

34
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,475
We can get through it together.

35
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,731
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

36
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,317
and what it means
to hear you say that.

37
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,612
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

38
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,868
You can barely walk by the rooms
where Dibala was treated.

39
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:44,413
Why should we live with that
hanging over our heads?

40
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,876
If there was ever
a time to turn the page...

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,424
Three-month-old with fever,

42
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,219
incessant drooling,
and chronic muscle weakness.

43
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:05,017
Or porn actor Hank Hardwick, born Henry
Lefkowitz, totally clean workup,

44
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,353
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

45
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,522
Or an infant as limp
as a rag doll.

46
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,691
Yeah. Let's wait till
Chase and Cameron get here.

47
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,943
I have the feeling they'll have
the good sense to side with me.

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,320
Doesn't matter who they side
with, I'm still in charge.

49
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,614
We're taking the
limp three-month-old.

50
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,742
Oh, good, you paged
the limpness specialist.

51
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,544
This envelope is oddly
medical-licensed shaped.

52
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,880
Congratulations.

53
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,512
House is back in charge.
We get to treat a porn star.

54
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,889
Congratulations.

55
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,974
Perfect timing for us.

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,186
We're leaving the team and the
hospital, effective immediately.

57
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,106
It's kind of sudden.

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,351
Unless you've been circulating
your résumés for a while.

59
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,278
We're just starting to think about
new jobs, where we want to live.

60
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,614
Moving, too. Interesting.

61
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,865
Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,951
Yes.

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,330
We'll miss you.

64
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,415
We'll miss all of you, too.

65
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,209
We'll start clearing
out our things.

66
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,591
Run an STD panel
and a tox screen,

67
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,052
send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation

68
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,012
and an ANA to screen
for autoimmune.

69
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,642
The rest of you take a history and do
an LP to rule out viral encephalitis.

70
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,727
Oh, it's just you.

71
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,273
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,235
I get tested
for STDs regularly,

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
so does everyone I work with.

74
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,531
Since I'm guessing you don't
take their word for it...

75
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,578
All right. I'm gonna need you to lie on
your side and put your knees to your chest.

76
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,039
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,460
My wife used to smoke a little
pot, but I never touch the stuff.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,878
You're married?

79
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,130
Happily. Two years now.

80
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,383
She happy you do porn?

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,885
Very. Since she does it, too.

82
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,098
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

83
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,557
It's a job.

84
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,133
Once you start letting your
work life rule your home life,

85
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,897
especially if you're in the same line of
work, your relationship's gonna be short.

86
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,400
You're gonna feel
a little pressure.

87
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,943
Any history of sexual abuse?

88
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,736
I defy the cliché.

89
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,905
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

90
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,575
Let me save you some time. There's
not a blotch on my medical record.

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,078
Look, I know most
of the people in my field

92
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,414
are drug addicts
with daddy issues.

93
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,501
But I'm a nice Jewish boy from the 'burbs.
I wasn't driven to this.

94
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,005
I chose it. I believe in it.
I actually think it's...

95
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,341
My arms are killing me.

96
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,593
Looks like tetany. Your
muscles are contracting.

97
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,886
Need some meperidine in here.

98
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,430
Oh, God.

99
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:52,226
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

100
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,604
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

101
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,942
Four candidates,
three slots on the team.

102
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,319
Need to know if you've still
got your diagnostic chops.

103
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,655
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day.

104
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,158
I have my weekends again.
I recognize my wife again.

105
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,786
Yeah, I agree, does sound pretty dull.
No wonder you want to work for me.

106
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,540
Tox screen was clean, we ruled
out viral encephalitis.

107
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,965
The only obstacle to you
coming back is your wife,

108
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,303
which has never been that
much of an obstacle to you.

109
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,184
Maybe you're right.

110
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,439
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

111
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,399
Tumor, seizure...

112
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,906
Taub seems to think the
link has to be the brain,

113
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,230
but eye and muscle are governed

114
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:53,579
by different parts of the patient's
second-favorite organ, which means it's...

115
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,665
Thailand was wonderful,
thanks for asking.

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,502
Of course, yes,
it has to be multi-focal.

117
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,213
I have an interview with a community
health clinic in two hours.

118
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,299
Backup plan's fine, but Taub's
swinging for the fences.

119
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,884
I suggest you don't
divide your attention.

120
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,929
Good point. I won't
divide my attention then.

121
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,306
Taub thinks
it's a brain issue,

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,016
Thirteen thinks
it's multi-focal.

123
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,768
And neither of
them wants to work here.

124
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
Don't take their word for it.

125
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,605
Taub's problem is his wife,
Thirteen's problem is you,

126
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,608
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

127
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,361
None of them has a
problem with the work.

128
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,156
Cerebral vasculitis would explain
both the eye and arm findings.

129
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,368
Steroids to treat, brain
angiogram to confirm,

130
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,372
EMG and a nerve biopsy while you're at it.
I'll be at lunch.

131
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,001
I'd hire all four, but a
five-person team seems unwieldy.

132
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,004
Who would you turn down?

133
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,465
I'll have whatever he's buying.

134
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,426
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

135
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,638
There are a thousand people in the
world who want to be on your staff,

136
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,640
but you're going after
the four who don't.

137
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,145
They don't because their lives are
irrelevantly and annoyingly complicated,

138
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,273
which makes them confused, which
makes them make poor decisions.

139
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,774
And your life is simple?

140
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,735
You went all the way up to the medical
conference to cozy up to Cuddy.

141
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,489
Instead, she's dating one of two people
in the world you think of as a friend.

142
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,324
There's no way
that's not devastating.

143
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,451
So I had
an attraction of sorts.

144
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,911
Yeah, the sort in which

145
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,165
your imaginary tryst landed
you in a mental hospital.

146
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,459
And I got help,
and she got Lucas,

147
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,171
who bought me a ginger ale.
It's all fine.

148
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,089
Which won't be true
of my department

149
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,426
unless I can figure out
which doctor I'm not hiring.

150
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:35,598
I suppose throwing yourself into your
work isn't the worst thing you could do.

151
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,475
What is the worst
thing I could do?

152
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,854
House thinks
it's cerebral vasculitis.

153
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,356
If you could just do the brain angio
while I finish up the blood work...

154
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,566
We're out the door.

155
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,651
He's got me running every
test and treatment by myself.

156
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,528
Which is why you should
be out the door, too.

157
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,656
This is completely
unreasonable, even for House.

158
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,201
You owe me this.

159
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you.

160
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,711
You really believe
this is cerebral vasculitis?

161
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,837
Could be.

162
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,466
House wants to thread a
catheter through his brain,

163
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,926
which could cause a vasospasm,

164
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,261
give steroids, which could spread
infection all over the place,

165
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,471
because it could be.

166
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,139
Sounds like House.

167
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,059
It could also be a severe
vitamin D deficiency.

168
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,895
He has a restrictive diet,
works long hours indoors,

169
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,357
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

170
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,921
You're saying I
shouldn't do the angio?

171
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,402
House ordered it, Foreman wants
it, of course we should do it.

172
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,029
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

173
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,697
You sure?

174
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,075
Because right now I'd basically
do anything you asked me.

175
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,787
I'm not interested in guilting you.
We're moving on.

176
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,167
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

177
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,670
blast him with ultraviolet
light and IV vitamins

178
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,381
for his severe
vitamin D deficiency.

179
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,011
Do you guys actually
work together?

180
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,598
We did at first. But now we like
to keep our films pretty separate.

181
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,393
So, do you watch her work?

182
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,603
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,107
Think what you want, but
we're proud of what we do.

184
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,401
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

185
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,070
Emotion is emotional,
sex is mechanical.

186
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,447
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

187
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,616
Certainly not in your world.

188
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,785
We've helped a lot of couples

189
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,746
by taking sex out of
some deep, dark dungeon.

190
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,375
Do what you want without
some big moral comeuppance.

191
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,045
You think you can escape the
consequences, but you can't.

192
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,631
You don't get to make
your own rules and morals.

193
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,468
Well, you're here to treat him,
not lecture us about our...

194
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,347
Hank, are you all right?
Are you okay?

195
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,057
Just a nosebleed.

196
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,645
Inside his leg?

197
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,149
Petechial hemorrhages.

198
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,693
We were wrong, so was Foreman.

199
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,950
Patient's blood won't clot.
We're back to square one.

200
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,245
And you're back in my office. So
much for playing hard to get.

201
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,748
We're just here
to help Foreman.

202
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,333
Is that...

203
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,001
He's not without talent.

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,297
UV rays made the patient's capillaries
more fragile, hastening the onset of DIC.

205
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,798
Sounds like sepsis...
But isn't.

206
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,800
No sign of shock,
no drop in blood pressure.

207
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:17,968
Can we turn that off?

208
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,304
Right, because Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

209
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,015
I don't care what he does.
I don't care what you watch.

210
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,642
I just think it's annoying that he
pretends it's some beautiful life

211
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,895
we should all be aspiring to.

212
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,688
Left shift points
to bacteremia.

213
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,901
No fever, plus it wouldn't explain
the spasmodic muscle contractions.

214
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,695
The ball-and-chain
smacked you down.

215
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,866
But widespread petechial rash,
nervous system involvement...

216
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,245
It's some kind of blood infection.
Meningococcemia.

217
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,207
Start the patient
on heparin for the DIC,

218
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,251
broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.

219
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,796
Dr. Cameron.

220
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,676
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lock-step with you again.

221
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,055
I guess he finally told you
that he iced Idi Amin Jr.

222
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,539
Does that mean he can break the
other nine commandments, too?

223
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,309
Taking the Lord's
name in vain, sure,

224
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,020
but coveting thy
neighbor's wife?

225
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,480
Is she hot?

226
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,565
I've forgiven him.

227
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,234
Not for murder. Not you.

228
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,361
Doesn't matter
how evil Dibala was.

229
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,323
By every conscience-hugging,
Mother-Teresa-loving bone in your body,

230
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,409
you should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

231
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,327
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

232
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,578
We're not talking
about my position,

233
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,247
we're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

234
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,999
Here's what doesn't add up. If you
were serious about staffing your team,

235
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,710
you would know exactly which
three fellows you wanted.

236
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,755
You plowed ahead with this case even
though you hadn't hired new fellows

237
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,425
because you knew Foreman would
ask Chase and me to help,

238
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,593
giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

239
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,429
I don't want that.

240
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,098
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

241
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,269
A, my firing Chase was the only
reason you left two years ago.

242
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:55,107
B, when the full horror of his homicide
hits you, your marriage will blow up.

243
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,361
And Z, the only obstacle of you
working here will be gone.

244
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,366
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

245
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,622
Meningococcemia's spread
person-to-person.

246
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,126
Something you ought to think about
next time you show up for work.

247
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,212
It's okay,
your wife's not here.

248
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,335
I'm just telling you what...

249
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,134
You have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

250
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,583
But I can tell from all
the questions you ask

251
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,972
that you're more like
me than you admit.

252
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm a guy, I look around every once
in a while, but I love my wife.

253
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,979
I love the fact that she's the
only one that I'm intimate with.

254
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:39,109
And no part of you wants to just toss
this rulebook everyone's forced on you?

255
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,987
No part of you wants a
life of actual commitment?

256
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,573
Is my relationship perfect? No.

257
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,495
Am I ever horny when my wife has
just had sex for nine hours? Yes.

258
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,166
But we are committed to each
other in every way that matters.

259
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,834
In other words,
you're committed,

260
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,420
except when you're
not committed.

261
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,797
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

262
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,967
Conscience? You mean
that thing that kicks in

263
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,180
when there's no logical reason to
behave the way people want you to?

264
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,434
What? You have a fever.

265
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,605
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

266
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,526
Mr. Takayama?

267
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,735
Yes.

268
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,197
I'm really happy with what the
last guy did with my eyes,

269
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,493
but why would broad-spectrum antibiotics
fail to work on meningococcemia?

270
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,829
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a real patient. Mr...

271
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,208
Hitler? Really?

272
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,020
I had to do something
to amuse myself while

273
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,772
your receptionist fought
with her boyfriend.

274
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,046
Who's next?

275
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,841
A guy who needs two decades' worth of
corn chips hoovered out of his neck,

276
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,387
or a guy who can't stand daylight
and whose blood won't clot.

277
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,763
You do the triage.

278
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,056
Who's the jerk?

279
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,142
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

280
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,312
I told you. I'm content
at home and at work.

281
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,314
But you're not
content with content.

282
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,400
It's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,

283
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,735
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

284
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,320
At bridge.

285
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,865
My wife and I play
a lot of bridge.

286
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,450
Why you worked on the case
the last time I was here.

287
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,577
I gave you a theory,

288
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,061
just like I'd help a guy who needs
a Heimlich in a restaurant,

289
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,789
and then I shut
the door behind you.

290
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,500
Yeah. But you'd knock over three
other doctors to give it to him.

291
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,335
Metaphorically speaking,
you're a Heimlich addict.

292
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,712
And you're an addiction addict.

293
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,637
Right now, your drug of
choice is your old team,

294
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,799
and like any addict, you're trying
to solve some other problem,

295
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,084
and it's not gonna work. If
you'll excuse me, I have a...

296
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,762
You have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

297
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,765
Yes, I do nose jobs, just like the
guy who came here after a car crash,

298
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,435
couldn't even breathe
through his...

299
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,818
Antibiotics wouldn't work if his
sinuses were infected and clogged,

300
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,989
if there was a pocket of bacteria
his blood vessels couldn't reach.

301
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,701
You surgically drain his
sinuses, the drugs will work.

302
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,369
Nice.

303
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,414
Tell me that didn't feel good.

304
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,916
See you tomorrow.

305
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,045
Not coming back.

306
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,472
Looks like quite a trip.

307
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,060
It was.

308
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,937
House send you to talk to me?

309
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,064
No.

310
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,776
Then there's nothing to talk about.
I don't want to work for him.

311
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,239
You're a great doctor. House is
right to want you in the mix.

312
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,326
You saying this because you
still have feelings for me

313
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,570
and you want me to come back?

314
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,080
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

315
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,749
Do you have feelings
for me or not?

316
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,503
I don't want our work life to have
anything to do with our personal life.

317
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,421
You couldn't keep
them separate.

318
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,591
And that's why our personal
life doesn't exist.

319
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,177
None of that has to...

320
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,346
I can't work with you.

321
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,391
Actually, you can.

322
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,354
I was the one who had the problem.
I don't any more.

323
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,989
I owe you an apology.

324
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,993
I was... I was...

325
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,996
What were you wrong about?

326
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:26,837
You spent weeks elaborately concealing
the fact that you'd crashed daddy's car.

327
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:31,591
Then you just confessed. Seemed
idiotic, certain to end in disaster.

328
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,845
Instead, you're riding off
into the sunset together.

329
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,263
Any theories on why?

330
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,975
I assume you've already dismissed
the "she loves me" theory?

331
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,601
It's possible.

332
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,562
It would require the
presupposition that everything

333
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,147
she's done for
the last six years

334
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,065
has been completely inconsistent
with her character,

335
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,817
but, yeah, it's possible.

336
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,653
As we've already established, it's
also possible that you're wrong.

337
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,072
Or there's another explanation.

338
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,368
Since you don't have one, I'm
gonna keep looking for you.

339
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,834
Let him drain, then pack it with
anesthetics and sterile gauze.

340
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,546
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

341
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,424
He's trying to get
his old fellows back.

342
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,050
It's called stalking.

343
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,012
I am way too busy to play
officer of the court.

344
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,599
That's a shame, since you're
the one who triggered this.

345
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
What do you see
in Lucas anyway?

346
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,728
I don't see that
it's any of your business.

347
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,438
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

348
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,731
You could've at least told me,

349
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,192
so I wouldn't have coached him on
how to prove his worthiness to you.

350
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,863
I know you're upset with me because I
didn't choose to date your best friend,

351
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,324
but I'm living my life.

352
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,492
For the first time.

353
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:43,371
I'm not gonna change that because
of how it might affect him, or you.

354
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,215
I feel like crap.

355
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:58,512
Yeah, look, our relationship is gonna be
about House or it's gonna be about us.

356
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,014
I vote for it being about us.

357
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,433
House is gonna make
it about him for us.

358
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,603
This is very insulting. You're
apparently shocked by this,

359
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,232
which means that you thought that there
was some way that we could date,

360
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,568
get married, have two kids,
a dog, retire to Florida,

361
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,487
all without House finding out.

362
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,157
Or you thought that we
wouldn't date all that long.

363
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,397
The first means
you're delusional,

364
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,537
the second means
I'm delusional.

365
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,021
Technically, it could also mean
you thought House had matured,

366
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,666
but then we're back to your being...

367
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,251
Shut up.

368
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,921
You're right. I'm sorry.

369
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,465
I'm also flattered.

370
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,634
Yeah, 'cause you acted all cool
and everything with Wilson,

371
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,012
but you feel comfortable enough
with me that you can freak out.

372
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,389
That's cool.

373
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:53,275
His sinuses are clear. The
antibiotics should work this time.

374
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,862
Why did you forgive me?

375
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,408
I mean, I'm glad, I'm
grateful, but I'm confused.

376
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,733
You've been harder on the
patient than you've been on me.

377
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:09,583
The difference between you and the
patient is that you feel shame, guilt.

378
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,920
That's how I know we're
gonna get through this.

379
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,674
My stomach.

380
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,177
It really hurts.

381
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,473
His liver's failing.

382
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,898
His liver's failing and his abdomen
keeps filling with fluid, so...

383
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,316
It's not meningococcemia.

384
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,444
No matter how much you finish
each other's sentences,

385
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,614
don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

386
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,115
Patient's liver's not working.

387
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,160
We don't have time
for your little team-stakes.

388
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,121
Sometimes you're just
 wrong.

389
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,333
Something genetic, something in
his family history we overlooked?

390
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,043
History and genetics
are spotless.

391
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,687
Plus, every time he had a bad cough
as a kid, he went to a doctor.

392
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,589
Klatskin tumor,
obstructing his bile ducts?

393
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,591
No jaundice, wouldn't
have ocular effects.

394
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,928
But if it's inflammation inside the
bile channels, sclerosing cholangitis.

395
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,763
Could've stopped him from
producing clotting proteins,

396
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,932
damaged his blood cells,
causing small strokes.

397
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,977
Enough, enough! Stop
pummeling Thirteen and Taub.

398
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,691
It fits. Prep the
patient for an ERCP,

399
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,176
see if there's any hope of opening
his blocked bile channels.

400
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,322
And tell them to start
looking for a liver donor.

401
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,658
Dr. Chase.

402
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,535
Your turn.

403
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,163
So what did she say?

404
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,167
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

405
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,127
That works, too.

406
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,255
And now you expect me to ask
you what the "too" refers to?

407
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,677
Only if you're interested. Only if
you have doubts about her answer.

408
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,765
She thinks that you don't have
anything to feel guilty about

409
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,643
because you didn't
kill anybody, I did.

410
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,730
She blames me for
Dibala's murder, not you.

411
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,983
You were barely involved in
that case, she knows that.

412
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,195
But I created the big, bad, evil
climate that allowed it to happen.

413
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,155
You're wrong.

414
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,657
Powerful counter-argument.

415
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,494
Why are you doing this? Why are
you trying to screw things up?

416
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,538
You got the tense wrong.

417
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,331
Things are already screwed up.

418
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,626
Which is why you don't just want
to work for me, you need to.

419
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,212
Cameron thinks you're my
personal sock puppet.

420
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:23,049
If you don't stay, it's gonna
be hard to prove you're not.

421
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,676
I have to go.

422
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,441
Last week, my cane
could only do 10 minutes.

423
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,946
What are you doing here?

424
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,742
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

425
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,916
What's the best way to restore the liver
in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?

426
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,126
Not getting drawn into this.

427
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,377
You already are.

428
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,879
Because you crashed my workout?

429
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,757
You're doing core training,
which improves balance,

430
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:07,677
which staves off the most debilitating
symptoms of Huntington's.

431
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,055
You've ended your
self-destructive streak.

432
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,390
You want to do
something significant,

433
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,352
something that'll last longer
than the few years you have left.

434
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,938
My team is your
first, best choice.

435
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:23,943
And my first choice is the community health
clinic I interviewed with yesterday.

436
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,487
Absolutely, you should do that.

437
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,282
Three hours a week, every doctor
should, because every doctor can.

438
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,451
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

439
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,746
Plus, on my team, you get
to screw with Foreman.

440
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,748
Every way but literally.

441
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,000
Why are you doing it this way?

442
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,503
You're pretending to assume
we're all coming back,

443
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,963
without actually
asking us. Why?

444
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,884
See, this is why you'd be miserable
wiping noses in a clinic.

445
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,889
You can't ask because you
can't face the rejection.

446
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,182
Why not? What's going on?

447
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,767
Are you asking me to ask you?

448
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,395
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

449
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:05,568
We don't know how much the sclerosing
cholangitis has damaged your liver.

450
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,238
It might be in a year,
might be in 10,

451
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,200
but the odds are you're
gonna need a new one.

452
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:18,289
And you should know, while no transplant
committee will say this openly,

453
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:22,502
they'll never grant an organ to
someone working in your profession.

454
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,339
You're saying
I have to change jobs?

455
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,676
You're medically advising
me to change jobs?

456
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,885
Hank, if you're too sick...

457
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,887
She wants me to have some
kind of religious conversion.

458
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,472
She's practically
salivating over it.

459
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,349
I'm just being candid about...

460
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,311
So you don't think I'm scum, just
some committee thinks I'm scum?

461
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,147
That your lifestyle has risks.

462
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,067
You work around more sick people,
and germs, and blood than I do.

463
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm not gonna live my life
afraid like my parents did.

464
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:54,033
Barely letting me play outside and
God forbid that I get a scratch.

465
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:58,079
I'll talk to him. He'll calm down and
realize that this is the only way.

466
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,497
No. No, I won't.

467
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,916
Why does everyone want to
dictate the way I live my life?

468
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,086
Because the way we're living
it is gonna kill you.

469
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,260
Passing
the pancreatic duct.

470
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,762
Don't listen to House.

471
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,264
You have no idea what he said.

472
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,183
I know that
House is manipulative.

473
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,267
I know that you're in a
vulnerable state right now.

474
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,355
And I know that Cameron wants
your marriage to work, so do you.

475
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,065
So don't listen to House.

476
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,610
House doesn't
make my decisions.

477
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,905
I'm in the common bile duct.

478
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,199
What's that mass? Gallstone?

479
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,035
Can we magnify times five?

480
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,123
That's not a gallstone.

481
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,002
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

482
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,799
You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.

483
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,636
They disseminated all over your
body, causing all your symptoms.

484
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,887
How'd I get a parasite?

485
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,807
Most likely through sexual
activity, but we can't be sure.

486
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,560
And what's the treatment?

487
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,062
Two mebendazole pills.

488
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,357
That's it?

489
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,985
You'll be fine. Your liver, too.
Go back to your lives.

490
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,078
You know this is
the doctors' lounge.

491
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,287
I know.

492
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,999
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

493
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,502
You are good at it, by the way.

494
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,130
Why are you reading my charts?

495
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,133
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

496
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,887
Your girlfriend is
a male porn star?

497
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,472
No, I'm dating Lisa Cuddy.

498
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,766
Seriously? Cool, huh?

499
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,290
And if House doesn't have his
team, that'll make her miserable,

500
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,895
which will make me miserable.

501
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,400
Which brings us to the fact that you
have elevated noting to an art form.

502
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,734
I see the connection.

503
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,111
Most doctors write "9:00 a.m."

504
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,779
if they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

505
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:59,450
You write "9:03" and you make little
notations when procedures are delayed.

506
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,369
You're easily impressed.

507
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,080
Well, yeah. I was.

508
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,126
Until I saw that you had virtually stopped
writing them about four weeks ago.

509
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,627
Been busy. Got a backlog.

510
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:15,300
Yeah, people with your level of precision
don't really just get backlogs.

511
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,305
No one knows why
you're leaving PPTH.

512
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,681
Because it's personal.

513
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,474
If something happened...

514
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,894
I mean, if you're leaving to get away
from something that you did, or she did,

515
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,646
or both of you did...

516
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,899
I mean, emotionally, maybe you want
to run away, but in my experience,

517
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,987
if you're staring at a pit
bull in some guy's back yard,

518
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,157
you're better off staying
right where you are.

519
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,493
Face the problem, that way it
can't bite you in the ass.

520
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,334
Thanks for the folksy wisdom.

521
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,755
Hey, you got any dirt
on any of the other three?

522
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,090
It'd really help me out.

523
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,514
I thought you said those two
pills was all he needed.

524
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,599
Lungs are filling with fluid.

525
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,934
Suction him and
get him on oxygen.

526
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,693
Patient's lungs are severely
compromised, liver's still failing.

527
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,820
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

528
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,625
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have them.

529
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,368
Which means it could be a
hematological problem plus cardiomyopathy.

530
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,871
No. Neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

531
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,664
What if it's lymphoma?

532
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,542
Peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure,

533
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,962
paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

534
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,884
Lymphoma it is.
Prep him for chemo.

535
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:44,097
Fax Taub and Thirteen the
latest update on the case.

536
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,643
Seriously?

537
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,229
They have as much right to
know as anyone on the team.

538
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,648
You either like the
diagnosis or you don't.

539
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,527
If you don't, we need to keep talking.
If you do, you need to shut up.

540
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,321
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

541
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,206
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

542
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,667
Do you want me
to be mad at you?

543
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,669
You blame House, not me.

544
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,796
I'm mad at House
because he's an ass.

545
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,924
And I am mad at you, but I
don't want to leave you.

546
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,761
What I did may be the worst thing
I ever did, it may be the best.

547
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,848
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer.

548
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,975
But I did it. Me.

549
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,937
And even if it destroys me,
I'd do it again today.

550
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,355
You don't mean that.
This isn't you...

551
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,847
I'm not running away
from what I did because

552
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,277
you want to pretend
I never did it.

553
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,698
If that's how you feel,

554
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,535
okay.

555
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,126
My strategy is not
completely working.

556
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,547
All four of them
want to work for me,

557
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,800
but all four of them have reasons
why they don't want to work for me.

558
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:07,221
How do I get them to take one from
column A and none from column B?

559
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,436
Right.

560
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,772
Right, by not saying anything, you're
saying that the answer's inside me?

561
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,983
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

562
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,860
Then it's not
technically the answer.

563
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,820
Why do you need
three of these doctors?

564
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:28,284
Because I know they're good. Other doctors
fall into the might-be-good category.

565
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,008
It has nothing to do
with them being good,

566
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,787
you think they're
idiots half the time.

567
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,831
But they're comfortable.
You feel abandoned by Cuddy,

568
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,335
so you're reaching out to
people you know for comfort.

569
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,047
Oh, my God, you're right.
I don't need doctors at all.

570
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,841
I just need a good friend.

571
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Cuddy's right.

572
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,263
Maybe, just maybe, if I don't
play along, you'll realize

573
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,892
you can't solve a deeper problem
with a surface solution.

574
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,188
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

575
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,858
You okay?

576
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,318
Getting through it.

577
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,862
Be a lot easier once you
two are away from here.

578
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,113
Yeah.

579
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,494
He's peeing blood.

580
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,828
BP's rising.

581
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,996
Heart rate is up to 250.

582
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,165
He's going into cardiac arrest.

583
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,253
Charging. Clear.

584
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,712
He's bleeding out.

585
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,339
His body's
completely giving out.

586
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,049
Charging. Clear.

587
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,219
We've got him stabilized,

588
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,221
but no red cells,
no white cells,

589
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,806
practically no
platelets either.

590
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,684
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

591
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,353
He's been off it
since yesterday anyway.

592
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,733
Long passes, wild
guesses, anything.

593
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,861
Hypopituitarism? Could cause
multi-organ failure if...

594
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,406
If his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

595
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,907
Renal cell carcinoma.

596
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,409
Renal ultrasound was clean.

597
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,828
I'd say aleukemic leukemia,

598
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,538
marrow's not making
enough normal cells, but...

599
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,333
Ablate the patient's bone
marrow, find him a donor match.

600
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,378
You want to nuke
the patient's marrow?

601
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,714
He had no evidence of being
anemic or immune-compromised

602
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,716
when he was admitted...
Perfect white count as well.

603
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,092
Ablation
could kill him,

604
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,178
or leave him defenseless against
an infection that could.

605
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,764
Then come up with
something better.

606
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,188
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

607
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:26,569
Okay with you if I bring the other
candidates into the loop now?

608
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,575
The risks,
they're really minimal.

609
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,703
We'll do a series
of painless injections...

610
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,372
Excuse me.

611
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,387
The whole thing can be
done as an outpatient.

612
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,896
You're leaving at 11:00 a.m.?

613
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,107
Trust me, the case
is almost over.

614
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,653
Foreman told me you're
ablating the patient's marrow

615
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,739
on a non-theory that
Foreman himself withdrew.

616
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,200
You're gonna kill the patient.

617
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,912
Is this about me and Lucas?

618
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,958
I want alternatives
for the patient.

619
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,251
So do I.

620
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,097
I want to be on the team.

621
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,439
You think that's gonna
save your marriage?

622
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,444
I don't know.

623
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,117
Four candidates, three spots.

624
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,413
I got a tough decision
ahead of me.

625
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,316
Hi. Remy, this is Dr. Turner
from the Pennsauken Free Clinic.

626
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,987
We all loved meeting you,
and the job's yours.

627
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,823
Call me back,
let's pick a start date.

628
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:55,426
I want it to look natural. I
mean, much younger, but natural.

629
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,553
Can you get rid of the
crow's feet altogether?

630
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,722
Or is it better to
leave a trace of them?

631
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,433
I don't look old enough
to have them anyway, do I?

632
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,601
Absolutely.

633
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,060
I do look old enough?

634
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,145
No.

635
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,357
I'm sorry. Hang on a second.

636
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,242
Why are you here?

637
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:24,497
Because I think we're wrong, which
means something's gonna go wrong.

638
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,125
Or right.

639
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,293
Takayama here.

640
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,545
It's me and Thirteen,
stop the ablation.

641
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,758
Because...

642
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,963
Those threadworms.

643
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,845
Why would his body have gone to hell
just hours after they were gone?

644
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,010
The worms weren't hurting him,
they were helping him.

645
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,308
He has extra-intestinal Crohn's.

646
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,644
He got it from being
raised in too clean,

647
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,479
too overprotective
of an environment.

648
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,814
It's the hygiene hypothesis,

649
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,338
why there's so much autoimmune
disease in the developed world,

650
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,984
and almost none in
the developing world.

651
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,153
The worms were keeping
the Crohn's in check,

652
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,144
teaching his immune
system what it should've

653
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,074
learned from eating
dirt growing up.

654
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,409
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

655
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:08,207
So his life of filth wasn't the
problem, the clean living was.

656
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,835
We'll start him
on methylprednisolone.

657
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,711
And some helminths.

658
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,924
Worms. Cool, huh?

659
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,719
Best out of three?

660
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,226
Have
you been a bad boy?

661
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,357
Yeah, that's...

662
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,948
I want to be on the team.

663
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,366
Good news for your wife.

664
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,202
Thanks for the sarcasm.

665
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,873
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

666
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,542
but apparently I don't love
her as much as I thought.

667
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,544
Or you love her more.

668
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:58,340
This job gives you the thrill you
used to find through philandering.

669
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,886
Better to cheat with
a beaker and an MRI

670
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,639
than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

671
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,476
I'll let you know.

672
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,165
I told House I want to
work for him again.

673
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,501
Stay on the team.

674
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,087
You were always
more into it than I was,

675
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,882
more interested in diagnostics.

676
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,636
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

677
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,522
Four for four.

678
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,531
I was in love with you.

679
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,326
I was an idiot.

680
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,579
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you,

681
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,707
because I thought
I could heal you.

682
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,213
You almost killed that patient.

683
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,256
If almost not saving
his life means...

684
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,467
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

685
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,595
You risked another patient's
life to bait your old team.

686
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,138
Another one?

687
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,598
You did kill Dibala.

688
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,477
By playing God and teaching
us to do the same.

689
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,145
I taught you to think
for yourselves.

690
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,480
You don't even think
of them as people,

691
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,066
they're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

692
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,401
You celebrate their humanity,

693
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,820
I'd rather solve those little
puzzles and save their lives.

694
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,073
Motives do matter.
Lives can't come second.

695
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,826
The patient is alive.
That's what matters.

696
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,327
Not to you.

697
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,164
All you care about is that Taub
and Thirteen fell for your game.

698
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,376
You'll poison them
just like you poisoned Chase.

699
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,256
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me?

700
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,384
You ruined him,

701
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,432
so he can't even see
right from wrong,

702
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,061
can't even see the sanctity
of a human life any more.

703
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,445
I loved you, and I loved Chase.

704
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,657
I'm sorry for you both,

705
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,244
for who you've become because

706
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,249
there's no way back
for either of you.

707
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:46,568
Any idea where I can get a great
big "Mission Accomplished" banner?

708
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,367
Got my sanity back, my
license back, and now...

709
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,204
You're kidding. All of them?

710
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,956
Three out of four,

711
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,625
which is almost as good
as four out of five.

712
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,919
Who was the... Cameron.

713
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,630
Wow. I can't believe it.

714
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:11,552
I mean, really.
I can't believe it.

715
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,890
You were right, House.
Good for you.

716
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,059
Yeah. It is.

717
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,983
She's broken up with Chase, and
she's leaving the hospital. Still,

718
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,861
three out of four ain't bad.
