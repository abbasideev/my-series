1
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,176
Hey.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,344
Hey, I'll be right there.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,054
Take your time.

4
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,723
You mind if I get
a drink of water?

5
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,934
No, no. Not at all,
help yourself.

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,617
Not exactly beach reading, huh?

7
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,369
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

8
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,745
Well, most of these
I can get through.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,707
But that one, I can't
get past the dust jacket.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,375
Where's Ted? Laid off.

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,835
Company's going
with per diem workers.

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,337
You don't have to pay
overtime, health insurance.

13
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,714
Wow, that sucks.

14
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,634
I don't mind. Really. I'm not
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

15
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,556
Uh, if I could just
get you to sign...

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,141
Right. Um...

17
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,520
Hang on one second.
I wanna show you something.

18
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,442
You're gonna laugh,

19
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,154
but I swear this guy, James
Sidas, looks exactly like you.

20
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,742
Wait, hang on a second.

21
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,537
This guy is you. I saw a
profile Nova did on you.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,415
You're like the youngest
guy to ever graduate MIT.

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,083
Standards were lower back then.

24
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,585
You got an IQ of 178.

25
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,879
Published three books
and 35 papers,

26
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,797
all before the age of 18?

27
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,048
Yeah.

28
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,301
Sorry, I really
need to get going,

29
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,761
so if I could just
get you to sign off...

30
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,514
All right. I'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.

31
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,932
I'm not that guy any more.

32
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,777
Come on, man. This is
the most exciting thing

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,479
that's happened
in this place in years.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,572
Come on, don't be like that.

35
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,491
I'm paying you a compliment.

36
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,369
It's not that. I'm...

37
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,955
My hand's not working.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,875
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. You okay?

39
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,712
No.

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,170
$2.32. Put it on
Dr. Wilson's tab.

41
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,507
I don't know who Dr. Wilson
is, and we don't have tabs.

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,175
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,718
No. Good.

44
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,512
But, sir...

45
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,597
I got it. It's all right.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,475
Thanks.

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,600
Although, I should make it
clear that for two bucks,

48
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,729
all you get is top half,
over the clothes.

49
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,149
Any plans for turkey day?

50
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,069
Going to my sister's
for dinner. Why?

51
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,946
Just making
pleasant conversation.

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,990
I heard tell of
folks doing such.

53
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,325
How about we talk about this?

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,328
Fifteen-year-old, recurring
migraines and blurred vision.

55
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,580
Great. Really?

56
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,707
Sure. There's no point
putting a band together

57
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,166
if we're not
gonna play any gigs.

58
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,836
Hold on. Take this instead.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,713
I was expecting
more resistance.

60
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,633
That was the old me. New me is
static guarded and friction free.

61
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,552
Enjoy your drumstick.

62
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,767
Ready to save some lives?

63
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,397
Thirty-two-year-old courier,
ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

64
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,149
CT was clear,
tox screen negative.

65
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,026
What are you so excited about?

66
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,028
Why wouldn't I be?
Got all my starters back,

67
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:01,157
plus a couple of first-class free agents.
I feel like Mike Tomlin.

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,243
Probably not as much as you
do, but you get the idea.

69
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,079
Ataxia and anemia, could
be viral, maybe West Nile.

70
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:11,042
No fever, lymph glands were normal.
Anybody seen Wilson?

71
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,251
Hyperbilirubinemia?

72
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,420
Yeah, like that's a real thing.

73
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,504
Meningitis.

74
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,048
Anemia's a stretch.

75
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,425
Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.

76
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,843
What about sickle cell?

77
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,386
The guy's white.
Whites can get it.

78
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,097
Come on. We get the tennis
elbow and all the money,

79
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,265
let them have sickle cell.

80
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,600
TTP is a better fit.

81
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,935
He's right.

82
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,942
What, you thought I wouldn't
agree with him? Ever?

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,109
Well, you didn't
agree with him.

84
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,779
That's why he dumped you.
Oh, sorry, it was mutual.

85
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,114
We're cool, okay? Nobody's
angry, nobody's hurt.

86
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,574
Sounds passionate.

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,035
TTP makes sense to me.
Not to me.

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,119
What if he had a history of...

89
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,122
One big happy family.
TTP it is.

90
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,709
Confirm with a blood smear
and ADAMTS13 antibodies.

91
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,712
Dr. James Wilson,
please dial 558.

92
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,589
Can you cure it?

93
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,132
TTP isn't completely curable,

94
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,551
but the symptoms are manageable
with the proper treatment.

95
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,803
Is this the treatment?

96
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,138
No. First we need to do a blood
test to confirm the diagnosis.

97
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,306
But he's gonna get better?

98
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,766
Honey,
that's what she's saying.

99
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,050
I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,186
How can't I worry?
You're in the hospital.

101
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,813
I'm gonna be fine.

102
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,148
Are you sure everything
was fine before?

103
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,733
I mean, given your
educational background,

104
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,111
you'd think you could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

105
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,654
We have money. Don't worry.

106
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,822
It's not that.

107
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,490
It's just I want to make sure

108
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,283
we have all
the information we should.

109
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,618
My husband wouldn't lie.

110
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,662
It's okay, baby.
He's just doing his job.

111
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,125
He just wants to make sure I'm not a
secret drug addict or an alcoholic.

112
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,003
Or hiding a history
of mental illness.

113
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,340
I work as a courier
because I want to.

114
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,705
It's easy.
I don't have to think.

115
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,884
It's too hard to think?

116
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,970
No. Just unpleasant.

117
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,932
No matter what I did, it
really wasn't good enough.

118
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,142
Then I met Dara.

119
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,466
She didn't care
how smart I was,

120
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,021
or what I might accomplish
in the future.

121
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,482
It was the first time in my
life that I was really happy.

122
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,111
So I decided I would rather
be happy than smart.

123
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,291
You all right?

124
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,086
Sorry. I know you're
not okay. I mean...

125
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,547
She left.

126
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,966
Went back to Chicago.

127
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,427
Any chance of reconciliation?

128
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,803
No.

129
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,806
You sure you don't wanna
grab a drink after work?

130
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,017
I figured we could talk about
the perils of dating doctors.

131
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,477
I wasn't dating Cameron.

132
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,561
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

133
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,731
I know what you're doing,
and I appreciate it.

134
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,983
But I've got it under control.

135
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,069
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident,

136
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,987
and obviously you didn't.

137
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,616
And talking about it obviously
made things so much better.

138
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,041
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

139
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,543
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

140
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,253
That's my point.

141
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,963
Guys with IQs off the chart

142
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,758
are usually
completely abnormal.

143
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,928
Speaking of House,
why did you come back?

144
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,513
I mean, you must have
taken a major pay cut.

145
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,077
Life's too short
to worry about money.

146
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,265
Your wife feel the same way?

147
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,227
She's happy to cut back
on some things.

148
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,728
Like sex.

149
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,273
Why'd you come back?
Why wouldn't I?

150
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,819
Like Foreman said, nobody's
angry, nobody's hurt.

151
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,028
Schistocytes.

152
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,614
That means TTP.

153
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,866
Which is what we thought it'd be, remember?
This is a good thing.

154
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,036
This is an easy thing, and House
doesn't take cases that are easy,

155
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,746
which means it's not TTP.

156
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,208
And he wants to see how long it
takes us to catch up to him.

157
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,296
Schistocytes suggest TTP.

158
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,132
Good, now what?

159
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,092
Normally we'd try
plasmapheresis,

160
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,302
but the patient has an
albumin colloid allergy.

161
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,470
So?

162
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,639
So that means we have to
give him a splenectomy.

163
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,307
Yes, it does.

164
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,240
- Wilson?
- No.

165
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,491
Do you know where he is?

166
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,659
Not in here.

167
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,619
You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen?

168
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,904
Is that what a splenectomy is?

169
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,123
I thought it was an ice cream treat.
Yuck.

170
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,958
So you do really
think he has TTP.

171
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,168
You're not just testing us.

172
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,753
Yeah. Like I have
time for games.

173
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,340
So, why did you
really take this case?

174
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,635
Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing
for a dinner invite.

175
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,106
Missed you
at breakfast this morning.

176
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,733
And lunch.

177
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,443
I had a dentist appointment.

178
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,695
You know where
Cuddy's sister lives?

179
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,115
You see, this is why I don't
answer your urgent pages,

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,992
because they're
not urgent pages.

181
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,995
I've decided what I'm gonna
do about Cuddy and Lucas.

182
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
I'm going to break them up.

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,082
Of course. It's given
me a purpose in life,

184
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,460
a goal, a raison d'être.

185
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,422
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish raison.

186
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,091
I think of it
more as benevolent.

187
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,802
There's only two possible
outcomes for their relationship,

188
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,055
they split or they
stay together forever.

189
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,780
If it's split, then the sooner it
happens, the better for everyone.

190
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,101
If it's stay, then my
meddling won't matter.

191
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,063
In fact, if they survive it,

192
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,357
it might even make
their bond stronger.

193
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,984
How you manage to
elevate your narcissism

194
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,904
to beneficence is masterful.

195
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,866
And I've decided to do it
at Thanksgiving dinner,

196
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,701
just 'cause I'm sentimental.

197
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,870
Dinner's at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back to...

198
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,622
House, don't.

199
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,000
I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't
biting, so I'll have to crash.

200
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,003
I have no idea where
Cuddy's sister lives.

201
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,297
Ask and thou shalt receive.

202
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,384
You can't honestly think
I would help you with this.

203
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,178
Not help me,
help Cuddy, remember?

204
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,099
If you don't get it, I'll be forced
to use more nefarious methods.

205
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,725
Happy holidays.

206
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,897
Ah.

207
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,357
Looks great.

208
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,442
So, he's all better?

209
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,278
Probably be on
some long-term meds,

210
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,071
and he's about
10 ounces lighter,

211
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,157
other than that, he won't
even know it's gone.

212
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,745
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

213
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,539
When can I get out of here?

214
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,958
If everything checks out,
less than a week.

215
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,628
Good. 'Cause those boxes
aren't gonna deliver colors.

216
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,964
Colors?

217
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,633
Green and orange

218
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,177
and ceiling.

219
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,480
Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?
Chewing.

220
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,724
Jimmy?

221
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,808
Shirt.

222
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,686
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab, now!

223
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,021
Oh, my God.

224
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,944
Blood flow's restored, appears
to be no permanent damage.

225
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,280
Good news is it turns
out to be an exciting,

226
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,574
action-packed thrill ride
of a case after all.

227
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,410
Bad news is we took out
his spleen for nothing.

228
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,912
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

229
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,666
So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,

230
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,252
tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?

231
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,796
CNS Vasculitis,
explains the ataxia

232
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,173
and anemia, maybe the stroke.

233
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,716
CT would have
picked up something.

234
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,011
Hi, I'm Greg House. I'm a
friend of your sister, Lisa.

235
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,554
Could be DIC.

236
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,972
Lisa Cuddy.

237
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,640
Sorry, wrong number.
You gonna ask?

238
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,685
I'm sure he's got a perfectly
logical explanation.

239
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,853
Can't be DIC, no hemorrhaging.

240
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,522
And I'm calling all 12 Julia
Cuddys within 100-mile radius.

241
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,985
See? Completely reasonable.
Acquired pancytopenia?

242
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,111
WBC's normal.

243
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,491
Hey, Julia. You're
Lisa's sister, right?

244
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,410
Are you sure?
You are number 12.

245
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,788
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

246
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,247
Otis Campbell.

247
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,665
Probably kept her first name.

248
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
The mnemonic for toxins.

249
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,669
"O" for organophosphates, "T" for
tricyclics, "I" for insulin...

250
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,255
Or as I remember it,
"Moist Place."

251
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,758
That's "Place" spelled with
two "L"s and a silent "B."

252
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,203
Except the tox screen
was negative.

253
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,595
Standard tox screen. Unstandard
toxins don't show up on it.

254
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,099
Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen.
You two search his home.

255
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,851
Otis Campbell's gotta
be hiding somewhere.

256
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,145
Smartest guy in the world

257
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,980
and this is the best he can do?

258
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,649
Maybe he's doing what he loves.

259
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,276
Delivering boxes
was a childhood dream.

260
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,446
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

261
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,115
Nothing in here is
capable of going bad.

262
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,910
Ibuprofen, eye drops,
cough syrup.

263
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,997
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,751
You never asked me
over before, why now?

265
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,463
Just never thought of it. But now
that we're both on the team...

266
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,549
And my wife left me?

267
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,094
Is that a bad reason?

268
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,471
No, but I'm okay.

269
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,599
On both the food and friends.

270
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,143
Mice.

271
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,688
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

272
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,898
But not without a fever.

273
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,151
You have someone to talk to?

274
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,694
Yeah. Who?

275
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,156
What, you want names?

276
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,867
Look, you lost a friend,
I get it.

277
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,076
But I'm not Kutner.

278
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,663
Good. 'Cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

279
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
I'm going to pretend there's
something interesting over here,

280
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,750
so you'll shut up.

281
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:30,517
Actually, there is. He's got
sketches of atomic structure.

282
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,021
This one is full
of math proofs.

283
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,857
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

284
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,525
This isn't some
homework assignment

285
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,861
his parents forced on him,

286
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,698
this is passion. Why would
he want to stop doing this?

287
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,117
Marriage destroyed his soul?

288
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,547
Ooh.

289
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,885
Or maybe it was just the booze.

290
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,682
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been wonderful.

291
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,559
As have you, Diana. Be well.

292
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,102
Thank you.

293
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,980
You're helping. Voluntarily.

294
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,316
He's done six already.

295
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,026
I figured you might
be getting backed up

296
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,402
with the holiday season
and all.

297
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,031
So which one of us slipped through the
wormhole into an alternate dimension?

298
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,076
I have always loved
to travel. And paint.

299
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,202
Lucky number seven.

300
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
House, I know you're
trying to be nice.

301
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,832
But I also know you're doing
it because you have an agenda.

302
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,210
Wow. Sexy and smart.

303
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,546
Lucas is a lucky guy.

304
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,675
The question is, is this a
bad agenda or a good one?

305
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,761
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

306
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,473
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

307
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,020
So which is it?
I'm dying to know.

308
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,488
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

309
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,992
Peace in our time!

310
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,996
Only cost me 45 minutes
of clinic duty.

311
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,958
This is a three-hour drive.

312
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,794
Have you considered the possibility
that this is a fake address?

313
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,006
You think she'd send me to a vacant
lot for Thanksgiving dinner?

314
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,049
If she's smart. She is.

315
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,094
That's why I ran it through Motor Vehicles.
Good as gold.

316
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,722
This cannot end well.

317
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,475
Don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

318
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,437
You're not gonna want
to miss this.

319
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,358
The unstandard tox screen

320
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,027
was as clean
as the standard one.

321
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,071
But we found vodka stashed
away in his place.

322
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,699
What's with the ties?

323
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,038
Makes me look adorably non-threatening.
Party or party-hearty?

324
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,540
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

325
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,252
Party.

326
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:09,051
So, the guy's a brainiac and his
secret drug of choice is booze?

327
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,011
It's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

328
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,679
Talk to him,
he's a pedestrian guy.

329
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,350
With pedestrian alcoholism. Liver biopsy
can wait until after Thanksgiving.

330
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,143
Yes, assuming the biopsy

331
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,270
is going to tell us exactly
what we expect it to tell us,

332
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,897
it can wait till
after New Years.

333
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,525
On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen
can do the liver biopsy today.

334
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,735
Why us?

335
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,987
Juniority. Welcome back.

336
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,989
What do you want us to do?

337
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,284
Same as me.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

338
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,288
I'm not an alcoholic.

339
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,208
Yes, you just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

340
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,502
I drink, just not a lot.

341
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,462
Since when do you drink at all?

342
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,882
I have one shot when I get home
from work, baby. That's it.

343
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,384
So why lie to
your wife about it?

344
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,177
Because it's not important.

345
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,382
What difference does it make?

346
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,639
That you drink every day,
by yourself?

347
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,308
I have one lousy drink, okay?

348
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,559
Have you ever
seen me drunk? Ever?

349
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,562
No, but you've obviously been
drinking enough to hurt your liver.

350
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,606
My liver is fine. Hold still.

351
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,945
There we go.

352
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,822
This test is a waste of time.

353
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,670
Hey. This wine?

354
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,683
All right. Very good.
There, we got this...

355
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,351
String beans?

356
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,374
Julia?

357
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,876
No, I'm the house sitter.

358
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,754
They're in Hawaii for the week.

359
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,721
Happy Thanksgiving.

360
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,431
Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.

361
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,515
Happy Thanksgiving.

362
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,683
Cheers. Cheers.

363
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,977
You must be Dr. House.

364
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,897
I was told I should offer
you a turkey sandwich.

365
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,122
Tuna salad. Closest thing
they had to turkey.

366
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,208
Thanks. But I'm hoping I
can still get out of here

367
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,168
and catch the tail end
of dinner with my wife.

368
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,252
Anything?

369
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,421
No cirrhosis, no scarring,
no infection.

370
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,257
Blood panel?
Elevated albumin, 7.2.

371
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,220
That's it?
Everything else is fine.

372
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,472
So it was a waste of time.

373
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,642
Unless, it's not his liver

374
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,645
that's elevating his
albumin, it's his kidneys.

375
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,438
Renal failure.
Explains the anemia.

376
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,898
If he developed hyperkalemia,

377
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,818
that would explain the
ataxia, but the stroke...

378
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,653
Ischemic encephalopathy.

379
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,071
Nice.

380
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,950
Except now we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

381
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,173
Key under the mat.

382
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,379
There's no key under the mat.

383
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,592
Oh, right.

384
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,638
You need to replace one
of your kitchen windows.

385
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,766
I helped myself to
your wine cellar.

386
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,685
I'll leave a buck
on the way out.

387
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,062
You're not right for her.

388
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,230
And you are?

389
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,690
Less wrong.

390
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,774
Ah.

391
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,945
But then I started thinking...

392
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,326
What was I saying?

393
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,787
You were saying
it's late and...

394
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,708
She invited me. She didn't
know if she should.

395
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,879
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed

396
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,175
or if I'm still the same
old SOB I've always been.

397
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,681
But she always
gave me a chance.

398
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,895
Eight hundred and
thirty-two chances,

399
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,147
and I used up
every one of them.

400
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,650
Eight hundred and thirty-two's
her limit, make a note.

401
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,281
How about a cup of coffee?

402
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,033
It's just instant, but...

403
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,125
I'm pathetic.

404
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,712
I don't deserve her.

405
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,091
Okay. Okay. All right.

406
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,968
Here.

407
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,683
Maybe you should crash here.

408
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,644
It's a sofa bed.

409
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772
I love her.

410
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,072
Patient's liver is fine, it's
his kidneys that are shot.

411
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,490
And where the hell is House?

412
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,076
He left a message on the machine.
He's not coming in today.

413
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,619
So what causes kidney failure?

414
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,745
Rhabdomyolysis.

415
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,038
No edema.

416
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,207
I trust you had
a wonderful Thanksgiving.

417
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,335
I don't remember.
So I guess I did.

418
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,879
Multiple myeloma. No bone pain.

419
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,339
You got drunk alone?

420
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,007
No. That would be a sign

421
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,134
that I need to talk
to you about this.

422
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,594
Polycystic kidney disease.

423
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,179
No UTis or flank pain.

424
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,976
Well, what if his cough
is more than just a cold?

425
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,144
He hasn't been coughing.
It's in his history,

426
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,438
and we found a new bottle of cough
syrup in his medicine cabinet.

427
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,023
Cough could mean
Goodpasture Syndrome,

428
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,733
affects kidneys and lungs.

429
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,944
Start him on immunosuppressors
and dialysis.

430
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,612
We'll do it right after
we run it by House.

431
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,030
He's not answering his pager.

432
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,515
Looks like he's
leaving it up to us.

433
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,908
Us. Not you.

434
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,827
And since we don't disagree,

435
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,246
you can save your fight
for another case.

436
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,130
How long do I have
to be hooked up for?

437
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,756
Four to six hours a day

438
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,883
until we see an improvement.
What if you don't?

439
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,802
Then we keep doing it
until he gets a transplant.

440
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,470
You were sure
it was his spleen,

441
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,347
and then you were sure
it was his liver,

442
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,807
which he told you it wasn't,

443
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,183
and now you're sure
it's his kidneys.

444
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,643
It's definitely his kidneys.

445
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,396
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

446
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,860
Any word from Cameron?

447
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,279
Nope.

448
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,825
I started seeing a counselor
after my diagnosis.

449
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,118
She's really good.

450
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,789
Why does everyone assume that
everyone works in the exact same way?

451
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,124
We pretty much do.

452
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,669
Our egos want us to think we're
all snowflakes, no two alike,

453
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,504
but really, we all want
the same things,

454
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:05,258
love, forgiveness, chocolate.

455
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,175
Well, what I want is for
everyone to leave me alone.

456
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,929
How do I get that?

457
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,150
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

458
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,821
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

459
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,409
I don't remember how I got
here, never mind what I said.

460
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,702
Well, I just talked to him.

461
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,079
And he said he thought
it'd be better

462
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,623
if we stopped
seeing each other.

463
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,416
Said he didn't realize how much

464
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:41,002
there still was
between you and me.

465
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,422
And he didn't want to get
caught in the middle of us.

466
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,677
I was drunk.

467
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,137
Whatever I said,
he can't really...

468
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,681
I've had enough, House.

469
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,851
I actually felt bad
about scamming you,

470
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:03,149
but then you lived down to my
expectations, and then some.

471
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,780
There is no us.

472
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,826
There never will be.

473
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,127
It worked.

474
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,587
Please tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

475
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,381
They split up this morning.

476
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,550
You're the very first
one I've told.

477
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,637
And you think she'll start dating you?
I'm sure she hates you.

478
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,639
But her eyes say,

479
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,225
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

480
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,977
What a shame.

481
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,311
They'll get over it.

482
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,190
I meant for you. I'll get
over it faster than they do.

483
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,819
I can't believe
that Lucas fell for my.

484
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,737
"I'd never say this
because it's so personal

485
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,198
"except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

486
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,825
Second oldest trick
in the book.

487
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,287
You're right. It's his
fault because he's stupid.

488
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,459
He certainly is.

489
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,677
You're stupid.

490
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,348
Well, I'm rubber
and you're glue...

491
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,475
He's not pedestrian,
he's stupid.

492
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:23,688
Or at least stupider than he should be.
He's a DXM junkie.

493
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,399
Dextromethorphan.
As in cough syrup?

494
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,359
He wasn't taking it
for his cough.

495
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,237
It's cheap, available
at your corner drugstore,

496
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,490
and taken in high doses,
it's a dumb drug.

497
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,036
Dumb drug?
He obviously hasn't...

498
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,704
He's smart compared to you,

499
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,373
he's a moron compared
to what he was.

500
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,587
Robotripping lowers the IQ,
it also causes brain damage.

501
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,840
Unless taken with the
proper amount of ethanol,

502
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,383
about one drink per day.

503
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,427
He wasn't abusing the booze

504
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,222
and taking the cough
remedy medicinally,

505
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,184
he was abusing the cough meds and
taking the booze medicinally.

506
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,062
Bravo.

507
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,397
Why would you do that?

508
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,817
If you had a gift, why would
you just throw it away?

509
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,529
I didn't throw it away. I
just turned it down a little.

510
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:18,451
When my brain was on low, everything
didn't seem so miserable any more.

511
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,328
Life was bearable.

512
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,331
I thought that I did that.

513
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,166
You do.

514
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,462
Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.

515
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,174
Even, oh, sweet irony,
your cough.

516
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,760
Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.

517
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,845
We get all traces of it
out of your system,

518
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,765
you'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

519
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,686
I don't think
I can live without it.

520
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,274
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

521
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,025
Make him a genius.

522
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,741
I can't believe it. He looks
so much better already.

523
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,453
We were thinking
about calling GQ.

524
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,498
Lavage has removed all
traces of DXM from his body.

525
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,543
You're drawing again.
What is it?

526
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,627
Just doodles.

527
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,839
No, it's not. Come on,
Jimmy, I want to know.

528
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,427
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

529
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,726
It determines
the amount of energy

530
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,895
expended by
the subatomic particles.

531
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,901
I'm thirsty. Could you get
me a juice or something?

532
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,070
Yeah. Of course.

533
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,656
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

534
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,581
I told you.

535
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,502
You know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

536
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,712
91 points.

537
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,341
In relation, she's closer to
a gibbon than she is to me.

538
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,886
Having sex with her would
be an act of bestiality.

539
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,138
I assume you didn't marry her

540
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,681
for her skill in
Applied Physics.

541
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,059
I just wish she could spell it.

542
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,311
You really think
you'd be happier

543
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,854
with someone who
could spell better?

544
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,272
No.

545
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,485
That's the problem.
I'm the one who's a jerk.

546
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,113
But I owe her everything.

547
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,242
I want to want to be with her.

548
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,496
And when I'm clear, I...

549
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,666
I can't.

550
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,588
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

551
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,964
Sometimes.

552
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,550
Is the wait always this long?

553
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,054
Only on days that end in
"day." Diarrhea, weight loss?

554
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,347
A bit.

555
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,058
Don't you ever shave?

556
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,310
Yeah, once a week.
How about you?

557
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,938
Stomach pain, tenderness?

558
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,565
Every now and then. Are you
this rude to all your patients?

559
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,734
Oh, yes, don't think
you're special.

560
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,905
So we got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms,

561
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,741
yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

562
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,618
What do you think I have?
I'm not sure,

563
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,080
but I think it's a lame job.

564
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,289
What?

565
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,750
You're a rat. Insurance
company sends you out

566
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,794
to check on the quality
of medical care.

567
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,962
That's ridiculous.

568
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,088
Is it really?

569
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,506
'Cause you seem
a lot more interested

570
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,216
in asking questions
than answering them.

571
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,427
Handwriting in your medical records
is obviously not a doctor's,

572
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,761
'cause I can almost read it.

573
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,639
And when you went out for a urine
sample, I looked in your purse.

574
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,558
Found the list of questions
you were supposed to memorize

575
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,353
before you came to the clinic.
I was looking for gum.

576
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:33,938
You're an ass.

577
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,064
Put it in your report.

578
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,899
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you 20 bucks

579
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,276
if you'll pretend that I'm not

580
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,861
when we leave this room.

581
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,616
Remember, first ice, then heat.

582
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,785
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

583
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,662
Thank you, Dr. House.

584
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,333
Wait a second. Where's Cuddy?

585
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,252
Gone for the day.

586
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,046
Hey! Hey! Hey!

587
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,427
Sorry, can't remember if I've mocked
you yet for being a male nurse.

588
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,512
I think this counts.

589
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,556
Fair enough.

590
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,145
That isn't the man I married.

591
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:18,941
Yes, he is. He's just smarter.
Give him some time.

592
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,485
I'm sure... He hates me.

593
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:23,321
His body is going through withdrawal.
He's adjusting.

594
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,324
Maybe he never loved me.
Not really.

595
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,452
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

596
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,913
Somebody help!

597
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,755
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.

598
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,968
Anywhere. Nothing.

599
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,726
We have to talk about this.

600
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,270
It's late. I'm tired.

601
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,107
I know it's a big pay cut,

602
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,859
but I'll always have
the chance to make money.

603
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,529
I won't always have the
chance to do this job.

604
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,782
That's what you think?
That it's about the money?

605
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,160
So it's that I didn't consult
you before I took the job?

606
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,788
That was offensive, but
it's not about that either.

607
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,331
So then...

608
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,795
Can you give me
the first letter?

609
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,132
When we got married,

610
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,135
you were an intern working 30-hour
shifts, doing grunt work,

611
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,679
and we both put up
with it because we knew

612
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,389
that it was leading
to something better.

613
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,643
In your private practice, you are the boss.
You call the shots.

614
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,311
But now, you're 40 years old,

615
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,480
you're still doing grunt work.

616
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,942
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

617
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,529
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

618
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,501
Vitamin B12 deficiency
gives us anemia, numbness...

619
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,586
Not a stroke.

620
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,670
If he has
a vascular malformation...

621
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,672
Anemia's not macrocytic.

622
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,426
Sorry to inconvenience you.

623
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,177
Dying patients can
be so thoughtless.

624
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,429
Don't.

625
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,890
Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde?
Come on, people.

626
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,100
Bone marrow malignancy.

627
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,384
Wouldn't produce schistocytes.

628
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,312
Lupus. Gee, thanks
for coming in.

629
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,896
ANA was negative.

630
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:22,898
What about you?

631
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,610
You got any predictable
drivel you'd like to add?

632
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,255
I think they've given
you enough already.

633
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,947
At least they're trying, not just
sitting there like roadkill.

634
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,699
Give me something!

635
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,702
Give me something or I'll
get your ex-smarter half

636
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,579
on the phone and ask her.

637
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,872
House...

638
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,492
You're going to be
pressing charges?

639
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,619
Against the ottoman
I tripped over?

640
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,245
Against Chase.

641
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,832
I'm pretty sure the
ottoman was acting alone.

642
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,001
You free for dinner
this weekend?

643
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,796
At least three other
people saw him do it.

644
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,589
Mass hysteria. Either night?

645
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,841
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

646
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,177
Oh, my God, who got punched?

647
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,429
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake,

648
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,098
I need to know if he's
able to handle himself

649
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,266
or if I should be
getting him some help.

650
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,935
Chase couldn't
have punched anyone.

651
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,728
He was with me when I
tripped over the ottoman.

652
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:46,440
If you're not planning on eating
this weekend, maybe a movie?

653
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,818
I'm not doing this, House.

654
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,778
It's not fun any more.

655
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,280
Just do your job.

656
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,045
I need your help.

657
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,965
What happened to your face?

658
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,218
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

659
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,847
You're a computer. I'm gonna feed
you data, and you analyze it.

660
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,012
What are you gonna feed me,

661
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,808
20 years of
medical knowledge, too?

662
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,144
It's not gonna work.

663
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,690
I know. But I don't
have anyone else to ask.

664
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,654
It's lonely, isn't it?

665
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,532
It's not that bad.

666
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,285
Then you're not that smart.

667
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,621
You ever try to kill yourself?

668
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,873
Not quickly.

669
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:44,957
I did.

670
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,752
Twelve years ago, I jumped off the
top of my eight-story building

671
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,713
into a dumpster bin
the day before pick-up.

672
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:55,760
I broke my collar bone,
my leg and three ribs.

673
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,637
When I was in the hospital,
they put me on narcotics

674
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,682
and suddenly
everything was just better.

675
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,103
I didn't feel
isolated or lonely.

676
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,856
That's where I met my wife.

677
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,903
She was so happy and dumb.

678
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,573
And I was

679
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,037
smart and miserable.

680
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,290
You tell me who the genius is.

681
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,794
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head

682
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,214
and I knew I wanted to
stay that way forever.

683
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,766
Enjoy.

684
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,603
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

685
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,397
What's a conscience?

686
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:05,538
Which ribs did you break in the fall?
Down the left side?

687
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,958
Yeah, bottom three.
But that was 12 years ago.

688
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,299
This probably cost me my marriage,
so it better be awesome.

689
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,843
Ferrous oxide contrast?

690
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,971
It gets absorbed by the spleen,

691
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,597
unless he doesn't have one,

692
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,684
in which case it's absorbed
by the liver and fries that.

693
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,852
You're killing him?

694
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,895
You think I opened him up and
didn't take out his spleen?

695
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,482
All organs do look kind of
the same, red and squishy.

696
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,781
Oh, my God.

697
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,575
Accessory spleens.

698
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,869
Okay, that is amazing.

699
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,788
Twelve years, eight stories
and a dumpster ago,

700
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,165
he broke three ribs,
damaged his spleen.

701
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,877
Bits of it split off, circulated
through his blood stream

702
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,004
until they landed and
attached somewhere else.

703
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,048
So, it is TTP.

704
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:02,261
I just didn't remove
all of his spleens.

705
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,389
Sixteen splenectomies,

706
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,975
pretty sure he gets a set
of steak knives with that.

707
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,613
I can outrun you.

708
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,996
Sorry about the nose. And the eye.
And the eyebrow.

709
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,207
Guess I deserved it.

710
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,085
Well, if I thought that,
I wouldn't be apologizing.

711
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,463
Your fist slipped?

712
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,841
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

713
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,429
So you bust my nose to
keep people off your back?

714
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,059
Pretty much.

715
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,936
Making people even more
worried about you.

716
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,522
Maybe. But at least they're
not talking to me about it.

717
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,360
Fair enough.

718
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,736
Cheers.

719
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,537
Thank you.

720
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,872
Don't be so grateful.

721
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,501
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

722
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,088
Well, thanks for our talk.

723
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,299
It's been a while since I had
a stimulating conversation.

724
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,505
So what are you going to do?

725
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,135
Go back to my life.

726
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,428
Which one?

727
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,014
The one that has my wife in it.

728
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,726
Robotripping.

729
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,520
How does she feel about that?

730
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:38,148
Well, she doesn't have to know.
It's worked for 12 years.

731
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,657
Tell your brain I said goodbye.

732
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,835
Einstein's giving
himself a lobotomy,

733
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,712
and you're cool with that?

734
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,757
Ignorance is bliss.

735
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,054
Hold that pose.

736
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,230
I'll start with t-shirts and
mugs and see how it goes.

737
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,948
Home early.

738
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,454
What happened to him?

739
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,876
You beat up House?

740
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,878
Just one right hook.

741
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:41,962
Why? What happened?

742
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,047
You were right.

743
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,383
I told him we need to lay down some
ground rules, it got a little heated.

744
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:50,471
That's not what I meant.
Is he okay?

745
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,347
Are you going to
be fired? Arrested?

746
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,141
Everything's fine.

747
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,311
Wow.

748
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,372
Dr. Cuddy.

749
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,922
Can we at least be civil?

750
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,716
How's your nose?

751
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,094
It's okay.

752
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,513
Does your kid like animals?

753
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,598
I got tickets to
that holiday carnival.

754
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,184
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

755
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,937
I think I was
pretty clear before.

756
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,772
I don't mean with me.

757
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,526
Here. Take them. Enjoy.

758
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,945
No, thanks.

759
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,616
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

760
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,078
One of the nurses was selling
them for her kid's scout troop.

761
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,621
I know it doesn't make
things right between us,

762
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,457
but I just wanted
to do something nice.

763
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,212
I don't want them.

764
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,383
Okay.

765
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,219
I'll see you tomorrow.

766
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,273
They didn't split up.

767
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,900
She wouldn't take the tickets.

768
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,405
Of course. Windtalker code
for "we never split up."

769
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,115
House, she told you
multiple times

770
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,741
she wants nothing
to do with you.

771
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,994
I wasn't gonna be there.

772
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:41,248
She just felt guilty that I felt
guilty, so she couldn't take them.

773
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,834
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

774
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,836
These weren't reparations,

775
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,048
just a simple gesture of remorse,
and she slapped it down.

776
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,926
They didn't break up.

777
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,430
She just wanted me to think
that, so I'd back off.

778
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,934
Dare I ask what
you're gonna do?

779
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,605
Nothing.

780
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,691
I said they'd either break
up or they'd stay together.

781
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,735
They didn't break up.

782
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,280
And you're okay with that?

783
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,699
It is what it is.

784
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,370
Good for you.

785
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,298
House knows I lied.

786
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,716
Why? What did he say?

787
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,385
Nothing. I could just tell.

788
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,845
You gonna stage
another breakup?

789
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,138
No.

790
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,640
Oh.

791
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,308
Hi.

792
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,728
It seems like he's
going to leave us alone.

793
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,314
Mmm. Why would he do that?

794
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,982
I'm not completely sure.

795
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,987
So, we have his blessing?

796
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,490
I guess so.

797
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,117
I made you some
eggplant Parmesan.

798
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,831
And maybe House
isn't so bad after all.

799
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,836
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?
