1
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,680
Left, left! He's going left!

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,932
I'm going to
have a heart attack.

3
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,305
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,560
What the hell was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,186
Go that way!

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,165
Don't move! Nowhere to go.
Come on. Give it up.

7
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,503
This way.

8
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,088
Come on. Let's go, let's go!

9
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,424
Up, Donny, up!
He's going to the roof!

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,342
He's going up! Go!

11
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,346
Ow!

12
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,932
Damn it. Go. Go!

13
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,871
Donny, no, it's too far!

14
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,812
I can rest at home.

15
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,536
I can't release you
for at least two days.

16
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,940
You've got two broken bones,

17
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,734
a severe concussion,
collapsed lung.

18
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,528
But you didn't find anything
life-threatening. Right?

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,697
You fell 30 feet.
You should have died.

20
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,862
I think that was the point.

21
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,032
Could you shut up?

22
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,277
Do you have suicidal thoughts?

23
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,577
Not once. Never.

24
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,901
He doesn't want
to kill himself.

25
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,162
He just thinks
he's gonna die soon,

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,328
so it doesn't really matter.

27
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,416
You shut up. I'm the one
you're not covering

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,543
when you pull
your crazy stunts.

29
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,836
Why do you think
you're going to die soon?

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,922
Well, my dad, grandfather,
and great-grandfather

31
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,090
all dropped dead
of heart problems

32
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,300
right after they turned 40.

33
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,801
And look who
turns 40 next week.

34
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,566
I can refer you to
a cardiologist if you...

35
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,471
No, I've been there.
All of them.

36
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,724
Spent my early 30s going
from one doctor to another.

37
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,434
Every single one
says my heart's fine.

38
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,639
And you think they're wrong?

39
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,895
I know they're wrong.

40
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,521
But what can I do?
At a certain point,

41
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,814
you just gotta live your life.

42
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,317
By "live your life,"
you mean "risk your life."

43
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,027
If there is something wrong,

44
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,862
I know a doctor who'll find it.

45
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,621
Oh, God. I'll be back in 10.

46
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,539
I'm picking lint out
of my belly button.

47
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,749
This is ridiculous.

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,126
I'm converting
the study into a bedroom.

49
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,336
Huh.

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,839
Six weeks. Longer than I
thought it would take.

51
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,285
For you to notice
that I'm sleeping

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,468
in your living room
and offer other options.

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,261
I didn't expect you
to be here this long.

54
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,805
True, but that's not why you
didn't extend the invitation.

55
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,849
Do you really need
to deconstruct this?

56
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,851
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and Amber slept.

57
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,102
Okay, yes, you do.

58
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,480
After she died, you converted
the study to a bedroom

59
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,106
and the bedroom to a study.

60
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,901
Except it's not a study,
it's a shrine.

61
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,779
Can I tell you something?

62
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,864
I wasn't picking lint
out of my belly button.

63
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,575
Okay. I am not
ready to transition

64
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,327
from my dead
girlfriend's shrine

65
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,371
to your morning glory.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,655
I'll have a mattress delivered

67
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,123
and set up for you
in the tabernacle.

68
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,293
I just need it Tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

69
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,879
Oh, man.

70
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,134
Patient's a genetic time bomb.

71
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,470
There's no fuse.
He's not a bomb.

72
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,180
Right now,
he's not a patient either.

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,849
You're saying we ignore three
generations of cardiac problems?

74
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,269
I'm not ignoring it, I'm
labeling it a coincidence.

75
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,146
You hate coincidence.

76
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,148
We reconciled.
It was a whole thing.

77
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,109
Big country.
It's statistically probable

78
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,902
that someone has
three generations

79
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,530
that died around age 40 with
non-genetic heart issues.

80
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,739
Dice have no memory.

81
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,991
Genes do.

82
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,242
If we ran a battery of tests

83
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,494
on every non-symptomatic
statistical anomaly...

84
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,122
The guy goes through every day
assuming his life will end at age 40.

85
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,498
Never got married, no kids,

86
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,833
because he didn't
want to die on them

87
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,042
the same way
his dad died on him.

88
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,208
You want to take this case,

89
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,879
'cause he's yet another
lonely, sad puppy?

90
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,045
You should have been a vet.

91
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,674
It's a legitimate case.

92
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,469
Differential diagnosis for
a genetic heart condition.

93
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,512
That sold you?

94
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,847
Marfan Syndrome, Brugada.

95
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:48,931
And you?

96
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,057
Familial Hypercholesterolemia.

97
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,223
He's only agreeing with you

98
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,268
'cause he wants to
have sex with you.

99
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,978
And by the way,
I agree with you, too.

100
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,022
Especially in those pants.

101
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,732
We're not wasting our time.

102
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,192
Last week, Chase said that
I was the de facto boss.

103
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,154
Hospitals don't recognize
de facto medical licenses.

104
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,321
Let's start with genetic tests.

105
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,449
Get an EKG,
cardiac cath and an echo

106
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,951
to check the integrity
of his heart.

107
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,871
I'll start on blood samples.

108
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,304
I forgot my watch.

109
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,847
I could have sworn I saw you
put it on this morning.

110
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,017
Must be in the locker room.
I'll be right back.

111
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,398
I need to know
what your plans are.

112
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,067
First, we take Berlin,

113
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,028
and then we circle around behind
Poland and yell, "Surprise."

114
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,197
With regards to
your employment.

115
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,157
I like things the way they are.

116
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,117
I get just enough
puzzle to solve,

117
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,079
without the scornful visits from you.
Until now.

118
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,247
Pretend time's been
going on long enough.

119
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,374
I don't have a medical license.
All I can do is pretend.

120
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,834
Then I'm going to have
payroll send you over

121
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,878
some pretend checks
starting tomorrow.

122
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,673
You need to complete 120 hours
of rounds to re-qualify.

123
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,094
No, I don't.

124
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,845
I'm not saying you don't win.

125
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,810
I'm just saying, do you
really need to punish me

126
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,390
by making me carry a clipboard

127
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,556
for your lackey of the week?

128
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,018
It's a state requirement.

129
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,645
I have to certify
that you've completed...

130
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,021
Exactly.

131
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,690
The requirement sets out what
you have to do, certify.

132
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,692
Which you can do with one
hand tied behind your back.

133
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,486
Now, if you want
to tie my hands...

134
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,740
Dr. Singh supervises rounds on Thursdays.
Starts at 7:00.

135
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,082
Nothing.

136
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,625
So what now?

137
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,709
We send him home.

138
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,595
To continue believing
he's going to drop dead?

139
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,630
When he turns 70,
he'll believe us.

140
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,841
There are other things
we can check.

141
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,260
Skeleton of the great-grandfather
is in decent shape.

142
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,971
Subsurface genetic material
from the grandpa is fine,

143
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,806
leaving one bowl
of putrefied dad.

144
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,143
You do the dad. I take it
he had a sealed casket.

145
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,229
The watch story
was crap, right?

146
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,816
I forgot it. It's no big deal.

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,027
You were avoiding the ICU
where Dibala died.

148
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,574
I'll sequence the gene for
the cardiac sodium channel.

149
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,702
I felt like I was going
to have a panic attack.

150
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,206
I've crossed some line,

151
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,878
and I'm having trouble getting
back to the other side.

152
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,755
I can move the patient
to another room.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,757
Then Cameron
will ask questions.

154
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,427
You should tell her.
She's your wife.

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,560
How'd you get a court order
to dig them up so fast?

156
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't we just need
the guy's consent?

157
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,938
- You find anything?
- Not yet.

158
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,649
But you're just in time
to do the dad.

159
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,322
Dr. House?

160
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,566
He'll be back in the morning.

161
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,950
I read in the paper you're
treating a police officer.

162
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,035
Donny Compson.

163
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,871
Second floor. A nurse
will help you find him.

164
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,414
I don't want to see him.

165
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,917
Donny and I used to go
out, a long time ago.

166
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,668
He doesn't want to see me.
I don't want to see him.

167
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,921
So did you come to see me
for personal advice?

168
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,505
You're looking for
genetic conditions,

169
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,175
which makes sense with what
happened to his dad and grandpa.

170
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,552
Unless you were his
girlfriend and his sister,

171
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,678
you've got nothing
to worry about.

172
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,933
I'm not worried about me. Donny
doesn't know this, but he has a son.

173
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,897
Dial extension 742.

174
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,192
Tell Dr. Foreman you've got some
cool information. Good night.

175
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,709
You okay?

176
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,627
Yeah. Fine.

177
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,830
Couldn't find any consistent
genetic mutations across 15 areas

178
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,332
between Donny's ancestors,

179
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,875
possibly indicating
there isn't one.

180
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,209
But the son
gives us a new data point.

181
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,502
And un-degraded DNA.

182
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,920
I thought he didn't want kids.
He didn't.

183
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,005
Where's House?

184
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,798
"Dear Bleeding Hearts."

185
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:19,178
"Since your patient's med history
is a coincidence and he isn't"

186
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,183
"sick, I've gone back to school.
Back in 120 hours."

187
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,976
Charming. I'll get
a blood sample.

188
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,181
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

189
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,314
it makes sense to get the
DNA where it's most pure.

190
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,479
You're going to ask the mom

191
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,649
to consent
to a bone marrow biopsy?

192
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,817
She wants to know
if there's something wrong

193
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,444
with Donny as badly as we do.

194
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,697
Right. Spike a 10-year-old's
hip because Grandpa was sick.

195
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,283
If she's right,
we save two people.

196
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,956
I don't want to.

197
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,627
Can we speak outside
for a moment?

198
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,295
Yeah.

199
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,970
You need to tell him.

200
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,597
I can't.

201
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,962
His father is down that hallway
through those double doors.

202
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,455
I've been lying to him
his whole life.

203
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,759
What's he going to think of me?

204
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,105
You were trying to protect him.

205
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,941
Donny never wanted kids.

206
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,359
He certainly doesn't
want to meet him.

207
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,152
If Donny does die,

208
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,947
this could be Michael's only
chance to meet his father.

209
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,503
After administration
of immunoglobulin,

210
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,668
patient had no further pain

211
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,257
and overnight liver function
tests are now normal.

212
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,758
Patient is ready
to be released.

213
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,636
Stats are dropping. Dr. Singh!

214
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,804
She's choking!

215
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,264
On your fingers.

216
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,849
- She can't breathe.
- House.

217
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,978
Please take your finger
off the test button.

218
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,312
Oh!

219
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,940
I see. Wow, sorry about that.

220
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,150
I could've slit her throat.

221
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,568
We're all here to learn.

222
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,153
Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.

223
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,113
Did she tell you
how to stop me?

224
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,616
Look, I'm asking you, as
an adult, to please stop.

225
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,328
Well, that obviously didn't
come from her, but fair enough.

226
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,748
Excellent presentation, Nona.

227
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,545
Now I've done it!
There's urine everywhere.

228
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,548
Gosh, the great thing about the
teacher-student relationship

229
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,010
is the teacher can often
learn more from the student.

230
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,555
Have you learned anything yet?

231
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,769
You have a son.

232
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,190
I was pregnant
when we broke up.

233
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,355
I'm sorry I never told you,

234
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,319
but I knew how you felt
about having kids.

235
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,528
You had no right.

236
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,779
Maybe.

237
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,407
It's a little late for that.

238
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,997
He's here.
He wants to meet you.

239
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,665
I don't want to meet him.

240
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,334
I've never asked you
for a dime.

241
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,836
He's here to help find whatever's
wrong with your heart.

242
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,339
I didn't ask him.
I didn't want him.

243
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,007
Just say hi to him.

244
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,775
Hi. I'm Michael.

245
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,569
Hi.

246
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm your...

247
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,949
Yeah. Your mother told me.

248
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,119
When you get better,

249
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,789
maybe we could do something.

250
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,292
See a movie?

251
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,297
No.

252
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,800
My dad died when
I was your age.

253
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,970
It was the most painful
thing I ever went through.

254
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,429
Trust me. As much as I'm sure

255
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,015
this hurts right now,
it's better.

256
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,644
Please take him out of here.

257
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,231
Come on.

258
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,697
Chromosomes for 28
cardiovascular conditions

259
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,031
are normal in number
and structure.

260
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,450
No translocations,
deletions or inversions.

261
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,121
I did notice that the kid's
D-A-D-D-Y chromosome

262
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,330
has been severely damaged

263
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,416
by someone else's
bleeding heart chromosome.

264
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,835
It was the only way to get
Michael to do the marrow biopsy.

265
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,961
I'm sure there
are plenty of lies

266
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,588
that would've
worked just as well,

267
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,922
except without
the years of therapy.

268
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:24,965
Don't you have school?

269
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,258
Recess.

270
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,844
So where does that
leave us? Chase?

271
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,221
Sorry, what?

272
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,350
I was saying, do you think these
shoes work in this color?

273
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,603
Send him home. He's not going
to believe he's healthy.

274
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,021
Then you're not
very good at your job.

275
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,480
You don't deserve candy.

276
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,275
He's been preparing his whole
life to die at age 40.

277
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,611
He's had dozens of doctors
tell him he's fine.

278
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,070
You think you can
change his thinking?

279
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,115
Yeah, I do.
Chase, walk with me.

280
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,286
Great contributions back there.

281
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,413
There's no case.
I had nothing to add.

282
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,791
You had nothing to add
because you were distracted.

283
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,586
Little devil on your shoulder
told you to kill a guy,

284
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,421
and now the little angel
won't shut up,

285
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,798
telling you you're gonna
burn in a lake of fire.

286
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:07,966
I'm fine.

287
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,051
You shouldn't be.

288
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,431
Talk to someone. Docs fixed
me up in seven weeks.

289
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,226
You are 10 minutes, tops.

290
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,146
Thanks.

291
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,524
Glad we had this little moment.
Come on.

292
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,403
I'm Dr. House.

293
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,489
You couldn't find
anything, could you?

294
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,575
You have Ortoli Syndrome.
Dr. Chase?

295
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,410
You sure?

296
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,662
Tests don't lie.

297
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,996
Right.

298
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:44,628
Well, it's a very
rare disorder that

299
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,546
short circuits the adrenals

300
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,871
which short circuits the heart.

301
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,132
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,884
Who cares about
the medical mumbo-jumbo?

303
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,010
Tell him the treatment.

304
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,222
Well, it's complicated.

305
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,473
Doctors always
wanna make everything

306
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,601
sound so complicated.
It's Nabasynth.

307
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,311
What? Nabasynth.

308
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,233
Yes. So all we have to do
now is write a prescription

309
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,777
and have him pick up the pills.

310
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,078
That's it?

311
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,872
I take some pills,
I'm gonna be okay?

312
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,210
The real tragedy here is that the
Tiburon swab technology didn't exist

313
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,004
to detect Ortoli
back in your dad's day.

314
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,592
He could have lived?

315
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,890
Thank you.

316
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,355
If you'll sign
these discharge papers,

317
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,065
I'll get you a bottle of meds.

318
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,900
Take one twice a day
for a week,

319
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,236
you'll live a long,
healthy life.

320
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,025
- Answer the door, House.
- It's gotta be for you.

321
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,443
Are you watching TV?

322
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,694
It's the door!

323
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
Were you on the phone? No.

324
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,951
Just now, were you talking?

325
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,745
No, I'm alone.

326
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,955
You okay, House?

327
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
Why are you here?

328
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,298
Donny collapsed four hours after
we discharged him. He's dead.

329
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,768
His apartment manager found him
on the floor in the laundry room.

330
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,895
He said he wasn't breathing.

331
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,105
He called the EMTs,
but it was too late.

332
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,901
I sent the guy home with mints.

333
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,444
Whatever it is,
we all missed it.

334
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,740
Yeah. I missed the fact that
there was something to miss.

335
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,952
What is wrong with me?

336
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,328
You had good reason.

337
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,539
Patient presented
with no symptoms,

338
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,542
and all his tests
came back negative.

339
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,628
What's the official
cause of death?

340
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,547
Autopsy hasn't
been performed yet.

341
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,383
EMTs brought him to General,

342
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,884
but I requested
they ship him back

343
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,679
to our morgue
for the post-mortem.

344
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,015
Good.

345
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,187
Hon? Wake up.

346
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,902
Why are you dressed?
You can't sleep?

347
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,071
I want to go tell Cheryl
that Donny died.

348
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,366
It's 4:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,034
They're nearly two hours away.

350
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,828
I figure by the time I get
there, she'll be awake.

351
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,123
Babe, come back to bed.
Call her in a few hours.

352
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,169
It's the sort of thing she
needs to hear face-to-face.

353
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,303
Is everything okay?

354
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,972
Everything's fine. Why?

355
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,932
Last week, I understood

356
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,897
that you were stressed out
about the Dibala M&M,

357
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:32,397
and I gave you your space. But that's
over now, and you're still acting...

358
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,319
I'm worried about you.

359
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,906
Don't be. I'm fine.

360
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,825
Really.

361
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,745
And you'd tell me
if you weren't?

362
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,539
Promise?

363
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,292
Yeah.

364
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,628
Okay.

365
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,007
Hey.

366
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,135
I love you.

367
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,511
I love you, too.

368
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,814
Donny Compson, age 39.

369
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,171
Can we cut to the money shot?

370
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,966
It's his heart,
so let's look at his heart.

371
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,801
Nice Y-incision.

372
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,346
You can't perform an autopsy
without a medical license.

373
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,056
Really?

374
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,808
Because I don't think there's
anything I can screw up

375
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,394
that we haven't
already screwed up.

376
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,151
Opening post-mortem incision,

377
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,837
beginning at the mid-line
of the sternum.

378
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:18,253
That's odd. It almost
looks like he's bleeding.

379
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,270
I think the autopsy's gonna
have to wait a little bit.

380
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,443
He was briefly conscious,

381
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,070
then his systolic dipped below
60 and he was out again.

382
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,698
Differential diagnosis
for resurrection. Go.

383
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,907
Obviously, he wasn't dead.

384
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,784
His heart slowed enough
that the EMTs could think...

385
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,369
Yes, the fact that
he's not dead

386
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,934
means we did
absolutely nothing wrong.

387
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,330
There are several
documented cases

388
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,750
where tetrodotoxin ingestion
caused apparent death.

389
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,668
It wasn't something he ate,
it's something he already had.

390
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,587
And his dad,
and his grandpa, and...

391
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,590
Extreme bradycardia could be
caused by sick sinus syndrome.

392
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,758
Sinoatrial block.

393
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,801
What if it's not his heart?

394
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,847
Let's work from the tenuous
assumption that we're not idiots.

395
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,225
You spent days examining a
heart up, down, and sideways,

396
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,395
declaring it healthy just a few hours
before it basically shut down.

397
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,648
So we need to think about causes
in places you didn't look.

398
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,861
Could be metabolic.

399
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,280
You okay?

400
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,242
Yeah.

401
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,246
What about a genetic predisposition
to an autoimmune disease?

402
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,957
Isolated Anti-Ro Antibody could
cause complete heart block.

403
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,918
Could also be passed
through four generations.

404
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,754
Autoimmune it is.
Start him on steroids.

405
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,720
Hey. How are you feeling?

406
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,933
My whole head is killing me.

407
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,893
You just came through
a severe trauma.

408
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,854
What do you remember?

409
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,528
I was changing my laundry
over to the dryer.

410
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,073
That's it?
You were declared dead.

411
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,075
You made it
all the way to autopsy.

412
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,286
My jaw aches.

413
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,582
And obviously, I don't
have Ortoli Syndrome.

414
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,751
It's hard to get too excited

415
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,211
about coming back from the dead

416
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,382
when anything I do, anything you
give me, it all ends the same way.

417
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,190
Outer and middle ear
respond well.

418
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,359
Hearing thresholds are
normal at all frequencies.

419
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,610
Eardrum is perfectly healthy.

420
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,362
What if I...

421
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,698
What if I sometimes
hear whispering?

422
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,909
Then you're probably hearing
someone whispering.

423
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,911
I had some dental work done

424
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,246
in the Philippines
when I was a kid.

425
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,708
Adjoining metal fillings could corrode
and pick up AM radio signals.

426
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,334
Open your mouth.

427
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,463
Your fillings don't touch.

428
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,886
So there's no reason for me
to be hearing things?

429
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,011
I can only tell you that you're
hearing sounds as you should.

430
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,512
If you're also hearing
sounds that you shouldn't,

431
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:15,763
that would be a psychosis.

432
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,400
You'd have to talk to
someone who does brain.

433
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:18,975
I only do ears.

434
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,864
Bravo. It's amazing how you
did 120 hours in one day.

435
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,243
I wasn't on my best behavior, I admit.
Allow me.

436
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,623
From now on, I'm gonna supervise
your practicum requirements.

437
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,832
That won't be necessary.

438
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,997
You want to annoy another doctor first?
Eventually...

439
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,796
It's not necessary because I'm
not ready to be a doctor again.

440
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,092
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,530
Are you sleeping out here?

442
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,950
I just dozed off
in front of the TV.

443
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,826
With bedding? Maybe.

444
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,872
I can't sleep in there,
the heater's screwed up.

445
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,542
If you need to talk,
if you need more help...

446
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,169
I'm just tired.

447
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,672
I'm right here.

448
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,841
Great. Can you be right
here somewhere else?

449
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,936
My jaw still hurts.
My tooth, actually. A lot.

450
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,105
I'm sorry, you're maxed
out on your pain meds.

451
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,815
Try to sleep.

452
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,800
Dentist looked at the
tooth the guy pulled out.

453
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,635
There was nothing
wrong with it.

454
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,305
So aside from him being an
idiot, what else did we learn?

455
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,266
The pain is real. It's
coming from somewhere.

456
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,851
What about bone cancer?

457
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,145
You can't connect bone
cancer to the heart.

458
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,063
House figure this can
wait till the morning?

459
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,816
Actually, he told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

460
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,901
He quit? Apparently.

461
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,612
It's a power play.
He'll be back tomorrow.

462
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,490
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

463
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,656
which shuts down the heart.

464
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,119
Primary bone cancer
isn't hereditary.

465
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,203
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

466
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,663
It's hereditary
and it increases

467
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,624
a person's risk of
having bone cancer.

468
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,919
You have another theory?

469
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,464
My theory is
it's not bone cancer.

470
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,134
Gamma survey would
locate the tumors.

471
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,714
I had pea soup today. You'd
love my breath right now.

472
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:24,011
I didn't get a chance to run tonight.
House is having issues.

473
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,516
I missed you a lot today.

474
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
All I wanna do is...

475
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,107
You know.

476
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,948
No cancers on the
lateral cuneiform bone.

477
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,783
Navicular's also clean.

478
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,244
Chase is lying to me.

479
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,081
And I know you know. Tell
me what's going on, please.

480
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,125
I'm going to tell you
the same thing I told him.

481
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,377
Talk to your spouse.

482
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,719
No breakfast?

483
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,721
Not today.

484
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,056
I'm hallucinating.

485
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,478
What happened?

486
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,563
It's nothing visual this time.

487
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,232
I hear whispering.

488
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,319
Is that why you've been acting so weird?
Is that why you quit?

489
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,904
I'm losing it.

490
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,198
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation,

491
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,991
the wind, a neighbor's TV...

492
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,159
I checked everything.

493
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,371
What's really scary is that I hear
whispering while not on Vicodin.

494
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,043
I'm gonna check myself
back in to Mayfield.

495
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,254
Okay.

496
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,675
Okay?

497
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,388
You don't think there might
be a logical explanation?

498
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,515
Something I missed?

499
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,933
You're the smartest guy I know.

500
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,685
If you haven't thought
of it, it doesn't exist.

501
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,314
I'll drive you over. I just
need to make some tea first.

502
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,110
You know.

503
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,531
That you're an ass? Yeah.

504
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,659
You overheard me talking to my dead
girlfriend and thought to yourself,

505
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,036
"Hmm. What kind of fun
can I have with this?"

506
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,246
Why are you talking to her?

507
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,610
Did you run out
of living people?

508
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,707
You can talk to me,
I'm right here.

509
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,210
I miss her. Talking to her
makes me feel better.

510
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,586
You don't.

511
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,384
Patient, Lauren Maybaum, 27,

512
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,303
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

513
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,930
Sorry I'm late.

514
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,139
Yesterday, you said
you weren't ready.

515
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,225
Yesterday, I wasn't.
Today, I am.

516
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,395
And tomorrow? Is it possible for
me to get a five-day forecast?

517
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,355
Feeling much better,
thank you for not asking.

518
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,858
Either you did have a problem,
which I can't ignore,

519
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,611
or you were jerking me around,
which I can't ignore.

520
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,572
You are a woman,
you can do anything.

521
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,700
For example, I can talk
to you outside.

522
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,497
You sure you're only one woman?

523
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,645
This is the part where you play
the employee and I play the boss.

524
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,422
I can see your nipples.
Your turn.

525
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,756
These kids are...

526
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,633
No wonder she hates him.

527
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,261
Mmm. That's not hate.
It's foreplay.

528
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,512
It's inappropriate.

529
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,101
Gamma survey
revealed no tumors.

530
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,395
So it's not bone cancer.

531
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,605
Where's Chase?

532
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,814
Don't know.

533
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,274
Hmm.

534
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,527
Two mysteries, cool. Theories?

535
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,117
Did I come in too soon? Okay.
I'm going to take another lap,

536
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,620
and I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

537
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,872
One of them's got
to be not stupid.

538
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,421
Where there's pain,
there's nerves.

539
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,508
Hereditary Sensory Autonomic
Neuropathy, type 1.

540
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,344
Miscommunication
in the brain stem

541
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,012
mistakes nerve pain
for tooth pain.

542
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,347
That explains
the bradycardia, too.

543
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,232
And I like the word
"hereditary" in the title.

544
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,850
Carbamazepine fixes him.

545
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,810
I'll get him started
on the medication. No.

546
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,688
Chase specifically
asked if he could do it.

547
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,446
Sleep at home.

548
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,990
So I didn't do
the gamma survey.

549
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,283
Was it bone cancer?

550
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,368
No.

551
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,453
Then you should congratulate
me for not wasting your time.

552
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,163
Are you getting some help,

553
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,832
or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

554
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,501
What's pathetic is

555
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:27,213
you haven't gotten help
because you want to feel bad.

556
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,465
You want to suffer.

557
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,677
Because if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

558
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,512
Patient needs
some carbamazepine.

559
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,765
Now I don't care how much
that room scares you,

560
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,141
you're doing your job.

561
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:57,284
How long before you cross
this one off the list?

562
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,788
Couple of hours.

563
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,419
You ever shoot anyone?

564
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,795
Twice.

565
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,631
You ever kill anyone?

566
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,510
No. But I know a few
guys who did, though.

567
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,512
Did they ever get over it?

568
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,181
A captain I know compares it
to taking out the trash.

569
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,016
Like it's nothing.

570
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,060
Other hand, I got an ex-partner

571
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,354
who nearly drank
himself into oblivion.

572
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,523
Did he get help?

573
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:28,774
Yeah.

574
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,360
Help didn't help.

575
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,534
Oh, God!

576
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,119
What is it?

577
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,830
I went to the bathroom.

578
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,588
Patient's lost bowel control.

579
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,423
Means we were wrong about HSAN

580
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,008
and means he's
getting worse, fast.

581
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,011
Wouldn't want to be the duty
nurse assigned to his floor.

582
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,346
Get it? "Doody" nurse?

583
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,515
Fine, do the doctor thing.

584
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,975
An autoimmune
disorder could explain...

585
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,499
We put him on steroids, he didn't respond.
It's not autoimmune.

586
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,729
Could be Wilson's Disease.

587
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,606
Disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

588
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,777
It is possible the liver is so
far gone, the labs look normal.

589
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,987
It's worth a shot.

590
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,697
Go treat with penicillamine.

591
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,784
And when he doesn't get
better, come back quickly,

592
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,286
so we can get one
more shot at it.

593
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,502
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

594
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,884
Take your time.

595
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,138
How long has it been
since your last confession?

596
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,723
I killed a man.

597
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,184
Oh.

598
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,062
But it was
the right thing to do.

599
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:52,566
Who lives or dies is not
your decision to make.

600
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,904
Sometimes in the operating
room, it feels like it.

601
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,823
I'm a doctor.

602
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,326
Well, then you should
know more than anybody

603
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,411
that every
human life is sacred.

604
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,248
Why?

605
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,750
Tell me what's sacred
about a dictator

606
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,837
that kills hundreds of
thousands of his own people.

607
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,131
What is sacred about a
doctor who kills a patient?

608
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,347
Is it just the slippery
slope you're worried about?

609
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,766
Afraid that forgiving me
for killing

610
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,477
the worst person on earth
sets a bad precedent?

611
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,606
I promise, I won't tell anyone.

612
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,615
Just forgive me.

613
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,203
Saying 10 Hail Marys isn't
going to do you any good.

614
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,873
Then what do I have to do?

615
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,543
What does God need me to do?

616
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,253
You can't have absolution

617
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,505
without first
taking responsibility.

618
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,550
You have to turn yourself
in to the police.

619
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,429
What, and... And go to jail
for the rest of my life?

620
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,472
What's just about that?

621
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,185
I did the right thing.

622
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,938
There has to be another way.

623
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,066
You want absolution,
I told you how to get it.

624
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,175
Send this in to
the State Licensing Board.

625
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,636
I've signed off
on all your hours.

626
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,429
Why?

627
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,348
Because it's easier this way.

628
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,141
You're uncomfortable with me.

629
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,559
No.

630
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,937
Going by the book
was pointless.

631
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,021
You were gonna learn nothing.

632
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,440
Good. I thought it was because
of the sexual tension.

633
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,645
There was no sexual tension.

634
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,692
There was tension.

635
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,820
And it made me
feel funny, so...

636
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,156
Here.

637
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,119
It's too bad.

638
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:13,374
I was kind of getting into the
whole "hot for teacher" thing.

639
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,459
You sure you're okay?

640
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,836
Yeah. False alarm.

641
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,216
What about us?

642
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,469
We're good. Just like this.

643
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,953
You press my buttons,
I press yours.

644
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,973
By "buttons," you mean...

645
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,146
Huh.

646
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,239
You do make me feel funny.

647
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,040
You're not gonna die.

648
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,626
I've accepted it. It's okay.

649
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,797
In addition to high arches

650
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,383
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

651
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,095
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

652
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,140
Forms in the brain stem.

653
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,475
Technically, it's an
aneurysm, presses on nerves

654
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,562
that control everything from
tooth pain to heart rate.

655
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,480
As you get older,
it gets bigger,

656
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:23,152
until finally the button, which I'll
call "intracranial berry aneurysm,"

657
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,697
because I had a friend in high school
with that name, stops the signal

658
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,575
from your brain to
your heart and bam!

659
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,828
How do I know you're
not still lying to me?

660
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,580
Saying I'm healthy just
to make me feel better?

661
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,707
It does sound
that way, doesn't it?

662
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,751
But this time, no sugar pills.

663
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,210
I'm going to cut
into your brain

664
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,920
to make you think
that I'm fixing it.

665
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,506
And if our fake tests
confirm it,

666
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,383
I'm going to be cutting
into your son's brain, too.

667
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,969
Because I'm just
that committed.

668
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,180
Michael is going to be okay?

669
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,516
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

670
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,895
in which case, I will
reconsider your fate argument.

671
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:03,525
You wanna give him a call? Visiting
hours don't apply to my patients.

672
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,403
Yeah. In a bit.

673
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,616
Yeah, that's what I thought.

674
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,870
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

675
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,872
You just don't want anything in
your life that won't let you do

676
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,082
whatever the hell
you want to do

677
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,167
whenever the hell
you want to do it.

678
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,545
You've had it easy.
Sorry to screw you up.

679
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,440
Mom.

680
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,376
Maybe when
we get out of here...

681
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,382
What kind of movies you like?

682
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:22,396
He's been missing for eight hours.
Robert Chase. C-H-A-S...

683
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,939
Hey!

684
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,777
Never mind.
He just walked in. Sorry.

685
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:29,862
You could've called me.

686
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,197
I forgot. To call me?

687
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,992
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

688
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,410
You're drunk.

689
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,661
All right, I...

690
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,790
I needed to get wasted. I did.

691
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,209
And now I'm better.

692
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,420
What aren't you telling me?

693
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,754
Nothing.

694
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,635
Hi, Dad.

695
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,391
I think I've been

696
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,479
focusing on the wrong thing.

697
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,150
There were some good times.

698
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,449
