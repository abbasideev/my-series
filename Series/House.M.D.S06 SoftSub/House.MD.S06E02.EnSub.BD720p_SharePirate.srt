1
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,945
I guess everybody else is dead.

2
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,364
Which means we're
totally outnumbered.

3
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,242
We gotta make up for
that in pure firepower.

4
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,411
You want to raid the
feeding area, don't you?

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,954
Two boxes of grenades in there.

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,498
It's our only chance
at getting out.

7
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,626
Vince, that place
is a deathtrap.

8
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,546
Lucky for you I've
got the megablaster.

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,175
Lee, you go right, Roy,
straight down the middle.

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,136
I'll cover you both.

11
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,310
One, two, three.

12
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,111
Where's that cover fire?

13
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,031
Megablaster, dude, megablaster!

14
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,788
What the hell?

15
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,666
Got it. Vince, where are you?

16
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,044
I can't get them off of me.

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,550
Vince, you d-bag,
where are you?

18
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,262
Damn it! Damn it!

19
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,514
Damn it, Vince.

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,769
That blood look funny to you?

21
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,396
Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,150
Hey, boss, you just like watching
us get our asses shredded?

23
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,526
Yeah, not that
you're not hilarious,

24
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,738
but we hit the shelves
in three months.

25
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,033
Vince?

26
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,037
Vince, what's wrong?

27
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,750
My hands, they're on fire.

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,084
Your NCV test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel.

29
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,837
No evidence of trauma,
your blood work looks normal.

30
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,922
Then what is it? I don't know.

31
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,632
I'll arrange to have you
transferred to a neurologist.

32
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,468
A neurologist? Don't you have
some famous diagnostics guy?

33
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,594
What's he doing?

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,930
I quit.

35
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,189
You can't quit.

36
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,194
I think you're confusing me
with Jake Gyllenhaal.

37
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,276
House, are you okay?

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,028
Yeah. And I want
to stay that way.

39
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,363
I talked it over
with my therapist.

40
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,490
I need to change my
environment, my habits.

41
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,450
But he cleared you to
get your license back.

42
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,120
Which will help immensely
with my new job in research.

43
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,832
I've sent out some resumes. Research
means no patients, less pressure.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,377
But you just got out, have you had
enough time to think this through?

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,965
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,552
I know this will
affect both of you,

47
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,638
and Thirteen,
and the one with the nose.

48
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,935
But I just can't
risk coming back here.

49
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,317
Okay.

50
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,369
That was surprising.

51
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,669
I want to run the department.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,590
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

53
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,383
before you start angling
for his job?

54
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,968
He's not dead or sentimental,

55
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,303
and somebody needs to do it.

56
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,055
Not necessarily.

57
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,599
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

58
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,268
The only reason we have one
is because of House.

59
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,605
You reassigned us, kept us
on payroll for three months,

60
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,856
you might as well
give me a chance.

61
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,066
You're a great doctor,

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,528
I want you to stay on in
Neuro, but House was a genius.

63
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,240
House was an egotistical,
pill-popping, lawsuit magnet.

64
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,618
And a genius.

65
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,789
And I worked with him longer than
anybody else. I can do this.

66
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,672
You get one shot.

67
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,135
What's House gonna do?

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,929
No idea, but he's gone,

69
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,223
so how about we focus
on the medicine?

70
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,558
What?

71
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,519
You're the boss,
it's kind of sexy.

72
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,896
Here I thought
it was just the pants.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
Diabetic neuropathy?

74
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,733
HbA1c looks fine.

75
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,277
Could be hypothyroidism.

76
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,154
No fatigue or weight gain.

77
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,073
What about complex
regional pain syndrome?

78
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,908
That's a good idea.
Let's run with it.

79
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,035
Look at that. No House,
the job still gets done.

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,286
And yet, something's missing.

81
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,998
I'm short, he's black,
you're gay-ish.

82
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,165
That's it.

83
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,752
Treat for CRPS. Prep the patient
for spinal stimulation.

84
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,507
I don't buy it.

85
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,009
CRPS isn't that
well understood, but...

86
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,845
I think it's mercury poisoning.
I eat a ton of sushi.

87
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,304
And you're currently
getting mixed reviews

88
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,975
in Speed the Plow on Broadway?
Google it.

89
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,309
It's pretty hard to
consume enough fish

90
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,755
to give yourself
mercury poisoning,

91
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,855
and it doesn't usually
present solely with pain.

92
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,025
But it can. Check out the
Atlantic Medical Journal.

93
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,609
This guy came in
with burning pain

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,071
caused by Erythromelalgia

95
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,281
caused by mercury poisoning.

96
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,991
Who needs actual doctors when
you've got the Internet?

97
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,701
No offense,
but doctors make mistakes.

98
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,536
Medical errors are
up 30% this year.

99
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,455
You should check
the rate of patient error.

100
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,458
There's a ton of
information out there.

101
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,085
Why wouldn't I educate
myself, be my own advocate?

102
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,712
CRPS came up in my search, too,

103
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,464
but I've never had
any skin discoloration,

104
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,674
and my pain is sporadic,
not constant.

105
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,803
It's gotta be worth
one lousy blood test.

106
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,256
You know how House feels

107
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,674
about people touching his ball.

108
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,343
No, Chase refuses to tell me.

109
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,263
Right, my husband's gay. Witty.

110
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,932
I hear you're
taking over for House.

111
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,018
You're gonna be great.
Congratulations.

112
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,728
Not permanent.

113
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,648
Yet. Taub and Thirteen
cool with it?

114
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,858
He's older than you.
She's seen you naked.

115
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,111
Not like we haven't been working
together for two years now.

116
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,239
Working with is different
than working for.

117
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,951
You saw House, how was he?

118
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,037
He was good.

119
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,749
He was honest, took responsibility.
It was kind of weird.

120
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,712
Is Thirteen around? I need her
to sign off on her ER transfer.

121
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,298
She and Taub are doing
a spinal stimulation.

122
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,508
No, they're not.

123
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,927
I just dropped a patient
in the cath suite,

124
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,513
and your guys
were not in there.

125
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,811
You know, usually,
spinal stimulation

126
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,396
is done with the patient
in the room.

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,523
He asked us to test
his blood for mercury.

128
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,358
It's unlikely,
but not impossible.

129
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
It's also not
what we agreed on.

130
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,486
Testing doesn't hurt, and
it only takes 20 minutes.

131
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,654
I figured it didn't matter.

132
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,282
I'm thinking I should
decide when it matters.

133
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,160
If you're done
marking your territory...

134
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,998
Test results. Surprise, surprise,
Marcus Webly was wrong.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,709
I'll handle this.

136
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,090
You expected not to
have mixed feelings?

137
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,886
I know it's the right call.

138
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,182
I just don't know what to do
with my time, and my leg.

139
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,184
Pain's flared up
since I left Mayfield.

140
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,103
Ibuprofen's barely
putting a dent in it.

141
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,938
You need a hobby.

142
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,399
Right. Doctors the world
over treat chronic pain

143
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,984
with collections
of Hummel figurines.

144
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,986
No, I didn't say
you need a lame hobby.

145
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,823
You need something to keep you
engaged, connected to other people.

146
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,783
You already made me
get a roommate.

147
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,035
Wilson's got one bedroom.

148
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,163
I don't think we can get any more
connected without unzipping.

149
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,249
Okay. So what does
Wilson like to do?

150
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,506
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman,
Head of Diagnostics.

151
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,842
So you must be
the genius's replacement.

152
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,637
I prefer to think of
myself as Genius 2.0.

153
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,401
Your blood test ruled
out mercury poisoning.

154
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,140
What was my mercury level?
Two-point-eight.

155
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,308
That means for every
deciliter of blood...

156
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,727
I know what it means. I also
know it's above normal.

157
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,896
I want mercury chelation.

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,261
Your level isn't elevated enough
to produce your symptoms.

159
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,360
You can't know that until we de-elevate
it and see if my pain improves.

160
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,903
It's a judgment call.

161
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,239
Based on 10 years
of medical training?

162
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,033
I think you have CRPS. I want
to try spinal stimulation.

163
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:41,163
So, basically, you want to shove a needle
in my spine based on a glorified hunch.

164
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,332
I'll stick with the chelation.

165
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,837
If you don't want to get
better, I think we're done.

166
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,215
What do you mean "done"?

167
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

168
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll move on to
my next patient,

169
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,928
you'll move on to a doctor

170
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,721
willing to run
all the unnecessary tests

171
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,684
and procedures you want. Or you
can stick around and be cured.

172
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,354
Makes no difference to me.

173
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,692
I'm glad you changed your mind.

174
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,277
Don't know about that.

175
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,154
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-armed me.

176
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,990
Which is impressive.

177
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,325
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

178
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,912
Guess you found him a little more
persuasive than the two of us.

179
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,789
Probably the pants.

180
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,457
He reminds me of me.

181
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,127
Is it supposed to hurt?

182
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,461
Not if we're in correctly.

183
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,338
Is it your hands? Your back?

184
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,965
No, my chest.

185
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,968
Can't breathe.

186
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,720
Heart rate's 140, climbing.

187
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,471
You need to hold still.

188
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,598
What did you do?

189
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,852
Deep breaths.

190
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,690
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

191
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,446
Analysis of the fluid from Vince's
lungs shows the lung problem

192
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,822
is really a heart problem.

193
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,866
He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

194
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,534
When his heart sped up
during the procedure,

195
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,121
it jacked up the pressure in his
lungs, causing pulmonary edema.

196
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,406
Good thing I talked the patient
into spinal stimulation.

197
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,459
It did lead us to
discovering a new symptom,

198
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,294
and proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

199
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,795
We lucked into that discovery,

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,089
and we were wrong about CRPS.

201
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,593
Ventricular thickening plus
neuropathy could equal Lyme disease.

202
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,886
Not without joint pain.

203
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,929
When's his new game coming out?

204
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,014
Couple of months.

205
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,182
He's probably working non-stop.

206
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,186
Might be using more than
coffee to power through.

207
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,019
Cocaine use
explains his symptoms.

208
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,854
So we search his
office for drugs.

209
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,273
No. We're gonna ask him.

210
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,114
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

211
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,785
Different elements combine
to make a symphony.

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,287
Difference is that
Beethoven's Fifth

213
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,539
isn't going to
be poop tomorrow.

214
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,041
What was my one condition

215
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,126
for allowing you to tag along?

216
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,795
Try not to be a jerk.

217
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,089
I'm trying. I'm just failing.

218
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,884
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

219
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,557
How hard are you trying not to
make a ball joke right now?

220
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,267
They're smoking.

221
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,853
Your balls.

222
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh.

223
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,524
No, no. They're browning
way too fast.

224
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,209
Blue's the color
you gotta watch out for.

225
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,819
Enough.

226
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,738
God, they're...
They're still raw inside.

227
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,824
By the time they're cooked through,
the outside will be burnt.

228
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,910
I think there's
a medicated powder for that.

229
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,748
Although, vinegar could work.

230
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,085
My old chem prof talked about

231
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,336
theoretically
you shouldn't trust

232
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,422
the results of
a hemoglobin A1C test

233
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,882
on a chronically
acidotic patient.

234
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,093
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

235
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,221
between the hemoglobin
protein and blood sugar.

236
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,223
Browning meat is the
same chemical process,

237
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,018
which means it should
also be slowed by acid.

238
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,104
That actually makes sense.

239
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,732
You might have saved my balls.

240
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,484
That's the spirit!

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,447
Obviously the procedure
didn't go as planned.

242
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,823
The heart problem
was unforeseeable,

243
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,450
but I still feel responsible.

244
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,534
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,785
Okay.

246
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,538
How long have you guys
been doing it?

247
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,749
I think it's best if we
kept things professional.

248
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,034
Tough to do, now that I've seen

249
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,627
you rock
a leopard-print bikini.

250
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,963
Congrats, by the way. Up top.

251
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,716
You hacked my profile page?

252
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,676
Your treatment nearly
gave me a heart attack.

253
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,220
Figured I'd check if you had the
credentials to go with the cojones,

254
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,388
one search led to another.

255
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,598
Is there a shot of just her?

256
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,891
I'm thinking screensaver.

257
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,642
We need to know if you've
been using cocaine.

258
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,769
Nope. Dude,
you just block everybody

259
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,146
or do you really
only have three friends?

260
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,856
We need you to be
straight with us.

261
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,400
We need to be
able to trust you.

262
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,029
I cleaned up my act
12 years ago,

263
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,947
after my college roommate OD'd.

264
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,203
Okay.

265
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,336
Search his office.

266
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
You think he was lying?

267
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,047
No, but I'm not sure.

268
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,131
It was worth asking.

269
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,674
If he'd said yes, it
would've saved us a trip.

270
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,426
But he didn't.

271
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,513
You have to forget about him.

272
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,640
The patient? House.

273
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,225
First you try acting like him,

274
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,352
that doesn't work, so then
you try the opposite.

275
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,563
Now you're mad because you
have to use his move.

276
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,066
I feel like Tom Brady's backup.

277
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,860
Tom Brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

278
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,280
Stop comparing. You can
do this by being you.

279
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,409
We should still check out his
office, talk to his co-workers.

280
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,494
I'll get Taub.

281
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,578
And

282
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
thanks.

283
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,875
Oh. And dinner tonight at 7:00.

284
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,001
Can we make it 8:00?

285
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,128
Already made
a reservation for 7:00.

286
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,426
Hi.

287
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,678
I'm making gnocchi.

288
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,143
Oh, I didn't mean
to intrude, I just...

289
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,771
Cecile's in my cooking class.

290
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,939
She doesn't speak English.

291
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,532
You bake the potatoes
instead of boiling.

292
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,702
Less moisture, fewer gluten
bonds, lighter gnocchi.

293
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,911
You seem good.

294
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,121
Feeling better.

295
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,087
House.

296
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,006
I need to talk to you about
your leaving the hospital.

297
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,633
I do love a good groveling,
but my decision is final.

298
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,886
That's fine, as long as I'm
not the reason for it.

299
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,651
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic.

300
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,265
Yeah.

301
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:39,062
But it's not. We flirted,
we kissed, I fondled.

302
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,137
I hallucinated a night with you

303
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,650
and yelled it from
a hospital balcony.

304
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,652
You're not a narcissist.

305
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,196
So what am I?

306
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,406
Not the reason I'm leaving.

307
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,454
House.

308
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,957
I'm gonna miss you.

309
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,587
Lady, either kiss him or leave.
We got work to do.

310
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,882
You just couldn't
keep your trap shut.

311
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,091
Make the damn gnocchi.

312
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,217
Bye.

313
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,556
I guess you're not in a hurry

314
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,187
to get back to the office.

315
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,313
And you are?

316
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,946
I'm not trying to
avoid my boyfriend.

317
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,741
I'm a lizard, not an idiot.

318
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,407
You've been in a crappy mood

319
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,494
since we got in the car.

320
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,121
And you're completely okay with
being ordered around by someone

321
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,291
who 24 hours ago was
basically your equal?

322
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,086
Unlike you, I didn't
expect anything different.

323
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,755
The work part
I can get used to.

324
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,634
He didn't ask me to go to dinner,
he told me we were going.

325
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,345
He's never done that before.

326
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,473
So even the score.
Go home tonight,

327
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,277
put on some heels and
break him like a pony.

328
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,603
You'll feel much better. What?

329
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,192
That's one big-ass bird.

330
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,119
Wow. That's kind of amazing,

331
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,371
the way the wings move,
it's so real.

332
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,289
Get them off me!

333
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,042
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

334
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,002
I'm going to call Foreman.

335
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,464
A little help.

336
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,217
Your partner said
you studied birds

337
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,635
to improve the game animation.

338
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,762
Did you touch them? Can't
dissect without touching.

339
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,180
It's the best way to
understand the anatomy.

340
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,392
It's also a good way to contract
an infection called psittacosis.

341
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,061
We spoke to Dr. Foreman, he wants
to start you on antibiotics.

342
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:47,399
Does that infection cause
problems in the joystick area?

343
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,900
Kind of stuck in play mode.

344
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,820
Yes, we get it.
She's very, very pretty.

345
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,698
It's not her. I mean, it was,

346
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,950
when she was here with her
boyfriend three hours ago.

347
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,995
You've had an erection
for three hours?

348
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,664
At first, it was
just embarrassing,

349
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,207
but now it's
really starting to hurt.

350
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,459
Will the antibiotics help?

351
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,628
I'm afraid not.
This isn't psittacosis.

352
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,384
His erection persisted
even with medication.

353
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,886
We had to put in
a surgical shunt

354
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,179
just to drain the blood.

355
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,557
You missed dinner. And a shunt
doesn't require both of you.

356
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,311
I'm dedicated. So, the holy
trinity, heart, hands, hose.

357
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,437
Could be Guillain-Barré.

358
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,148
Not with normal
nerve conduction.

359
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,566
Thrombocytosis.

360
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,401
His platelet count
isn't that high.

361
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,652
Brain tumor makes more sense.

362
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,701
I'm sorry, I just realized.
Joint pain and joint pain.

363
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,953
Honest, I wasn't laughing

364
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,165
because of the obvious tension
between the two of you.

365
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,252
Erection points to a circulatory problem.
I'm with Foreman.

366
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,754
It is possible for a
brain tumor to cause...

367
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,090
We're going with
thrombocytosis.

368
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,759
Okay.

369
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,597
You're mad I didn't
ask you to dinner?

370
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,057
How long have we been dating?

371
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,266
It felt like an order.

372
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,351
Your tone of voice was...

373
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,435
My tone?

374
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm under a little
pressure right now.

375
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,725
How about giving me a break?

376
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,397
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

377
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,358
except I haven't
just gotten a promotion.

378
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,276
So, now you're jealous?

379
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,237
No. I'm just saying
don't complain

380
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,823
about the burdens of
command to your employees.

381
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,575
I was complaining
to my girlfriend.

382
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
Who are those guys?

383
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,871
I have no idea.

384
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,753
Meet the competition.

385
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,172
Steve Paulson,
Neurology, St. Mark's.

386
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,257
Nice to meet you.

387
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,381
You called another doctor?

388
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,302
Lots of other doctors. I posted
my symptoms on the Internet.

389
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,588
You guys are 0-for-2. I thought
I'd look for some backup.

390
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,224
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

391
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,643
Month's supply, $395.

392
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,020
Okay, that guy's an idiot. That
doesn't mean they all are.

393
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,565
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital,

394
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,109
please leave. Now.

395
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,737
Dr. Foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,

396
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,448
but I notice you haven't
done a head MRI yet.

397
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,614
Because he doesn't need one.

398
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,201
I'm pretty sure
he's got a brain tumor.

399
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,413
We considered that and concluded
thrombocytosis is more likely.

400
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,956
I'm starting him
on hydroxyurea.

401
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,667
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

402
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,751
If you took an image,
I'm sure...

403
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,587
There are no signs
of increased ICP.

404
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm not delaying treatment. Looks
like we need a tiebreaker.

405
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,966
Dr. Hadley, what do you think?

406
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,178
I think both theories
have merit.

407
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:26,224
So, brain tumor, otherwise you'd
back your boss/boyfriend.

408
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,893
I want an MRI.

409
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,397
Fine. I'll set it up.

410
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,450
Great, you're up.
I need a taster.

411
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,787
Ragú with pork sausage,
beef thigh, no cream.

412
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,126
It's a little early.

413
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,968
Did you even go
to bed last night?

414
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,762
Bed is for sissies.

415
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,431
Unless you're having sex,
in which case...

416
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,266
No, bed is still for sissies.

417
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,269
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

418
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,515
You should have been here
when I was butchering the ox.

419
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,773
What do you expect?
I'm an addict,

420
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,941
I turn everything up to 11.

421
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,526
Yeah, I thought you were
trying to tone that down.

422
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,987
No, I'm just trying to find
something I can set at 11

423
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,572
without blowing
out my eardrums.

424
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,491
Star anise with
the caramelized onions,

425
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,702
the sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

426
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,333
I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

427
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,420
It was either make ragù or go out
on the street looking to score.

428
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,637
Good choice. So, so good.

429
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,647
He asked me a question,
I answered.

430
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,171
You told me to make
my own decisions,

431
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,608
I do, and you stab me
in the back.

432
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,985
I didn't even say
what I really thought.

433
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,320
I hedged, and I don't
like that I hedged.

434
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,488
If I have
a legitimate opinion...

435
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,365
You express it in private.

436
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,909
In public, the team
opinion is your opinion.

437
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,787
Except the team opinion
is your opinion.

438
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,747
That's my job. And what's mine?

439
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,542
To lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

440
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,294
You would have
done it for House.

441
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,255
Maybe you just don't
want me to succeed.

442
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,549
Maybe you just want
to kick me again

443
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,592
for not asking you to dinner.

444
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,512
At least when House was
being an unbelievable jerk,

445
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,347
I could talk to
my boyfriend about it.

446
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,059
I may be a jerk, but you're wrong.
MRI is clean.

447
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,563
Treat for thrombocytosis.

448
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,780
You're early.

449
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,283
For what?

450
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,411
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

451
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,289
I thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.

452
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,416
I showed up to ask if
you've seen thromobocytosis

453
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,660
with a platelet count under...

454
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,628
I went crazy, not stupid.

455
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,965
I leave, Foreman embraces
his inner Mugabe.

456
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,884
What's that?

457
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,178
Embryonali.
Unhatched chicken egg.

458
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,724
I'm going to suck out some of the
yolk and replace it with ragù.

459
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,351
By the way, you can
tell the other lepers

460
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,895
that their absence
has been noted.

461
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,104
Cameron didn't come by?

462
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,316
Daddy's little co-dependent
is all grown up.

463
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,403
Making room for Daddy's hot
bisexual with boyfriend problems.

464
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,655
It's not a problem, it's...

465
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,202
Okay, it's a problem.

466
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,443
I mean, I get it, the
patient's a nightmare.

467
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,623
He posted his case online.

468
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,459
You know Foreman,
you know the situation.

469
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,628
How can I get him
to tone it down?

470
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,254
Stop being a coward,
for one thing.

471
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,589
He's the one who's
afraid of failure.

472
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,175
In a job that no one
before me has ever done.

473
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,260
His fears are justified.

474
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,429
You're just afraid of giving
him control over you.

475
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,555
Which might work at home,

476
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,766
but makes it almost impossible
for him to do his job.

477
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,768
Pass me those crackers.

478
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,230
You're saying
this is all my fault?

479
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,690
I'm saying

480
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,819
that you would be happier if you
learned when it's okay to give in.

481
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,114
What?

482
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,867
You just suggested that I give
in so that I could be happy.

483
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,036
What did they do
to you in there?

484
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,329
Taste this.

485
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,551
Oh, my God.

486
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,849
This might be the best
thing I've ever eaten.

487
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,103
And, yes, I'm including
what you're thinking of now.

488
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,188
You're an amazing cook!

489
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,732
I know.

490
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,404
And yet, my leg hurts.

491
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,907
Fire her.

492
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,992
I'm not gonna fire her.

493
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,197
Then stop being such a wuss.

494
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,327
I am not being a wuss.

495
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,496
Challenging you
is part of her job.

496
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,341
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

497
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,958
So you're saying
this is my fault.

498
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,503
I was trying to bury it
a little, but, yeah.

499
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,339
You gotta eliminate either the
challenge or the reaction.

500
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,717
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

501
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,052
We get drunk and talk
about how girls are lame.

502
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,432
Yeah, this problem
will go away on its own.

503
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,610
It's 8:00 in the morning.

504
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,861
Coffee ice cream.

505
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,615
No frittata, no bombolini?

506
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,241
Started thinking
about what you said,

507
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,870
about me obsessing. Started
obsessing about obsessing,

508
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,079
decided to take a day off.

509
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,457
You were enjoying cooking.

510
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,210
How like a man
to think that I enjoy

511
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,878
slaving over
a hot stove all day

512
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,546
while you're off
banging secretaries.

513
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,882
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

514
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,636
That was before I discovered The
Biggest Loser marathon on cable.

515
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,472
I like to pretend
they can see me eating.

516
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,933
And your leg?

517
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,142
It's fine.

518
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,774
My leg's killing me.

519
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,235
Cooking helped for a while,

520
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,819
then I guess I got bored.

521
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,404
My leg started hurting again.

522
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,907
Then I got worried, and
that made the pain worse.

523
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,784
What are you worried about?

524
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,744
That nothing's gonna help.

525
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,789
That I end up in
the Very Dark Place.

526
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,586
I'm fine, I'm just not happy.

527
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,255
I didn't let you out
because you were happy.

528
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,579
I let you out because I believe

529
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,591
you have the skills
to cope with that.

530
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,053
You tried one thing, it
didn't work, so move on.

531
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,639
Write, play chess...

532
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,765
What if nothing works?

533
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,517
What if nothing gives me
more than a few days

534
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,727
before my brain starts
looking for the next fix,

535
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,814
before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it.

536
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,941
What do I do then?

537
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,361
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

538
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,447
we'll deal with that
when we get to it.

539
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,867
But you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient.

540
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,166
I brought you a donut.

541
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,044
The florist was closed.

542
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,381
I'll get a vase
and put it in water.

543
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,930
You know I'm sorry, right?

544
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,307
I'm sorry, too.

545
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,560
Do you think

546
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,564
we could start over?

547
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,400
That's a fantastic idea.

548
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,573
We're gonna be late.

549
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,741
Your boss won't mind.

550
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,706
No way.

551
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,085
His lymph nodes blew up.

552
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,610
He's been treated
for thrombocytosis,

553
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,963
but there's been no change.

554
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,048
I was wrong.

555
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,507
God, you are a genius.

556
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,112
I'm adding this
to my list of symptoms.

557
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,258
That didn't work last time.

558
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,845
Because I didn't
think big enough.

559
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,431
Now I'm offering
a $25,000 reward.

560
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,069
Steroids reduced
his facial swelling.

561
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,196
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

562
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,240
How did so many people
get my personal e-mail?

563
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,033
The Internet is
a magical place.

564
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,412
Lymph enlargement makes
me think polyarteritis.

565
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,081
You were saying?

566
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,168
No point in treating the
symptom and not the disease.

567
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,423
Your stunt generated
quite a few responses.

568
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,924
Let's take a look.
I'm way ahead of you.

569
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,343
Paraneoplastic syndrome
secondary to spinal tumor.

570
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,388
No. No hypercalcemia, no
muscle spasms or incontinence.

571
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,682
You are possessed by the
Biblical demon Legion.

572
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,767
No. No jumping off a cliff
in a herd of pigs.

573
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,060
Otherwise, it did fit.

574
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,103
Graves' disease.

575
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,771
No. Thyroid levels are normal.

576
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,177
You want us to
spend next few days

577
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,524
shooting down every
theory in the world,

578
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,688
or can we do our jobs and
come up with one that works?

579
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,446
I want you to test me
for amyloidosis.

580
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,851
Is that your
professional opinion?

581
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,157
It's the wisdom of crowds.

582
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,783
Studies show that
collective decision

583
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,786
of a group can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

584
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,539
I went through my e-mails,
amyloidosis got the most votes.

585
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,082
If you had amyloidosis,

586
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,084
there'd be speckling
on your cardiac ultrasound.

587
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,211
In 100% of cases?

588
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,965
Fine. I'll make you a deal.

589
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,426
We do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

590
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,631
When it comes back negative,

591
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,805
you pull your case off of the
Internet and retract the reward.

592
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,600
It's either that or
I don't test you at all.

593
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,060
Deal.

594
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,115
If you wanted a quickie, you
should have called ahead.

595
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,742
I'm a mess.

596
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,495
I came home for lunch.

597
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,580
You have lunch with Cuddy
on Tuesdays.

598
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,332
She was busy.

599
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,042
And you're checking up on me.

600
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,923
You know, you can talk to me...
Is that my laundry?

601
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,717
You were running out of
socks for me to borrow.

602
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,595
We have plenty
of underwear, though.

603
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,889
I'm fine.

604
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,263
You said that this morning.

605
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,809
And consistency proves what?

606
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,605
Really, I'm good. I'll
put these in your room.

607
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,945
You always hurt
the one you love.

608
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:16,290
Biopsy showed deposits in the renal
endothelium consistent with amyloidosis.

609
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,961
The Internet was right.
Start him on dexamethasone.

610
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,295
Already done.

611
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,341
This may not be the best
time for this, but I quit.

612
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,971
I got an offer to join a
friend's surgical practice.

613
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,056
You don't
generally get an offer

614
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,558
unless you're looking for one.

615
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,686
I put out some feelers when I found
out House wasn't coming back.

616
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,479
I lobbied to keep
the department open

617
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,731
so you could keep your job.

618
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,443
Yes, that was incredibly
altruistic of you.

619
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,159
It's nothing personal. Actually, I
think you're doing pretty well.

620
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,747
But I came here
to work with House.

621
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,592
He's a jerk. We'll
be fine without him.

622
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,855
Do you know how many
resumes we get every day

623
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,429
without even asking?

624
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,265
Might be a few less after
Cuddy shuts us down.

625
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,643
The case got solved
under your watch,

626
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,604
does it really matter
how it happened?

627
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,149
It matters.

628
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,405
What if I'm just not
ready for this job?

629
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,201
Okay, you're sad.

630
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,829
I could tell you
the story about me

631
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,707
and my roommate
at Sarah Lawrence.

632
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,709
Okay.

633
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,800
Her name was Lindsey, and she
was a cheerleader from Iowa.

634
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,264
I broke my toilet this morning.

635
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,517
I'll get my tools.

636
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:02,480
I blocked the intake valve so I could
collect some of House's urine.

637
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,649
Cuddy, he was barely limping.

638
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,775
What did the lab say?

639
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,443
The urine was clean
for Vicodin.

640
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,988
It did however contain
strange epithelial cells.

641
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,825
Further analysis showed they
were from a Labrador Retriever.

642
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,037
Damn.

643
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,915
He's using.

644
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,513
Vince, Vince. Vince, relax.

645
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,765
It's Dr. Foreman.

646
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:33,005
Kill it! Kill it! No! I
don't have my blaster.

647
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,093
He's hallucinating
'cause he's burning up.

648
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,054
Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.

649
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,228
Antipyretics didn't work.

650
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,356
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

651
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,526
Maybe we should see if
anyone's sent in other ideas.

652
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,819
Maybe the reward
money attracted...

653
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,238
No, I'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

654
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,573
The masses were wrong
about amyloidosis.

655
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,116
They don't know
about the fever.

656
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,411
I'm going with Light-Chain
Deposition Disorder.

657
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,497
You okay with that?

658
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,665
Yes.

659
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,593
We think you have
a disease called LCDD.

660
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,762
It causes proteins to
build up in your organs.

661
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,264
You think?

662
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,309
We can't definitely
confirm the diagnosis.

663
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,978
And our only chance
of beating this

664
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,939
would be to start you on
high-dose chemotherapy.

665
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,193
But I do have to warn you that in
your condition, it might kill you.

666
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,575
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

667
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,620
You're my doctor, I trust you.

668
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,165
No, you don't.

669
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,793
You're scared, and you don't
want to make this decision.

670
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,389
My career is
riding on this case.

671
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,474
Nowhere near as
important as your life.

672
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:14,106
But I think the best shot for
both of us is to treat for LCDD.

673
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,401
Okay.

674
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,866
All right. Let's get you out
of this tub and into chemo.

675
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,830
We know you're back on Vicodin.

676
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,915
No.

677
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,791
The only thing you know
is that I'm a genius

678
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,210
who got a dog to pee
in your toilet.

679
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,712
You don't know how I did it,

680
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,089
or, more interestingly,
where I peed.

681
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,258
House, you've spent
the last three months...

682
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,010
Et tu, Butte?

683
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,094
You got no reason to be here,

684
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,304
he's the one
I was jerking around.

685
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,931
Why is your leg better?

686
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:50,100
Ow! It hurts.
Please go away now.

687
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,385
If you really think I'm using,

688
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,714
how about asking me before taking
a wrench to your plumbing?

689
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,813
House, you're an addict.

690
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,942
You can't be surprised if we
can't take you at your word.

691
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,988
Fine. Let's get you some proof.
Hide your eyes, ladies.

692
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,367
House. You, too.

693
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,623
My godson made me that mug.

694
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,625
If the lab says
this is Retriever, too,

695
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,085
please let me know right away.

696
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,628
It'd explain my
overwhelming desire

697
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,255
to wipe my butt on your carpet.

698
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,135
Thank you for
dragging me into this.

699
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,491
Stop the chemo,
he's got Fabry's disease.

700
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,696
He was in a tub for an hour,

701
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,828
his fingers should have
pruned, but they didn't.

702
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,373
Already stopped chemo,
and confirmed Fabry's.

703
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,043
I'm glad you both agree but
could somebody loop me in here?

704
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,962
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys

705
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,131
were proteins,
but they were fats.

706
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,551
Fabry's makes them build up in
your organs, choke your nerves,

707
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,178
keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

708
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,680
It's chronic but manageable.

709
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,807
How did you figure it out?

710
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,105
Iodide mumps.

711
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,232
His lymph nodes swelled
up after the head CT.

712
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,609
We thought it was a new
symptom, but it wasn't,

713
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,445
it was a reaction
to the contrast.

714
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,530
Iodide mumps takes lymph
nodes off the table.

715
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,782
Remove that symptom...

716
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,952
And that just came to you?

717
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,998
I looked through
the online responses again.

718
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,083
Someone posted it this morning.

719
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,599
I heard Cuddy made it official.

720
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,310
Department's yours. Congrats.

721
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,316
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,319
I went behind your back.

723
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,322
On a scale of one to 10,
how mad are you?

724
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,160
A seven. And that's stupid.

725
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,788
You did the right thing.

726
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,992
It's my fault you thought you
had to go behind my back.

727
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,199
I should have stood up to you.

728
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,336
But you didn't 'cause you
didn't want to fight again.

729
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,217
It's our first case,
it'll take time to adjust.

730
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,847
What if by the time
we get adjusted,

731
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,517
we don't like
each other any more?

732
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,768
That's not gonna happen.

733
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,019
Are you sure?

734
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,312
'Cause ever since
I took this job,

735
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,565
we've been making
each other miserable.

736
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,447
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

737
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,830
You're breaking up with me?

738
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:58,956
No.

739
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,835
The other night, when I thought
I was done, you were there.

740
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,878
I need you.

741
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,216
I don't want to lose you.

742
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,011
Then, why are you...

743
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,396
You're firing me.

744
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,236
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,534
I slipped.

746
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,871
You took Vicodin?

747
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,172
$25,000.

748
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,342
I solved my old team's case.

749
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,137
I was about to take the
pills, I went online,

750
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,015
I found people
posting medical problems.

751
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:02,436
And my leg stopped hurting.

752
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,148
Oh.

753
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,775
Oh?

754
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,739
I'm supposed to be changing my life.
This is not a change.

755
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,866
Maybe I was wrong.

756
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,285
Says the guy making sand
castles in my brain.

757
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,870
We need to keep you from using.

758
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,122
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

759
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,707
nearly drove you back to it.

760
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:29,004
Maybe diagnostic medicine is
the key to keeping you clean.

761
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,676
So you're okay with me going
online, solving cases?

762
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,969
No.

763
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,764
You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

764
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,391
Isolation fosters depression.

765
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,435
The hospital is
part of my old life.

766
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,897
If I go back, I might become

767
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,066
who I was before,
pills and all.

768
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,068
That's a possibility.

769
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,362
But could be,

770
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,782
the only thing worse for you than
going back to diagnostic medicine

771
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,118
is not going back.

772
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,673
Guess we're gonna find out.
