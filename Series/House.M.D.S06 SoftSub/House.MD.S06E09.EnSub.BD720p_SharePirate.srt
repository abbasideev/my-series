1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,763
How the...

2
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,912
You know, most people go for
the hardwood or carpeting.

3
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,873
I think guitars and garbage
work just as well.

4
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,917
Got the urge
to play last night,

5
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,460
had to go all the way
back to my apartment.

6
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,170
Thought I'd save
on future trips.

7
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,338
Hmm.

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,799
That's very
eco-friendly of you.

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,219
How about keeping down
on the noise pollution?

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,305
6:33. You should
be flossing by now.

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,849
I'm not going to work today.

12
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,185
I'm going hunting.

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,733
After I sleep in.

14
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,288
Is it that time of year again?

15
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,750
He's a self-important jerk.

16
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,917
He's my friend.

17
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,712
He's a self-important jerk.

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,672
Seems to be what
I'm attracted to.

19
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,258
Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't
even know your name.

20
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:37,180
Jim is short for James.
Now go away, Lim.

21
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,853
Nice shot, Jim.

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,104
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,732
Oh, yeah. I nailed that tree.

24
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,860
Maple syrup for dinner.

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,025
We should have got a guide.

26
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,321
Doesn't count as
a new adventure

27
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,114
if you have someone
holding your hand.

28
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,200
On the other hand,
we are holding weapons

29
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,077
and have no idea
what we're doing. Fun.

30
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,163
We need to sneak up on them.

31
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,048
I read somewhere that
the Native Americans say

32
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,917
turkeys know
what you're thinking.

33
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,960
So I should stop thinking
about German porn.

34
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,463
No, no.
That'll lure them closer.

35
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,308
We're terrible at this.

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,646
Yeah. Well, at least it's
cold and my new boots leak.

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,816
It's almost time anyway.
Did you bring the bag?

38
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,417
May 30th, 2004, 10:07 a. m.

39
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,128
Dr. Wilson informed me that
if treatment didn't go well,

40
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,589
my leukemia would give me
only six more months to live.

41
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,885
November 30th, 2004, six
months later, I didn't die.

42
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,012
As long as I am alive,

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,098
I will find new
and exciting ways

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,642
to thank you for
giving me another year.

45
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,024
Now move very,
very far away from there,

46
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,652
so that I can be sure
and thank you again next year.

47
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,838
Thanks, Jim.

48
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,802
All right. Let's see how many
more turkeys we can miss.

49
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,142
Yeah, this'll work.

50
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,937
What the hell?

51
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,231
God, sorry. I don't
know what happened.

52
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,733
I can't move my arm.

53
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,488
Am I having a stroke?

54
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,825
I don't know.

55
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,703
Good news. Head CT doesn't
show any signs of a stroke.

56
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,914
So he's gonna be okay, right?

57
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:54,168
I cannot believe how much you've
grown up in five years. She's...

58
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,463
She's not Emily.

59
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,006
Ashley. My girlfriend.

60
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,634
New life, new adventures.
Ashley, meet Jim.

61
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,760
It's good to meet you.

62
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,222
So this arm thing, does that
mean his leukemia's back?

63
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,141
I checked blood counts
and blood cell morphologies.

64
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,309
Everything is normal.

65
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,813
So these blood tests, that means
it's not cancer for sure?

66
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,981
He said I'm fine.

67
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,357
So what do you think it is?

68
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,150
Hopefully something innocuous.

69
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,404
There's a doctor I can
speak to who's great...

70
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,199
Who's great at diagnosing...

71
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,742
What?

72
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,077
Sorry, that cold sore.

73
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,745
How long have you had that?

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,247
Um, two weeks. I'm sorry.

75
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,165
I got the call, I didn't
have time to cover it up.

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,208
What is it, Jim?

77
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,088
That cold sore is
caused by a virus.

78
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,924
Assuming you guys kiss,
the virus could transfer,

79
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,301
infect your spine and
cause the paralysis.

80
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,095
It's a disease called
Transverse Myelitis.

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,680
And is that
good news or bad news?

82
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,934
It's great news. I'll get you a
room and start you on acyclovir.

83
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,012
I just had a House moment.

84
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,057
Diagnosed Transverse Myelitis
from a cold sore.

85
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,391
How cool is that?

86
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,062
Patients really eat
that crap up.

87
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,814
It's why I'm loved.
What am I doing here?

88
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,274
Ultrasound is clear.

89
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,276
Which means he's definitely
not pregnant, right?

90
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,448
No gall stones.
Could be diverticulitis.

91
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,241
Have you eaten any seeds?

92
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,368
I'm joining you,
Antonio Aguilar.

93
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,454
We'll play in
God's Mariachi band.

94
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,331
Draw some blood.

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,752
The self-important jerk does
not have Transverse Myelitis.

96
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,420
He's got cancer.

97
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,546
How do you even...

98
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay.

99
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,550
Maybe I paid the redhead
down in records a few bucks

100
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,677
to CC me on all your cases.

101
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,805
A few patients die,
you might get sad again,

102
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,681
make a speech that
would end your career.

103
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,226
Frankly,
I'm stalking you for you.

104
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,852
How long does
a simple blood draw take?

105
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,978
Almost finished.

106
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,397
Well, when you're finished
almost finishing it, test it.

107
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,192
My stomach was ripped
open by the hand of God.

108
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,401
He spilled my blood.

109
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,153
Confusion. Delirium.

110
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,989
Why rule out
the hand of God so fast?

111
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,784
Your guy's low white count
and right arm paralysis

112
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,579
equals a recurrence of his leukemia.
Simple math.

113
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,959
Did you look past the
first page of the file?

114
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,045
No AML cells anywhere.
I did the blood smears myself.

115
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,215
It's still cancer.
You know how I know?

116
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,634
He's got an oncologist
for a doctor.

117
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,970
And your magical
leukemia detector

118
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,638
is more powerful
than a flow cytometer?

119
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,684
I look for zebras because other
doctors rule out all the horses.

120
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,978
In this case, you are
those other doctors.

121
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,105
You haven't earned a zebra.

122
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,232
Hundred bucks. Are you serious?

123
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,819
Look, friends don't diagnose
friends with cancer. I get it.

124
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,696
Your problem is
you're not objective.

125
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,073
Your caring is
clouding your diagnosis.

126
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,285
If you just cut that out, you
could be a pretty decent doctor.

127
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,745
Just give me
the lactic acid level.

128
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,913
Twenty-seven.

129
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,814
The fact that you
can't speak English

130
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,170
is not an excuse for you not being
humiliated by what I'm about to say.

131
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,546
It's also not an excuse for you

132
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,756
not telling us that
you were a tennis pro.

133
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,601
If you had, we wouldn't
have wasted our time.

134
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,635
Fine. Hundred bucks.

135
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,600
Tucker settling in?

136
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,269
Yep. Already got his
first dose of acyclovir.

137
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,634
And don't worry, I ordered his
girlfriend the kiddie meal.

138
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,732
Next patient on deck.

139
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,525
Del Clinton, day six of chemo.

140
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,810
You just missed the grandkids.

141
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,861
Oh.

142
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,990
That's all right. Last time they
were here, they painted my tie.

143
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,872
You're almost ready to go home.
You feeling okay?

144
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,708
I feel like I felt
after the last four rounds.

145
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
In oncology, familiar
pain means all is well.

146
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,087
So that's good, right?

147
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,214
Yeah.

148
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,299
I heard Jesse and
Zeke were by earlier.

149
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,508
Yeah.

150
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm sorry, Del, I gotta run.

151
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
How are they doing?

152
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,646
They're fine.

153
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,650
No game-winning hits? No aced report cards?
No school plays?

154
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,401
I guess not.

155
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,404
I thought you had to go.

156
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,909
Are you depressed?

157
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,369
I have cancer.

158
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,704
You've had cancer
for a long time,

159
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,829
and it's never stopped you

160
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,332
from bragging
about the grandkids.

161
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,583
Oh.

162
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,920
I guess I'm feeling a little
more down than usual.

163
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,380
Can you give me something?

164
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,589
Yeah.

165
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,414
I don't want you
to get alarmed,

166
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,510
but sometimes depression
can be a sign

167
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,970
that something else
is going on.

168
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,348
I'm just gonna order a
couple of extra tests, okay?

169
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,941
What's going on?
It's his foot now.

170
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,109
It's nothing.

171
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,318
It's not nothing.

172
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,155
I just started getting a little
tingling feeling in my foot.

173
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,991
Is that bad?

174
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,158
Ashley, it's gonna be okay.

175
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,203
It might mean his foot fell asleep.
It might mean nothing.

176
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,955
Can you give us a few minutes?

177
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,331
Why can't you tell me?

178
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,041
Because you're
making him nervous.

179
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,877
Just give us a few
minutes, okay, hon?

180
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,382
Does this mean that it's not the
disease you thought it was?

181
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,634
It means the medicine
I gave you is not working.

182
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,678
I just might have
to hit it harder.

183
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,514
I'm going to add ribavirin
to your treatment.

184
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,765
Jim.

185
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,977
Are you sure that
this isn't a recurrence?

186
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,646
So the brave face
is just for Ashley.

187
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,398
She's young
and she's terrified.

188
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,522
She's not really equipped.

189
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,026
Don't worry.

190
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:57,323
Once you've had cancer, recurrence
is your biggest fear. I get it.

191
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,283
I've looked at this thing
every which way there is.

192
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,243
That's not
what's happening here.

193
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,496
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

194
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,748
You can't do it?

195
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,334
She hasn't exactly
been talking to me

196
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,085
since I got together
with Ashley.

197
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,588
I'd really like her to be here.

198
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,341
Of course.

199
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,303
Exactly how serious
does it have to be

200
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,264
to justify you coming
to see your father?

201
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,517
No, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,355
I'd rather you regretted coming
than regretted not coming.

203
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,816
Thanks, Emily.

204
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,070
How's Tucker?

205
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,874
Well, he's made a mess
of his personal life,

206
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,782
but physically I think
he's going to be fine.

207
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,575
Transverse Myelitis.

208
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
What does House think?

209
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,497
What is this?
Is House my overseer now?

210
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,624
No, it's just not
always a good idea

211
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,043
for doctors to treat
their friends, that's all.

212
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,170
Well, House has got
100 bucks on cancer.

213
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,255
So unless you want
in on the action...

214
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,092
Um, is Bonnie still a realtor?

215
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,968
As far as I know.

216
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,181
Do you mind if I call her?
I'm looking for a new place.

217
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,351
I'm moving in with Lucas.

218
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,270
It wasn't the tennis.

219
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,731
You're moving in with Lucas?

220
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,149
Yes.

221
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,528
You're Bonnie's friend,
you know how to reach her,

222
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,655
and yet,
instead of calling her,

223
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,740
you come and seek
my permission.

224
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,077
You want my blessing, and,
implicitly, House's blessing.

225
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,912
I don't need House's blessing.

226
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,497
Good.

227
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,965
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

228
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,675
Should be soon.

229
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,926
You started smoking again?

230
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,136
No.

231
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,764
What does that mean? Is it
bad that he's coughing?

232
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,766
Hi, Dad. Hey.

233
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,436
Melissa, hey. I didn't
know you were coming.

234
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,147
I was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

235
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,471
I can go if it's
gonna be weird.

236
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,568
No, no. Stay, it's fine.

237
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,777
Hi.

238
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,320
How are you? Is he okay?

239
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,741
Yeah, he's okay. I'm not a big
fan of his coughing, though.

240
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,452
You must be Ashley. Hi.

241
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,663
Hey, are you okay?

242
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,792
Do you think this cold sore
thing could've caused this?

243
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,670
No. Whatever is causing this is
affecting more than his nerves.

244
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,047
I need a crash cart in here.

245
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,436
Don't you guys have a dying
Mexican crooner to attend to?

246
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,979
He isn't dying any more.

247
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,814
Found out he was
on a popcorn diet,

248
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,400
eating 10 bags of
microwave popcorn a day.

249
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,944
Huffing the fumes
scarred his lungs.

250
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,824
Wow. That's very strange.
Where's House?

251
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,868
Performing his ritual
"hiding from Cuddy

252
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,536
"to avoid getting
a new case" dance.

253
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,247
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

254
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,933
He's probably eating
lunch in the morgue.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,601
I can page him to your
office if you want.

256
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,421
Actually, maybe it would be better
if I talk to you guys alone.

257
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,924
House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.

258
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,968
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

259
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,181
Forty-three-year-old male
in remission from leukemia,

260
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,683
presents with left-arm paralysis
and trouble breathing.

261
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,477
I assume House's
money is on cancer.

262
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,020
Thanks, that's very helpful.

263
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,438
Subdural hematoma
would explain...

264
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,773
CT ruled it out.

265
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,942
I thought it was TM, so I
started him on anti-virals.

266
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,027
But he got worse.
Bacterial infection?

267
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,446
Bacteria would move much faster
than this, he'd be dead already.

268
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,572
It could be fungal.

269
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,533
A fungal infection would
explain his breathing problem,

270
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,494
but not his "unable to
move his arm" problem.

271
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,374
Actually, if aspergillus fungus
balls took root in his lungs

272
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,086
and spread to his spine,
it would explain both.

273
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,630
Thanks.

274
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,219
The treatment involves
riddling the infected area

275
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,930
with BB-sized pellets
of anti-fungal meds.

276
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,226
I assume you don't just load up the
12 gauge and pepper me with birdshot.

277
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,187
No, we have a slightly more
humane delivery system.

278
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,691
But we do have to open you up.
It is surgery.

279
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,403
And like any operation,
there are risks.

280
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,530
What do you think, honey?

281
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,617
I don't know. I mean, is surgery
really such a good idea?

282
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,704
He just seems so sick.
I just...

283
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,623
You should do whatever
you think is best.

284
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,876
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

285
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,336
Because of
the rapid progression,

286
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,589
I don't think we have time
to test or try IVs.

287
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,393
And he's strong enough
to endure anesthesia?

288
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,592
Definitely.

289
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,076
I want you there
during the surgery.

290
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,219
Of course.

291
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,265
You gotta do it.

292
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,393
Good.

293
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,479
Dr. Chase will be in here soon
to get you set up for the OR.

294
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,525
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's
room for a surgery consult,

295
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,610
and can you get me...

296
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,445
Mr. Koplovitz wants
to talk to you.

297
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,571
Is everything all right?

298
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,905
He wanted to
talk to his doctor,

299
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,490
not his doctor's assistant.

300
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,284
Oh. And House is
looking for you.

301
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,368
What'd you tell him?

302
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,534
That you were in the clinic.

303
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,622
I figure that gives you
about 10 minutes.

304
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,207
Here, Mr. Koplovitz's
chart, go.

305
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,089
Hello, Saul. I heard
you were looking for me.

306
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,384
I'm very tired,
but I can't sleep.

307
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,263
Today's your lucky day. I happen
to be a sleep specialist.

308
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,474
Thanks, Doc.

309
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,032
Hey, can't a guy
get a little privacy?

310
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,492
Nice hiding spot.

311
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,743
Actually, it's perfect.

312
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,913
It allows me to hide
from Cuddy and find you.

313
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,247
What did she want?

314
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,084
She was checking up
on Tucker, thanks to you.

315
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,794
That's it?

316
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,296
Like what? Something about you?

317
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,757
Something you could interpret
as being about you?

318
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,966
An anagram maybe?

319
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,343
It'd be great if you could play

320
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,844
hide and seek somewhere
else, my patient's...

321
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,181
No problem. Just give me the 100
bucks you owe me and I'm gone.

322
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,599
Tucker doesn't have cancer.

323
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,394
He doesn't have a ball of
fungus in his lungs either.

324
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,687
Next time you want
to use my team,

325
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,271
I suggest you
at least leave a tip.

326
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,148
I'm late for surgery.

327
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,735
Ah. Your assistant said you'd be in here.
I talked to Bonnie.

328
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,446
Let's take this outside.
Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.

329
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,115
Oh, sorry.
She found us this fantastic loft.

330
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,199
Outside.

331
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,763
It's not a loft,
it's just more urban.

332
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,285
Not that I'm urban,
but I used to be.

333
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,091
It's got two bedrooms, got wonderful views.
It's a really great place.

334
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,082
Procedure should
take about an hour.

335
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,167
I'll be observing
the entire time.

336
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,585
Thanks.

337
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,796
Maybe it'd be better if you
would stay with Ashley.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,381
She's more scared than I am.

339
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,718
Well, she's...

340
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,011
At her age,

341
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,057
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

342
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,352
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

343
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,939
Why did you leave Melissa?

344
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,775
We got married young. We...

345
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,698
I'm not sure.

346
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,298
There's nothing to talk about.

347
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,345
Why are you doing surgery when I
need you finding me a new case?

348
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,055
You don't want a new case.

349
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,017
Oh, right.
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

350
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,520
Obviously, you didn't tell me

351
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,272
that Cuddy was
moving in with Lucas

352
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,608
because you were protecting me,

353
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,443
which is odd, since I told you

354
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,862
that I'm fine with
their relationship.

355
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,199
So, obviously, you question
one of those assumptions

356
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,242
or you have
an issue with logic.

357
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,453
Yes, you're fine
with them dating.

358
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,457
But moving in together is a whole
other level of commitment.

359
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,668
This is
the 21st century, Wilson.

360
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,130
I realize that the logical
course in any adult relationship

361
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,800
could one day lead
to fornication.

362
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,428
Although, the fact that
she wants to buy a loft

363
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,264
could actually mean
that their relationship

364
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,974
is not as serious as I thought.

365
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,560
Oh, for God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

366
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,771
It's a loft,
it has no deeper meaning

367
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,940
than open-spaced
living arrangement.

368
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,608
You bought into her diatribe

369
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,778
about rediscovering her
lost city-girl roots?

370
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,531
And two bedrooms, it just
reeks of commitment issues.

371
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,825
Yeah, or she has a baby.
Well...

372
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,953
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

373
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,121
This is her version of
a two-seat convertible.

374
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,582
Yep, clearly you're
fine with it.

375
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,169
Wilson, he's got global lung damage.
Means it's not fungal.

376
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,879
It's PCP pneumonia.

377
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,844
Hmm.

378
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,598
Obviously, something is
knocking out his immune system.

379
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,811
HIV, acquired SCID,

380
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,022
or, my personal favorite,
cancer.

381
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm sure you'll test
for all three.

382
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,327
Sixty-two-year-old
African-American man

383
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,371
with lymphoma now in remission.

384
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,373
I did a CT and
found a small lesion

385
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,333
on the upper lobe
of his left lung.

386
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,418
But if he's in remission,

387
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,044
why did you bother
scanning him?

388
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,462
During a routine follow-up,

389
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,381
I realized the patient
was depressed.

390
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,967
Wow. That's quite a call.

391
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,887
Thanks.
The treatment indicated...

392
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,849
Oh, I'm sorry,

393
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,013
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

394
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,646
It's a conference room
with glass walls.

395
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,106
You thought I'd be alone?

396
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,275
Your patient has cancer.

397
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,904
Not that guy, who
probably also has cancer.

398
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,572
And who's probably
also your buddy.

399
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,824
Thought you'd want to know.

400
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,036
And you owe me 100 bucks.

401
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,045
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. ALL.

402
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,091
So it is a recurrence?

403
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,844
No, it's different.
It's a second leukemia,

404
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,596
probably caused
by the chemotherapy

405
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,931
we gave him five years ago.

406
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,807
That's why you didn't see it?

407
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,226
Maybe they can
rename it Ironic leukemia.

408
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,478
This is not the end.

409
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,980
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

410
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,106
That's good news.

411
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,983
How can cancer in his
head be good news?

412
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,487
The blood-brain barrier separates
the blood in your head

413
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,614
from the blood in your body,

414
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,076
keeps the cancer bottled up.
We can go for a cure.

415
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,078
So give me the numbers.
What are we looking at?

416
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,538
Ninety percent chance of cure.

417
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,458
Really?
What if we're in the 10%?

418
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,045
Steady decline, but six months
of a good quality life.

419
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,464
Does he have to go through
another bone marrow transplant?

420
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,051
No. Chemotherapy. We can go
at this with drugs alone.

421
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,136
When do we get started?

422
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,013
We begin by surgically
planting a shunt,

423
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,224
so we can get the drugs
directly into your brain.

424
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,642
I already booked the OR.

425
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,228
You're the only one who can make
cancer sound like good news.

426
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,355
We get it out of your head
and you walk out of here.

427
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,857
Paralysis gone and cancer free.

428
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,780
We also need you to
sign a healthcare proxy.

429
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,407
If something goes wrong
in surgery,

430
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,692
someone needs to be appointed
to make decisions for you.

431
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,119
What are the chances
of that happening?

432
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,328
Very remote.

433
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,747
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

434
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,499
What? No.

435
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,252
Coming through.
House got a new case.

436
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,090
Revised OR schedule. Sorry,
Wilson, had to bump you.

437
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,009
It's not like your guy is
bleeding out of his eyes.

438
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,677
House, your guy's not bleeding
out of his eyes, either.

439
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,429
The nurse who books
the OR thinks he is.

440
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,847
Your case is no more
urgent than mine.

441
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,141
Yeah, but you're
way more patient.

442
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,852
It's okay.

443
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,439
You can talk about the
paperwork in the prep area.

444
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,444
You trust her more than me?

445
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,945
About this, yes.

446
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,364
You've been through
the good stuff,

447
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,034
but Melissa's been to
hell and back with me.

448
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,579
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

449
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,372
You still love her.

450
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,000
Don't be silly. I love you.

451
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,379
Please, don't make this
into more than it is.

452
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,763
Okay. Anything? No.

453
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,390
Can you feel this?

454
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,641
No.

455
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,809
How about here?

456
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,436
No.

457
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,606
Where is everybody?

458
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,067
Melissa and Emily went downstairs
to get some breakfast.

459
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,235
Ashley? She had work to do.

460
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,529
I thought she was off today.

461
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,031
Well, she didn't
really have work to do.

462
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,533
She's just pissed, so she
pretended to have work to do.

463
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,118
I let her pretend.

464
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,162
Okay.

465
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,332
Move your fingers.

466
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,132
The chemo's not working.

467
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,718
Does that mean it's not cancer?

468
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,221
No. It means the chemo from
your first round of treatment

469
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,723
has made
the leukemia resistant.

470
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,518
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

471
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,439
Maybe not.

472
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,360
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung,

473
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,238
and the weird thing is,
he didn't get better.

474
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,572
Any idea what that means?

475
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,241
It means you're
not listening to me.

476
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,534
No, it means I'm ignoring you

477
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,244
to make a point.
There is a difference.

478
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,528
The problem with that technique

479
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,247
is I have no idea
what point you're making.

480
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,333
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

481
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,795
Doubling your patient's
chemo dose is stupid.

482
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,130
Damn, now it's explicit.

483
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,799
It could swamp out the
resistance of the cancer cells.

484
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,484
The fact that it
theoretically should work

485
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,844
doesn't make it
any less stupid.

486
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,388
Of course it does. It's
exactly what you would do.

487
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,348
I'm me. You're you.

488
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,270
And a table is a table.

489
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,315
And chemo is poison, and
double chemo is double poison.

490
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,444
And I can handle it when things go wrong.
You can't.

491
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,031
And things could
go very, very wrong.

492
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,743
I can handle it.

493
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,419
Sounds pretty dangerous.

494
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,045
It is.

495
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,425
What do you think, Mel?

496
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,430
I think you should call Ashley.

497
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,600
You're my family.

498
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,228
I'm sorry I forgot that.

499
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,818
I think that you should try

500
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,904
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

501
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,948
Yeah.

502
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Look.

503
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,728
I can move them.

504
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,688
Hey. Thank you.

505
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,193
What is it, Jim?

506
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,321
I'm gonna need
to run some tests.

507
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,909
Intraepidermal superficial bullae.
Could be pemphigus.

508
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,452
Or it could be from the fire.

509
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,122
Either way, he's dead.
We can't stop the oozing.

510
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,041
Don't care.

511
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,337
I'm here because it's 1:15

512
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,924
and Wilson started testing
at 12:45, which means...

513
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,512
The cancer is gone, but over
half his hepatocytes are dead.

514
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,848
In only 24 hours?

515
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,560
He needs a new liver.

516
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,274
Look on the bright side.

517
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,985
You can publish the results
of this case study.

518
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,779
No one will ever
double the dose again.

519
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,495
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer,

520
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,290
but it also trashed your liver.

521
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,751
If I don't find you
a new liver...

522
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,130
You've only got
about 24 hours left.

523
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,842
So what do we do now?

524
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,472
Your father's been moved to the
top of the transplant list.

525
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,975
But all we
really can do is wait.

526
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,059
That's it? We wait?

527
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,384
Tell me something
that I can do.

528
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,645
I'm sorry, Mel.

529
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,897
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type,

530
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,983
and neither does Ashley.

531
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,819
So a live liver donation
is out.

532
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:39,157
The best thing to do is
just what you've been doing,

533
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,075
be together.

534
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,000
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die,

535
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,127
'cause it's gonna make what I'm
about to say a lot more relevant.

536
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,839
House, I know it's raining out
there in the hallway, but...

537
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,968
I was just in the ER, testing my
patient for autonomic dysfunction.

538
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,094
It's the only department
with a shower

539
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,888
big enough for the whole team,

540
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,558
plus the cardiac monitors, plus me, plus...
Anyway, relevant part.

541
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,269
We're just wheeling the guy
out, a trauma came in.

542
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,562
Motorcycle versus semi.

543
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,730
How bad?

544
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,449
Bad for the motorcycle,
good for your liver.

545
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,108
Blood type's a match.

546
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,193
Why wasn't I paged?

547
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,903
Because there is a problem.

548
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,696
No organ donor card.

549
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,406
Dead guy's sister
is next of kin,

550
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,283
she's refusing to
allow the donation.

551
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,368
Where is she?

552
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,494
Twenty minutes away.

553
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,707
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead,

554
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,167
and then run out the door?

555
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,585
"That reminds me,."

556
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,754
"I had dry cleaning
to pick up."

557
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,132
Did Cuddy buy the place?

558
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,801
Not yet.

559
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,761
You okay?

560
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,346
Just making conversation.

561
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,556
Yours was getting boring.

562
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,808
What are you planning?

563
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,393
I'm not planning anything.

564
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,477
And I don't believe you.

565
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,145
How are you gonna punish
her for dating Lucas?

566
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,273
Okay, now this conversation
is getting boring.

567
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,236
Are you really okay? No.

568
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,156
I am not okay. Not even close.

569
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:07,328
Wow. Okay. See, that's
very adult of you.

570
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,205
No, it isn't.

571
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,207
It's just me accepting the fact

572
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,084
that there's nothing
I can do and moving on.

573
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,212
Which is, I think,
the definition of adulthood.

574
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,756
Well, if it is, being a
kid is a lot more fun.

575
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,509
It's show time.

576
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,728
I didn't speak
to him for years.

577
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,774
But when my parents died,
at their funeral,

578
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,694
we made peace.

579
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,613
Our parents must
have blessed it.

580
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,950
And I'm sure they would
want him to do good

581
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,870
with his last act
in this world.

582
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,164
They wanted us to be friends.

583
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,460
Our relationship wasn't
strong, but it was growing.

584
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,212
If I allow you to
defile his body,

585
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,298
it will destroy that bond.

586
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,341
The itai will be harmed.

587
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,011
It will save my patient's life.

588
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,352
What if I told you
that he wasn't dead?

589
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,023
Are you saying
my brother's still alive?

590
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,816
I'm saying
you're being an idiot,

591
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,568
but I don't have time to talk
you out of your religion,

592
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,332
so I'm stuck with
giving you a technicality

593
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,781
that will let you justify
doing the right thing.

594
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,326
What if his last living act

595
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,244
was to donate
a part of his liver?

596
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,748
Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

597
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,417
Then I'm not
defiling a dead body.

598
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,588
House. The last generous
act of a living person.

599
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,590
House. It's too late.

600
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,426
The liver started to degrade.

601
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,970
It's no longer viable
for transplant.

602
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:55,686
Well played. Religion just
killed another person.

603
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,238
It's not fair, Jim.

604
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,325
You just helped me get
my family back together.

605
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm not ready.

606
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,774
I would've had six
more months with them

607
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,340
if you hadn't given me
that extra chemo.

608
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,717
Now I have less than one day.

609
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm sorry. We knew the risks.

610
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,056
I don't want to
lose them again.

611
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,141
I can't lose them again.

612
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,729
There's nothing more we can do.

613
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:46,112
Five years ago, when I needed a
transfusion, you used your own blood.

614
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,198
We have the same type,

615
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,493
which means you can give
me a part of your liver.

616
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,414
I'm your doctor.

617
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,124
You're my friend.

618
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,167
Should I die because
you're also my doctor?

619
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,252
Of course not.

620
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,587
Fine then, you're fired.

621
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,714
Now you're just my friend.

622
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,341
Now you can do what's right.

623
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,678
Tucker, it's...

624
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,347
I can't.

625
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,735
Late night with
the Pigeon sisters?

626
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,195
Every now and again,

627
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,407
I'd like to come home without
getting interrogated.

628
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,538
Someone's cranky. And late.
Where were you?

629
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,207
Was getting a drink.

630
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,252
Why are all my frozen dinners
thawing on the counter?

631
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,631
I needed room for
my margarita jello shots.

632
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,674
I used test tubes as bottles

633
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,052
so they'll be shaped
like my cane.

634
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,388
Why did you go
out drinking alone

635
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,308
when you got such
great company here?

636
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,441
Tucker wants me to donate
a lobe of my liver to him.

637
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:11,197
You were out drinking because
you're actually considering this?

638
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,241
Yeah, I was out marinating
my liver in alcohol

639
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,119
to get it ready for
the transplant. Yeah.

640
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,788
Your mouth says no,

641
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,831
but your pathetic attempt
at a deflection

642
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,292
has guilt written all over it.

643
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,878
It's my fault. It is my fault.

644
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,588
I gave him too much chemo.

645
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,215
You cured his cancer.

646
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,676
And killed him in the process.

647
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Quibbles.

648
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,847
He's had a predictable
complication.

649
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,642
Surprise. Bad things happen
to people who are sick.

650
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,060
Doesn't make you responsible.

651
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:45,981
Oh. Not legally,
ethically. Ethically.

652
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,483
A table is a table.

653
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,902
Don't be a doormat, Wilson.

654
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,031
Boy, you are... You
willfully ruined my food

655
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,437
and have taken over
my living room

656
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,993
because you already
think I am a doormat.

657
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,704
You know what?

658
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,793
You're wrong.

659
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,797
Clean up your stuff
and get out.

660
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,510
You're wrong.

661
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,730
How's Tucker?

662
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:30,693
Still no dancing. But the
scans came in on Del Clinton.

663
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,069
It's good news.

664
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,404
Thanks.

665
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,031
Let me know as soon as Tucker
takes a turn for the worse.

666
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,908
I want to be there.

667
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,999
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

668
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,670
That was then. This is now.
The spot's gone.

669
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,007
That tiny little spot, huh?

670
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,218
Yeah, it's not
too impressive, is it?

671
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,513
That little dot
could have killed me?

672
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,223
Yeah.

673
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,435
Fortunately,
we caught it early.

674
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,896
It's gonna be okay.

675
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,232
That's amazing.
You got all this off me

676
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,693
not talking about my grandkids.

677
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,951
Thanks, Bonnie.

678
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,163
We're just gonna have to
sit tight for a while.

679
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,415
Okay.

680
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,964
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

681
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,135
I offered exactly what a similar
unit sold for three months ago.

682
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,349
I want to donate a lobe
of my liver to Tucker.

683
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:45,893
That's insane.

684
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,104
I'm donating
a small portion of...

685
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,273
You have hundreds of patients.

686
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,400
And until I run out
of excess organs,

687
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,653
why shouldn't I do everything
I can to help them?

688
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,739
Because you're a doctor,
not a donor.

689
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,332
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

690
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,918
Not because you
have the most organs.

691
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,129
You're thoughtful, caring.

692
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,923
Yeah. Caring.

693
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,552
By your own criteria, a
strength and not a weakness.

694
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,345
This is coming out of guilt.

695
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,347
This is coming
out of friendship.

696
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,307
I have a friend
who's about to die.

697
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,561
And I have the opportunity
to save his life.

698
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,026
Okay.

699
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,457
Call me a doormat,

700
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,919
get it all out of your
system, but I'm doing it.

701
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,133
Why?

702
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,720
He's my friend.

703
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,138
I'm your friend.

704
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,142
All the pain pills I've taken?

705
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,560
What if I need your liver?

706
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,061
Right. How selfish of me

707
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,398
not to have considered
your possible future needs.

708
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,817
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

709
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,777
I'm not here
for an argument, House.

710
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,071
No, right, that's room 12A.

711
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,241
So why are you here?

712
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,119
You wanna make sure that
I've called a moving van?

713
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,287
No.

714
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,416
The operation is in two hours,

715
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,585
and I'd like you
to be there with me.

716
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,383
No.

717
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,429
Why?

718
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,266
Because if you die, I'm alone.

719
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,355
Thanks, Jim.

720
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,894
How are you feeling?

721
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,020
Can't complain,

722
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,190
considering if it weren't for
you, I'd be dead. Twice.

723
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,108
You?

724
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,693
I feel good.

725
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,613
Sending out your laundry?

726
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,783
Going to rehab.
Someplace up in Katonah.

727
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,953
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

728
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,499
Easier on Ashley.

729
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,085
I see.

730
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,547
I was thrilled to get
the family back together,

731
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,008
and Melissa's great
in a crisis,

732
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,386
but the person you want
when you're dying

733
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:35,015
isn't the same as the person
you want when you're living.

734
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,602
Hi, Jim.

735
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,856
Actually, it's James.

736
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,173
You ready to admit that
he's a self-important jerk?

737
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,468
I still feel good
about what I did.

738
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,096
You don't feel angry?

739
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,058
Oh, I'm a little disappointed.

740
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,563
Disappointment is anger
for wimps.

741
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,775
You don't have to be so
gentle about everything.

742
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,570
It's okay to get angry
once in a while.

743
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,407
You can't change a table.

744
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,784
Actually, you can.

745
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,621
You just need a coat of paint
and the guts to use it.

746
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,808
Bonnie.

747
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,794
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.

748
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,379
You're gonna outbid her?

749
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,844
We do need
a bigger refrigerator.

750
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,184
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

751
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,145
You got mad.

752
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,231
I'm proud of you.

753
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,859
Cuddy won't share
that sentiment.

754
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,861
How are you going
to explain it to her?

755
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,906
I'm changing our address
to a PO box.

756
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,699
She'll find out eventually.

757
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:02,079
A problem delayed
is a problem denied.

758
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,126
Bonnie? I'll take it.

759
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,963
Baby steps.
