1
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,486
My lords and ladies!

2
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:32,240
Today, your Queen
will choose her champion.

3
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,369
Here he will battle
for not only her honor,

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,080
but for a title of his own.

5
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,336
But only if he can defeat
the Captain of my Guard,

6
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,463
Sir Horace the Black!

7
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,810
Sir William, wouldst
thou fight for my honor?

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,980
To the death, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,567
Let's hope it does not
come to that, eh?

10
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,321
I choose Sir William
as my champion.

11
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,037
Attack from his left side.

12
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,082
I saw his squire bandaging
that shoulder this morning.

13
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,338
I wish thee luck and strength.

14
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,091
I fear I shall need
all I can get.

15
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:42,518
The Captain of my Guard,
Sir Horace the Black!

16
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:04,332
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
reconsider your choice, my Queen?

17
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,835
I believe I chose
rightly, my King.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,182
Brave knights, in the honored
tradition of our land, have at ye!

19
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,296
I fear you chose
most poorly, my love.

20
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,235
William! William!
William! William!

21
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,781
William! William!
William! William!

22
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,452
William! William!
William! William!

23
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:08,039
William? What is it?

24
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,005
Your eyes.

25
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,595
William.

26
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,402
We need an ambulance
at the Camden Fairgrounds.

27
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,254
You're new.

28
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,172
You're naked.

29
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,175
And for the record,
a little bit cold.

30
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,344
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

31
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,848
James had an early call,
and I was just leaving.

32
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,683
Without breakfast?

33
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,436
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm Sam, by the way.

34
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,521
House. Nice to meet you.

35
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,107
It'd be nicer
if you put this on.

36
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,443
So you and Wilson...

37
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,738
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

38
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,242
Sorry, must have missed the "if this
trailer be a-rocking" sign out front.

39
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,828
I'm really late, so...

40
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:16,250
If there's any chance that we can
pretend this never happened,

41
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,170
I'd be completely
fine with that.

42
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,848
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

43
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,144
I'll see your bleeding ears and raise
you a total muscular degeneration.

44
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,479
What the hell?

45
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,110
I had a dream like this once.
It didn't end well.

46
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,363
Huzzah, my loyal peasants.

47
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,740
House, what are you doing?

48
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,409
Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein Bris.

49
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,664
While I'm busy, you all can check
out the knight down in the ER,

50
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,793
who instead of seizing
the throne, just seized.

51
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,586
He works at
a Renaissance festival?

52
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,172
Doesn't work there,
he lives there.

53
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,508
He's part of a wonderful
little troupe

54
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,052
who spend their weekends
re-enacting a nobler age

55
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,136
when people crapped in the streets and
Thirteen would've been a grandmother.

56
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,266
Weeks, not weekends. Says here
he's been camping out for a month.

57
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,272
Try doing that with a pen.

58
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,942
Why don't you put that down
before you kill one of us?

59
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,402
Better idea. Why don't you
give me something I can use

60
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,608
so I won't feel the need to?

61
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,949
Seizure right after a fight
obviously suggests concussion.

62
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,868
Obviously it isn't, or the ER
wouldn't have called House.

63
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,538
A full suit of armor would
protect against visible trauma,

64
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,164
but not transmitted
concussive force.

65
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,625
Could be a subdural hematoma.

66
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,044
You're forgetting to demonize.

67
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,964
An evil, satanic
subdural hematoma.

68
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,718
No, two demon eyes.
Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

69
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,138
Could be an allergic reaction to
something from the Renaissance fair.

70
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,140
Which is why we need to
check out Middle Earth.

71
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,642
Foreman, take Frodo and break
bread with the Hobbits.

72
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
I still think a hematoma
is more likely.

73
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,980
That's why you and Chase
are gonna get an MRI.

74
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,148
But you just...

75
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,066
I said Frodo, not Gollum.

76
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,404
Is he saying I have short
legs or hairy feet?

77
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,030
I don't even know who Frodo is.

78
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,662
Who's the chick, and why
are you hiding her?

79
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,497
You were home last night?

80
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,251
And this morning. I bumped
into your babe naked.

81
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,336
I told you to stay
out of my bathroom.

82
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,546
I was in the kitchen.

83
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,506
She was naked in the kitchen?
I was naked.

84
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,716
Why were you naked
in the kitchen?

85
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
That's not important right now.

86
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,845
What is, is why you didn't want me
to meet her in the first place.

87
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,638
Is she married? No.

88
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,848
Patient?

89
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,183
I don't have time for this.

90
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,893
She used to be a man. House!

91
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,519
She wants to be a man.

92
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:44,106
Sam is a man's name,
short for...

93
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,112
Samantha.

94
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,783
The soulless harpy you were
married to before we met.

95
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,412
People change, House.

96
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,374
Sure. They get older, their
ovaries start drying up

97
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,219
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

98
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,420
Listen, I know that in
your own demented way,

99
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,584
you think you're looking out for me.
But I have this.

100
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,760
By "this" you mean a sinking
feeling in the pit of the stomach.

101
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,595
Fine, I get it.

102
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,598
It's your life, you go screw it up.
I can wait.

103
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,016
For what?

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
To tell you, "I told you so."

105
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,945
No signs of a hematoma.
Brain looks completely normal.

106
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,865
Normal, except for the fact
that he likes to play dress-up.

107
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,618
My uncle used to pretend
that he was King Leopold.

108
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,495
I'm not pretending.

109
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,002
Sorry about that.

110
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,672
But you don't really think
you're a knight, do you?

111
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,841
Being a knight isn't a
game, it's a lifestyle,

112
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,011
and we do it every day, not
just when we play dress-up.

113
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:02,184
We live by a code, and uphold ideals
like loyalty, courage, humility.

114
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,021
And the part where you beat the
crap out of each other in armor?

115
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,858
That we do for fun. At least
it was up until yesterday.

116
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,363
Are we almost done?
I'm feeling...

117
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,367
Let's get him out of there
before he aspirates.

118
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,795
Anything abnormal on the MRI?

119
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,592
God's teeth! What strange
manner of garments be these?

120
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,803
Okay. We'll be back soon.

121
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,182
He consorts with tiny demons in his hand.
'Tis witchcraft, I say.

122
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,893
Do I look like I'm here
to play pretend with you?

123
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,229
Relax. It's not personal.

124
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,234
Just tell them you're a
time traveler or something.

125
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,737
Well, if we're gonna be here,
we might as well enjoy it.

126
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,905
Our knight just vomited
inside the MRI.

127
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,783
Taub thinks it might
be food poisoning.

128
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,373
Which shouldn't be surprising.

129
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,461
Outdoor latrines, food prep
going on next to livestock.

130
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,843
I hear you wish to speak with
me concerning Sir William.

131
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,011
How faireth he?

132
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,347
Not well,
or we wouldn't be here.

133
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,266
A pox indeed is... Miles.

134
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,603
We just thought
it was a concussion.

135
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,146
He's going to be okay, right?

136
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,149
We need to look at the area
he was camping out in.

137
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,569
And you might want to invest into
a dental plan for the kingdom.

138
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,448
You sure he got sick
from something here?

139
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,117
I'm not sure of
anything, yet, but...

140
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,206
What do you make of this?

141
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,419
Mmm. Looks like vomit.

142
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,797
Means he was showing
symptoms prior to the fight.

143
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,174
True, but I meant this.

144
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,304
Oh. It's a cow eye from the
night before the tournament.

145
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,224
He makes the knights eat all
kinds of disgusting stuff.

146
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,392
Why?

147
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,851
Got the idea from Fear Factor.

148
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,895
Why didn't he mention it when
he checked into the hospital?

149
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,523
I make them all take an oath
of secrecy about the ritual.

150
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,609
William tends to take his role
as a knight very seriously.

151
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,696
You think that's what
caused him to pass out?

152
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,039
It's not exactly sanitary.

153
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,624
Fun stuff never is.

154
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:37,423
Serious bacterial food poisoning
explains seizure and vomiting.

155
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,799
A lumbar puncture
could confirm.

156
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,467
Except it's not food poisoning.

157
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,929
If it was, the ER would look
like Camelot right now.

158
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,098
All it takes is
one bad eyeball.

159
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,269
Or testicle, cow brain,
or my personal favorite,

160
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,064
pig rectum with a side
order of sphincter.

161
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,492
I think they call that
breakfast in Australia.

162
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,236
No one else was sick because they
weren't allergic like he was.

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,161
To what? That's what I
sent you to Middle Earth

164
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,656
to find out.

165
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,909
Run scratch tests with the
samples you brought back.

166
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,703
That's gonna take time,
and he's getting worse.

167
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,247
So treat him with
epinephrine, too.

168
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,756
This should prevent
any more symptoms

169
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,134
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

170
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,510
Thanks.

171
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,305
I told you, you shouldn't
have eaten all that stuff.

172
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,431
You know,
you don't have to stay.

173
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm sure you and Miles are crazy
busy, what with the wedding and all.

174
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,519
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

175
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:36,648
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be there.
I just hope you have a good photographer.

176
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,776
'Cause I don't think the standard red-eye
filter's going to work on these.

177
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,278
I need your right arm.

178
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,956
That feels... Feels strange.

179
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,959
What is it? What's wrong?

180
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,878
His heart rate's
become irregular.

181
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,172
My chest hurts. It feels
like it's going to explode.

182
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,674
Tachycardia. We need to
shock him back into rhythm.

183
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,967
Oh, my God, William...

184
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,886
I need his gown open.

185
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,183
What is that?
What is that stuff?

186
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,352
I don't know.

187
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,277
It's definitely not an allergy,

188
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,530
or the epi would have helped
him, not made him worse.

189
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,083
Unless he's allergic and
allergic to the cure.

190
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:29,576
Sodium bisulfite,

191
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,205
the preservative that keeps epi
peppy, can cause tachycardia.

192
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,374
So can Wolff-Parkinson-
White syndrome,

193
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,459
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

194
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,464
And abnormal electrical pathways in the
heart, which could cause seizures.

195
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,756
But not skin infections.

196
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,425
There is an infection that can
cause skin and neurological damage

197
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,553
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

198
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,722
Methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

199
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,308
Lord have MRSA.

200
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,312
You weren't wearing gloves when we
shocked his heart back into rhythm.

201
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,236
I'm sure you'll be fine. You two,
get a sample to the lab to confirm.

202
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,364
You get the knight into isolation
and on IV antibiotics.

203
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,491
You, stay away from me.

204
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,793
Need to talk. About the MRSA?

205
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,878
I know. We're... MRSA, shmrsa.

206
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,297
Something important.

207
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,383
Something you think is more important
than a potentially lethal bacteria

208
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,219
spreading like wildfire
through my hospital?

209
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,015
Well, that narrows it down to
something personal and stupid.

210
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,309
Wilson. Theory confirmed.

211
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,603
He is dating his
first wife, I know.

212
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,104
I don't believe it.

213
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,940
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

214
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,819
No, that he's actually capable
of keeping a secret from me.

215
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,031
Well, you'd be surprised how many
things Wilson doesn't tell you.

216
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:53,827
Would I? Like how you slept with
your father's best friend? Or...

217
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,995
I'm going to kill him.

218
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,663
You need to break them up.

219
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,457
Forget it.

220
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,958
So you'd rather
sit back and watch

221
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,378
while the evil blonde gorges
on Wilson's tender flesh

222
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,590
and then tosses out his bones
like she did the last time?

223
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,634
You remember what
he was like after that?

224
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,220
Yes, I do.

225
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,472
Well, then do something.

226
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,037
God knows he's not
gonna listen to me.

227
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,810
You, on the other hand, have
decades of experience dating

228
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,229
and being attracted to losers.

229
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,440
Obviously I don't
include myself.

230
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,026
You know what happens when you interfere
in other people's relationships?

231
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,570
Of course,
I do it all the time.

232
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,239
Hmm. I see your point.

233
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,533
That is why
I'm staying out of this.

234
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,746
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

235
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,924
He doesn't seem to be in
as much pain anymore.

236
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,133
That's good.

237
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,679
But we won't be out of the woods for
sure until the blisters start to recede.

238
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,932
I'm really thirsty.
You mind getting me a soda?

239
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,101
Sure. I'll be right back.

240
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,940
What's wrong?

241
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,818
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

242
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,444
Just now? No.

243
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,156
I didn't want to worry her.

244
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,368
So how long have you
been in love with her?

245
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,912
What? No, we're just friends.

246
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,789
Seriously.

247
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,420
Since the first time I saw her.

248
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,296
Why don't you tell her?

249
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,631
She's engaged to my friend.

250
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,882
The King?

251
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,343
Haven't seen him visiting
or sitting by your bedside.

252
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,970
He has responsibilities.

253
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,723
Yeah? I'm guessing
the Queen does, too.

254
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,268
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

255
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,771
I hate that
I even think about it.

256
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,649
You're not a knight.
You're just a guy.

257
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,947
But I want to be
more than that.

258
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,493
Your chest?

259
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,911
No, my back.

260
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,497
Feels like there's
a knife in it.

261
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
Is the infection spreading?

262
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,585
It's not MRSA.

263
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,881
It looks like some sort
of clostridial organism.

264
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,968
Question is, which type of clostridium?
There's hundreds.

265
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,803
C. Perfringens?

266
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,891
Wouldn't account for his other symptoms.
C. Tetani, on the other hand?

267
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,435
Tetanus? He would have been
inoculated against it.

268
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,896
So he cut himself and
didn't get a booster shot.

269
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,066
The guy fights people with swords
for fun, no one said he's smart.

270
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,777
They don't just fight for fun.

271
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,528
They fight to prove
their bravery.

272
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,823
You buying this honor stuff?

273
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,744
Fighting is not brave,
it's just stupid.

274
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,662
You would say that.

275
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,873
You think I've never
been in a fight?

276
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,458
No, I just think
you've never won one.

277
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,960
I took on three guys
in college once.

278
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,087
Hope they
bought you dinner first.

279
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,215
It's not MRSA. I know.

280
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,841
- It's poison ivy.
- Poison ivy?

281
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,385
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

282
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,912
and maybe irritate his eyes
enough to cause the hemorrhaging,

283
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,140
but the chest pain
and seizures?

284
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,975
They have bonfires every night.

285
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,061
Burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

286
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,146
You've seen what it's done
to the outside of his body,

287
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,440
imagine what it's doing to
his lungs and his sinuses.

288
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,192
Okay, maybe it remotely fits,

289
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,861
but I'd rather go with scientific
evidence than with your gut.

290
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,905
How about this?

291
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,283
Apparently,
it's all over his sword.

292
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,122
It's his heart rate again!

293
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,749
How fast is it? It's slowing.
Why aren't you...

294
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,417
It's not MRSA.

295
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,169
I'm giving him 12 cc's
of epinephrine.

296
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,171
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out.

297
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,091
If it slows any more,
it's going to stop.

298
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,762
I told you!

299
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,603
And I told you.

300
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,111
That wasn't caused
by poison ivy.

301
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,362
Or epinephrine.

302
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,824
Means the heart problem we ruled
out, we now have to rule back in.

303
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,451
We found clostridium bacteria
in the skin samples.

304
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,787
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

305
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,540
But opportunistic, if his
immune system was depressed.

306
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,417
Leukemia?
He would've had symptoms

307
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,043
way before the
Renaissance festival.

308
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,463
Which is true of anything that would
compromise his immune system.

309
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,884
Which means it has to be some
other environmental toxin.

310
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,012
Yesterday he was a healthy knight,
today he's sleeping beauty.

311
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,346
Nothing else fits.

312
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,223
Trichinosis from
eating infected meat?

313
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,558
We already ruled
out food poisoning.

314
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,522
Both the butcher shop and the food
stands at the fair were totally clean.

315
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,479
Then he ate the poison
apple somewhere else,

316
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,773
or maybe you just missed it.

317
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,193
Start treatment for trichinosis
and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

318
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,329
Hey.

319
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,625
I can't believe I'm about
to say this. Sam...

320
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,251
Told you so.

321
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,130
No, she didn't dump me. She wants
to get to know you better.

322
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,758
Damn it! I never should
have let her see me naked.

323
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,303
It goes against all my
instincts, but I said all right.

324
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,429
Why?

325
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,389
She thinks I was
hiding her from you.

326
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,515
You were.

327
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,934
I don't want her to know.

328
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,897
You're asking me to condone a
relationship based on lies and mistrust?

329
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,566
Yeah.

330
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,692
When and where?

331
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,569
Tonight. Venezia. 8:00.

332
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,737
What am I gonna wear?

333
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,489
All my cereal boxes
are at the cleaners.

334
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,533
House, listen.

335
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,203
I know you're worried about me.

336
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,997
And I also know that that
kind of unselfishness

337
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,416
doesn't come naturally to you.

338
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,670
But I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

339
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:42,217
Just come to dinner and be
your usual selfish self.

340
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,596
How could I say no?

341
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,811
Miles said he'd stop by later.

342
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,646
Tell him not to.

343
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,815
I don't want to be
seen like this.

344
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,151
You're sick. That's
nothing to be ashamed of.

345
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,209
Unless you're saying
you want me to leave?

346
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,738
No, don't.

347
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,576
I think he's saying it's
different with you, Shannon.

348
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,329
It's a guy thing. They don't like showing
weakness in front of each other.

349
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,039
Right, William?

350
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,334
Right. Maybe when I'm
feeling a little better.

351
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,590
I'm going to take a small sample
of your muscle tissue here.

352
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,157
Do you mind waiting
outside for this?

353
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,343
Don't hurt him.

354
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,220
He's safe with me.

355
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,041
I thought you were
going to tell her.

356
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,023
Not my call, but if you ask
me, she's waiting for you to.

357
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,817
Knights are supposed
to be selfless.

358
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,363
Right, they conquered countries and
built castles by being selfless.

359
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,867
Bravery and loyalty are great
qualities for soldiers.

360
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,787
If you want to be king, sometimes you
have to be willing to take what's yours.

361
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,044
She's not mine.

362
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,797
She's not his either. Not yet.

363
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,975
It's just dinner. Relax.

364
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,644
Trust me, there is no "just"
when House is involved.

365
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,438
We're in the middle
of a restaurant.

366
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,649
What could he possibly do?

367
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,986
That.

368
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,492
Sorry we're late,
but you know girls.

369
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,577
Always fiddling with the
hair and the makeup.

370
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,330
James, Sam, this is Sarah.

371
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,998
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me...

372
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,083
House.

373
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,836
House has told me
all about you.

374
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,171
Nice to meet you.

375
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,261
What's the diagnosis?

376
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,849
His muscle biopsy's clean.
It's not trichinosis.

377
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,019
House was wrong.
This is not environmental.

378
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,272
Or we screwed up and missed
something at the Renaissance fair.

379
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,607
You think we did?

380
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,318
No, but I think
House will think we did.

381
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,695
What could we have missed?

382
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,739
Fungal infection?

383
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,451
There's nothing in his blood work
even remotely suggesting that.

384
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,620
But it fits the symptoms.

385
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,623
You want to retest every
sample we took for spores?

386
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,251
We'll be here all night.

387
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,378
Have you noticed how much
pain he's been in lately?

388
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,588
And that's relevant how?

389
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:29,467
Extra pain means extra
cranky, means off his game.

390
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,719
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

391
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,139
unless we give him no choice.

392
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,290
I cannot believe
you're from Bloomington.

393
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,192
I know. Isn't it amazing?

394
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,820
Yeah. Delightful.

395
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,030
Ignore him. He's just upset
that we're having fun.

396
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,768
Do you remember
that little bakery,

397
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,160
the one with the
amazing cupcakes?

398
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,661
Gino's. Oh, yes!

399
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,996
First stop every
time I go home.

400
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,581
Me, too.

401
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,166
Remember that strip club?

402
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,252
Girl, I used to work
at that strip club.

403
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,212
Where does it hurt, William?

404
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,093
My legs. It feels
like they're on fire.

405
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,319
Rhabdomyolysis
means his kidneys are failing.

406
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,530
Also means it's not environmental.
We need to move on.

407
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,336
I recommend we start with a full
cancer work-up, starting with the...

408
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,702
Which one of you
checked out the apartment?

409
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,786
House...

410
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,038
His symptoms fit
an environmental...

411
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,706
The test results
don't. We redid...

412
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,583
Search the apartment.

413
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,876
He hasn't been there
in three weeks.

414
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,836
Go! Now!

415
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,884
I liked him better
when he was on Vicodin.

416
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,510
You and Thirteen
check out his place.

417
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,679
While you're wasting your time,
we'll ultrasound the liver.

418
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,141
If it's cancer, it's as good
a place as any to start.

419
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,314
Hey. Hey.

420
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,280
Heard House met Sam.

421
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,278
The first time he was naked.

422
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,160
The second time, he brought a
transvestite prostitute to dinner.

423
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,204
Overall,
it could've been worse.

424
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,872
Great.

425
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,252
That's your reaction?

426
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,419
What?

427
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,546
Nudity, prostitutes...

428
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,299
Sorry. Preoccupied.

429
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,304
House said something
to you, didn't he?

430
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,015
No. He didn't.

431
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,404
It is a little crazy, though.
I mean, isn't it?

432
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,948
I mean, things seem
to be going great,

433
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,826
but they seemed to be
going great 12 years ago.

434
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,452
The good things are still good.

435
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,913
She's still smart,
funny, gets me.

436
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,164
And she's less competitive.

437
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,710
Either she's changed or I've
changed, but either way...

438
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,713
Am I out of my mind?

439
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,719
You never know what can happen.

440
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,387
Might as well give it a chance.

441
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,601
Yeah.

442
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,273
Looks like you were right.

443
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:35,278
Tumors, dozens of them
inside and on the surface.

444
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,364
Pull in closer.

445
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,830
See that?

446
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,708
What is that?

447
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,462
I don't know, but it's
definitely not cancer.

448
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,729
Kitchen's clean.

449
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,564
Bedroom as well.

450
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,776
Most dangerous thing in his
medicine cabinet was dental floss.

451
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,279
It's locked.
Key wasn't on his ring.

452
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,989
You honestly want to go back

453
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,201
and tell House we didn't check
every square inch of this place?

454
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,827
Of course not.

455
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,637
My hero.

456
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,441
What the hell is this?

457
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,321
Either a secret
entrance to Hogwarts

458
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,660
or our knight is a witch.

459
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,759
Our knight is into some
seriously creepy stuff.

460
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,136
He claims it's
just sugar water,

461
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,971
but we sent the rest down
to the lab for testing.

462
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,255
You think he poisoned himself?

463
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,788
It's not poison. We would have
picked it up in his blood work.

464
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,893
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

465
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,646
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

466
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,940
These tumors
that aren't tumors,

467
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,276
what if they're focal hepatic
lesions filled with blood?

468
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,779
Every time one explodes, it'd
be releasing another dose.

469
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,197
Of what?

470
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,786
Plumbum nigrum.

471
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,204
You putting a hex on someone?

472
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,998
It's Latin for black lead.

473
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:56,335
Our knight/warlock apparently
also dabbles in alchemy.

474
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,463
Lead poisoning?

475
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,883
Seizures, paralysis, weak immune
system and eventually coma.

476
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,886
Biopsy the cysts,
you'll find your lead.

477
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,145
You think we'll make the 7:30?

478
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,231
I'm sorry. If I don't change, I'm gonna
feel like I'm at work all night.

479
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,691
Yeah, I remember.

480
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,859
Is it a problem?

481
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,569
Not at all.

482
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,490
In fact, if we hurry...

483
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,620
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

484
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,580
Well, there's always the 9:40.

485
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,009
Or not.

486
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,434
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

487
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,302
Wouldn't need a team if I did
all the work, now, would I?

488
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,480
Plus, I had to make you dinner.

489
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,564
We have plans.

490
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,526
Bet your plans
don't taste like this.

491
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,445
Don't!

492
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,491
House, whatever it is
that you're up to...

493
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,118
I'm trying to be nice.

494
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,875
What I did the other night was juvenile.
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,391
Yeah.

496
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,767
Soufflé was amazing.

497
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,062
It's my mom's recipe. Everything
else, I got off the web.

498
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,148
Here's to the Internet.

499
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,733
Where I found the lamb ragù

500
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,319
and you two found
each other. Again.

501
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,530
Well, it wasn't
just the Internet.

502
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,825
Yeah, more like
divorce, depression,

503
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,827
therapy, more therapy,
then the Internet.

504
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,995
Yeah.

505
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,371
And here we are.

506
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,498
Exactly. And here we are.

507
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,089
Well, I need to go
to the bathroom.

508
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,301
I think you're old enough now, but if
you'd like me to come along with you...

509
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,304
I mean, is it safe
to leave the two of you?

510
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,930
Come on, James, enough already.

511
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,516
Yeah, James. I cook in peace.

512
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,269
Okay. Be right back.

513
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,449
You're a cold-hearted bitch
who ripped his heart out.

514
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,785
I watched him struggle for years
to overcome the damage you did,

515
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,151
and there's no way I'm just
gonna let you reel him back in

516
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,540
so you can do it
all over again.

517
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,630
And all this?

518
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,050
Phase two of getting
to know my enemy.

519
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,261
You're wrong about me.

520
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,182
But I'm glad now I don't
have to pretend I like you,

521
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,476
except for when James
is standing next to me.

522
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,563
Same here. The only difference
is, I'll outlast you.

523
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,401
And scene.

524
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,531
Well, it's too late
for the movie.

525
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,783
Wanna see what's on TV?

526
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,076
Absolutely.

527
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,119
Love to.

528
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,213
There wasn't any lead present in
his blood work or liver biopsy.

529
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,298
And his heart rate and BP are
getting even more erratic.

530
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,260
We had to shock it back into
rhythm twice during the night.

531
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,141
There's only one
thing left to do.

532
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,360
We're wasting our time.

533
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,654
Actually, I've already
gotten good value.

534
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,699
I told you there's nothing here that
could've caused any of his symptoms.

535
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,243
No, you told me that you
couldn't find anything here

536
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,452
that could be causing
his symptoms.

537
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,788
And now we're gonna find something
new because we're in costume?

538
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,624
We looked everywhere.
Tested everything.

539
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:07,461
Just because Wilson's acting
stupid doesn't mean we are.

540
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,714
You think he's
making a mistake?

541
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,842
Of course. But he'll figure
it out sooner or later.

542
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,719
Hopefully after a few
weeks of great sex.

543
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,679
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

544
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,347
Wilson's not like us.

545
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,808
He cares too much about
people and their feelings.

546
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,976
Thanks for the compliment.

547
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,311
The code that our knight
claims to live by,

548
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:28,691
all that crap about honor and chivalry,
Wilson's naturally like that.

549
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,817
Which is why he is...

550
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,360
A great guy.

551
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,197
A sucker and a target. Someone's
got to look out for him.

552
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,576
You smell that?

553
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,411
Yeah, it's the apothecary shop,

554
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,913
and, yes, Foreman
and I already...

555
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,507
I cry your pardon, sir.

556
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,094
You know what this is?

557
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,220
Why, that's lavender.

558
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,764
Try rose hips.

559
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,391
Both harmless. Who cares?

560
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,037
It could be cyanide,
as far as he knows.

561
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,438
How about this?

562
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,356
Be nothing but St John's wort.

563
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,776
Wrong again. Black Cohosh.

564
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,529
My uncle owns the shop.
I just started apprenticing.

565
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,448
What's the big deal?

566
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:22,369
Hey, I just organized all that.

567
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,626
You know what this is?

568
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,169
A wild carrot?

569
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,715
It's hemlock,
you embossed carbuncle.

570
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,135
That's hemlock? You sure?

571
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,387
Did you sell it to anyone?

572
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,808
It's poison. Think hard.

573
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,685
It was just one branch.

574
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,271
You sold it to Sir William.

575
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,107
No. To the King.

576
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,658
It's the only part of the
environment you didn't check.

577
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,576
The people living in it.

578
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,211
What's going on?
Why can't we see William?

579
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:17,383
Because you poisoned him,
your royal anus, with this.

580
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,134
Wild carrots?

581
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,302
Hemlock.

582
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,920
I need to know how much you
used and how you prepared it.

583
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,931
You did something to William?

584
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,015
No, of course not.

585
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,644
He's still alive. You want to avoid a
murder charge, start talking fast.

586
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,730
The apothecary's willing to testify
that you're the only one he gave it to.

587
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,650
Okay. Yeah, maybe I bought
it for the food challenge,

588
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,943
but I didn't know
that was hemlock.

589
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,070
If it was for the challenge,

590
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,406
why is Wee Willy the
only knight who's dying?

591
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,490
I don't know.

592
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,201
I'm telling you, I didn't know.
Why would I want to hurt William?

593
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,037
I can think of at
least one reason.

594
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,125
Miles, please, whatever happened,
just tell them the truth.

595
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,376
I am.

596
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,962
I swear.

597
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,759
We ran a gas chromatography
on his blood,

598
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,928
found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

599
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,638
The main markers
of hemlock intoxication.

600
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,892
Well, the good news is, we now
know what's wrong with you.

601
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,646
Bad news is, your king's precious
ideals were just pretend after all.

602
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,816
At least when it comes to guys
who get too close to his Queen.

603
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,193
It's not true.

604
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,280
I guess you've never
heard the expression,

605
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,574
"Gas chromatography
machines don't lie."

606
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,492
Neither does Miles.

607
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,828
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

608
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,039
That's why he was chosen king.

609
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:34,001
Miles is a jealous idiot,
and you're just an idiot.

610
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,295
Something's wrong.

611
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,673
We performed a gastric lavage and
administered activated charcoal,

612
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,800
but he's getting worse,
not better.

613
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,636
It's been in his
system two days.

614
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,179
We're lucky he's
lasted this long.

615
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,514
If it was hemlock,
he'd either be dead already

616
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,682
or getting better
with treatment.

617
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,142
It's hemlock. We found
it in his blood.

618
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,386
He may have had some hemlock,

619
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,687
but it's not
what's killing him.

620
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,946
Don't do it,
whatever you're planning,

621
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,670
especially if you're
gonna use that thing.

622
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,492
It was just sitting
in a stone...

623
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:11,956
Here. It's gonna cost extra 'cause of
the level of detail that you wanted.

624
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,584
Anything good? And by good,
I, of course, mean bad.

625
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,920
Nope. Pretty much
your typical life.

626
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,630
Married young, got divorced.

627
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,216
Married a little less
young, got divorced.

628
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,061
She's been pretty successful in
everything she's done except marriage.

629
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,971
Well, there's gotta be
something I can use.

630
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,766
Maybe. Didn't read her shrink's notes.
Didn't seem right.

631
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,643
But stealing them did?

632
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,896
Whoa! I didn't steal them.
I found a way to obtain them.

633
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:40,734
Excuse me. I don't mean to
interrupt, but you got a minute?

634
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,152
Sure.

635
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,031
Oh, him? Yeah.
I was just leaving.

636
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,495
Careful, I have a sword.

637
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,417
I don't agree
with what you said,

638
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,128
but I understand
why you said it.

639
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,588
We were married young.
We both made mistakes.

640
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,591
And, yes, I did make
most of them.

641
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,510
But that was almost
a decade ago.

642
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,347
I'm sorry, is that the statutory
period for soul sucking?

643
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,934
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

644
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,686
To be honest,
I think you're an ass,

645
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,647
but we do have
one thing in common.

646
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,608
We care about James.

647
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,528
So prove it and
dump him. Again.

648
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,354
You're pretty much insufferable
all the time, aren't you?

649
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,450
Sorry. Go on. And yes.

650
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,203
We just reconnected, we have
no idea where we're headed.

651
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:39,835
But is it really too much to ask that
you give us a chance to find out?

652
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,802
I'm sure I'll be
seeing you around.

653
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,088
We did it. Well, I did it.

654
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,672
What exactly did we do?

655
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:28,759
You do?

656
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,723
These aren't focal hepatic
lesions on his liver.

657
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,055
They're peliosis
hepatis lesions,

658
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,391
which, in combination with an erratic
heart rate, usually indicates...

659
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,769
Endocarditis, an infection
on his heart valve.

660
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,939
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

661
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,107
No, he wouldn't...

662
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,525
And the rhabdo makes the third.

663
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,610
Our patient's a juicer.

664
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,489
The ancient poison accelerated
the damage of the modern poison.

665
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,535
Start treatment. Let the
king out of the tower.

666
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,001
How are you feeling?

667
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,378
Ashamed.

668
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,422
You should be.

669
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,384
You'll compromise your
ideals to win a fight,

670
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,178
but not to go for
the woman you love.

671
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,932
That was a game, not real life.

672
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,144
I didn't...

673
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,229
Hurt anyone?
Try telling that to Shannon.

674
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,691
Or maybe I missed something while
she was crying by your bed.

675
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,735
You don't need
to win anyone's heart.

676
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,655
You just need to ask for it.

677
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,584
Miles is a great guy.

678
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,461
He's rich, smart,
treats her well.

679
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,715
She's going to have
a great life with him.

680
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,258
With me?

681
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,509
I'd do everything
I could for her,

682
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,219
but even at my best,
it wouldn't be much.

683
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,181
And she deserves the best.

684
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,520
I guess I'd rather she be happy,
even if it means I'm not.

685
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,693
Guess House was right
about that, too.

686
