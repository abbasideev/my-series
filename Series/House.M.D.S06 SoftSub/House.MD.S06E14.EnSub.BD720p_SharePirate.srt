1
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,629
Are you ever coming to bed?

2
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,466
I still say I'm a vegetarian.

3
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,552
You can say that
you're an astronaut,

4
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,137
but that doesn't make it true.

5
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,264
A salmon is not
a vegetable, Frankie.

6
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,629
Well, apparently eight out of
10 commenters agree with you,

7
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,101
except for the part
where you said,

8
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,270
"I believe what
I want to believe."

9
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,604
That, they found
a little judgmental.

10
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,982
You blogged our argument?

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
I asked you to quit
talking about me.

12
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,945
I don't want a bunch of
people that I don't know

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,069
hearing stuff that's meant
to be between me and you.

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,366
I write about my life,

15
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,743
and you're a big part of that.

16
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,827
That's great. I want to be
a big part of your life,

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,913
but I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,917
Take it down. Erase it,
delete it, make it go away.

19
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,261
Come on, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning,

20
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,554
these walls are made
of tissue paper.

21
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,078
I gotta be up in three hours to
do a wiring job out in Edison.

22
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,421
Sorry, we'll try
to hold it down.

23
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,517
Sorry.

24
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,021
Frankie, what happened?

25
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,233
No, no, that's not what you think.
Something's wrong.

26
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,652
We need a police
car at 152 Haverhill.

27
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,280
What are you two talking about?

28
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,407
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,869
Are you all right?

30
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,079
I think it's coming
from my gums.

31
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,498
What are you doing tonight?

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,041
Masturbating.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,252
I'd invite you, but people
are already talking.

34
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,089
It's pathetic. You divide your nights
between porn and the Discovery Channel.

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,509
Right, playing Dance Dance
Revolution is a much better choice.

36
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:01,347
Okay, that was a gift from a patient,
and it happens to be great exercise.

37
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,183
I mean, who rents porn anymore?

38
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,977
Can't you get that
stuff on the Internet?

39
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,814
You can, but you can't get disk two
with the director's commentary.

40
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,942
Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

41
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,069
If you mean you're dating
on meth, count me in.

42
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,193
You need to meet somebody.

43
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,363
This way, you meet
20 somebodies.

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,448
Over a five-minute
discussion of Proust?

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,825
Speed dating's a meat market.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,494
Yeah, dozens of women,
just waiting to be hit on.

47
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,415
Your odds of a happy ending are nearly as
good as staying home and watching porn.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
You plan on doing
any work today?

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,137
I thought I might do a little
light doctoring in the afternoon.

50
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,890
Twenty-eight-year-old female,
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

51
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,641
Could be congenital
thrombocytopenia.

52
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,851
Platelets look normal.

53
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,017
The patient makes money doing
freelance photography.

54
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,606
Some photographic processes
produce toxic gases.

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,331
She's a blogger. I can't see her
photos being anything but digital.

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,279
What does she blog? Politics? Dominatrix?
Cooking? I need recipes.

57
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,044
It's a personal journal. I don't get
putting your whole life online.

58
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,951
It's not that crazy. Privacy's
basically a modern invention.

59
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,496
Towns used to be too small for
anybody to keep any secrets.

60
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,625
What if it's not the platelets, but
the glue that holds them together?

61
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,210
No, thrombin and von
Willebrand factor are normal.

62
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,777
And knowing too much
about each other

63
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,715
is exactly why people leave small
towns and move to the city.

64
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,258
And a lot of people
choose to stay

65
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:23,012
because in return for zero privacy,
you get community, connection...

66
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,389
Big, red A's for our tunics.

67
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,099
Connections are for airports.

68
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,685
For people, we have over
300 cable channels.

69
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,020
Her photos may be digital,

70
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,481
doesn't mean she couldn't have
been exposed to some other toxin.

71
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,899
We should search the apartment.

72
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,277
Eenie, meenie, minie,
Thirteen and Tiny.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,367
This one's locked.

74
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,704
I'm surprised you took
the pro-community position.

75
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,040
I have friends, I like people.

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,292
You also like secrets.

77
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,629
You deny it, that sort
of proves my point.

78
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,008
When we're left to our own
devices, we make lousy choices.

79
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,554
Ignore it.

80
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,976
I can hear you in there. Open the
door or I'm calling the cops.

81
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,520
We're four stories up, but there's
a fire escape on the other wall.

82
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,271
The ledge might
be wide enough...

83
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,985
We're doctors. We aren't
stealing anything.

84
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,445
We are collecting samples.

85
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,573
Who are you? The neighbor.

86
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,783
Did they say that you
could come in here?

87
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,827
Yep. What do you know
about Frankie and Taylor?

88
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,746
Not much. The guy works a lot,
but I see Frankie around.

89
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,041
We argue a few times a week, and
then we go back about our business.

90
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,167
What do you argue about?

91
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,613
Frankie's got some
strong opinions.

92
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,380
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

93
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,465
You take the
anti-recycling position?

94
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,011
Trash piling up for composting is
attracting every rat in the neighborhood.

95
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,804
I had to put down poison.

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,514
That's her private drawer,
what are you doing over there?

97
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,158
She says she doesn't have any
secrets, I'm taking her at her word.

98
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,228
Is there any chance Frankie
touched the rat poison?

99
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,752
Touched it?
She grabbed a chunk of it

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,315
right out of the mouth of the
schnauzer from down the hall.

101
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,444
Now every time I put the stuff
down, she picks it back up.

102
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,304
You brought a date?

103
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,028
Wilson seemed to think
it was a good idea.

104
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,557
You need to dive
back into the pool.

105
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,100
And he has to swim in ours?

106
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,686
You go to a bar, you
bring your ugly friends.

107
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,688
It's not a beauty pageant.

108
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,398
Life is a beauty pageant.

109
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,276
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

110
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,612
Come on, I'm not
that good-looking.

111
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,821
Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,366
You kind of are.

113
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,368
So you attribute
every relationship

114
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,537
I've ever had to the
height of my cheekbones?

115
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,289
Not the whole relationship,
just the beginning.

116
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,208
- The rest is your hair.
- This is ridiculous.

117
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,211
Women aren't as distracted
by appearances as we are.

118
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,670
They look deeper.

119
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,507
You wanna bet?

120
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,885
You can't tell anyone you're a doctor.
You're unemployed.

121
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,888
You're also a little slow.
Misunderstand everything they say.

122
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,681
And lose the accent.

123
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,976
A hundred bucks says you still walk
out of here with a dozen names.

124
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fun is about to start.

125
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,482
When I strike this gong,

126
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,026
each man should sit at the
table you've been assigned.

127
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,613
When I strike it again,
date's over, move on.

128
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,992
I'm an oncologist.

129
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,913
My aunt and my grandma, they
both died from breast cancer.

130
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,541
Do you want to talk about it?

131
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,878
I'm a diagnostician.

132
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,426
I find out what's wrong
with people and I fix it.

133
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,717
Don't all doctors do that?

134
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,555
Yeah, but they can't
dance like I can.

135
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,267
I play video games.

136
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,018
Oh, professionally?

137
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,064
I wish, bro.

138
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,735
After six months of chemo, we
thought he was out of the woods.

139
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,531
I don't want kids. Check.

140
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,700
I'm thinking about
going from a C to a D.

141
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,868
Quadruple check.

142
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,911
And I'm on fire for the Lord.

143
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,747
I'm a chocolatier.

144
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,624
I could tell by your hips.

145
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,753
Yeah, I guess I could afford
to lose a few pounds.

146
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,382
I don't think I know anybody
who died of cancer.

147
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,303
Thank God. For you, I mean.
Obviously.

148
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,599
Except my cat.
She died a few months ago.

149
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,767
I hate these things.

150
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,937
You here at gunpoint?
Need me to call 911?

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,900
Friend dragged me. She keeps
trying to fix my life,

152
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,904
which, admittedly, could use
it, but still, annoying.

153
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,448
You like puzzles.

154
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,326
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

155
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,786
but it didn't work
out that way.

156
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,290
Police detective. Turns
out criminals are idiots.

157
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,461
If they're not gonna bother to
challenge you, what's the point?

158
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,549
Is there a fire alarm
we could pull?

159
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,343
Maybe get out of here.

160
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,474
Except maybe
you're just too swoft.

161
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,560
I beg your pardon?

162
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,771
Swoft. It's one of your
crossword answers.

163
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,731
I believe it means,
"Lying manipulator"

164
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,566
"who tells men anything
they want to hear."

165
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,319
You brought a prop
as a conversation starter,

166
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,655
folded the paper to make it look
read, filled in some answers,

167
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,073
but you couldn't be
bothered to work at it,

168
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,950
so you just put in
random letters.

169
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,577
You have some natural
talent as a liar,

170
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,621
but not enough brains
to see it through.

171
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,539
I'm gonna assume
you're not a cop.

172
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,168
Are the five minutes up?

173
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,013
These women would welcome
a call from you.

174
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,308
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

175
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,814
My.

176
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,410
It's nice to have visitors.

177
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,536
I'm updating my blog.

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,538
And I'm reading it.

179
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,041
You realize you're
in the same room.

180
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,377
Sorry.

181
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
So I've been thinking
about what you said,

182
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,049
and I'm sure I washed my hands
after I threw out the rat poison.

183
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,635
Apparently you did it multiple
times, over a course of days.

184
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Can't be too certain.

185
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,346
You must be Dr. Foreman.

186
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,433
Gotta get back to work. Okay.

187
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,892
Take it easy. Okay.

188
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,563
What? She reads my blog.

189
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,776
Personally, I don't think
you're condescending at all.

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,446
That's not what I wrote. When
you were taking my history,

191
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,448
I told you I went white-water
rafting six months ago,

192
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,658
and you said it was
"unlikely to be related."

193
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,160
I was just giving information.

194
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,661
Let's face it,
you got a little snarky.

195
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,466
You can't convey a tone
of voice in writing.

196
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,831
I just put what you said.

197
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,374
If you don't want people
to think you're condescending,

198
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,336
maybe you shouldn't say
condescending things.

199
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,047
Can this wait a second?
'Cause I have to pee.

200
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:22,097
I think people behave badly because there
are no records of what we say or do,

201
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,975
and nobody believes anymore
that God's watching.

202
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,518
Well, God's not, but I am.

203
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,272
Everything is on the record,
including everything I do.

204
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,151
I don't think my pee is
supposed to be mud-colored.

205
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,115
We were wrong
about the rat poison.

206
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,082
Coagulopathy plus
kidney equals what?

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,417
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.

208
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,211
Normal creatinine levels.

209
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,213
She has elevated cholesterol.

210
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,965
Hey, Wilson!
I can't find my pornos.

211
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,636
Have you tried
offering a reward?

212
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,889
Gaucher's Disease. It would affect
her ability to synthesize Vitamin K.

213
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,557
She's on a semi-
vegetarian diet.

214
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,142
Means she gets
plenty of Vitamin K.

215
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,061
Sjogrens is more likely.

216
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,063
I assume you moved them
while you were dusting.

217
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,400
I checked the drawers, window sill,
the DVD player in your room.

218
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,944
The quiet ones are
always deeply repressed.

219
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,071
I returned them to the store.

220
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,915
She had a fish dinner
a couple of nights ago.

221
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,075
Could be Haff Disease
causing rhabdo.

222
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,661
What? Why did you return
them to the store?

223
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,497
It's no trouble, I had to stop next
door for my dry cleaning anyway.

224
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,083
Sjogrens would inhibit the clotting
enzymes, infiltrate the kidneys,

225
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,668
explains everything.
So does Haff Disease.

226
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm not thanking you,
I'm asking you why.

227
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,840
Because if I did happen to
bring a woman home last night,

228
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,593
I wanted it to be
a porn-free zone.

229
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,517
You do realize things don't have to
be socks to go into a sock drawer.

230
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,186
I'm sorry.
Horribly, horribly sorry.

231
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,189
I thought you'd
watched them all.

232
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,777
You completely
ruined my morning.

233
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,904
I had to pull out your
old family photos.

234
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,991
Your mom was pretty hot.

235
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,788
Haff Disease fits
the timing best.

236
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,207
Start her on saline
and Mannitol.

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,594
You reading your
patient's blog?

238
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,803
No.

239
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,265
You should.
Could be some clues.

240
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,643
Too many. It'd be like
doing a whole body scan,

241
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,979
send us up eight blind alleys.

242
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,272
That's why Chase is doing it.

243
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,026
She mentions you.

244
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,235
She's never met me.

245
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,948
You're an unseen presence,
like the Wizard of Oz.

246
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,410
He was a fraud. She couldn't
have gone with Keyser Söze?

247
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,829
Speaking of movies
that don't make any sense,

248
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,916
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

249
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,502
I told the guy at the counter I was
so grateful that you'd returned them,

250
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,255
but I wanted them, and guess what?
You only returned two.

251
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,633
You lost the third.

252
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,929
Decent of you to pay for it, not
let them put it on my bill.

253
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,263
You know...

254
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,016
I can explain what happened.

255
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,184
I'm sure you could,

256
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,748
but rather than listen to your
lies, I thought it'd be more fun

257
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,439
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

258
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,901
You have it here?

259
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,959
Oh, God. Oh, God.

260
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,420
Okay, first, that's not me.

261
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,130
It's not... Mostly not...

262
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,136
I was in college! I don't... My
roommate was minoring in film.

263
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,222
Are you hyperventilating?

264
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,058
Remember that covering your
mouth and one nostril can help.

265
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,562
He had to get this in for some
grade, and he was desperate.

266
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,815
And the only reason I did it was
because no one would ever see it.

267
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,150
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

268
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,028
He's not a director,
he's an artist.

269
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:10,284
The way he plays with light
and darkness and boobs.

270
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,119
Look, that's not me.

271
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,997
What are you?
Where are you taking me?

272
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,707
Be not afraid.

273
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,501
The forest nymphs have taught
me how to please a woman.

274
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,839
That's not me! It's not me.
You can see it's not me!

275
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,679
He added extra scenes so he
could release it as a porno.

276
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,182
Be not afraid, Wilson. You
took risks for your art.

277
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,685
Oh, boy.

278
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:45,485
No one... Hey, look at me.
No one can know about this.

279
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,364
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

280
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,497
Sorry. It's okay.

281
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,749
Be not afraid.

282
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,881
Find anything?

283
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,636
Relevant? No.
Interesting? I guess.

284
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,847
There's nothing she doesn't share.
"Angry sex is overrated."

285
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,558
"How can he expect me to be aroused
when I'm so pissed at him?"

286
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,935
Revelations like that might
just earn her a new kidney.

287
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,146
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

288
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,607
the hospital got
a call from Singapore.

289
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,110
One of Frankie's readers asking
how hard it would be to donate.

290
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,407
How good-looking am I?

291
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,887
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me,

292
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,830
I'm looking for
an objective answer.

293
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,041
Oh, okay, then it's an
appropriate question.

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,211
Last night I acted like a
complete tosser to prove to House

295
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,088
that women don't go out
with me for my looks.

296
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,758
Cost me 100 bucks and my
definition of myself. And women.

297
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,094
So date men, they're
not shallow at all.

298
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,262
Everything's physical. Yes,

299
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,556
we are physical beings.
Some more than others.

300
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,017
Please don't define my entire
gender based on one night.

301
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,937
No. What if the patient's
problem is a physical reaction,

302
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
not an emotional one?

303
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,733
What if her lack of arousal had
nothing to do with their fight?

304
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,277
Sjogrens would inhibit
her normal secretions.

305
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,244
Sorry for keeping you up. I thought
it better not to wait till morning.

306
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,955
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm a night owl.

307
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:26,837
So you think I might have this Sjogrens
because of my lack of discharge?

308
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,631
Yes. It's lucky
you wrote about that.

309
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,634
And a little crazy, you're
thinking, to share that much.

310
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,180
Not crazy, unusual, to be so
intimate with people you don't know.

311
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,642
But I do know them. They read
my blog, I comment on theirs.

312
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,352
Just because you haven't
met someone physically

313
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,812
doesn't mean you
don't know them.

314
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,314
What about you?
Are you in a relationship?

315
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,817
It recently ended.

316
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,152
Oh, sorry.

317
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,821
Lie flat on your back,
all the way.

318
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,410
But you saw each other
every day, right?

319
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,454
How much did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

320
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,138
Or did you just end up talking about
where you were going to dinner

321
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,959
and who needed
to do the laundry?

322
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,836
Is that what your relationship
with Taylor is like?

323
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,963
No.

324
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,466
Well, maybe a little.

325
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,177
He's great, but sometimes

326
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,680
it's easier to open up to people
who aren't looking at you.

327
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,725
You need to lie flat
for us to get the x-ray.

328
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm actually not comfortable on my back.
Can't we do it this way?

329
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,646
Did you strain a muscle?

330
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,856
No.

331
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,109
What's wrong?

332
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,326
I've booked our patient
in for heart surgery.

333
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,662
I was doing a sialogram on her, and
she didn't want to lie on her back.

334
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,540
That's a complaint you hear from
people with heart valve issues.

335
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,751
It fits. Sjogrens
damaged her heart,

336
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,045
causing her clotting problems,
causing her kidneys to fail.

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,298
You based all that on the fact
that she didn't want to lie down?

338
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,969
That, and the cardiac echo I performed
after she didn't want to lie down.

339
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,765
Her mitral valve
is nearly gone,

340
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,558
which means she's nearly gone.

341
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,729
God, you're pretty.

342
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,489
So we can replace the mitral valve with
a pig valve or with a plastic one.

343
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,491
From an actual pig?

344
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,661
It's the better choice if you
want to have children someday.

345
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,330
The plastic valve requires
you to be on anticoagulants,

346
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,998
which are known
to cause birth defects.

347
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,918
On the other hand, the pig
valve wears out quickly,

348
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,171
so you'd need to have heart
surgery again in 10 years.

349
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,259
I know that you're on the fence about
having kids, but Taylor really wants them.

350
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,096
It's in the blog.

351
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:45,600
I'm afraid you two will need to agree
on that decision earlier than planned.

352
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,068
It's your call.

353
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,573
Can you pass me my laptop?

354
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,325
Seriously?
I want to get some feedback.

355
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,536
You really think that
asking strangers

356
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,956
for some off-the-top-of-their-head
response is gonna be helpful here?

357
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,000
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

358
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,877
They've got you two-thirds
of the way to vegan,

359
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,088
what are they gonna say about you buying
your life with the life of a pig?

360
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,048
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

361
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,258
It won't work out that way,

362
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,511
and we're the ones that are
gonna have to live with this.

363
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,973
Please, Frankie.
Don't tell them.

364
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,812
If I start picking and
choosing, I'm being dishonest.

365
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,939
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,956
Thanks.

367
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,183
Though I guess I should thank whoever
taught you how to please a woman.

368
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,482
Maybe it was the forest nymphs.

369
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,366
Get my Vertigo poster back.

370
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,830
Be not afraid,
it's exact change.

371
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,041
Okay.

372
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,214
Hello.

373
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,550
I'm looking to get
something on House.

374
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,971
Couldn't you just ask the
love-nymphs for the secret?

375
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,305
Don't.

376
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,977
My mission is to find something that
House would not like to see made public,

377
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,687
and make it public.

378
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,939
In.

379
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,692
But you know him better than
anyone, why do you need my help?

380
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,017
House would never leave anything
secret around the condo.

381
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,156
But you've worked in the same office
with him, on and off, for years.

382
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,327
Think back. Were there ever any odd
phone calls or visitors from the past?

383
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,830
He openly brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

384
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,000
and he gambles with bookies because
he's too lazy to go to the OTB,

385
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,876
and you're asking for...

386
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,215
What? What? What?

387
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,718
He's reading The Golden Bowl.

388
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,386
By Henry James?

389
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,598
Yeah. No, he's not
really reading it.

390
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,018
Okay. I don't understand.

391
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,061
That book's at least
400 pages long,

392
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,105
whatever he's reading
is only half that thick.

393
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,442
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

394
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,695
He's not using
his reading glasses.

395
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,363
That's a good point.

396
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,241
He took the cover off The Golden Bowl
and put it onto this other book,

397
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,618
so no one would know
what he was reading.

398
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,455
Whatever it is,
he's ashamed of it.

399
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,207
Huh.

400
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,967
I'm going with plastic.
It just makes more sense.

401
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,011
I don't want another
operation later.

402
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,138
That's not why
you're doing this.

403
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,614
Look, when you were first telling
me about why you love the Internet,

404
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,313
you said that no one
has to be alone again.

405
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,817
Whoever you are, whatever you love,
you can connect with someone.

406
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,361
If you want to recreate
the Boston Tea Party,

407
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,947
while dressed as
Imperial Stormtroopers,

408
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,992
you can find the 10 other people in the
world that have always wanted to do that.

409
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,952
That hasn't changed.

410
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,120
But you have.

411
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,957
This thing that you do, it's
not about connection anymore.

412
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,710
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

413
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,213
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

414
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,800
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

415
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,808
You're smart, you're fun
to read, it's okay.

416
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,228
But don't give them this.

417
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,860
Or if you do,
don't expect me to be here.

418
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,329
It's a good cover choice. It's not
like anyone would pick it up.

419
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,373
It's Cameron's favorite book.

420
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,916
I don't even know
what it's about.

421
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,043
Don't do that to yourself.

422
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,879
What the hell?

423
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:33,429
Giving him a computer is like
giving plutonium to Dr. No.

424
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,265
Got it.

425
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,939
Sermons for Everyday Life"?

426
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,239
These are literal sermons,
written by a minister.

427
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,409
"Loving thy neighbor even
when thy neighbor's stereo"

428
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,695
"is keeping you up at night."

429
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,828
Why would he read this?

430
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,246
Why would he hide it?

431
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,290
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran.

432
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,626
He says he likes to know what
mistakes people are making.

433
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,128
You think he's sincere?

434
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,255
You think that he's actually
getting something out of this?

435
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,882
I don't know.

436
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,259
What a hypocrite.

437
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,638
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

438
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,765
You know what?

439
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,270
Don't mention this to anyone.

440
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,440
So what was the point?

441
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,782
Are you going to be
here when I wake up?

442
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,625
I hate that you
don't have a blog,

443
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,510
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

444
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,923
Let's not get
into it right now.

445
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,008
We need to get you
through surgery.

446
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,221
I don't want to go in there knowing
you'll stick with me through surgery

447
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,431
'cause that's what
good guys do,

448
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,058
but once I'm better,
you'll be gone.

449
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,018
Let's not get into it now.

450
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,772
It hurts.

451
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,065
Is it her heart?

452
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,442
No, it's here. Here.

453
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,197
Get her inside.

454
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,583
Your appendix burst.
We had to remove it.

455
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:31,172
And the biopsy confirms it was full of
abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.

456
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,178
I have cancer?

457
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,180
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

458
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,433
So, I mean, I guess we do, what,
chemo and all that stuff?

459
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,687
Yes, but apparently you've
had this for some time.

460
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,356
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

461
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,192
Those cells went streaming
throughout your body.

462
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,195
So you're saying you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

463
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,864
That's why no valve.
It's pointless.

464
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,618
Our Dean of Medicine has approved
an experimental treatment.

465
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:05,456
We use your unique cancer cell signature
to create a targeted lymphoma vaccine.

466
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,209
Okay. So that'll cure me?

467
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,795
Well, we're not actually
sure what it'll do,

468
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,214
but the intention is to
train your immune system

469
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,217
to recognize and kill cells bearing
the same malignant signature,

470
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,136
while leaving
healthy cells alone.

471
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,473
But, as Dr. Foreman says,
it's experimental.

472
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,641
I see.

473
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,393
Without it, what kind of
time are we talking about?

474
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,353
An exact prognosis
is impossible.

475
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,732
How about a guess?
Something, please.

476
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,571
Based on people in situations
like yours, maybe a year.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,037
Baby, whatever we
have to do, we'll do.

478
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,874
I can take care of you.
I can work from home.

479
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,505
Sounds good. Thank you
for letting me know.

480
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,343
We'll start with the treatment
whenever it's ready.

481
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,769
Is she being a good soldier
or is she in denial?

482
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,188
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

483
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,775
Or it could be a symptom. Some
lymphomas affect cognition.

484
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,860
If it is denial, she
needs time to process.

485
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,739
If it's a symptom, hopefully treatment
with the vaccine will help.

486
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,286
Hey, Sandy.

487
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,583
Can I borrow your car?

488
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,464
She gave me the keys.

489
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,549
You're a doctor, she
was doing you a favor.

490
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,968
She barely knows me.

491
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,722
I've been deluding myself that I'm
actually connecting with people.

492
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:53,648
The first person I ever fell in love
with turned out to be a total tool.

493
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,818
He came across all funny and
charming and thoughtful,

494
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,152
but it was an act.

495
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,320
He saw something he wanted

496
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,656
and he knew he had to behave
a certain way to get it.

497
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:06,494
In retrospect, the fact that I was 17
and he was 30 should've been a clue.

498
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,914
Figuring out who
people are takes time.

499
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,668
And it takes twice as much time
if they're trying to impress you.

500
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,671
Now, I could take from this that
anyone who loans me their car

501
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
has an ulterior motive,

502
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,926
or I can accept that it's
just a nice thing to do,

503
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,846
and take people as they come.

504
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,351
You wanna do
the first injection?

505
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,287
Why are you reading a book
by a Unitarian minister?

506
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,789
Book club. Oprah was
going on and on...

507
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,209
I'm serious. This is messed up.

508
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,211
A patient wrote it. No.

509
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,548
You've never treated a patient
with this name, I looked it up.

510
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,802
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

511
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,095
No, it wasn't.

512
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,891
No one you respect would give you
this and expect it to be helpful.

513
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:10,975
It's a book!

514
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,435
Of sermons!

515
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,520
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

516
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,815
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

517
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,157
I know that you have
trouble, sometimes,

518
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,909
with the pain
without the Vicodin.

519
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,329
Is that it? Are you
so out of options

520
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,832
you're looking for answers in
what you consider irrationality?

521
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,709
I'm all right. Trust me.

522
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,839
Are you all right because
you're back on Vicodin?

523
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,092
I said trust me.

524
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,679
I know this means something.

525
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,557
You mind?
I haven't finished it yet.

526
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,369
Thanks for the gift.

527
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,913
Obviously differs from
my own personal beliefs,

528
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:18,292
but if these stories have helped you
through some spiritual turmoil...

529
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,420
Read chapter six,
entitled "Shut the hell up."

530
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,089
I appreciated the inscription

531
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,841
about the benefits of prayer
before medical treatments,

532
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,970
and I think it's great that you have
been called to witness by the Lord.

533
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,055
Chapter two, "Bite me."

534
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,310
Hi.

535
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,855
Thirteen's giving our patient
her third vaccine injection.

536
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,232
She's responding well so far.

537
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,484
How did you get all these copies?
It's out of print.

538
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,904
I called the author. He's got cartons
of the thing in his basement.

539
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,739
You called him?
What did you say?

540
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,659
That I knew some people who could
benefit spiritually from the book.

541
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,536
Did you mention me?

542
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,121
No, but...

543
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,917
Fever's at 104.

544
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,253
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

545
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,505
The vaccine is killing her.

546
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,053
Well, clearly it's not working.

547
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,805
You have to stop the vaccine.

548
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,474
Sure. Give up and let
her die on schedule.

549
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,643
It's better than speeding
up the schedule.

550
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,061
How quickly did this come on?

551
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,939
She was all right when I woke her this
afternoon for the second injection.

552
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,942
Of the stimulating agent, which
added to the first injection,

553
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,111
switched her immune reaction
into overdrive.

554
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,113
Why was she sleeping?

555
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,158
Who can sleep in a hospital,
during the daytime?

556
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,492
I'm not surprised she's tired.

557
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,036
She's always been a night owl.

558
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,560
Just by treating her, we've
completely disrupted her schedule.

559
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,291
Is that what her blog says?
She's a night owl?

560
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,417
No, she told me.

561
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,296
In what tense? Is? Was?
Will have been?

562
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,340
I'm not sure.

563
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,549
What are you onto?

564
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:51,093
Look at the time-stamp
on this post.

565
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,346
2:30 a.m. Here's
one at 4:00 a.m.

566
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,182
Whatever he's onto doesn't change
the fact that she has lymphoma

567
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,392
and we gave her a dangerous vaccine.
We need to...

568
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,520
Six months ago, she's
posting in the daytime.

569
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,816
Two years ago, daytime.
That's her natural rhythm.

570
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,443
Day-night reversal.

571
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,653
Sign of liver disease?

572
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,071
Which doesn't fit lymphoma.

573
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,739
But we know she has lymphoma.

574
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,534
We know she has the cell atypia
that indicates lymphoma.

575
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,245
Biopsy her liver.

576
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,546
That was pretty cool,
what I did, right?

577
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,756
You wanna make out?

578
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,429
You don't have lymphoma.

579
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,515
But you said my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

580
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,185
Your appendix was full of cells
that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

581
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,064
We now think they were a granulomatous
build-up from some unknown cause.

582
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,904
So I'm not dying?

583
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,786
You're actually dying
more quickly than we thought.

584
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,457
Unless we figure out what's
causing your liver failure.

585
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,132
You have three or four days.

586
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,310
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

587
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,940
Well, we're past denial.

588
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,669
Maybe we didn't
cause the fever.

589
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,141
We gave her the vaccine and her
fever spiked, seems to me...

590
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,644
Yes, but it persisted after
we took her off the vaccine.

591
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,855
What if it's a new symptom?

592
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,777
Okay, so we add
fever to cell atypia,

593
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,779
coagulopathy, kidney,
heart, liver...

594
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,623
- It has to be an infection.
- But which one?

595
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,033
No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't travelled anywhere.

596
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,452
There's nothing in the history she
gave us, nothing in her blog.

597
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
There has to be something
unique to this infection,

598
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,457
something about its transmission,
the way it manifests.

599
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,876
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

600
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:34,173
There isn't. She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

601
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,722
Start her on broad-
spectrum antibiotics.

602
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:47,353
Since we know everything, we might
as well treat for everything.

603
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:53,252
I picked up one of the copies of the
book that Chase left in the lounge.

604
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,504
If you're going to be this way,

605
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,229
I'm not going to invite
you to my baptism.

606
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,384
The first time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

607
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,888
The inside back flap, there's
a picture of the author.

608
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,308
Imagine how surprised I was
when I recognized him.

609
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,477
Your biological father
is a minister?

610
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,149
Natural selection
is not an infallible force.

611
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,653
I don't get it.

612
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,907
Okay, he was
a friend of the family,

613
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,909
you'd only known him
when you were a kid.

614
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,328
But if you wanted
to meet him now,

615
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,831
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

616
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,002
"Hi, it's Greg.
You slept with my mother."

617
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,546
You're capable of it.

618
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,132
I was mildly curious.

619
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,384
Enough to read a book, not
enough to make a phone call.

620
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,805
Please. You didn't read
this, you studied it. Why?

621
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,392
All your life you've
thought this was crap.

622
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,354
You can't suddenly turn around

623
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,732
and build a whole new
world-view based on crap.

624
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,193
Crap.

625
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,991
You better not be faking this just
to get out of a tough conversation.

626
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,706
Do you poop?

627
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,880
Come on. Everybody poops. I read
the book in medical school.

628
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,299
Sinkers or floaters?

629
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,550
This is the Wizard.

630
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,720
Greasy and soft,
or hard and pellet-like?

631
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:38,273
Floaters and the first one.

632
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,237
You just had to be so swoft.

633
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,074
You're a hypocrite,
no lies, no secrets,

634
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,742
but everything stops
at your colon.

635
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,787
Four thousand pages,
not one word about BMs.

636
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,288
And I bet yours
don't smell at all.

637
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,495
Nobody wants to hear about that stuff.
Readers don't.

638
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,835
People who don't really care about
you don't, but doctors might.

639
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,129
The icky stuff changed, right?
A few months ago.

640
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,463
Well, I became a vegetarian.

641
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,133
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

642
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,970
You take in less unusable material,
and your waste gets more efficient,

643
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,223
harder and rounder. Just look
at the feces of rabbits.

644
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,600
Seriously, I think I might have some.
Malabsorption.

645
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,061
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

646
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,522
A GI infection that
causes malabsorption,

647
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,315
granulamatous
build-up of cells.

648
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,735
It's not contagious, 'cause
no one around her got sick.

649
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,987
Whipple's Disease.

650
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,283
Let's split the credit.
Start her on cotrimoxazole.

651
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,661
We all need some secrets.

652
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,582
So long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

653
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,628
I'm...

654
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,841
I'm gonna be okay?

655
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,384
You'll still need
a new heart valve,

656
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:52,014
and you'll be on meds for a few years,
but basically, yeah, your odds are good.

657
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,823
Thank God.

658
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,206
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

659
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,138
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

660
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,516
Thank God you're an enabler.

661
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,399
Do you think people can
actually know each other better

662
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,110
on the Internet
than face-to-face?

663
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,570
Faces can be distracting,

664
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,074
but there's nothing better than
looking into someone's eyes

665
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,784
and everything
that goes with that.

666
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:58,664
I don't know. People meet, they
like something superficial,

667
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,389
and then they fill in the blanks
with whatever they want to believe.

668
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,960
Why are you so hung up on this?

669
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,630
I refuse to believe it's all because
you just noticed you have a nice face.

670
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,315
I mean, you just
came off a relationship,

671
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,760
you know things
go deeper than...

672
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,141
Is that what this is about?
You and Cameron?

673
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,728
I was the one that pursued her.

674
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,482
Maybe I was just filling
in the blanks, maybe...

675
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,694
Maybe her first
reaction was right.

676
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,155
We were just two people
who were in proximity

677
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,365
and found each other attractive,
and I never should have...

678
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,619
Paranoia. You felt something real.
So did she.

679
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,414
Don't try to take it back now.

680
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,585
Can I borrow your car?

681
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,087
No.

682
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,390
Why would it make more sense for
you to read your father's book

683
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,683
than to go talk with him?

684
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,603
Can you write a book, so I
can stop talking to you?

685
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,500
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis,

686
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,906
you didn't want to hug the guy.

687
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,367
You just wanted to know how his
head works, how he thinks.

688
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,995
Because I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

689
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,997
Because you're not
ordinary, House.

690
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,957
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

691
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,294
I'm your best friend, and half
the time I don't understand you.

692
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,631
You're alone, you've been
alone your whole life.

693
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,886
When you read that book you
were hoping that somewhere,

694
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,723
underneath all that talk of God,
there would be a way of thinking,

695
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,767
a mind that you
could recognize.

696
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,061
You wanted what we all want.

697
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,730
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

698
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,901
To look across the gulf and know
there's someone else like you.

699
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,822
At least tell me this, did
you find something there?

700
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,326
Underneath the God stuff,

701
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,662
more God stuff.

702
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,836
Get maintenance
to take that down.
