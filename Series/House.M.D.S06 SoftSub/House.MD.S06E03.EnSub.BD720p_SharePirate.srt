1
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,965
We will anger the Americans
slipping out like this.

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,010
If your son was a student

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,471
at one of the greatest
universities in the world...

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,640
So make him come to you.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,725
We are protected near the U N.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,185
But once we cross
42nd Street...

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,438
As always, I appreciate
your caution, Joseph.

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,608
But as always, you have
far too much of it.

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,882
Stay down, sir.

10
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,307
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

11
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,145
I'm just serving process!

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,397
Your boss is being sued
under Title 18

13
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,191
of the United States Code,
section 1350,

14
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:11,904
for genocide, crimes against
humanity, and torture.

15
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,371
Mr. President, this is
only a civil lawsuit.

16
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,039
We can ignore it.

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,631
Mr. President.

18
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,126
You want us
to work for Foreman?

19
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,795
Not permanently.

20
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,046
He is setting up interviews

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,422
to replace Taub and Thirteen,

22
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,965
but it might take
a couple of weeks.

23
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,468
Well, what happened to them?

24
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,553
He quit, and I had
to let her go.

25
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,514
You actually fired
your girlfriend?

26
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,681
Yes.

27
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,933
You two are both competent,

28
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,217
and I know I can work with you.

29
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,269
You really do know how to woo.

30
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,146
I need you.

31
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,606
It would be interesting.

32
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,816
And we could work together.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,651
Did you see who the patient is?

34
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,778
That's one of the reasons
it'll be interesting.

35
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,697
Dibala is one of the most
repressive dictators in the world.

36
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,825
You had no problem treating
a guy on death row.

37
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,660
Who was still in prison
after we patched him up.

38
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,078
We fix Dibala,
he gets on a plane

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,454
and executes half his country.

40
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,748
He's been repressing an ethnic
rebellion in the south,

41
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,917
the Sitibi people.

42
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,794
It's getting worse.

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,296
Dibala is a guest
of the US government,

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,549
and he's been invited
to speak at the U N.

45
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,092
I'm not asking you to love him,

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,469
I'm asking you to do your job.

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,432
Utterly incomprehensible.

48
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,644
And, of course, I'm talking about
you firing your girlfriend.

49
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,728
We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

50
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,690
This'll help. Cameron
and I worked together.

51
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,941
But you weren't her boss,

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,693
and you stopped
working together.

53
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,528
Why don't you just tell her
you were wrong and...

54
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,321
Because I wasn't.

55
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,948
I know how this looks.

56
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,825
I know it might break us up.

57
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,618
But that's better than
definitely breaking us up,

58
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,496
which is what would've
happened otherwise.

59
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,292
Hemorrhagic
ulcers in the lungs.

60
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,965
Oh, my God,
it's three years ago.

61
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,676
Does that mean I'm still crazy?

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,719
You're back?

63
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,178
You look good.

64
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,139
We're just helping out because...
I know.

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,557
I just ran into Thirteen

66
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,559
while she was
clearing out her locker.

67
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,977
My condolences.

68
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,187
Although it's not like she's the
hottest woman in the world.

69
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,190
We haven't broken up.
Are you back?

70
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,109
Sort of. You get
your license back?

71
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,527
Not for a month or so.

72
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,239
So you'll be in charge, I'm
just gonna pitch in a little.

73
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,201
Dibala thinks it was
an assassination attempt.

74
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,078
Polonium, like the
Russian guy in London.

75
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,498
FBI checked the service of process
forms and his hotel room.

76
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,208
No radioactivity trails.

77
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,376
Acid reflux?

78
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,587
No history of
asthma or heartburn.

79
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,088
He has a bug bite on his hands.

80
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,340
Malaria's endemic
in his country.

81
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,050
Let's start him on Coartem.

82
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,475
I don't want to step
on any toes,

83
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,769
but I guess I do have a
higher duty to the patient.

84
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,437
If you have something
to say, say it.

85
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,897
You're rushing to a diagnosis

86
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,065
because you're
rushing out of this room

87
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,691
because you're
rightly upset with me.

88
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,027
Although I wasn't the one who
made that asinine decision to...

89
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,655
Do you have anything
medical to say?

90
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,616
Poison fits better
because of the vomiting.

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,284
Bug bite might not be a bite,

92
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,953
it might be
the start of chloracne.

93
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,872
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

94
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,375
It's hard to detect. Fits.

95
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,882
Start him on olestra.

96
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,304
You couldn't have just
said dioxin up front?

97
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,182
I was hoping you'd
get there on your own.

98
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,688
So, I guess we
should talk to Cuddy.

99
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,401
You are sure it is dioxin?

100
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,320
Nope.

101
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,783
It's our best guess. The olestra
here binds to the poison,

102
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,493
flushes it out of your system.

103
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,786
Where are you from, doctor?

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,246
I'm Australian.

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,331
Do I hear a bit of British?

106
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,166
Most people don't notice it.

107
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,210
Yeah, I kicked
around there for a while.

108
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,087
You went to
medical school there?

109
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,922
Actually, a year of seminary.

110
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,258
And you left. Uh-huh.

111
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,471
There was a Catholic mission
near my childhood village.

112
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:51,225
I liked the priests.
They were good people.

113
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,688
But when my two younger sisters
were dying from consumption,

114
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,232
it wasn't more priests
we wanted.

115
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,825
I fired my girlfriend because
he said he was gone for good.

116
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,494
I need this in my life.

117
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,538
A week ago, it was the
last thing you needed.

118
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,623
It's a process. I'm learning.

119
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,125
And screwing me over as you go.

120
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,461
Yeah, that's why I did it.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,255
Sorry.

122
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,507
If you want, I'll
explain it to Thirteen.

123
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,677
He's not ready.
He doesn't have his license.

124
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:31,557
Then he can't practice. But we'd
be idiots not to listen to him.

125
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,643
You're in charge. He sits in
on all the differentials.

126
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,730
Until you get your license
back, this is all unofficial.

127
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,232
No procedures,
no patient contact.

128
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,153
I think I can probably deal
with that last one.

129
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,744
The only reason I let you go

130
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,496
is because our relationship
wouldn't work

131
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,623
if I was in charge.

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,919
But I won't be in charge soon

133
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,587
so I came to offer
your old job back.

134
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:08,135
I know I look bad, but
circumstances have changed.

135
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,386
I don't want the job.

136
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,471
Why not?

137
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,016
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

138
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,142
You wanted to break up with me,

139
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,394
but you were too weak
to do it yourself.

140
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,314
Then why would I try
to hire you back?

141
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,359
Can we please get
some dinner tonight?

142
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,658
Uh...

144
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,160
You're a follow-up?

145
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,538
You must not treat him.

146
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,168
Dibala killed my wife.

147
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,797
She was a trade unionist.

148
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,969
They took her from our
home while I was at work.

149
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,053
Who took her?

150
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,472
Dibala's Youth Labor League.

151
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,225
He pretends it's to get young
people off the street,

152
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,854
but he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

153
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,940
and feeds them
drugs and alcohol

154
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,692
and teaches them
how to torture.

155
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,489
They dumped her body in
my yard two weeks later.

156
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,949
They raped her.

157
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,953
They carved "inyenzi",
cockroach,

158
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,998
onto her stomach
because she's Sitibi.

159
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,792
I'm very sorry, but I can't
discuss other patients.

160
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,378
You should talk to a
lawyer, talk to the U N...

161
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,673
So they can sit and watch
like they did in Rwanda?

162
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,677
There are two million Sitibi.

163
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,305
He is planning to
massacre them all.

164
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,016
His radio stations
are talking about

165
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,810
a final war to
exterminate the cockroaches.

166
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,566
He can't recover.

167
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,946
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,952
How was your
first day of school?

169
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,206
Didn't pee once in the sandbox.

170
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,498
How was it with Cuddy?

171
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,709
What did you think
I was talking about?

172
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,835
Hmm.

173
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,048
You didn't use garlic. You
didn't use it last night either.

174
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,842
We always use garlic
on Chicken Florentine.

175
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,093
It tastes fine this way.

176
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,887
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

177
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,682
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

178
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,227
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

179
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,896
No, it's the...

180
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,484
Are you inventing some big
medical mystery here?

181
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,986
Because if you're
imagining things again...

182
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,239
You weren't wearing shoes
last night either.

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,037
Yes, shoes, garlic,
I am vampire, Sookie.

184
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,924
I told you to get
that echo fixed.

185
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,718
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

186
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,805
started complaining about the extra
noise and the cooking smells.

187
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,973
What's his name?

188
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,058
I don't want you
making things worse.

189
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,226
He's on the condo board,

190
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,190
and I'm trying to get
the back garden renovated.

191
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,771
The white coats
taught me a whole bunch

192
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,524
of fun coping
and relating skills.

193
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,817
He's not only a total jerk,

194
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,862
he's a decorated war hero
who lost an arm in Vietnam.

195
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,782
I mean, there's no
winning with this guy.

196
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,785
Coping skill number one,
complete avoidance.

197
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,996
You happy?

198
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,542
Booty call? Give me 20
minutes to not shower.

199
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,793
Patient's having
a heart attack.

200
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,836
Mask and 15 liters.

201
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
Just thought
you'd like to know.

202
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,465
Streptokinase. Heparin.

203
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,391
Lassa fever.

204
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,477
You were mad that
I withheld it last time,

205
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,980
so I'm saying it
right up front.

206
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,400
He's already stabilized,
so 40ccs of ribavirin,

207
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,985
and we're home
in time for Ellen.

208
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,821
I checked. There's no Lassa
in Dibala's country.

209
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,489
Oh. The rash is gone.

210
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,533
It rules out
your dioxin theory.

211
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,743
He's running a slight fever,

212
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,078
which we can add to the
heart, plus the lung ulcers.

213
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,371
Ebola? Marburg?

214
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,914
Too long
an incubation period and...

215
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,207
Yes?

216
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,336
Don't people sometimes travel
to places that have, you know,

217
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,339
a fever that originated in
the Nigerian town of Lassa?

218
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,883
He's been to three other
countries in the last two years.

219
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,428
Here, Zimbabwe and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.
No Lassa there either.

220
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,764
Oh. Again.

221
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,098
Trypanosomiasis?

222
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,352
No sleep disturbances, but it
fits best with his symptoms

223
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,562
and it's geographically
the most... What?

224
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,148
The Egypt visit was for the
African Union meeting,

225
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,234
where I'm guessing he was
"meeting" people from "Africa",

226
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,652
which includes Liberia,

227
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,446
which sent some members
of their foreign ministry

228
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,741
which has itself just been hit
by an outbreak of jock itch.

229
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,286
No, wait, not jock itch.
Lassa fever.

230
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,707
I'll start the ribavirin.

231
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,377
I did say it up front.

232
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,505
It's great to have the old
team back together again, huh?

233
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,470
Yesterday, it's poisoning,

234
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,846
today, Lassa fever.

235
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,014
Maybe a specialist...

236
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,142
Joseph, leave him alone.

237
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,813
These people know
what they are doing.

238
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,316
Are you married, doctor?

239
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,484
No.

240
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,902
You have a girlfriend?

241
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,571
Yes.

242
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,491
Judging by your
tentative answer

243
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,994
and the complicated
expression on her face,

244
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,373
I believe that is she
standing in the hallway.

245
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,340
I got a call from Douglas'
department at Princeton General.

246
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,592
They want me to
interview with them.

247
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,518
Which is weird because
when I called last week,

248
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,846
they said they had
nothing available,

249
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,598
so I never sent in my resume.

250
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,517
Douglas owes me a favor.

251
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,060
Most people send chocolates.

252
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,826
And I'd stand outside your apartment
all night holding up a boom box

253
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,524
except you told me
you hate '80s music.

254
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,450
So about dinner,
I'm free tomorrow night.

255
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,352
I was wondering what that noise was.
It's the damn cane.

256
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,562
And I'm Greg.

257
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,356
And I can't sleep with you
banging around with that thing.

258
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,944
You're not actually saying
that I have too loud a cane?

259
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,572
Is that hard for you
to understand?

260
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,536
Well, only in the sense
that it has a rubber tip

261
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,034
on the end, not a tap shoe.

262
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,661
Now you're
getting cute with me.

263
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,500
Okay, we started badly.
I apologize for the noise

264
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,585
and we will try to figure
out a way to be quieter.

265
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,213
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

266
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,925
Now you keep it down or we're
going to have trouble.

267
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,806
Wow.

268
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,229
You paged me?

269
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:20,567
This is Ama. She is from our
country, but she lives here now.

270
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,444
We'd like you to use her blood.

271
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,737
For what?

272
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:28,116
She recovered from Lassa
fever two years ago.

273
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,993
Our Health Minister
has advised us

274
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,539
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

275
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,666
is much more effective
than ribavirin.

276
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,293
This is a signed consent form.

277
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,004
Will you take
her blood, please?

278
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,175
No.

279
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,261
I want to do this.

280
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,180
You understand that we
will be using your blood

281
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,140
to cure President Dibala.

282
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,725
I know.

283
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,477
Are you from the Sitibi people?

284
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,728
I am Sitibi.

285
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,021
Did they threaten you
in some way?

286
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,306
Your family members back home?

287
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,484
Please let me
give the blood. Please.

288
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,030
Do it.

289
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,407
She's being coerced.

290
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,284
If she is,

291
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,369
I'd rather have a needle
prick on my conscience

292
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,997
than the death of
her family members.

293
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,610
Hey! Don't let him in there!

294
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,496
That's enough, we got him.

295
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,706
Hey.

296
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,085
You all right?

297
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,962
Who is that man?

298
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,262
He shot him?

299
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,388
No.

300
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,105
You need a lawyer.

301
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,940
You can get a court-appointed.

302
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,150
I can help you.

303
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,319
I can't be helped.

304
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,739
You did a stupid,
terrible thing.

305
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,868
But given the circumstances
with your wife,

306
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,745
you could get
a reduced sentence.

307
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,582
She wasn't my wife.

308
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,003
Well, who was she?

309
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,756
They never told us her name.

310
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,099
What his men made us do
to that woman,

311
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:04,940
he is now going to do
to all the Sitibi.

312
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,398
You could have gotten killed.

313
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,485
He wasn't going to hurt me.

314
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,781
He fired a gun in the hospital.

315
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,742
Come here.

316
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,459
Maybe next time, don't
yell out that warning.

317
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,008
The bloody eye was from an enlarged
lymph node blocking the retinal vein.

318
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,468
We restored circulation,

319
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,220
but it means we've got
to add lymph involvement

320
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,140
to the heart and lungs,
and rising fever.

321
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,393
I'm just going to
sit here quietly.

322
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,061
Why?

323
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,897
I feel like I've been inadvertently
undermining your authority.

324
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,359
So I'm just gonna observe.
I'm not gonna say a word.

325
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,864
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

326
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:05,250
I'm thinking the X-rays indicate
a lack of hilar adenopathy,

327
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,710
which rules it out.

328
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,213
Staph aureus?

329
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,215
No.

330
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:19,264
Because he smokes?

331
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,809
He's miming a thermometer.

332
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,520
He says the fever's
not high enough.

333
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,606
So some other infection.

334
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,774
He's wrong.

335
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,318
The fever could be misleading
us into thinking infection.

336
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,654
Talk.

337
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,369
It could all fit with lymphoma.

338
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,378
I need you to spread your
legs so I can do an "H".

339
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,800
Can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.

340
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,044
He's got good liver function,

341
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,220
it's masking
the elevated levels.

342
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,847
Biopsy the lymph node.
Check it out.

343
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,186
Makes sense.
Guess you don't need me.

344
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,817
Oh. By the way, you might
want to close the blinds.

345
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,402
It's really bright in here.

346
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,788
It's just a wild coincidence

347
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,498
that he thought
you were a rude jerk.

348
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,916
Come on, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,876
You said he's a jerk.
I barely talked.

350
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,336
You talked!

351
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,424
All I wanted was to
sip morning espresso

352
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,343
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

353
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,179
You could be
sipping Courvoisier

354
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,348
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

355
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,225
if you tell him
what you got on him.

356
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,018
I don't have anything on him.

357
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,270
I don't want anything on him.

358
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,730
Closest he's been to Vietnam,

359
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:54,025
ordering the Mee Krob
at that place on the corner.

360
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,485
Mee Krob is from Thailand.

361
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,611
Exactly.

362
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,947
What did you do? Why do
you think he's faking?

363
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,198
I saw his mail.

364
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,366
You broke in?

365
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,580
No. He was holding it. Private
medical insurance, not from the VA.

366
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,791
Plus he's gotta be early 50s.

367
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,085
He's too young to be a vet.
So, I looked further.

368
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,169
You did break in.

369
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,337
Online.

370
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,257
There's no reference to him
in any of the vet records.

371
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,717
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

372
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,052
Well, just look
how you're acting.

373
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,139
People have been tiptoeing
around this jerk for years.

374
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,850
Normally, we'd all tell the
amputee to go screw himself.

375
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,895
Victims get pity. Heroes get adulation.
It's way better.

376
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,063
Thank you for trying to help
me out with my neighbor.

377
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,398
Now forget the Vietnam stuff.

378
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
I could prove this.

379
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,401
But you won't because
you'll be too busy

380
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,986
writing him a letter of apology

381
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,406
and dropping it at his door,
without knocking at his door.

382
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,034
I didn't do anything.
That guy's a total ass.

383
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,329
Which is the point. It's easy
to be nice to people you like,

384
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,416
but being nice to people you
hate, that's a skill. Do it.

385
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,882
Thank you for saving my life.

386
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,760
The man that tried to kill you,

387
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,179
he said that you were
preparing a massacre.

388
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,311
The Sitibi are my countrymen.

389
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,522
I am fighting a guerrilla war.

390
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,108
In a way that's
being called genocide.

391
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:23,365
Twenty years ago, these same
Sitibi rebels took over the south.

392
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,867
They massacred
tens of thousands,

393
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,702
and they would
happily do it again.

394
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,705
I'm trying to impose order.

395
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:35,919
I'm trying to prevent
a genocide. Genocide.

396
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:43,134
My own son, my youngest,
he is a student here.

397
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,928
He hasn't spoken to me in years

398
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,806
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

399
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,976
But what he read is not true.

400
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,561
What about your
Youth Labor League?

401
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,278
There, I was at fault.

402
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,576
I hired men who, in their
zeal, stepped over the line,

403
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,622
and there were abuses.

404
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,584
But that will not happen again.

405
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,632
Hello?

406
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,625
How's it going?

407
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,627
Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,587
How's it going with you?

409
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,792
It worried me when you joked

410
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,198
about letting that man
shoot Dibala.

411
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,925
I wasn't joking.

412
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,886
You can't want to kill anyone,

413
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
especially not
your own patient.

414
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,597
It's only natural to feel...

415
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,265
No, it's completely unnatural.

416
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,934
Only psychopaths
can kill other people

417
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,560
without having some
sort of breakdown.

418
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,437
Not when it's justified.
Look at soldiers.

419
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,940
Even when it's justified.

420
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,609
Am I trying to kill our patient?
Of course not.

421
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,277
But if he died, am I
supposed to just pretend

422
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,114
that wouldn't be good
for the world?

423
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,785
The cells are neatly differentiated.
This isn't lymphoma.

424
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,250
I thought I had detected the
sickly sweet smell of maple syrup

425
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,709
and socialized medicine.

426
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,880
It smells like victory.

427
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,386
That big flag in your place prompted
me to chat with your housekeeper.

428
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,180
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

429
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,640
You broke into my apartment?

430
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,060
Technically, no.
Well, technically, yeah,

431
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,645
but two steps, hardly...

432
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,771
You're going to jail.

433
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,648
Speaking of, you know
what can get you

434
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,651
six months and a $100,000 fine?

435
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,155
Falsely claiming that you
won a medal in Vietnam.

436
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,322
You think I'm faking?

437
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,076
Canada did not send troops to
fight in Vietnam, you idiot.

438
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:01,499
They sent troops to reinforce
the '73 Peace Accords,

439
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,711
which is where I tried to
free a 12-year-old boy

440
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,713
who stepped on a land mine.

441
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,465
Thirty-six years later, every
second I feel pain in my hand

442
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,176
like I'm still grabbing
that boy's arm

443
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,845
even though my arm isn't there.

444
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,764
So, no, I'm not faking.

445
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,518
Oh.

446
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,900
On a related note,
go Maple Leafs.

447
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,369
Did you get the biopsy results?

448
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,621
Is it lymphoma?

449
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,747
No.

450
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,707
So we have to move on.

451
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,667
Infection,
perhaps autoimmune...

452
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,795
Did you get the biopsy results?

453
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,756
Yes, I just told you.

454
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,466
Is it lymphoma?

455
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,555
Cameron and Chase?

456
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,432
They both really
like diagnostics,

457
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,186
and I think they both really
like watching House torture me.

458
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,606
Anyway, thank you for
understanding about the job.

459
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,986
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

460
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,281
There was a third.

461
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,574
What's that?

462
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,494
You could have stepped aside.

463
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,080
We both would
have lost our jobs.

464
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,249
You could have asked Cameron
or Chase to take your place.

465
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,541
They wouldn't have wanted to.

466
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,753
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

467
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
You want to go back in time?

468
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,591
I want to make this work.

469
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,680
I want to understand you. I mean,
you know how you made me feel.

470
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,600
If you could do it again...

471
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,521
I made the right decision.

472
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,954
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

473
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,873
Is the President capable
of thinking clearly?

474
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,668
Obviously not right now.

475
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,838
Will he ever be?

476
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,049
I think...

477
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,804
Neurons don't grow back, and
he's already in his decline.

478
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,224
Anything he tells you, any command
he gives, how will you ever know

479
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,270
it's not just the delusions of
a sick, mad, dying, old man?

480
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,992
He just started
spiking a fever.

481
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,538
It's scleroderma.

482
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,959
You don't have some clever
way of telling me this time?

483
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,587
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

484
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,506
Look at his skin. It's
tight for a 75-year-old.

485
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,801
Based on his admission photo?
Bit subjective.

486
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,386
Fever points to infection.

487
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,972
And now he's got nodules on his fingers.
That's blastomycosis.

488
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:06,768
Nodules? You're calling
tight skin subjective?

489
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm with Foreman.

490
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,604
We would have seen fungus
balls on the head CT.

491
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,105
Fungal lesions can be missed.

492
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,231
We could
settle this with a test.

493
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,484
Anticentromere antibodies
would point to scleroderma.

494
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,162
Point to, not prove. And
his fever's too high.

495
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,779
We have to treat him now.

496
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,282
If we treat wrong, we could send
this disease into overdrive.

497
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,867
You're with me on
the scleroderma?

498
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,911
I guess. I just don't care
enough about the patient

499
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,621
to waste my time trying to
convince anyone. We get it.

500
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,831
You don't like the guy, you don't
want to work on this case.

501
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,249
And yet you're still here.

502
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,415
Why don't you take a stand?

503
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,211
Either do something
about it or shut up.

504
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,713
Treat him for blasto
if you want.

505
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,800
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her to...

506
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,385
This isn't a democracy.

507
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,886
I don't care who you get.

508
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,680
At least for right now,
this is my department.

509
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,965
We're treating him for blasto.

510
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,476
Start him on amphotericin B.

511
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,696
Inject my IV
with an air bubble.

512
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,864
What are you doing?

513
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,408
I will have
another heart attack.

514
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
No one will know.

515
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,827
Let her go.

516
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,665
You tell my colonel I'm a sick,
dying old man who can't be trusted.

517
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,749
I didn't say...

518
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,709
You were trying to
put a gun in his hand

519
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:17,547
and point it at my head.
The gun is now in your hand.

520
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,050
That is a practical
difference, not a moral one.

521
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,928
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

522
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,974
It is not so easy when you
have to do it yourself.

523
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,948
Allison.

524
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,378
I guess I didn't want you dead.

525
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,470
If you touch my wife again,

526
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,263
I'll kick your ass
out onto the street.

527
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,556
I don't care who you are.

528
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,852
I did her a favor. I showed
her her true character.

529
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,313
She's a better person
than you are.

530
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,065
She is too weak to
act on her beliefs.

531
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,236
But that is not her fault.
Almost everyone is.

532
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,740
Even my own advisers,
my own colonel.

533
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:32,788
All they do is negotiate and
debate and sign treaties.

534
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,499
They are appeasers.

535
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,170
All the while, we are beset by
assassins and traitors, the scum...

536
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,755
Cockroaches?

537
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,635
What are you gonna
do about them?

538
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,720
What is an enemy to you?

539
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:52,767
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

540
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:58,356
In my world, there are dangers
and bloodshed and death,

541
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,528
and that makes you a man.
And men make choices.

542
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,241
And your choice is to send bands
of drunk, crazed children

543
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,076
to massacre an entire people?

544
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,995
Don't ask me questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

545
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,208
I saved your life. I deserve to
know what you're planning to do.

546
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,795
Whatever it takes to
protect my country.

547
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,724
You broke into his apartment?

548
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,560
I didn't break in.

549
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,896
I wish I believed you.

550
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,565
I can fix this.

551
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,275
I already did.

552
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,736
He was gonna press charges,

553
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,447
but I promised him you'd leave.

554
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,994
You're kicking me out?

555
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,079
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist,

556
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,833
but, yeah, you gotta
go somewhere else.

557
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,421
House, I know
when things go wrong,

558
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,715
usually you just double down
and get more involved.

559
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,093
But here, you could go to jail.

560
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,887
And I truly believe

561
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,432
that you've changed enough to
know this is the right thing.

562
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,940
We need a blood sample.

563
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,610
We gotta do the
anticentromere antibody test.

564
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,446
It'll show House is right.
It's scleroderma.

565
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,656
Why are you doing this now?

566
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,701
Because I didn't
want to kill him.

567
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,954
And you're right.
I have to take a side.

568
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,750
So I'm gonna do what I
can to keep him alive.

569
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,253
I'll get you the blood.

570
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,507
Positive for
anticentromere antibodies.

571
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,051
We gotta get him
off the anti-fungals

572
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,552
and onto steroids immediately.

573
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,970
I told you before.

574
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,556
This only points to scleroderma.
It doesn't prove it.

575
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,183
You're just gonna
ignore the test?

576
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,352
Blasto still fits best.

577
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,020
I know it's not conclusive,
but when you put it

578
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,146
with all the other evidence...

579
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,565
I've made my decision.

580
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,616
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

581
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,369
What does that have
to do with anything?

582
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,871
I've worked with you long enough
to know you're reasonable.

583
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,083
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

584
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,210
But there's some
deep part of you

585
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,544
that when you find
you're wrong about

586
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,381
the most important
decisions you've made,

587
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,217
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

588
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,511
If you wanna mess up your
relationship that's your right,

589
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,222
but you mess this up,
our patient dies.

590
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,271
Switch him to steroids.

591
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,783
Hi, honey.

592
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,162
How was your day?

593
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,335
Morning.

594
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,506
First of all, my bad.

595
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,435
I've gone through this
whole thing recently.

596
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:15,594
I don't want to bore you.

597
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,515
Short version, I'm really trying
to do work on some stuff.

598
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,601
This is a definite setback.

599
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,398
Although, in fairness, you
really did make it tough.

600
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,402
Phantom pain in
your missing arm,

601
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:36,365
the five different kinds of
painkiller in your medicine cabinet,

602
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,370
that's what this magic box of
neurological trickery is for.

603
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,668
This'll be a lot easier if you do what
the crazy guy who tied you up says.

604
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,093
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in there.

605
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,890
Now look.

606
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,267
Mirror magic.

607
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,519
Your arm is back.

608
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,440
Now clench both your
fists at the same time.

609
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,067
Clench. Real hard.

610
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,034
If you believe in God,

611
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,537
pray that this is gonna work.

612
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,626
You might also want to ask him
why he blew off your arm.

613
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,544
Ready?

614
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,547
Now let go.

615
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,812
Oh, my God.

616
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,314
You relaxed it.

617
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,860
For 36 years I've been in
pain, and it's finally gone.

618
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,029
Oh, my God.

619
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,913
Thank you.

620
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,750
O2 sat's down to 88.

621
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,337
Going through the main stem
bronchus into the right upper lobe.

622
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,005
Get them out of here! No!

623
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,090
It's okay.

624
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,466
Bleeder.

625
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,926
Cauterizing.

626
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,887
Got it? Yeah.

627
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,019
Get the paddles.

628
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,145
I'm going back in.

629
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,230
What is happening?

630
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,982
He's bleeding into his lungs.
Charging.

631
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,859
Another bleeder. I can get it.

632
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,278
Hold on. There's a third.

633
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,282
God, there's a dozen.

634
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,534
Shock him.

635
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,785
Clear.

636
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,832
Charging. Clear.

637
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,135
You want to curl up and cry,

638
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,554
the lounge chair's
a little more comfy.

639
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,431
I switched his meds.

640
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,226
I thought I was wrong, so I
took him off the antifungals,

641
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,604
put him on steroids
like you said.

642
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,981
You know what that means.

643
00:37:56,066 --> 00:38:00,361
I was too late or I was
right in the first place.

644
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,450
So, either you killed him

645
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,328
by not having confidence
in your opinion

646
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,124
or you killed him by being too
attached to your opinion.

647
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,169
If you're anything like me,
and by the way, you are,

648
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,838
you need to know which.

649
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,508
He's under lock and key
in the morgue.

650
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,552
His government wants their own
doctors to do the autopsy.

651
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,472
They're taking his body
out tomorrow.

652
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,724
There's a reason I hired you.

653
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,021
You used to know what to
do with a locked door.

654
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,741
I went down to the morgue
to rerun the antibodies test.

655
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,159
You ran it twice.

656
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,495
Turns out, I couldn't get in.

657
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
They had an armed guard.

658
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,374
But I saw this.

659
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,089
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

660
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,176
Your signature,
9:45 this morning.

661
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,262
That's right before
you guys ran the test.

662
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,141
What were you doing there?

663
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,018
Follow-up on a clinic case.

664
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,352
What case?

665
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,478
You think this is
really important?

666
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,980
One of the patients
in the morgue

667
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,941
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

668
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,529
You and Cameron, if you
took that woman's blood,

669
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,448
you could have
messed up the test results

670
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,784
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

671
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,539
Cameron had nothing
to do with it.

672
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,249
You son of a bitch!

673
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,835
He was going to
kill the Sitibi,

674
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,171
every last one of them.

675
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,381
I don't care what
he was gonna do.

676
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,634
He came to us and put
his life in our hands.

677
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,803
All the good we've done,

678
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:55,184
every life we've saved,
it would have meant nothing

679
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:59,063
if we just sent him off to kill
hundreds of thousands of people.

680
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,731
Look at the news.

681
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,108
The moderates are taking over.

682
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,527
There's hope for peace talks.

683
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,782
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

684
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:14,578
Dibala becomes a martyr.
The massacres begin.

685
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,956
I cover this up,
I become your accomplice.

686
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,668
You think you can
guilt me into that?

687
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,676
If the cops are
going to come for me,

688
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,678
please warn me

689
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,349
so that I can
tell my wife first.

690
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,526
Chase,

691
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,071
you really think you can
kill another human being

692
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,740
without any consequences
to yourself?

693
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,455
No.

694
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,966
My neighbor called.

695
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,885
He sounded happy.

696
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,305
That's nice.

697
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,976
Even nicer, he's approving
the garden expansion.

698
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,394
Huh.

699
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,063
And even more nicer,

700
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,566
he's not going
to press charges,

701
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,359
even if you don't move out.

702
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,696
What did you do to him?

703
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,906
I was nice.

704
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,245
You really want to know?

705
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:44,543
I think I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

706
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,257
Alligators' main
prey is smaller animals

707
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,051
that they can kill and
eat with a single bite.

708
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,636
Oh!

709
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,430
Oh!
