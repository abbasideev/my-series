1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,444
How about the name Brooke?

2
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,863
She just doesn't
seem like a Brooke anymore.

3
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,573
Brooklyn?

4
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,242
She's a baby, not a city.

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,871
What do you think, bud?
Got any suggestions?

6
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,208
Toadette. I'm hungry.

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,836
I'll get you guys
something to eat.

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,131
You're okay.

9
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,635
Okay.

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,478
I was paged?

11
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,406
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,910
Can we talk somewhere?

13
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,746
I was thinking...

14
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,430
Sarah?

15
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,517
Yeah.

16
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,685
Where's the baby?

17
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,863
No one saw anyone go in or out,

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,448
and the baby's
not in the nursery.

19
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,283
What was her condition?
Five weeks pre-term.

20
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,035
C-section because
of mom's preeclampsia.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,286
Is that the father?

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,956
Mr. Lozinski, I'm Dr. Lisa
Cuddy, Dean of Medicine.

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,750
How long were you
out of the room?

24
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,128
Fifteen, 20 minutes, tops.

25
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,334
Was there a proximity alarm?

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,464
No alarms.

27
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,632
What's that?

28
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,552
The bracelet on your baby's ankle has
a microchip that would set off alarms

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,262
if she were carried
through an exit.

30
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,308
Call the police, shut down all the exits.
We're on lockdown.

31
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,061
Nobody moves until
we find that baby.

32
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,265
Why won't you
sign the divorce papers?

33
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,600
It's been on my
to-do list, sorry.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,522
Will you sign them?

35
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,860
Not until we have a real
conversation about our marriage.

36
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,445
Okay, I made a mistake coming here.
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,282
I'm gonna leave this copy here.

38
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,711
Code Seven. Code Seven.

39
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,880
All non-essential
personnel and guests,

40
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,132
please remain where you are.

41
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,885
Security personnel should
report to their staging areas

42
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,178
and await further instructions.

43
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,723
All patients, please
remain in your rooms

44
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,809
and use call buttons if you
need medical assistance.

45
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,646
Please remain calm and wait for
hospital personnel to come to you.

46
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,150
Do not try to leave your
room until the Code Seven...

47
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,235
It's clear all the way down.
Nurse, just leave it.

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,403
But it's... Leave it.

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,571
You need to get
into the room now.

50
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,781
Please notify hospital personnel
or police immediately

51
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,575
if you see anything suspicious.

52
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,495
We cannot allow anyone to leave
the hospital at this time.

53
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,332
All personnel should remain
in their staging areas

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,977
unless otherwise
instructed by security.

55
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gotta clear the...

56
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,467
Thank you for your
patience and cooperation.

57
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,683
And did anyone other than your nurses
ever come by asking about your daughter?

58
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,936
No. No, just those two.

59
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll check in soon.

60
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,722
Wait. Hon, what are you doing?

61
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,149
No, I need to help them look.

62
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,734
You have to stay in bed.

63
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,028
You pulled a stitch,
lay back down.

64
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,196
I've got it.

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
Why don't I give you
something to help you relax?

66
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,700
No, no. I don't want to relax.
I want to find my baby.

67
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,369
The police are searching
room by room.

68
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,704
Who would take her? What
if she needs to be fed?

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,956
We're gonna find her.

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,959
Why aren't the police
talking to our nurse?

71
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,799
What now? Truth or Dare?

72
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,968
Oh, no, you don't
want to mess with me.

73
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,803
Truth or Dare queen
at Newton North.

74
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,179
I was kidding.

75
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,973
I'm sure we can find something
interesting to talk about

76
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,183
without relying on
some juvenile game.

77
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,351
Sure.

78
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,069
Truth.

79
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,657
They think I took the kid? Do you
think I would do something...

80
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm just asking questions.

81
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,454
The dad let the older brother
hold the baby for the first time,

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,458
so I put her in his lap. After
a few seconds, she shrieked.

83
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,918
I'm pretty sure he pinched her.

84
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,171
I need to know this stuff,
anything out of the ordinary.

85
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,425
It was sibling rivalry. I thought
it was kind of ordinary.

86
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,182
Hey.

87
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,595
What are you doing down here?

88
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,395
I was looking for
McKenna's patient file.

89
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,731
Oh. You mean this file?

90
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,525
The one I said I'd get?
Two hours ago.

91
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,901
Seriously, you don't trust me

92
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,362
with the immense responsibility
of fetching a file?

93
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,531
If you already found it, what are
you looking through those for?

94
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,950
Do you know what these are?

95
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,704
The staff credentials files.

96
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,997
Those should all be in HR.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,290
Down here to be digitized.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,793
And we're locked in, and whoever's supposed
to be watching them is locked out.

99
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,463
We could look up
anything on anyone.

100
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,382
Malpractice records,
felony histories...

101
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,967
Put them away. Come on.

102
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,472
We have a tiny window of opportunity to
gain some insight into our colleagues.

103
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,477
Okay. What if we just
snoop on our boss?

104
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,232
I think I can live with that.

105
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,248
You're on two milligrams
of morphine an hour.

106
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,167
How the hell are
you still awake?

107
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,753
No, don't tell me.

108
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,008
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

109
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,844
If the blood's not
reaching your gut,

110
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,263
you'd have intestinal
hypoperfusion,

111
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,599
that'd be stronger
than the narcotics.

112
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,936
The nurse said I might only
have a day or two left.

113
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,729
She was being kind.

114
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,990
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

115
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,828
Oh, God, don't tell
me we used to date.

116
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:38,165
The limp, yeah, I read about you.
I sent you a letter.

117
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,127
Before they knew
what was wrong,

118
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,295
I tried to get you
to take my case.

119
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,631
Yeah, well, you should
have kept reading.

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,259
Heart disease is kind
of below my pay grade.

121
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,929
It started as tooth pain.

122
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,182
No one got it that it
was a heart problem

123
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,978
until I had a series
of massive heart attacks.

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,244
This doesn't bother you?

125
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,121
You talking with your mouth full?
A little.

126
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,541
I meant the fact that you're
standing in here watching me die

127
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,419
because my file bored you.

128
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,297
I take maybe one in 20 cases.

129
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,176
A lot of the people
I turn down end up dying.

130
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,263
It's really a good argument for
there being more than one me,

131
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,265
when you think about it.

132
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,734
Truth.

133
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,902
All right.

134
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,696
Have you ever had a threesome?

135
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,947
No.

136
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,532
You haven't?

137
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,576
What, just because
I'm bisexual?

138
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
Well, yeah.

139
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,747
Do you understand
what bisexual means?

140
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,911
It doesn't mean you have sex
with two people at once.

141
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,585
And by the way, you didn't ask
me if I'd had a foursome.

142
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,753
Truth or dare?

143
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,296
Wait, you've had a foursome? No.

144
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,632
But now you've asked me two
questions so I get to ask you two.

145
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,467
You see why I was the queen.

146
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,852
Walker wouldn't do anything,
he's my son, too.

147
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,105
I don't mean to sound cold,
but he's your stepson.

148
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,026
We can't ignore
any possibility.

149
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,992
Walker's been getting in fights
a lot at school, lately.

150
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,414
Last week, he hit another kid with
a book, hard enough to draw blood.

151
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,047
If he did something
to the baby...

152
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,689
We were working on it.

153
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,276
We failed.

154
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,527
No. You had a
conversation with House,

155
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,697
then came back, informed me I'd
been forever poisoned by him

156
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,115
and started packing.

157
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,992
It's interesting how your
story leaves out the part

158
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,994
where you murdered
another human being.

159
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,204
A dictator who was
committing genocide.

160
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,914
You thought about
doing it yourself.

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,082
But I didn't.

162
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,918
Right, because you're
not toxic like I am.

163
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,463
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

164
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,590
You're going to logic
me into coming back?

165
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,889
There must be over 30 malpractice
settlements in here.

166
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,977
He did a brain biopsy
without CT mapping

167
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,771
"causing brain herniation
and death."

168
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,024
Look at this one.

169
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:55,279
"Patient lost four liters of blood
from a botched penisectomy."

170
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,241
On a patient named Lisa Cuddy?

171
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,287
Damn it, they're all
named Lisa Cuddy!

172
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,664
He's not even here and
he's screwing with us.

173
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,833
Where's the joy in that?

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,422
You really wanna
get into his head?

175
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,592
Yeah, but I decided against
stabbing myself in the leg

176
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,302
or getting addicted
to pain pills.

177
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,138
You can skip the stabbing.

178
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,351
Where did you...
Confiscated them

179
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,688
from a drug seeker in the clinic.
Didn't get a chance to turn them in.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,608
It is after-hours.

181
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,652
I'll take one.

182
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,697
Walk in House's
shoes for a night.

183
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,284
One? I believe
he wears a larger size.

184
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,548
No cards, no flowers,
not even a phone call.

185
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,634
Let me guess,
lighthouse keeper?

186
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,304
I was a classics professor
at Princeton for 26 years.

187
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,014
Mostly research.

188
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,477
So, your closest colleagues died
2,000 years ago, that must be it.

189
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:14,316
Not that you have no friends because,
say, you're a miserable bastard.

190
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,527
What do you care?

191
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,738
The next few hours
are gonna be grim.

192
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:24,493
There'll be nausea, pain, no company
as soon as I get myself out of here.

193
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:30,416
I can unlock the regulator, you can
put yourself into a narcotic haze,

194
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,751
sleep blissfully to the end.

195
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,921
Is that a favor
to me or to you?

196
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,382
Win-win.

197
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,844
No, thanks.

198
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,139
You're trying to guilt me
for not taking your case?

199
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,808
You think a classicist
doesn't believe in fate?

200
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,728
You think Odysseus would lie whimpering
like a loser in a hospital bed?

201
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,731
Come on, take my offer.

202
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,777
Take the drug holiday,
numb yourself out.

203
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,200
I think you're the one
who wants to numb himself out.

204
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,966
Truth.

205
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,386
How did your dad react
when you came out to him?

206
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,054
He made me tea.

207
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:30,058
Seriously. Doesn't matter what I tell
him, he smiles, tells me he supports me,

208
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,144
and makes me some
peppermint tea.

209
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,312
Truth or dare?

210
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,563
Truth.

211
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,357
Are you dating anyone?

212
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,650
Now? No.

213
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,738
Interesting, you added a modifier.
Truth.

214
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,493
When you were dating Foreman...
No, no, no.

215
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,744
What?

216
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,330
If it was something
personal about him or us,

217
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,665
I just don't think that's right to answer.
We all work together.

218
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,951
That's the whole point of this
game, something personal,

219
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,669
preferably embarrassing.
Just pick something else.

220
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,171
You see, this is your problem.

221
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,256
You act like you're
so liberal and open,

222
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,341
but you are the least...

223
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,676
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

224
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:09,431
Yes, nudity. I want you
to show your breasts

225
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,059
to Taub.

226
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,021
That is the most
idiotic dare ever.

227
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,898
Have you ever played this game?

228
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,860
Well, I thought showing me your breasts
would be a little exploitative.

229
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,363
Your dare is in
the future, genius.

230
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,656
Hey, if you're saying
you won't do it...

231
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,782
No, no, no, no.

232
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,952
Of course I'll show
my breasts to Taub,

233
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,955
tomorrow, perhaps, or
maybe sometime next year,

234
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,707
you know, because
I'm honor-bound.

235
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,917
Truth or dare?

236
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,633
It's understandable that you
wouldn't be happy right now.

237
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,970
Your world is changing.
Are you scared?

238
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,640
And how do you feel
about your sister?

239
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,393
I hate her.

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,318
Walker, this is important. Did
you do anything to the baby?

241
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,738
Did you move her somewhere?
Hide her?

242
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,823
No.

243
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,032
Nobody'll be mad at you.

244
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,660
I said no, so stop asking me.

245
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,751
Bad pain day?

246
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,671
Bad pain month.

247
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,299
And since I'm not using it...

248
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,594
If you don't want the morphine,

249
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,263
you must have
something of your own.

250
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,181
I was in rehab.

251
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,684
Had a little problem with
the "something of my own."

252
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,520
Now all I take is ibuprofen,
and that's two flights up.

253
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,771
For the whole month?

254
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,525
The pain's migrated, I think
the arterial wall is damaged.

255
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,027
And what? You don't know?

256
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,362
I haven't had
an arteriogram yet.

257
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:52,200
You don't want the test in case
the arterial wall is fine,

258
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:56,455
which would mean that the pain
is coming from something else.

259
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,666
What's her name?

260
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:06,381
Interesting that you'd jump from
physical pain to long-lost love.

261
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,884
You're projecting.

262
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,261
So, what's her name?

263
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,974
What time is it?

264
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:20,062
What does it matter to you?
It's T-minus four hours.

265
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,985
8:20. Now tell me who she is,

266
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,406
and what are the pathetically long
odds that she's gonna visit or call.

267
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,784
Only that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

268
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,253
Dude.

269
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,506
Dude.

270
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,593
Is the room still spinning?

271
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,179
Mine is.

272
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,933
Maybe we shouldn't
have taken so many?

273
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,979
I'm gonna try to stand up.

274
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,732
You be careful.

275
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,619
Oh, yeah, that's working.

276
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,708
I can't feel my face.

277
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,419
No way.

278
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,089
Way. Hit me.

279
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,674
What?

280
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,634
Hit me in the face.

281
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,969
Seriously?

282
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,806
You know you've always wanted to.
Now's your chance.

283
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:42,227
That's a great idea. We can
start a fight club, maybe we...

284
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,567
Oh, my God, you're right.
That is so cool.

285
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,152
Okay, I'll even...

286
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,323
I can still feel my hand.

287
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,492
I wasn't ready.

288
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,996
What were you gonna do,
flex your goatee muscle?

289
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,834
Wait a minute.

290
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,587
This is your credentials file?

291
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,255
Give me that.

292
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,511
That's why you came down here,
not for the patient file.

293
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,599
You wanted... You wanted...

294
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,277
Okay, Robert. I will answer
whatever questions you want.

295
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,573
But then you're gonna
have to sign the papers.

296
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,117
Did you ever love me?

297
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,454
How can you even ask that?

298
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
The first time you slept with me was
because you were on crystal meth.

299
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,793
I was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

300
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,997
It was the emotions that led
to the sex, not the drugs.

301
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,296
Not true.

302
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,424
After that, you refused to let
it go further than just sex.

303
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,750
Because I knew I was falling
for you and I didn't want to.

304
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,261
And that never changed.

305
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,764
You broke off our vacation
because I bought you a ring.

306
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,474
I got cold feet,
I'm not proud of it.

307
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,934
And then you almost
called off our wedding

308
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,852
because you couldn't
give up the idea... No.

309
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,312
Don't... of having your
dead husband's baby.

310
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,980
Don't bring him up.
Because even then

311
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,565
you weren't sure about me.

312
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,067
Maybe if I was dying
when you married me,

313
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,235
it would've been
a bit different.

314
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,319
That's not fair.

315
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,083
It's not only fair,
it's exactly the point.

316
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,866
He was dying when you met him and he was
gone just a year into the marriage.

317
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,451
So, it was all
a honeymoon with him,

318
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,328
and I could never
match up to that.

319
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,539
The first time reality intruded on...
Stop this.

320
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,624
Just tell me the truth.
About what?

321
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,750
Did you ever love me?

322
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,377
I don't know!

323
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,971
Thank you for finally
telling me.

324
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,487
Truth.

325
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,198
You said you weren't
dating anyone now.

326
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,618
Does that mean you recently
were or soon will be?

327
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,873
Oh. Look who's guarded now.

328
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,294
You had no problem talking about
your sex life, but your love life...

329
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,379
Fine, dare it is.

330
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,175
No nudity.
Now or in the future.

331
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,560
You're too much of
a nice boy, Wilson.

332
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,980
Let's let the bad boy
out for a bit.

333
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,526
You have to go steal
one dollar, right now.

334
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,653
From who?

335
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,869
Oh, come on.

336
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,248
"Interned at Hopkins,"
old news.

337
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,460
Here we go!
"Academic probation."

338
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,588
I'm asking you
to please stop reading.

339
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,466
I'm afraid I can't do that.

340
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,594
"Faked a lab result."
Very wrong.

341
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:07,724
And you came down to destroy the
record before it gets digitized.

342
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,602
Permanentized. Even wronger.

343
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,729
I...

344
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,360
I needed to beat all those
elite, spoiled kids around me.

345
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,448
To show no weakness,
to win at everything.

346
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,285
Why'd I just tell you that?

347
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,579
I always talk too much
when I'm stoned.

348
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,040
Why'd I just tell you that?

349
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,422
It was stupid.

350
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,716
You had great grades. One lab
result shouldn't have mattered.

351
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,468
Except I didn't
think I deserved

352
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,721
to be at a top med school
in the first place.

353
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,056
Again.

354
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,308
Faking a lab result
is one thing,

355
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:54,062
but you needing to come down
here to destroy the records

356
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,272
12 years after the fact...

357
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,945
This isn't about med school.

358
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,740
You don't think you belong
here at the hospital.

359
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,623
"Dr. Taub, comma,
Christopher Michael."

360
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,090
So, this is what it comes
down to in the final hours.

361
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,718
Deifying some lost love.

362
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,221
Hoping to get her on the phone
and make everything perfect.

363
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,681
It's pathetic.

364
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,226
Either you left her for a reason
or she left you for a reason.

365
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,723
A phone call is not gonna...

366
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,813
It's my daughter.

367
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,775
So, why isn't she here?

368
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,906
I left my family
when Gracie was six.

369
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:51,286
I was sort of
forced out, actually,

370
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,457
after I had had an affair
with a student.

371
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,209
For sex or love?

372
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,627
Neither.

373
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,133
I'd only married Gracie's
mother because of the baby.

374
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,928
But I didn't think I could
handle the commitment,

375
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:13,475
and just like any decent
academic, I proved myself right.

376
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,520
And what time it is
matters because...

377
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,981
She's a dance
teacher in Atlanta,

378
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,941
she gets home
from work at 9:00,

379
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,111
and I just wanted to speak
to her one more time.

380
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
That's my story.

381
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,867
What's yours?

382
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,245
Same thing, pretty much.

383
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,667
I'm gonna be dead
in a few hours,

384
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,878
your secrets couldn't be safer,

385
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,882
unless you're keeping
them from yourself.

386
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,138
I like being alone.

387
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,727
At least I convinced myself
that I'm better off that way.

388
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,776
And then I met someone in a
psychiatric hospital of all places.

389
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,862
She changed me.

390
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,865
And then she left.

391
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:19,749
We're better off alone. We
suffer alone, we die alone.

392
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:24,045
Doesn't matter if you're a model
husband or father of the year,

393
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,382
tomorrow will be
the same for you.

394
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,096
But yesterday
would've been different.

395
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,021
Hey, Daria.

396
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,231
Dr. Wilson.

397
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,277
Could you cook me up
a chicken sandwich?

398
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,695
Grill's closed.

399
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,155
It's important, medically.

400
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,700
Dr. Hadley needs a
high-protein meal right now.

401
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:57,579
She doesn't like to talk about
it but she has hypoproteinemia.

402
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,205
We got chicken salad.

403
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,915
Yeah, that's cold.

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,668
She needs to eat warm
protein for this disease?

405
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,587
Well, we could
give her cold protein

406
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,839
whose uptake enzymes
haven't been activated,

407
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,801
as long as you don't mind her risking liver
and kidney failure and eventual death.

408
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,722
But, hey, it's worth it so you
don't have to flip on the grill.

409
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,766
You don't have to be
obnoxious about it.

410
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,441
How do you look so okay?

411
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,320
I spent months wondering
how I made it go bad.

412
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:19,327
If you never loved me, then
I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,830
Hey.

414
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,000
Allison, come on.

415
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,920
It's all right.

416
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,881
Still don't know
why I said that.

417
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,220
It's not even true.
I did love you.

418
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:45,561
Just not in a way that
would have ever worked.

419
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,398
Why not?

420
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,110
Because everything
you said is true.

421
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,239
I'm a mess.

422
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,243
I married a man
I knew was dying,

423
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,788
so God knows how screwed
up I already was.

424
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,709
Him dying messed
me up even more.

425
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,380
I pushed you out of my life.

426
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:19,053
And I'm unfixable.

427
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,517
Not you.

428
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,650
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,068
I'm sorry, too.

430
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,106
Truth.

431
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,441
Shut up.

432
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:14,984
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,152
It's not your fault.

434
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,112
No, I didn't even play fair.

435
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,450
You asked me how my dad reacted
when I told him I was bisexual.

436
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,202
And the Huntington's.

437
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,286
No tea party?

438
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,579
I never told him.

439
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,122
He's been through enough.

440
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,418
So, he just visits his
heterosexual, healthy daughter,

441
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,129
and you go out to dinner and a
movie and talk about your garden?

442
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,673
I work late. He's
staying at my house.

443
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
It's easier if I stay
elsewhere as much as I can.

444
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,596
You can't suppress your life
for his convenience.

445
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,932
You don't see
a little irony in that?

446
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,850
That's exactly what
you do for House.

447
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,853
When he moved in with you, you
bought a bigger place for him.

448
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
No wonder you're
not dating anyone.

449
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,690
You're right.

450
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,655
That woman, the woman
I'm not involved with,

451
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:06,536
her name is Sam Carr. But in 1990
and 1991, it was Sam Wilson.

452
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,871
Your ex-wife?

453
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,749
No, my mother. Yes, my ex-wife.

454
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,420
Ex number one. She friended
me a few weeks ago.

455
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,673
We started e-mailing, turns
out she's recently divorced,

456
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,134
and I wanted to ask her out.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,971
You can't take
a woman to dinner

458
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,224
or else House will go running
straight back to the loony bin?

459
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,560
You're not worried about House,
you're worried about yourself

460
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,936
because she's an ex,

461
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,189
so even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

462
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,320
What are your favorite
parts that you remember?

463
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,829
I liked how, when I'd wake up
in the middle of the night,

464
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,233
you'd put your arm around me
and you wouldn't even wake up.

465
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,837
I liked watching you stand up to your dad
at Christmas when he yelled at your mom.

466
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:02,425
How you didn't even know you
were strong, but you were.

467
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,804
What do you miss?

468
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,139
I miss a lot.

469
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,436
But when I think
about missing you,

470
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,482
I think about that dance class
that we took, for our wedding.

471
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,109
It's weird.

472
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,326
I think, "He's never going
to hold me like that again."

473
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Oh, God.

474
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,396
Come on.

475
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,413
I'm gonna miss this, too.

476
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,088
"Published in The New
England Journal at 26"?

477
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,840
I finished all the lab
work a year earlier.

478
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,720
"Led a group of surgeons to fix
cleft palates in Bangladesh"?

479
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,307
What can I say? That concert
was very moving to me.

480
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,850
I have to take a knee.

481
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:39,188
I don't get it. This has gotta be the
most spectacular file down here.

482
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,857
Why are you pretending
to be ashamed?

483
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,944
I'd trade mine for
yours in a second.

484
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,489
When I was in med school, I
thought I'd be House someday.

485
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,828
Instead, I'm a fellow,
working with...

486
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,166
Working for people
years younger than me.

487
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,921
So, we both have a few regrets.

488
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,468
You should be proud of yours.
Your life's been trending up.

489
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,517
No news.

490
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,229
How you holding up?

491
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,899
You let them sedate you.

492
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,109
Yeah.

493
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,361
Do you have kids?

494
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,696
A little girl.

495
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,991
I adopted her last year.

496
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,703
I adopted Walker right after
Donald and I got married.

497
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,877
What if I can never love Walker
the way I love my daughter?

498
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,631
Does that make me
a horrible person?

499
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,177
Let me get you some tissues.

500
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,900
Did you request
some extra towels?

501
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,403
No. What? Why?

502
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,826
There are eight towels
in Sarah's room.

503
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,119
Okay.

504
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,621
There should only be four.

505
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,873
Housekeeping handles towels.

506
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,357
I need you to track
down their logs.

507
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,001
Figure out who was
up there and when.

508
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,286
Because they got extra towels?

509
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,880
Just find the logs. Now.

510
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,302
Adrienne, you okay?

511
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,970
Sure.

512
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,016
What's wrong?

513
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,646
Adrienne, give me your arm.

514
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,193
The hair on her left arm
is standing up.

515
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,778
Asymmetric
neurological function.

516
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,571
She's having
a pilomotor seizure.

517
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,948
She seemed fine a minute ago.

518
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,035
She was, she's probably been
having complex seizures all day.

519
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,537
She'd be basically functional,

520
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,497
but more or less
acting on autopilot.

521
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,458
She probably dropped
the towels off twice.

522
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,422
She could have taken the baby.

523
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,430
We never really did
have a proper goodbye.

524
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,370
It's 9:00.

525
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:47,061
It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.

526
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,073
I guess she's running late.

527
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,077
You don't seem that surprised.

528
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,209
That's what you
expected to get.

529
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,586
You waited until
you knew she'd be out.

530
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,926
Her aunt said that
she starts work late.

531
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:25,099
Every now and then, I just call
to hear her voice on the machine.

532
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,605
I was never there
when she needed me.

533
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,485
What right do I have
to need her now?

534
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,820
None.

535
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:43,117
Which just means you're a hypocrite.
Because apparently you do.

536
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:53,168
Forget about rights. Just tell
her what you need to tell her.

537
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,342
It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.

538
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,640
Gracie?

539
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,102
This is

540
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,690
your father.

541
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,321
I love you.

542
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,516
Anything?

543
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,653
We've covered every room
on Maldonado's logs.

544
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,270
Been everywhere she's been.

545
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,112
Where's the other cart? Isn't there
usually another cart in here?

546
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,593
Hey.

547
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,974
Okay. Okay.

548
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,394
Okay.

549
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,943
Hi.

550
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,782
- Anyone in there?
- Lockdown's over.

551
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,455
I should go.

552
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,124
Yeah.

553
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,175
I just asked Sam to dinner.

554
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,886
Little baby's all growed-up.

555
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,931
You gonna tell your dad?

556
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,434
I'll stop by his hotel,
talk to him.

557
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,022
Hotel? You said he was
staying at your apartment.

558
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,278
Was there any truth
in anything you said?

559
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,365
The part about it being a good idea
for you to call Sam. That was true.

560
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,701
Good night, Remy.
Good night, James.

561
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,495
Code Seven has been lifted.

562
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,080
Repeat. Code Seven
has been lifted.

563
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,873
You want your file?

564
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,667
Nah.

565
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,753
All hospital personnel

566
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,505
can leave their staging areas...
Good for you.

567
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,757
And report back
to their department.

568
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,133
Thank you for your cooperation.

569
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,094
We don't have to tell
anybody what we...

570
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,178
Mmm-mmm.

571
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,265
You got the patient file?

572
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,391
I'll grab it.

573
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,645
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

574
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,768
I think I'm ready to take
you up on your offer.

575
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,500
Dr. House? Lockdown ended
a few minutes ago.

576
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,752
Yeah, I know.

577
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,348
I'm sorry I didn't
take your case.

578
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,439
Me, too.

579
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:17,951
Gracie was the cutest
six-year-old you ever saw.

580
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,614
Interesting night, huh?

581
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,745
Interesting night.
