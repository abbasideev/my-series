1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,522
Good explosion! Drive
it, drive it, drive it!

2
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,693
You watching 77?

3
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,860
I'm watching everybody.

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,822
You don't need to watch
everybody, you need to watch 77.

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,740
You his agent?

6
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,283
Just an objective mom.

7
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,494
His explosion is impressive.

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,621
It's not just burst,
he can pull, too.

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,540
You know, the only reason
he went to a double A school,

10
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,751
he was a bit of a late bloomer,
but he's a big man now.

11
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,336
You should be his agent.

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,964
Nice pancake, Seven Seven.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,799
You're moving up
those draft boards.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,925
Thank you, sir.

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,969
- 01, 01, ready?
- Break!

16
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,430
Set!

17
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,974
Blue 90. Hike.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,481
Good job! Second level, nice!

19
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,025
Get off my quarterback!

20
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,868
Play's over! The play is over!

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,462
Save the aggression for
between the whistles!

22
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,588
Daryl!

23
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,006
All right, back to work!

24
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,843
Daryl!

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,016
Daryl, stop!

26
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,950
What are you doing?

27
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,911
Canoeing, but I seem
to be taking on water.

28
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,665
This is not okay.
Use your own bathroom.

29
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,083
No canoe in my bathroom.

30
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:52,004
My leg hurts, soaking
makes it feel better.

31
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,298
You were the one who had
to have this condo.

32
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,184
Maybe next time you should
consider amenities,

33
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,887
like two full baths, instead of
just the joy of outbidding Cuddy.

34
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,974
The guy who signs the loan
gets to pick the bedrooms.

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,809
Stay out of mine.

36
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,687
Well, then you owe me 35 bucks

37
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,106
for the grab rail I installed.

38
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,074
Hit the kill screen,
boss is here.

39
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,577
It's not porn,
it's our new patient.

40
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,953
Bummer.

41
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,582
Twenty-two-year-old male,
6'7", 310 pounds.

42
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,250
Clearly has brain involvement.

43
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,378
The guy has no recollection
of this entire incident.

44
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,380
Football player.

45
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,841
Those are the ones that get
hit in the head a lot, right?

46
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,050
ER CTed him.

47
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,428
No concussion, no stroke,
no cortical degeneration.

48
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,723
And he had a full psych evaluation.
He's not crazy.

49
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,266
So it's roid rage.

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,767
You don't think they grow
them that big naturally?

51
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,853
ER also tested for steroids,
he's clean.

52
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,397
Only proving that our guy got
his hands on the good stuff.

53
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,025
The negative test at least
means steroids is less likely.

54
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,276
We should discuss
other possibilities.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,444
Why?

56
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,905
He injects his sore ankles
with lidocaine every game,

57
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,615
you think he's above
injecting steroids?

58
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,075
Repeated head trauma could
damage the base of the brain,

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,203
leading to a pituitary
adenoma, which leaks GnRH.

60
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,623
Pituitary damage wouldn't
be visible on a CT scan.

61
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,208
Could cause the excess hormones
that could cause the rage

62
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,586
and would elude
the ER's steroid test.

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,506
Fine. Bilateral venous sampling
to find the elevated GnRH,

64
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,051
MRI to find
the pituitary damage.

65
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,303
Unless, of course, there
is no pituitary damage,

66
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,015
in which case, our guy got
his hands on the good stuff.

67
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,813
Foreman. Let the peasants
handle the peasantry.

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,525
Your brother needs to get
picked up this afternoon.

69
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,903
From prison.

70
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,032
Your older brother, in case
your confusion is related...

71
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,492
How do you know about that?

72
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,910
He left a message.

73
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,704
He said he couldn't get you
on your cell or at home.

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,790
I get it, you're busy,
you'll pick him up

75
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,500
the next time he
comes out of prison.

76
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,043
Is that all?

77
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:59,215
You're officially unbusy.
Family is family.

78
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,510
Take the rest of the day,
go see your brother.

79
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,387
I have work to do.

80
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,769
Do you feel any pain that's
deep and persistent?

81
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,270
Not just muscles or joints.

82
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,439
Everything hurts all the time.
That's football.

83
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,566
It might not be just football.

84
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,652
We're going to test for
damage to your pituitary.

85
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,488
If there is, it could
create excess hormones,

86
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,698
which could be
causing your pain.

87
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,533
It would also explain
your rage attack.

88
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,951
And if my pituitary is damaged,

89
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,285
how long would
it take to treat?

90
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,578
I don't want to get
ahead of ourselves

91
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,080
and start promising deadlines.

92
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,082
I'm sorry, Doctor,

93
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,251
but he's playing
in front of pro scouts,

94
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,336
coaches and GMs this Saturday.

95
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,798
This is the job interview
for the rest of his life.

96
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,466
If we do find something wrong,

97
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,176
we can go in through the nose

98
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,887
and repair the damage,
nothing too invasive.

99
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,931
You'll need a couple
of days of recovery,

100
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,976
and then we can have
you back by game time.

101
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,603
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,065
There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

103
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,904
Well, then, your gizmo's broken.
I'm seeing spots.

104
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,826
Or you enlisted, you got the cool
haircut and the awesome pants,

105
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,327
then you realized
that your plane ticket

106
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,787
to the Middle East was coach,

107
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,831
and you decided to
rethink your promise.

108
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,251
No. I've already been there.

109
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,047
Three deployments. Now
they want me to go again.

110
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,757
But my wife's pregnant.

111
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,884
So our Homeland
should be unsafe

112
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,011
because your Private
was unsafe?

113
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,806
Look, my wife and I
planned this perfect.

114
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,933
My enlistment was supposed
to be over last week,

115
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,352
so we got pregnant
six months ago.

116
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,438
Now they tell me
I'm getting stop-lossed.

117
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,564
Army speak for they don't care

118
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,150
about the fact that I've
finished my contract.

119
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,360
I don't care about the
fact that they don't care.

120
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,948
Hey, come on, I waited an extra
hour just to make sure I got you.

121
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,617
Why?

122
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,327
I saw you limping out there.

123
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,871
Vietnam?

124
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,164
Viet...

125
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
How old do you think I am?

126
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,586
I don't know. Vietnam age?

127
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,379
Well, back in my day

128
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,257
the real dodgers had the
stones to run off to Canada

129
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,675
or shoot themselves
in the foot.

130
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,804
They didn't come to free clinics
whining for doctors' notes.

131
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,765
Go hug your wife, tell
her to get a babysitter,

132
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,685
and you'll be back in time to
video the kid's first steps.

133
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,439
Yeah, I don't need
to see the scan.

134
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,110
I can tell from your little puppy
dog eyes that his pituitary's fine.

135
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,237
Are you gonna say it,
or should I?

136
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,822
You were right
about the steroids.

137
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,240
You're a genius.

138
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,825
Next time, with feeling.

139
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,618
Put the cheater on
a somatostatin analogue

140
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,744
to clear it out of his system,

141
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,664
send him back to
his football game.

142
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,085
I've never done steroids.

143
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,046
Well, somehow your
GnRH got elevated.

144
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,673
This will help
get it back down.

145
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,799
Mom, I swear!

146
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,467
Who's gonna draft you, Daryl?

147
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,927
You're stupid enough
to try that stuff,

148
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,887
especially the week you
know you're getting tested?

149
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,453
You guys must have
mixed up your labs

150
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,182
or got somebody else's blood,

151
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,308
because I never...

152
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,978
Okay, what is that?

153
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,605
Tachycardia.
Lay back down, Daryl.

154
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,067
Why's my heart
beating like this?

155
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,569
It's not steroids.

156
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,822
I need some adenosine, and get
that crash cart over here.

157
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,869
House, next time...

158
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,581
Marcus.

159
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Oh, right.
You two know each other.

160
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,837
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,046
Interviewing.

162
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,298
Oh.

163
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,177
Who are we kidding? Interview's
over, you got the job.

164
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,387
What job?

165
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,763
My new assistant.

166
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,349
Part of his parole,
he needs a job.

167
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,602
Just trying to do my part.

168
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,854
You were wrong
about the steroids.

169
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,606
Patient had a
paroxysmal tachycardia.

170
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,608
We cardioverted him
back to sinus rhythm.

171
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,027
We're going to get a EKG
and a sestamibi scan.

172
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,405
Marcus, let's talk outside.

173
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,618
Family is family.

174
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,455
Hey, good to see you, too.

175
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,584
Did you have a hard stretch?

176
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,961
Not bad, I hardly
got raped at all.

177
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,464
You can't work here.

178
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,132
But your boss says I can.

179
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,383
I'm not playing.

180
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,386
Lighten up.
I mean, this could be fun.

181
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:18,432
I get to see your world. You
get me access to the pharmacy.

182
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,812
I am playing. Come on, man.
You look good.

183
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,398
I'd already know that, if you came
to visit every once in a while,

184
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,734
but whatever, I get it.
It's cool.

185
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,487
You don't wanna see me,
you don't wanna pick me up.

186
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,239
It's all justified.

187
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,659
I'll just have to
win you back over.

188
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,746
Let me explain something. This
man who's offering you the job?

189
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,039
He's not a philanthropist.

190
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,363
He seems more helpful than you.

191
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,085
He doesn't want to help you,

192
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,295
he only wants to use you
to screw with me.

193
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,590
You know how you
can screw with him?

194
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,843
Act like your brother getting
a job doesn't screw with you.

195
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,847
Trust me, it'll be better for both
of us if you go back in there

196
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,516
and tell him you
can't take the job.

197
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,603
I'm not a person who has the
luxury of turning down jobs.

198
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,105
Well, figure something out

199
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,276
because you cannot work here.

200
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,294
House!

201
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,546
Okay...

202
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,717
We spent all night, used
all the fancy machines.

203
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,552
Patient's heart looks fine.

204
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,887
Well, if it was fine,
it wouldn't go aflutter

205
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,806
just because you
walked into the room.

206
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
Light whip, two extra shots.

207
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,143
Thank you, sir.

208
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,895
Judging by the look
on your face,

209
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,689
I assume you're upset
that big bro

210
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,150
didn't take your advice
and skip town.

211
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,485
You told him about
our conversation?

212
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,820
He bought me breakfast.

213
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,991
It was fun. Put lunch in the
books, just you and me.

214
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,994
Our patient could have a PFO.

215
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,331
Well, naturally you jump
right to a urinary issue.

216
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,207
PFO's not urinary,
it's a heart issue.

217
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,251
It is? Oh.

218
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,338
Well, naturally you think
it's not a urinary issue

219
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,380
because you're so embarrassed

220
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,049
about your own
past urinary issues,

221
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,009
you don't dare
broach the subject.

222
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,137
Oh, come on.

223
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,681
You spending the night
over at Bobby Samson's?

224
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,440
I did not wet the bed,
I spilled a drink.

225
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,068
We're not buying it, Eric.
We never bought it.

226
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,444
Why are you telling him
these things?

227
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,114
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

228
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,617
Oxygenated and
de-oxygenated blood mix,

229
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,036
the rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,831
Like that power forward from
Loyola Marymount when he...

231
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,958
Hank Gathers? That's not
what happened to him.

232
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,920
Whoa, let your brother speak.

233
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,338
What happened to Hank Gathers?

234
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,548
Conference tournament.

235
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,175
Alley-oop dunk, jams it home,

236
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,094
then he runs up
the court and splat.

237
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,419
He dropped dead of a heart thing
right there on the court.

238
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,139
I remember that.
On autopsy they found

239
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,225
he had a hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

240
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,186
Rage and tachycardia
are warning signs.

241
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,521
Seriously?

242
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,023
Because my brother remembers
a basketball game?

243
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,442
Hey, I don't care
where an idea comes from,

244
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,070
as long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

245
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,990
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,951
As a former
psychiatric patient,

247
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,661
I take offense at
that terminology.

248
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,996
All I did was
ban you from my tub.

249
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,873
Whatever happened
to proportional response?

250
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,000
Whatever happened
to coherent conversation?

251
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,339
That thing broke tiles, gashed the
walls, and pooped everywhere.

252
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,968
Expect a bill for repairs.
And payback.

253
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,182
What was that?

254
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,559
I have no idea.

255
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,147
Everybody else thinks hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy makes sense?

256
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,941
Good, stick the patient
on a treadmill.

257
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,484
Stress his heart
until it stops.

258
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,154
You want to induce
cardiac arrest?

259
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,323
The only real treatment is for the
patient never to stress his heart again,

260
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,493
which means we have to tell him to
retire at the ripe old age of 21.

261
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,872
Stopping his heart speaks
louder than words. Go.

262
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,046
Maybe it's a good thing. He gave
your brother a job, responsibility.

263
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,091
I'm not arguing that
he shouldn't have a job,

264
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,885
I just don't want him
having one here.

265
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,971
I understand that House
did this to annoy you,

266
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,222
but why is he succeeding?

267
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,182
You know what my brother did

268
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,189
the last time
he got out of prison?

269
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,525
He stole money from my
parents to buy drugs.

270
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,654
He robbed a liquor store, then he
moved on to jacking luxury cars...

271
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,947
Last time.

272
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,282
Every time.

273
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,328
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

274
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,079
You haven't even
known him a day.

275
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,631
The exterminator charged 250

277
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,955
to get the opossum
out of there,

278
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,928
and the contractor estimates
1,500 to fix the bathroom.

279
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,932
And why are you
jerking Foreman around?

280
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,601
Because it's fun.

281
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,741
Maybe you should give
those bills to the guy

282
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,439
who left his own
bathroom window open.

283
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,609
Your motives always run
deeper than simple fun.

284
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,945
I want to learn more about
one of my employees

285
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,030
so that I can manipulate him

286
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,076
and destroy him if and when I choose.
Information is power.

287
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,202
Not buying it.

288
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,245
Okay.

289
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,622
Why don't you tell me
my real evil plan?

290
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,457
I don't think
there is an evil plan.

291
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,710
You regret not having a
relationship with your own family,

292
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,296
and you don't want to see
Foreman go down that same path.

293
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,551
I think you're
actually being nice.

294
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,969
Oh, shut up.

295
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,472
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

296
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,517
and underhanded kindness
in the same visit.

297
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,685
Then I'll come back.

298
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,146
Treadmill test was a bust.

299
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,691
The guy's in
unbelievable shape,

300
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,985
we couldn't get his
heart rate above 150.

301
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,862
Your boss is secretly
a very nice man.

302
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,826
I know.

303
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,079
If we can't
recreate the cardiac event,

304
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,873
we can't prove
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

305
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:23,255
Either we find
a bigger treadmill, or...

306
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,638
Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

307
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,765
I'm feeling fine.
I can't keep laying here

308
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,350
in this bed, missing practices.

309
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,728
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

310
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,271
What's in the shot?

311
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,522
It's a vasodilator.

312
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,108
Since we can't exercise your
son's heart on the treadmill,

313
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,611
we're gonna have
to do it chemically.

314
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,242
What's wrong?

315
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,619
You're turning white.

316
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,287
What does that mean?

317
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,749
It means he doesn't need football
to get a good job anymore.

318
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,507
Raynaud's Phenomenon.

319
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,260
Vasospasms cut off the blood
supply to his fingers,

320
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,638
could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

321
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,264
His rheumatoid
factor is negative.

322
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,807
Arterial plaque throwing clots

323
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,893
would explain the fingers,
head, heart.

324
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,419
You really think
a guy with stenosis

325
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,730
could've aced
that treadmill test?

326
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,942
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

327
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,615
And a nameplate. Man's got to
have a place he can call his own.

328
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,992
What about
Takayasu's arteritis?

329
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,494
Lymphoma's a better fit.

330
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,703
We should remove his spleen.

331
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,580
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

332
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,792
His big game's coming up,
we don't have time to biopsy,

333
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,835
wait for the pathology report,
and resect.

334
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,672
Right. We should remove his
spleen without confirmation

335
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,256
so he won't miss the big game.

336
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,176
Hang an ethanol drip.

337
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,387
That won't treat for either
lymphoma or Takayasu's.

338
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,222
If it's lymphoma, the ethanol
will make him itchy,

339
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,807
and Foreman can
remove his spleen.

340
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,850
If it's Takayasu's,
he'll lose his radial pulse,

341
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,728
and Chase can
start him on steroids.

342
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:05,941
Marcus!

343
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,328
What are you doing here?

344
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,957
My new assignment is to shadow
you into enemy territory

345
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,751
and document your every
word to the patient.

346
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,796
Just don't say anything stupid.

347
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,674
You're not an idiot.
Don't do this.

348
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,386
Come on, man.
I'm a new person now.

349
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,388
No more drugs, no more lying.

350
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,140
And if I can't
get my own family

351
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,808
to give me an opportunity
to prove that,

352
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,435
then what's the point?

353
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,395
Mom and Dad gave you a chance.

354
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,731
And a second. And a third.

355
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,482
I'm not about to
give you a 54th.

356
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,004
Why isn't your minion
fetching your lunch?

357
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,006
He's busy spying on
his little brother.

358
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,010
What?

359
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,012
That's very demeaning.

360
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,558
You obviously have a theory as to
why demeaning is not demeaning.

361
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,061
You're escalating to prove I was
wrong about you being nice.

362
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,439
Which you would only do
if I was right.

363
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,316
Do you even listen to yourself?

364
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,068
Twenty-three-year-old just came
in to the ER, asked for you.

365
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,528
What's her cup size?

366
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,865
I don't think his cup size
is relevant to his condition.

367
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,868
He accidentally
shot himself in the foot.

368
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,247
Oh, for...

369
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,250
Seriously?

370
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,127
I give you a choice
between moving to Canada

371
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,533
and shooting yourself
in the foot,

372
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,130
and you choose the bullet?

373
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,507
I didn't want to be a fugitive.

374
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,425
You think this is
gonna get you discharged?

375
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,927
We'll patch it up and
send you right back.

376
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,095
Well, don't patch it up.

377
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,100
Look, you got screwed over

378
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,102
by your own government
and that sucks.

379
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,479
But all you're going
to get out of this

380
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,106
is a five-day vacation
and a band-aid.

381
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,318
When I signed up,
I was just a guy.

382
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
Now I'm about to be a dad.

383
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,728
I go back over,
there's a chance

384
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,741
my kid grows up
without a father.

385
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:26,164
You got a girl pregnant.
You're still just a guy.

386
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,260
How much longer
we have to wait?

387
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,720
We have to keep going until
you start feeling something.

388
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,056
Might help if you told me
what I'm supposed to feel.

389
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,267
I do that, that's all
you'll be thinking about.

390
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,431
Then you'll be telling me
that's what you're feeling.

391
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,770
Power of suggestion.

392
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,023
The other black dude who was in
here earlier, he your brother?

393
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,525
What gave it away?

394
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,193
The way you looked at him.

395
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,838
I have two older brothers, and we
always want to kill each other.

396
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,122
Something wrong?

397
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,875
Not really. Just feels itchy.

398
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,115
Is that what you
were waiting for?

399
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,088
Means lymphoma's most likely.

400
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,756
But that's actually good news.

401
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,133
How can that be good news?

402
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,551
Because it's treatable,

403
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,970
we can remove your spleen
tonight laparoscopically.

404
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,680
Will I be up and
around by Saturday?

405
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,182
We can get to the radiation
in the off-season.

406
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,356
Hey, Ma. Wake up.
Ma, wake up. I'm itchy.

407
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,650
Means I can play.

408
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,379
What are you doing in the dark?

409
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,089
Lying in wait.

410
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,510
Jeez, what happened
to your face?

411
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,304
Right, play innocent.

412
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,348
Like you weren't
looking for revenge

413
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,712
for the prank
that I didn't pull.

414
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,560
It's karmic justice,
but I didn't do it.

415
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,230
Of course you realize,
this means war.

416
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,614
Isolating
the gastroepiploic artery.

417
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,743
Nearly there.

418
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,123
Foreman, come and
take a look at this.

419
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,502
Liver's inflamed.

420
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,881
So the itching wasn't
caused by his spleen.

421
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,258
It's not lymphoma.

422
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,101
What happened to your face?

423
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,770
Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.

424
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,106
No abnormal T-cells or B-cells,

425
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,774
it's definitely not lymphoma.

426
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,653
Liver biopsy only revealed
non-specific inflammation.

427
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,238
Kind of like the time

428
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,907
you took your mom's birth
control pills on a dare

429
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,951
and ended up with
swollen nipples.

430
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,619
That never happened. Right.

431
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,081
And your nickname all the way up
through high school wasn't Erica.

432
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,624
It wasn't.

433
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,961
Okay, I may have
made that one up.

434
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,380
With the understanding that my
brother still had his sense of humor

435
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,715
and would figure
out to play along.

436
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,884
Polymyositis would
explain the head,

437
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,677
liver, heart,
even the white fingers.

438
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,347
Would also be accompanied by a
significant decrease in muscle power.

439
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,225
Marcus, chance to
redeem yourself.

440
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,352
Does our patient
look strong to you?

441
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,192
Sorry, Eric. Big brother
disagrees with your diagnosis.

442
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,401
Felty syndrome?

443
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,779
You said the liver was
inflamed, not the spleen.

444
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,656
Can you believe they let
this guy perform surgery?

445
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,741
What are you doing?

446
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
Requesting permission
to share my idea

447
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,321
without being belittled in
front of your new assistant.

448
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,747
Permission denied. Continue.

449
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,541
Our patient has cartilage
damage in both ankles,

450
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,211
he gets lidocaine shots before
every game to mask the pain.

451
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,339
Team doctor uses the same
needle twice by accident?

452
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,465
Viral hepatitis.

453
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,759
Do you think he's
an idiot, Marcus?

454
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,344
I don't think he's an idiot.

455
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,513
Okay. Go test his blood.

456
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,391
Come on. We have
a lunch scheduled.

457
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,440
So you jerked me around.

458
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,570
Your allegiance lies with your brother.
I get it. Admirable.

459
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,865
But here's the problem. I hired
you to tell me the truth.

460
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,535
If you don't do that,
you no longer have a job.

461
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,453
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

462
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,539
but my brother is a decent guy.

463
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,083
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

464
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,127
You're gonna be disappointed.

465
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,378
Try me.

466
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,297
He tell you I was with him?

467
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,549
Was it your idea?

468
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,714
We did everything together,

469
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,759
I don't know whose idea it was.

470
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,845
I was 16, he was only 14.

471
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,389
Little punk couldn't even see
over the steering wheel,

472
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,974
but he was quicker
with a flathead screwdriver

473
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,310
than most people with a key.

474
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,984
Sorry to interrupt my character
assassination with boring medical stuff,

475
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,569
but when we drew
the patient's blood

476
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,696
it clotted right there
in the vacutainer.

477
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,408
So the problem is not in his
blood, it's the blood itself.

478
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,532
He's been working out in the
cold, doing two-a-days,

479
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,620
it's got to be
cryoglobulinemia.

480
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,249
I usually love breaking bad
news, but in this case...

481
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,127
Start the patient on warfarin.

482
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,630
I am so sorry about that.
You were saying?

483
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,509
We drove for about 10 minutes

484
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,387
before we got caught
and that was it.

485
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,847
When mom came
down to the station,

486
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,975
she didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

487
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,812
She came to the driveway,
turned off the car.

488
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,273
We're sitting in there
in silence.

489
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,524
And then,
without turning around,

490
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,611
she said, "I'll pray for you."

491
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,698
Then she got out of the car.

492
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,869
Wow. You got off easy.

493
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,956
Easy for you, easy for me.
Not easy for Eric.

494
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,419
His life mission became to never
disappoint our mother like that again.

495
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,380
Because he is a good guy.

496
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,052
Thought he would tell
that story at the eulogy,

497
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,553
but I heard he didn't give one.

498
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,185
Your mother's dead?

499
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,940
If he didn't tell you,
I'm sure he had a reason.

500
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:11,527
Look, you can mock him all you
want about peeing the bed,

501
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,075
but please don't
bring up our mother.

502
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,916
Your blood contains an abnormally
high volume of certain proteins,

503
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,292
called cryoglobulins.

504
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,045
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

505
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,382
It's like a car trying to run
after the oil's turned to sludge.

506
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,676
We think that's what's been
causing all your problems.

507
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,971
So I just need a quick oil
change and I'm good to go.

508
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,139
This oil change isn't so quick.

509
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,809
We have to put you on blood
thinners and other medications.

510
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,936
The process will take
two to three weeks,

511
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,730
but after that, you should be
able to play without a problem.

512
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,357
After that,
it's not gonna matter.

513
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,734
Doctor, if Daryl doesn't
play in front of the scouts

514
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,695
on Saturday,
he won't get drafted.

515
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,488
Can't you wait
until after the game?

516
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,074
If we wait and let him play,

517
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,494
there's a good chance
he dies right on the field.

518
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,717
I had an epiphany.

519
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,721
Usually that precedes you walking
away with purpose, so...

520
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,598
Flathead screwdriver.

521
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,559
And then I say...

522
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,520
It's not a game, it's proof

523
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,439
that you didn't rig the
grab rail and make me fall.

524
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,815
I already have proof of that.

525
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,817
The fact that I didn't do it.

526
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,068
I can't go on that.

527
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,320
But I can go on the fact

528
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,780
that I had to borrow a
flathead screwdriver from Nora

529
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,116
to install the thing because
we only had a Phillips head.

530
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,118
Then, of course, I returned
it late that night

531
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,871
in a completely successful
effort to see her braless.

532
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,556
Whoa! Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

533
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,126
Which means that you didn't have the
tool to sabotage the grab rail.

534
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,837
Braless? Under, like,
a sweater? Or, like, a...

535
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,841
Now I also have proof that I'm
not responsible for the opossum

536
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,525
because I'm absolving you of
responsibility instead of escalating,

537
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,095
which you know is
not in my nature.

538
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,725
So someone is breaking into our
place just to screw with us?

539
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,604
The opossum was meant for me.

540
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:18,738
I'm so tired. It was exciting
until about 2:00 a. m.

541
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,449
Now it's just torture.

542
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,159
Did you even go to college?

543
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,205
This is the escalation,
isn't it?

544
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,539
Keeping me up all night.

545
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,542
Nothing happens, then you keep
me up all night again tomorrow.

546
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,127
This is your retaliation.

547
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,546
You see, that's just illogical,

548
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,173
'cause I'm staying up, too.

549
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,550
Maybe you napped all day.

550
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,969
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

551
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,640
No. No, you did not. You
created empirical proof

552
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,183
that I didn't prank you,

553
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,311
selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

554
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,855
Maybe you self-pranked.

555
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,232
I don't masterprank.

556
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,984
Is that cut on
your cheek even real?

557
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:59,497
See? This is exactly
what our nemesis wants.

558
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,906
Divide and conquer.

559
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,241
Can't you see that?

560
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,077
Okay. I'm going to bed.

561
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,287
I'm telling you,
if we sleep now,

562
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,998
we're going to wake up
next to severed horse heads.

563
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,500
Or worse, the rest of it.

564
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,880
Oh!

565
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,842
House!

566
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,638
The flatscreen!

567
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,030
You would never
sacrifice the flatscreen.

568
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,784
Oh, this guy's good.

569
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,959
Is there a reason for this?

570
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:03,468
There is a reason
for everything, mes amis.

571
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:09,307
I am troubled to report that we
have a criminal in our midst.

572
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,684
Guilty of what, exactly?

573
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,396
Last night the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

574
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,275
And before that, I found
an opossum in my bathtub.

575
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,778
You each had motive,
you each had opportunity.

576
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,324
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

577
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,536
Not so fast,
Mademoiselle Cuddy.

578
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,538
No one leaves here
until they can account

579
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,750
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

580
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,043
Bye.

581
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,755
Okay. No one who
is employed by me

582
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,039
leaves here until they account

583
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,799
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

584
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,093
What about you,
Professor Chase?

585
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,386
Why would I?

586
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,555
Because you hold me responsible

587
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,182
for breaking up your marriage.

588
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,850
I was here all night
with Thirteen

589
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:56,187
monitoring our patient's
IV blood thinners.

590
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,730
Can either of you prove that?

591
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,857
The patient's alive
and improving.

592
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,108
Is that proof enough?

593
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,318
For now.

594
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,862
What about you, Colonel Taub?

595
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,240
I was out to dinner
with my wife.

596
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,700
Really? Your wife?

597
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,619
Yes, really.

598
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,374
Good enough. 'Cause I had
you pegged all along.

599
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,594
You certainly had all the
motive in the world.

600
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,712
First of all,
I'm not interested.

601
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,715
Second, I don't even know
where you guys live.

602
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,760
Yesterday, I confirmed
that you are a liar.

603
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,136
What are you talking about?

604
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,847
Well, at least
a liar by omission.

605
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,015
House!

606
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:36,852
Don't.

607
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,690
Get this, class.
Foreman's mom died.

608
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,987
He ever tell any of you?

609
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,282
House, I think you're
getting off topic here.

610
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,201
Is he serious?
Did your mom pass away?

611
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,371
About three months ago.

612
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,747
I'm so sorry.

613
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,165
Why didn't you tell anybody?

614
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,750
And to top it off,

615
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,336
he refused to say anything
nice about her at the funeral.

616
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,047
I didn't talk because
it isn't anyone's business.

617
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:09,093
Stop. You don't have to
explain yourself to this guy.

618
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,588
You want to hit me, don't you?

619
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,513
Marcus, don't.

620
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,311
I quit.

621
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,318
You should stop him.
He needs this job.

622
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,529
Our patient needs a fresh IV.

623
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,166
I don't need two
to three weeks.

624
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,252
See? Got my color back.

625
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,129
It means you're getting
better, but it doesn't...

626
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,674
Means I am better. My coach
had the team doctor come by.

627
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,842
He cleared me to play.

628
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,512
Did your team doctor realize
you're on blood thinners?

629
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,183
I'm off them now.

630
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,351
You're still sick.

631
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,019
You're not ready
to go off your meds.

632
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,023
Daryl, listen to him.
It is not worth the risk...

633
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,231
I'll come back on Sunday, Mom.

634
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,900
You guys can give me
all the meds I need then.

635
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,569
The treatment
doesn't work that way.

636
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,243
Please, go with him.

637
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,047
The antibiotics aren't working.

638
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,091
We're going to switch you
to different ones,

639
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,010
but you're going
to lose your toe.

640
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,351
Outstanding, soldier!

641
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,522
As a general rule, before you
celebrate, do a little research.

642
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,274
The Army's Medical
Evaluation Board

643
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,361
is perfectly fine with
nine-toed infantrymen,

644
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,947
as long as they
can walk and run.

645
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,865
So I lost a toe for nothing?

646
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,158
Afraid so.

647
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,202
Unless you want me to keep
you on the old antibiotics.

648
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,579
We can let
the infection spread,

649
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,249
then we can amputate
more than just a toe.

650
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,298
Why are you risking
your life for this?

651
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,801
Your mom doesn't want you to.

652
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,846
My mom sacrificed
everything for me.

653
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,389
Her telling me not to come here

654
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,433
is just another
example of that.

655
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,226
I do good out there,

656
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,062
I could take care of her
for the rest of her life.

657
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,736
Who am I if I don't sacrifice for her?
That's family.

658
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,052
You okay?

659
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,429
Everything's blurry.

660
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,478
I can't see.

661
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,693
Take me back to the hospital.

662
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,536
The blindness means
we were wrong about...

663
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,289
Actually,
I'm responsible for that.

664
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,680
I spiked his water bottle with nitrates.
Dropped his blood pressure,

665
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,796
robbed oxygen rich blood from
his brain, making him blind.

666
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,464
I figured a temporarily
blind patient

667
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,299
is better than
a permanently dead one.

668
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,550
His vision was
already coming back

669
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,436
by the time I dropped him
off at the hospital.

670
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,474
Well played. If only we could
combine your medical chicanery

671
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,476
with your brother's
ability to fetch me mochas,

672
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,269
you'd be the perfect Foreman.

673
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,312
Where are you?

674
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,522
I'm busy.

675
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,068
Great, so we don't
have a new symptom.

676
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,237
Means we should just stick him
back on his blood thinners,

677
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,822
and he should be okay to
leave in a couple weeks.

678
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,074
Actually, we do
have a new symptom.

679
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,702
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

680
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,572
Between the time he checked in

681
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,740
and the time he re-checked in,

682
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,250
our patient lost
a single pound.

683
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,586
Patient like that would
usually shed over 10 pounds.

684
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,673
The obvious answer
would be steroids,

685
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,758
but since we've
already ruled them out...

686
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,929
So he's not injecting, but he
could be getting them naturally.

687
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,848
Paraneoplastic syndrome,

688
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,517
the body produces antibodies
which battle cancer,

689
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,269
which could also act
like growth hormone.

690
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,356
We've eliminated lymphoma. What
other cancers mimic growth hormone?

691
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,358
Lung, pancreatic,
renal, breast...

692
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,944
It was a rhetorical question,
I don't really care.

693
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,612
Go test him for all of them.

694
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,585
What are you doing here?

695
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,253
You need a job.

696
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,216
Maybe I can talk to House,

697
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,885
see if I can get your job back.

698
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,056
As soon as he knows you're
okay with me being there,

699
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,474
he won't want me back.

700
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,978
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

701
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,983
I promise I won't let you down.

702
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,818
Don't do that.

703
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,490
Let's just see how it goes.

704
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:30,497
So do they mandate you to stay
here at the halfway house,

705
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,669
or can you come stay
with family?

706
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,768
It's Foreman.

707
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,062
Well, it should stop
now that Marcus left.

708
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,897
Well, that's the whole point.

709
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,987
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was my leg sticking out?

710
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,531
I'm so distracted lately, trying
to think of something funnier

711
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,950
than fire sprinklers going off

712
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,036
in the middle of the night.
Any ideas?

713
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,613
Whoa. Easy there, tiger.
I know where you live.

714
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,292
You know how I know?

715
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:17,252
'Cause my girlfriend and I,

716
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,713
we tried to buy
that very same condo.

717
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,881
Why don't you
leave me out of this?

718
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,591
Wilson was the one
who bought the place.

719
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:27,930
And you're living there. You
deserve to suffer equally.

720
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,641
Actually, I've suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

721
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,309
Hey, hey. I'm...

722
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:35,145
His suffering will equal out
because he actually feels remorse.

723
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,022
Why would you out yourself?

724
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,525
You can't even imagine
the retribution.

725
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,904
There won't be any. I'm ceasing
all offensive operations.

726
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,241
I've both made my point and
established my superiority.

727
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,452
And if you even get to the
planning stages of retaliation,

728
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,789
I will tell Cuddy that she lost
her dream place to you two.

729
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,499
See, she's under
this odd impression

730
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,252
that you guys are her friends.

731
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,396
There's no cancer.

732
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,772
We scanned him head to toe,

733
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,357
we checked blood smears
for leukemia,

734
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,943
we even ultrasounded his chest
looking for breast cancer.

735
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,820
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

736
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,322
You weren't wrong. We found
blood in his catheter bag.

737
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,615
His kidneys are failing.

738
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,867
So it has to be cancer.

739
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,036
Paraneoplastic syndrome
is the only thing

740
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,163
that can link kidney,
heart and liver,

741
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,247
even the rage.

742
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,707
Then why can't we find it?

743
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,710
We've looked everywhere
inside this guy.

744
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,212
What if it's not inside?

745
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,688
You know why you're black?

746
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,274
'Cause God loves me
more than he loves you.

747
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,278
Hmm. What I was going for was melanin.
You got lots of it.

748
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,863
Makes your skin dark,

749
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,532
protects you from
the sun's harmful UV rays.

750
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,742
What are you doing?

751
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,243
Unfortunately, it also prevents

752
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,204
even those with advanced
medical degrees

753
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:19,374
from considering melanoma as a diagnosis.
Other hand.

754
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,378
On the rare occasion that black
people do get skin cancer,

755
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,672
they usually get it
on their white parts,

756
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,342
like the palms and
soles of the feet.

757
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,513
But your hands and feet are
so smashed up from football

758
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,182
that my team would
likely have written off

759
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,434
any skin blemish as a bruise.

760
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,022
But now that I know that melanoma
is the only thing that fits...

761
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,443
Come take a look at this, Mom.

762
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:54,409
There's the thorn in the panther's paw.
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

763
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,579
Your body forms antibodies
to fight the tumor.

764
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,542
Those tiny little proteins travel
through your blood and wreak havoc.

765
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,003
We remove the cancerous mole,
everything should be fine.

766
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,965
I'll tell Dr. Chase
to schedule the surgery.

767
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:12,219
Why bother? I missed my shot.

768
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,096
What kind of life
am I gonna lead now?

769
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,890
Did you study really,
really hard?

770
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,602
Then the same crappy life

771
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,022
that the rest of the guys you'll be
graduating with are going to lead,

772
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,191
minus the student loans.

773
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,990
Hey, you ready?

774
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,158
Almost.

775
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,453
And done.

776
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,249
I heard House and Wilson are
getting pranked by someone.

777
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,418
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

778
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,627
No.

779
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,838
And why should I believe you?

780
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,090
You said I had a trusting face.

781
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,719
I still don't understand why you
wouldn't let me retaliate, though.

782
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,304
They stole your dream.

783
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,140
Well, that's overstating it.
It's just a condo.

784
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,768
It's not because you feel
guilty about hurting House?

785
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,770
Or guilty for being with me?

786
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,439
We'll buy another one.

787
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,357
I just don't see the need
to make a war out of it.

788
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,817
Well, I think
you're rationalizing,

789
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,277
which a less confident man
than myself

790
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,405
might take as a sign that
you're second guessing...

791
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,658
Okay. You know what?
Forget that last part.

792
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,913
I heard Foreman and his brother

793
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,123
are trying to work things out.

794
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,208
That's nice for them.

795
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,418
It's nice of you.

796
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,964
You didn't provoke Marcus to
quit so the pranks would stop.

797
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,508
You were becoming the common
enemy they could bond over.

798
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:37,888
You are the diabolical,
yet benevolent puppetmaster.

799
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:42,184
I provoked Marcus to quit because
he was no longer useful to me.

800
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,353
I hired him to get information,
I got information.

801
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,687
Uh-huh.

802
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,773
And how are we going
to get back at Lucas?

803
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,233
We're not.

804
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,611
I win.
