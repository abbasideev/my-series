there's a swamp monster.

[Jess] Well,
you don't know this place.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,765
There's stuff there...
bad stuff.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,267
It was our eggs.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,185
They took our eggs.

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,062
Some of us got infected.

7
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,814
Some of us became sterile.

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,900
[Mary] It's not her.
The body in Minnesota.

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,736
It's someone else.

10
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,237
She's not dead.

11
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,906
[Rose] She already hurt
a girl here. Jess Cairns.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,368
She will never hurt
anyone else again.

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,911
[Emma] I'm making sense
of things,

14
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,329
and I'm starting to remember.

15
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,873
Can you tell me about Theresa?

[both grunt]

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,084
You think I'm gonna let you
keep his baby?

18
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,878
Before it was you and him,

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,588
it was me and him,

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,465
and it's always
gonna be me and him.

That won't help you.

29
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,969
Get away from me.

30
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,221
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

31
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,473
I will tear you to pieces!

I just want to talk to you.

36
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:27,606
Okay?

37
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,191
And then...

38
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,027
And then I'm... I'm gonna go.

00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,074
It doesn't have to be so bad,
okay?

41
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,535
Just tell me
what I want to know.

Let me get in this peeper.

Okay. Okay, that's good,
that's good.

51
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,939
That's good.

61
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,834
This will all be so much easier
if you just...

62
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,878
relax.

63
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,214
You want to start?

64
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,469
My boss has a lot
of questions for you.

65
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,554
Your boss?

66
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,568
So, you took
Mrs. Barlow's daughter,

67
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,030
and you killed her
with your boyfriend?

68
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,909
-No.
-Yeah. You did.

69
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,412
You... You helped him
with all of his women.

70
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,747
No. I never helped him.

71
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,624
Who are you?

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,835
Why are you doing this?

00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,684
You've been lied to.

76
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,436
She doesn't lie.

77
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,521
Misled. She's misled you.

78
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,606
I loved Kit.

79
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:15,983
-I loved him.
-Mm-hmm.

80
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,109
That's all I did.

81
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
I never took her daughter.

82
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,779
-Oh, shut up.
-I didn't help him.

83
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:21,864
I didn't know.
I didn't do anything.

84
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,781
Shut up!

85
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,991
It's true.

86
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,326
Everything she's told you
about me...

87
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,996
-It's her daughter.
-Shut up!

88
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,957
You don't have to
be this person.

89
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,667
You don't have to do this.

90
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,636
Yeah, but, look.

91
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,433
If I let you go,

92
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,519
you're gonna tell on me.

93
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,439
Yes, Emma-Karen, yes, you will.

94
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,608
You'll pick up the phone
the minute I walk out that door.

95
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,942
You're gonna call the police.

96
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,862
You're gonna say
what I look like and where I am,

97
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,238
and then they're gonna
put me back

98
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,490
in that stinking place again.

99
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,824
I won't do that.

100
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:07,910
I won't.

101
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,747
Because I know what it's like

102
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,041
to be on the inside
of that place

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,460
when you don't deserve to be.

104
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,254
I know that, John.

105
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,511
I wouldn't do that to you.

106
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,887
I wouldn't do that to you.

Do you promise?

109
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,684
I promise.

110
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,857
That's a frightened promise.

We can be a family.

I'm gonna do?

00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,594
She was with Kit

189
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,640
before he was with me.

190
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,558
Bullshit.

191
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,560
Your picture,
the gas station in Nevada,

192
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,937
that was them...

193
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,356
falling in love.

194
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,566
-Bullshit!
-[gunshot]

195
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,737
No cellphone, no credit card,
no bank withdrawals,

196
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,072
no contact with anyone
at anytime.

197
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,240
She didn't need it!

198
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,536
You think my daughter
just fell in love

199
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,954
and ran away

200
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,540
and didn't bother to call me?

201
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,877
You think I believe that
for a second?

202
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,714
That is not who she was!

203
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,465
That's who she became!

204
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,470
That's who she became.

205
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,856
[breathing shakily]

206
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,864
[Emma] Mary.

207
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,615
She's a murderer.

208
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,285
She killed that missing girl.

209
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,872
Amy Walker. I walked in on it.

210
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,040
-I saw it.
-My daughter is a murderer?

211
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:25,295
My daughter is the kindest girl
you would ever know.

212
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,047
You think I'm gonna believe that
for a minute?

213
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,758
You're just saying that
to save yourself.

214
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,884
She tried to kill me.

215
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,886
-She did.
-[scoffs]

216
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,722
And what happened that night,
it's what blocked my memories.

217
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,141
But they've come back to me now
[stammers] in pieces,

218
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,477
in these, like, nightmares.

219
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,730
If your daughter is still
out there, Mary,

220
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,315
God help anyone
who comes across her.

221
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,275
Don't say that.
Don't you say that.

222
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,068
Your daughter,
she's the monster.

223
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,237
She ruined my life.

224
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,365
You ruined your own life
when you fell for him.

225
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,118
All those people you talked to
about Theresa...

226
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,287
did they tell you
what she would say?

227
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,873
How she... How she tried to...

228
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,667
quit swimming
and you wouldn't let her?

229
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,794
I didn't make her swim.

230
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,753
[Emma] No, you did. You did.

231
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,421
You liked being the booster.

232
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,173
You liked her being
[stammers] a champion.

233
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,257
For her.

234
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,592
Not for me.

235
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,969
She was 13 when it started.

236
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,638
She was eight.

237
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,641
You don't even have
your story straight.

238
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,269
I'm not talking about swimming.

239
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,819
And every time
she wanted to quit,

240
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,320
you made her go back.

241
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,030
You made her go back to it.

242
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,325
No.

243
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:39,828
No.

244
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,372
Not my daughter.
Not my daughter.

245
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,124
You think you lost her
seven years ago.

246
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,710
I think it was a long time
before that.

247
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,841
Go ask.

248
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,010
Ask Honey.

249
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,556
She said she left everything
with someone named Honey.

250
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,349
I don't know what that means.

251
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,644
All I know is I had
to fight for my life

252
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,647
because of your daughter.

253
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,743
Mary.

254
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,247
The truth is the only
way forward.

255
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,292
What you do,

256
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:28,918
your work,

257
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,840
it's about compassion.

258
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,179
Tell the truth, Mary.

259
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,808
Tell the truth.

260
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,823

[Kit] "Beloved Theresa...

268
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,402
I wonder how nose piercings

269
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,945
would affect a blow
to the face.

270
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,239
...of tattooing butterflies
on drunk girls.

271
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,449
She picked the jewelry
herself...

272
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,533
...imagine how their bones

273
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,951
would snap
after a sudden blow...

274
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,244
...only for me
to crush it to death.

...This doesn't mean
that I don't love you...

...smashed straight
into her sinuses...

277
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,666
...suppose I express my loving.

278
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,418
I'll draw you a picture
in different ways.

279
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,377
If you ever feel down,

280
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,795
just think about
how much better

281
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,548
you feel in a few months,
when you leave it all behind.

282
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,799
Hope love
is treating you better.

I'm, uh...

I'm about to bury her,

For 300 years,

this night has commemorated
the saints who watch over us...

319
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,785
St. Jerome,

320
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,912
who protects our children,

321
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,956
and St. James,

322
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,833
who protects our dead.

323
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,460
And now,

00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,465

and of our hearts.

[crowd screaming]

333
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,156
Where you been?

334
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,325
I was with a patient.

335
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,453
You going somewhere?

336
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,747
I'm gonna take a break
for a while.

337
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:45,998
A break?

338
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,251
What are you talking about?
Like a vacation?

339
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,628
'Cause if...
if you need a vacation,

340
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,505
-you should discuss it...
-A break from you, Pete.

341
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,340
I need a break from you.

342
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,891
She isn't lying
and she isn't crazy.

Emma.

344
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,813
It's still happening there,
at St. Jerome.

345
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,273
You told me it was over.

346
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,692
We made a promise to walk away

347
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,653
and to never
let ourselves go back.

348
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,364
But I don't think you ever left,
did you, Pete?

349
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,866
I was never
in that storm shelter.

350
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,327
And you never lived there
as a kid,

351
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,829
so I don't know
how you would have played

352
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,288
war games in there.

353
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,416
It's not my book.

354
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,335
So, if it's not my book
and I was never there,

355
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,838
then whose is it
and who was in the shelter?

356
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,800
I know you don't believe
any of this

357
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,511
because it's crazy.

358
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,180
You're building these stories
in your head

359
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,849
that make absolutely no sense.

I don't know if we'll be back.

363

[Mary] For seven years,
I have turned to you

364
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,325
and shared every hope,

365
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,037
every fragile
shred of information

366
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,457
that could lead to the truth
about Theresa.

367
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:14,420
Four years ago,
when Christopher Parker

368
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,590
and Karen Miller were arrested,

369
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,258
I thought, "Finally...

370
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,677
Finally, I would have
my answer."

371
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:27,099
And when Christopher Parker
took his own life, I was...

372
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,935
I was scared that the truth
would die with him.

373
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:31,979
[camera shutter clicks]

374
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,272
But I didn't...

375
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,569
I couldn't give up.

376
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:45,117
So, I kept... I kept going,
I kept believing that, uh,

377
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,120
that the woman
who shared his life

378
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,956
had to know something more,

379
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,792
had... had to know
what happened.

380
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,466
And I was right.

381
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,845
Because today I got my answer.

382
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,476
[sniffles]

383
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,603
Karen Miller...

384
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,155
Karen Miller

385
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,325
brutally attacked me

386
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:30,287
after confessing
to the killing of Amy Walker

387
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,457
and many, many others.

388
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,503
She was not only complicit
in the crimes

389
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,257
of Christopher Parker,
she was willing and active.

390
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,803
Who knows how many other acts
of violence she has committed?

391
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,267
Karen Miller is... is...
is dangerous and violent

392
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,646
and living in the town
of St. James, Louisiana,

393
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,816
under the new name of Emma Hall.

394
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,443
And I demand justice now

395
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,321
for Karen Miller
to answer for these crimes

396
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,991
and for the disappearance
of my daughter,

397
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,910
Theresa Elizabeth Barlow.

398
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,996
[reporters clamoring]

399
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,749
[sirens wailing]

400
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,048
[crying]

401
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,069
[growls, screams]

402
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,865
[Mary] She was not
only complicit in the crimes

403
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,493
of Christopher Parker,
she was willing and active.

404
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,497
Karen Miller is dangerous
and violent

405
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,335
and living in the town
of St. James, Louisiana,

406
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,630
under the new name
of Emma Hall.

407
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,881
She's lying.

408
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,508
No, she's lying. She's lying.

409
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,760
She's lying.

410
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:09,928
Emma...

411
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,515
No, I have to go. Oh, God.
Oh, God! She's lied!

412
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,642
And we'll prove it.

413
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:15,893
-No.
-We'll prove it.

414
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,478
No, I have to go.
I can't be here anymore.

415
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,396
No. No. No. No.

416
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:20,939
Emma, you're not leaving me.

417
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:22,941
You can't go.

418
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,443
I can keep you safe.

419
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,487
Trust me.

420
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,864
I will keep you safe.

421
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,283
You can't.

422
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,662
No one can.

423
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,423
[crying]

424
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,147
[line ringing]

425
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,150
This is Emma.
Leave me a message.

426
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,777
[sobbing]

427
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,863
She's come back.

428
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,032
Jess. She's all wet

429
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,784
and she's bloated
from the swamp,

430
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,703
and I didn't want to hurt her.

431
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,246
I just wanted to shut her up

432
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,498
and make her stop talking
about my daddy.

433
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,755
You don't need to talk to her.

434
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,634
I'm gonna make
everything go away.

435
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,553
You understand me?

436
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,569
I did it for you, Daddy.

437
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,405
I know you did.

438
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,867
She was saying
those terrible things about you,

439
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,994
about things you've done.

440
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:01,623
You brought pain on yourself
to honor your daddy.

441
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,835
And now I'm gonna honor you.

442
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,839
They were all lies,
weren't they, Daddy?

443
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,426
They were all lies.

444
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,770
God forgive you
for what you've done.

445
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,231
Get away from her.

446
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,316
Don't you take her.

447
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,318
You are not fit to raise her.

448
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,491
You said they were all lies.

449
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,428
[insects chirping]

450
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,195
[Mary] Oh, Saul.

451
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,473
[gasps]

452
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,519
Oh, no.

453
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,146
Oh, no.

454
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:57,948
[whimpering]

455
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,918
Oh, Jakey...

456
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,297
Oh, no, no, no.

457
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,882
[crying]

458
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,227
You swore her body
would never come back.

459
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:31,148
But here she is,
back up for all to see.

460
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,317
Now I got to put things right.

461
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,360
I got to go see your girl

462
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,821
'cause she's gonna take
the fall, you understand me?

463
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,615
She's gonna take the fall

464
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,283
for how you messed this up.

465
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,868
What do you mean "my girl"?

466
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,871
You brought a child-killer
to the bayou, Peter.

467
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,331
Who do you think I mean?

468
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,749
Don't you touch her.

469
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,919
I've done everything
you ever asked me to do.

470
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,045
Everything.

471
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:54,796
I want out of this.

472
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,882
I want out of this, Bodie.

473
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,842
You're never getting out.

474
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,594
Neither is she.

475
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,979
[Bodie] Karen Miller?

476
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,065
Come on, now.

477
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,025
It's gonna be alright.

478
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:19,571
I know you can't live with what
you did to that little girl,

479
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,406
so I'm gonna deliver you.

480
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,916
Karen.

481
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,922
Come on now, Karen Miller.

482
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,842
It's gonna be alright.

483
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,098
Come to Jesus, baby.

484
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,108
No, you come to Jesus...

485
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,694
Baby.

486
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:19,840
Wasn't sure you'd come.

487
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,926
Last time I saw you,
you were so...

488
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,346
angry at me and my actions.

489
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,641
Mary, that was about you
in the context of the swim team,

490
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,518
not you as a person.

491
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,855
So, you were just
protecting the girls, huh?

492
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,191
Yeah, that's all
I ever try to do.

493
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,527
But none of that matters.

494
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,530
I saw the press conference.
My God.

495
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,490
Just tell me
what you need from me.

496
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,787
I want to show you something.

497
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,251
It's, um, it's a journal

498
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:58,837
of my daughter's.

499
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,300
[Ed] Theresa kept a journal?

500
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,263
[gunshot]

501
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,231
[knock on door]

502
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,403
Can I help you?

503
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,447
I'm Karen.

504
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:12,119
Esther said that...
that you would keep her safe,

505
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,162
and I am so grateful.

506
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:16,915
I just...

507
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,210
I just want to see her.

508
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,879
Even if it's just five minutes.

509
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,589
You don't have to tell her
who I am.

510
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,424
I don't want to unsettle her.
I just need to...

511
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,928
I just need to see her. Please.

512
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,638
No, no, she warned me
about this.

513
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,474
She said you'd come
and you'd say this.

514
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,059
Who... Who said that? Esther?

515
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,811
No.

516
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,188
I'm taking about
Freya's birth mother, Karen.

517
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,606
No, I'm Karen.

518
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm Karen. No. No. No.

519
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,360
-Karen came last week...
-I'm Karen.

520
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,571
...to take her home,
just like Esther wanted.

521
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,905
I'm Karen.

522
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,658
-This is Karen.
-I'm Karen.

523
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,535
-No, I'm Ka--
-This is Karen.

524
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,621
Karen's been visiting Freya
since she was tiny.

525
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,582
Freya's gone.

526
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,420
[Emma] Freya!

527
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,381
Freya!

528
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,383
Freya!

529
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,641
[Kit] Where is she? Our baby?

530
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,435
I asked you to bring her.

531
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,187
She's safe.

532
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:22,898
Well, I need to see her.
[exhales sharply]

533
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,067
You can't.

534
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,571
Kit, I saw her.

535
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,285
I saw that woman.

536
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,997
Her skull was...
[voice breaking]

537
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,959
was beaten in.

538
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,546
You can't ever tell.

539
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,632
Then we lose everything.

540
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,718
You, me, our baby girl.

541
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,221
Please.

542
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,724
Karen, promise me
you have her safe.

543
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,561
[grunts]

544
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,149
[whispers] Now you need
to forget her.

545
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:08,693
Forget us.

546
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,242
[siren wailing]

547
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,702
[officer over speaker] Suspect,
get on the ground.

548
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,748
Face down. Stay down.

549
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,001
[Kit] Then you'll never be safe.

550
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,753
Neither will she.

551
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,713
Never.

552
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,674
Never.

553
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,760
[dramatic music playing]

554
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,872
[Emma] You are what I lost
all those years ago.

555
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,710
You are what I've been
trying to get back to.

556
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,920
I won't lose you again.

557
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,756
I won't have you hear the lies,

558
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:15,427
have you believe
what others say about me.

559
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,556
I'm not the person
they've made me into.

560
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,644
Their lies have made
a nightmare of my life,

561
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,274
and now I'll make
a nightmare of theirs.

562
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,320
And I will find you,

563
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,031
no matter what I have to do.

564
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,782
[engine starting]

565
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,100
[Theresa humming]

566
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,576
Did I ever tell you
you look just like your daddy?

567
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,873
You say that every time.

568
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:38,343
[Theresa] It's just you
and me now, for always.
