1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,465
You got dreams?

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,927
To go back and be with someone
I don't have anymore.

3
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,598
Does she still have her stone...

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:15,683
for the lake?

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,811
She needs to throw
those sins away.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,312
[Van over phone] I checked
on your landlord.

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,897
He did work at St. Jerome,

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,315
but his license was suspended.

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,984
[Emma] This place,
it's really mine?

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:25,985
It's my cabin.

11
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,570
[Emma] It's you...

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,697
you who's been lying to me.

13
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,240
Your daughter's beautiful.

14
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,491
I want to stay with you.

15
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:33,909
Go home.

16
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,369
[Gayle] Grandma Moses...

17
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,663
She gave her life to those kids.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,498
[Mary] I know she phones you.

19
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,208
I know you know where she is.

20
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,543
You'll never find her.

21
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,338
And that's the only time
my Karen's ever coming home,

22
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,340
is to kiss my coffin.

23
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,559
[man on radio] ...federal agency
is restructuring,

24
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,271

[indistinct talking on radio]

26
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:13,991
Hi.

27
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,042
My sweet girl.

28
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,586
...which ranks third nationally
for the number of...

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,087
You look good.

30
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,088
New dress?

31
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,049
You bet it is.

32
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,427
I'm here for someone special,
you know.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,931
You keep counting down the days.

34
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,934
When I get out,

35
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,687
the first thing I'm gonna do...

36
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,608
...is your hair.

37
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,860
[laughing]

38
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,446
And I'm gonna leave it
till you're home.

39
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,740
No one else can do it, anyhow.

40
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,243
You're a good person.

41
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,330
I love you
from the bottom of my heart

42
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,083
to the end of the world
and back again.

43
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,129
[whispering] Are we safe?

44
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,968
Did you keep us safe?

45
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,722
[crying]

46
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,601

[woman over radio]
National Weather Service

00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,612
is predicting heavy rainfall
throughout Minnesota,

00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,614
as much as six to eight inches
up north.

50
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,575
[woman continues
speaking indistinctly]

51
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,456
Bring it.

52
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,093
[man on TV
speaking indistinctly]

53
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,928
...is our down pillows.

54
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,973
Our down pillows
are extraordinarily soft,

55
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,642
luxurious, and long-lasting.

56
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,186
Choose from a wide selection
of styles,

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,022
densities, and shapes,

58
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,192
including bolster pillows,
body pillows, and bed rests.

59
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,905
For the ultimate in...

60
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,990
[cellphone vibrating]

61
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,791
[John] Oh, I don't know.
You're the professional.

62
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,876
[Samantha] It fits great.

63
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,503
You look...dashing.
[John chuckles]

64
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,631
That's not a word
you hear every day.

65
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,632
Oh, there she is.

66
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:35,925
Mary, Samantha.

67
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,885
Best salesperson
in all of Minnesota.

68
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,802
You're so sweet.

69
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,471
[John] And I am sold.

70
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,474
Can you excuse us?

71
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,309
Sure.

72
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,730
-What was that?
-You said you had an emergency.

73
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,440
I don't have anything to wear.

74
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,192
Maybe that's more of a crisis.

75
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,443
Don't play games.

76
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,236
You were very rude
to Samantha just now.

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,404
That is not a good look on you.

78
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,824
[stammers] You do not skip
meetings with me, John.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,493
I hired you.

80
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,994
Well, then let me do my work.

81
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,121
And you should know
that I believe in kindness,

82
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,456
especially when it comes
to people

83
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,499
in the service industry.

84
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,084
You might want to apologize
to Samantha.

85
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,502
Now you're lecturing me?

86
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,796
My mom worked in cosmetics

87
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,632
and she told me horrible stories
about customer rudeness.

88
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,218
You're no-nonsense, like my mom.

89
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,221
You have that same expression,
sense of style.

90
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,724
She was an amazing
shopping companion.

91
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:26,892
But she was kinder.

92
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,063
And she used to look at me
just that way.

93
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,401
I loved getting caught
in her stare.

94
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,990
This suit will help me blend in.

95
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,992
You want me to blend in,
don't you, Mary?

96
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,785
I want you to find her!

97
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,578
Yeah, and when I do?
What is your plan?

98
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,000
What I do is none
of your business.

99
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,042
Because you spoke with her.

100
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,336
-Before. Didn't you?
-What?

101
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,504
When she was in jail.

102
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:56,672
How do you know that?

103
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,215
It's just my work.

104
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,843
I was a different person then.
I have different questions now.

105
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,345
So you do believe in change,
Mary?

106
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,515
That we can become
better versions of ourselves?

107
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,190
Esther Moses? Yeah?

108
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,868

109
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,470

I'm making splashes.

117
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,678
You are.

118
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,722
And your lovely hat,

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,891
your little cat hat.

120
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,850
I love it.

121
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:19,935
Me too.

122
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,951
Do you like kittens?

123
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,495
Yes. Kittens are fun.

124
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,498
I have a kitten.

125
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,457
Where?

126
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,544
In my truck.

127
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,671
Mommy loves kitties.

128
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,755
Yeah.

129
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,842
Yeah, she does.

130
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,142
Mommy! [door opens]

-[woman] What is it, honey?
-[door closes]

132
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,728
I want to meet the kitty.

133
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,104
Where?

134
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,066
[laughs] Slow down!

135
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,695
Where? Where?

136
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,697
It was right here?

137
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,940
You've reached Jake.
Leave me a message.

139
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,404
Hi. It's me,
just... just checking in.

140

I... I broke the rules,
using my phone.

141
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,871
Uh, anyway,
the break's been, uh, great.

142
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,290
The spa is super relaxing.

I'm about to get a, um...

00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,963
a uh... uh, deep-tissue massage
right now.

145
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,341
I have nothing to complain
about. [chuckles]

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,468
Wow, I feel so cheated.

147
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,389
Except I miss you.

148
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,143
So there's that.

149
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,607
Okay. I love you.
I'll see you soon.

00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,015
[Bodie] Hey, Pumpkin.

153
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,319
I don't care
that you're hiding out.

154
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,698
I want to hide out with you.

155
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,161
Hey.

156
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,917
Why would you want to hide out?

157
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,002
---Move over.

[sighs]

159
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,798
I reckon...

160
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,010
today's just one of those days.

161
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,846
What's going on?

162
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,311
Nothing.

163
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,980
Don't make me read your mind.

164
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,734
[humming]

165
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,110
Don't.

[continues humming]

167
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,073
Stop.

168
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,699
Stop!

169
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,619
All right.

170
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,704
On one condition...

171
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,456
that you escort me to lunch.

172
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm not hungry.

173
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,544
---Nuh-uh. You're always hungry.

174
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,504
And my day just freed up.

175
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,971
[humming]

[cellphone ringing, vibrating]

177
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,280
John?

178
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,573
[John] She wasn't
at the funeral.

179
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,157
Did you stay the whole time?

180
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,077
You aren't trying to tell me
how to do my job, are you?

181
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,580
E-Excuse me?

182
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:32,914
I have other options.

183
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,418
I-I don't want options.
I want assurances.

184
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,377
Yeah, me too.

185
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,296
I'm sorry?

189

190
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,107
Hey, John?

191
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,525
Yes, Mary.

192
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,776
You want to hear something?

193
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,279
Yes, Mary.

194
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,866
When my son was younger,
he had a bit of a phase.

195
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,993
He went from being
my perfect little boy

196
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,287
to this kid
who painted his room black

197
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,248
and told me I represented
a patriarchal society

198
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,834
obsessed with money
and the enslavement of others.

199
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,960
Did he have a point?

200
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,795
So I cut off his allowance.

201
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,508
And, pretty soon, we didn't need
to have that conversation again.

202
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,802
I'm starting to feel
kind of sorry for Jake.

203
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,057
It was "Jake," wasn't it?

204
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,187
It would take
only one phone call

205
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,772
to your parole officer.

206
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,899
What would you tell them, Mary?

207
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,902
That you gave me a phone
and an expense account

208
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,071
and blackmailed me
to cross state lines?

209
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:48,948
Huh?

210
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,909

-How was your flight?
-It was worth it.

214
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,103
Even if I have to fly
back the same day.

215
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,188
You can't tell anybody
you were here.

216
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,273
The spa would never
let me back in

217

all these rules.

218
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,028

No, I'm serious, though.
I'm serious.

You were never in Minnesota.
You never saw me.

You can't tell anybody.

talk to me about that stuff.

You know, about Theresa.

-C-Calm down. Relax. Emma. Emma.
-How did you find me?

There are rules. We have rules.

248

I am done with your rules.

249
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,187
You put yourself in danger
coming here.

-Do you understand me?
-The only danger...

251

I used to be a counselor
at St. Jerome house.

273
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,746
There was a girl there.

274
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,331
We had a connection.

275
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,374
At the time, I was 25.

276
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,709
She was 16.

277
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,086
But nothing ever happened.
Nothing. Ever.

278
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,339
Why'd they fire you?

279
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,966
Well, when the state found out
how close we were,

280
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,676
they banned me.

281
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,012
That was 15 years ago.

282

I never went back, ever,
until you asked me to,

283
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,724

284

What about the book?

285

Book? There was a book,
writing in it.

A girl's handwriting
all over it.

287
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,856
She drew a monster.
She was clearly scared.

288
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,983
Hell, yeah, she was scared.
She hated that place.

289
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,653
She felt trapped there.

290

She didn't trust them.

She trusted me.

292
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,285
When she ran away,
I made the mistake

293
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,537
of letting her stay
at the cabin.

294
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,791
That's why I got fired.

There were markings on the wall.

00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,566
You want to pretend
like you're on top of this,

366
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,402
but you just keep stalling.

367
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,907
I'm starting to think you're
just playing games with me,

368
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,659
like you don't really know
how to do this job.

369
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,037
Does it feel like it's too much?

370
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,333
Failure's not a good look
on you, John.

371
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,459
Don't say that, Mary.

372
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,337
I prefer "Mrs. Barlow."

373
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,589
Oh, yeah?
But I really know you now.

374
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,506
So...

375
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,718
it's gonna be Mary.

376
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,098
Wow, you keep popping that gum
like my friend Andrea Black.

377
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,975
She was nervous, too.

378
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,436
I tried to tell her
about Meditation Alley.

379
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,562
She wouldn't listen.

380
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,147
It's really funny,

381
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,899
you reminding me of my mom
this morning

382
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,901
and Andrea Black right now.

383
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,402
Oh, stop this shit.

384
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,906
I want to see Karen Miller
by the end of the day,

385
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,741
and then I think
you and I are done.

386
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,785
-We're not gonna be done.
-[gasps]

387
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,372
Because I would
miss you too much.

388
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,541
Stop chewing!

389
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,293
Now, swallow it!

390
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,795
Now, swallow it!

391
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,714
Swallow it.

392
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,474
[spits]

393
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,352
Get out of my car.

394
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,610
That's a good girl.

395
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:11,988
[car door opens]

396
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,618
-[gasps]
-[lock clicks]

397
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,709
[sobs]

398
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,053
[keys clacking]

399
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,651
[keys clacking]

400
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,455
But I met him

401
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,167
maybe about a month before.

402
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,338
He did, uh,
housekeeping at my block.

403
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,758
I think I said good morning.

404
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,511
He said that I ignored him,

405
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,890
but I'm not that kind of person.

406
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,768
He took one of the master keys.

407
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,771
And I woke up.

408
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,068
And he was beside my bed.

409
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,198
Masturbating.

410
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,035
I just...

411
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,915
I knew he was gonna rape me.

412
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,798
There was this blackness
in his eyes, this power.

413
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,343
He had all my... my power.

414
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,638
He took all my power.

415
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:05,893
He used a fake name

416
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,062
at the job, so,

417
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:10,815
they never caught him.

418
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,738
But I can...

419
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,660
I can still smell his sweat...

420
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,915
...and his weight on top of me.

421
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,338
And in my dreams, he's...

422
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,092
...he's there.

423
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,012
He's always there.

424
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,104
[indistinct talking]

425
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,657
[man] Can I help you, ma'am?

426
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,453
I want a gun.

427
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,622
Something...

428
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,624
basic.

429
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,044
Okay, then.

430
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,087
[gun clicking]

431
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,010
[gun clicks]

432
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,058
[gun clicks]

433
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,439
Pick 'em up. See how
they feel in your hand.

434
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,908
That's a nice one right there.
I got a couple of those myself.

435
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,577
They're great
for concealed carry.

436
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,621
They're actually more reliable
than the revolver.

437
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,706
Nice polymer frame.

438
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,250
If you load the magazine,
you got eight,

439
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,292
and then one in the chamber.

440
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,461
These guns are super popular.

441
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,630
Easy to draw. Easy to holster.

442
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,966
You can't go wrong
with any one of those.

443
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,720
What... What will
you use it for?

444
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,392
Protection.

445
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,230
[birds chirping]

446
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,796
[doorknob rattles]

447
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:43,921
Emma...

448
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,924
what are we doing out here?

449
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,021
I didn't come back

450
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,024
just to say goodbye
to Esther, Pete.

451
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:05,901
Okay.

452
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,779
I came to get my little girl.

453
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,616
[breathing heavily]

454
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,293
[groaning]

455
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,015
[gasps]

456
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,737
[woman vocalizing]

457
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,450
[groaning]

458
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,002
[inaudible]

459
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,103
[vocalizing continues]

460
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,401
[Emma] I named her Freya.

461
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,154
[vocalizing continues]

462
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,866
[baby crying]

463
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,260
She's beautiful, Pete.

464
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,680
She has my eyes.

465
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,812
I knew I had to keep her safe.

466
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,231
No, I don't know.

467
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,819
I know something happened.

468
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,736
I...

469
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,366
I don't know why I had Freya
out here with Esther.

470
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,831
She said she just
found me out here.

471
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,793
She's the only one
who knew where my baby was.

472
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,169
With a couple.

473
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,047
Someone that she'd fostered
years ago.

474
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,261
But it was only meant to be
until I could come back for her.

475
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,933
I don't know who I am...

476
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,979
who I can be...

477
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,315
without her.

478
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,028
Will you help me?

479
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,112
Yes.

480
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,698
I'm always gonna do
my best by you.

481
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:46,121
It'll be hard and strange.

482
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,414
She only knows them, but...

483
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,634
No.

484
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,595
No, Pete.

485
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,765
No. Esther, she always
made it very clear

486
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,560
it was only until
I could come back for her.

487
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:09,978
Emma. I am...

488
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,439
No. No.

489
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,815
-I'm not leaving without her.
-I'm not asking...

490
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,777
Emma, I'm not asking you
to leave her permanently.

491
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,278
I came back for her.

492
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,196
I understand that,

493
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,031
but there's a right way
to do this

494
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,324
and a wrong way.

495
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,119
I'll help you get Freya back,
but not today, not yet.

496
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,875
Now, what you can do
is get yourself ready for her.

497
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,377
Get yourself together.

498
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,671
And, more importantly,
keep yourself together.

499
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,259
I will go see every judge
that I need to go see.

500
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,719
I pro... Emma, look at me. Emma.

501
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,013
Emma, I'm gonna stand by you.

502
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,350
You have to trust me right now.

503
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,312
[voice breaking]
I can't leave her here.

504
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,691
I can't leave her here.

505
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,320
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

506
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,780
looking over your shoulder,

507
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,865
waiting for that knock
on the door,

508
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,784
or dreading the day
that they finally come

509
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,910
to take her away.

510
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,579
Come back to St. James with me.

511
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,959
Come back, and I promise
I'll get you Freya back.

512
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,044
But we have to do it
the right way.

513
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,422
Emma, you could live the life
that you want to live,

514
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,340
but you have to trust me.

515
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,934
[sniffles]

516
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,528
"We put our sins...

[sighs heavily]

518
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,661
...our mistakes into a stone...

519
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,080
...one at a time.

520
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,708
Cast them into this lake

521

with an open heart.

522
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,005
When they fall...

523
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,634
we are free.

524
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,139
Free from our sins.

525
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,434
Free from the past."

526
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,436
Free from the past, huh?

527
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,815
Well, then give me
a goddamn stone.

528
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,093
[singsong voice] I found you.

529
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,360
[softly] Look at you.

-You are a cutie.

You have her?

540
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,525
It's nice to hear you, Mary.
How are you?

541
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:27,652
You have Karen Miller?

542
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,573
She did not show.

543
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,661
Okay.

544
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,414
Are you heartbroken, Mary?

545
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,341
You came across her, didn't you,
my friend Andrea Black?

546

You must've, from your silence.

00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,309
Oh, I love this intimacy...

548
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,354
both so, so familiar
with each other.

549
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,486
I know what you did, Mary.

550
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:15,867
Oh, yeah?

551
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:18,703
What do you know?

552
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,289
What, are you gonna play games?

553
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,041
[line disconnects]

554
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:26,586
[cellphone closes]

555
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,190
[cat meowing]

556
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,441
Hi, you.

557
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:49,359
[meowing]

558
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,485
[hiss, meowing]

559
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,787
[shushing]

560
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,458
I'll drive you back.

561
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,836
I got here by myself.

562
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,338
Okay.

563
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:17,220
[sighs]

564
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,118
[screaming]

565
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,677
[breathing heavily]

566
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,020
[gunshot]

567
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,008
[clicking tongue]

568
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:37,926
Bitty?

569
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,348
Where are you?

570
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,480
There you are.

571
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,025
Hi.

572
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,653
I know I left you alone
for a while.

573
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,570
I'm sorry.

574
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,867
You lost your collar?

575
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:04,828
Huh?
