1
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:06,340
[Emma] It wasn't
a hallucination.

2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,259
It happened, Pete.
This happened.

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,222
I can't just show up there
and start asking questions

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,516
about a girl that you think
went missing.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,059
[Van] I checked
on your landlord.

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,602
He did work at St. Jerome.

7
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,271
But his license was suspended.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,856
[Kamala]
Mother to mother.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,524
Parker didn't kill
our daughter.

10
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,900
[Mary]
How can you know that?

11
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,027
Because Parker told me.

12
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,571
[Kit] The most
dangerous part of me

13
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,322
isn't even in this prison cell.

14
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,575
Someone worse than me
is still out there.

15
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,744
You copied
a private recording

16
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:35,703
of a conversation.

17
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,914
[Gayle] Grandma Moses
fostered so many kids,

18
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,625
but she couldn't save
that one.

19
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,003
Your secret is safe.

20
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,129
I love you.

21
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,383
[Esther] Will you take
the wolf out, please?

22
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,636
[door buzzes]

23
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,516
Karen?
I'm Pete Guillory.

24
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,977
I'm very glad you agreed
to meet me.

25
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,315
I don't feel
I had much choice.

26
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,152
The FBI, uh, has been known
to be a bit pushy.

27
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,572
So they asked me
to come talk to you,

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,407
to see if you remember
anything else.

29
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,077
You've been here
barely two weeks.

30
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,623
I'll bet you every minute feels
like an hour, doesn't it?

31
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,459
You don't get to choose
what you eat, when you sleep.

32
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,670
One moment all the lights
are on, and the next, well,

33
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,297
all you have is total darkness.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,803
As long as you're in here,
no choice will ever be yours.

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,390
You came to tell me things
I already know?

36
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,352
No one likes to think
they got it wrong

37
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,938
about someone they trusted,
someone they loved.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,568
Loving a bad person
doesn't make you a bad person.

39
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,320
Who are you?

40
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,490
I'm a psychiatrist.
I work with Witness Protection.

41
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,325
I make psychological
assessments.

42
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,619
My job is to determine
whether or not

43
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,746
someone like you is, well...

44
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,833
is right for the program.

45
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,795
You think I'm crazy?

46
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,464
No. I do think you have PTSD.

47
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,092
That's why you pull
your hair out.

48
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,720
It's also why you don't remember
everything that happened

49
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,681
between you and Parker,
which is unfortunate,

50
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,600
because if you did and you could
help us with other cases,

51
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,854
I'd get you out of here a whole
hell of a lot faster than, uh...

52
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,689
than seven years.

53
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,567
I could give you a new life.

54
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,612
I want my old life back.

55
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,366
And I've said everything
I remember.

56
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:45,875
[knock on door]

57
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,628
Karen? Louise.
I'm next door.

58
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,132
-Hi.
-Hey.

59
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,134
You doing okay?
Need anything?

60
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,345
Cup of sugar,
orientation day?

61
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,055
It's a lot to get used to.

62
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,015
Yeah.

63
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,518
But I was playing,
about the cup of sugar.

64
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,312
Right.

65
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,772
You want me to take that
to the mail room for you?

66
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,400
-Oh, no, I'm not done.
-I'll take it.

67
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,485
Is this to him?

68
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,529
Get out.

69
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,448
Beg your pardon?

70
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,242
It's not your business
who I'm writing.

71
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,411
Huh.

72
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,956
I said you should get out.
[groans]

73
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,961
See, we all got daughters
on the outside.

74
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,297
And women like you,
helping out men like him...

75
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,342
Well, that makes us sick
to our stomachs.

76
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,261
I didn't help him.

77
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,097
Yo, this bitch done
so much lying

78
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,557
she's starting to believe it.

79
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,226
We gonna help you remember.

80
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,687
[phone rings]

81
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,733
[Pete] Hello?

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,611
It's Karen.

83
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,489
I've changed my mind.

84
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,575
I'm ready to talk.

85
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,289
[drill whirs]

86
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,304
[sighs]

87
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,348
Something happen
out here, miss?

88
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,770
I just... I live alone.
I want to feel safe.

89
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,147
At least you got a kitty.

90
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,691
[cat meows]

91
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,318
Excuse me a moment.
I got to shut you in.

92
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,454
Kit? Kit, they've got
cotton candy, clouds of it,

93
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,415
and they're
just giving it away.

94
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,126
Why, that is the best news
I've heard all day.

95
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,670
How about you go and get
the biggest cloud

96
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,422
you can carry
and bring it back to me?

97
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,799
No, I'll wait.
I'll wait till you're finished.

98
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,259
We can go together.

99
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,136
I'm gonna be a while here.

100
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,516
Go get me some
cotton candy, baby.

101
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,648
Hurry up.

102
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,866
[theme music playing]

103
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,809
Oh, God.

104
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,022
Jake?

105
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,109
You okay?

106
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,779
Have you seen all this?
Are you on this thread?

107
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,325
Don't look at it.
Just... leave it.

108
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,826
And do nothing?

109
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,496
No, I got to call her.

110
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,664
I got to tell her
that I'm sorry.

111
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,542
I was so careful
with that upload.

112
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,377
I did not put on
the marriage part,

113
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,754
just that one moment.

114
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,797
It was her moment.

115
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,216
You stole a recording

116
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,927
that was so private
and so personal,

117
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,471
and you shared it
with everyone.

118
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,017
I don't think you can
apologize for this.

119
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,685
I never meant to hurt
or damage them.

120
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,271
I just... I just wanted
to make it count.

121
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,650
It doesn't matter, Mom,
your reasons, your validation.

122
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,822
No, I got to go see Kamala.
I can't leave it.

123
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,949
It's like you
won't hear me. Mom.

124
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,242
Take a break...

125
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,494
from all of it,

126
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,329
but especially
from Karen Miller.

127
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,040
Mom, you got to stop now.

128
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,166
Please.

129
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,638
Are you cold?

130
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,432
There's such a chill
in here.

131
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,853
You know I love the cold.

132
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:24,486
Karen said she loved the cold,
but it was because she thought

133
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,990
I couldn't afford
to buy her that warm coat.

134
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,869
She always worried so much.

135
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,662
That's right.

136
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,207
She was cold,
but she never said.

137
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,462
Has she called?

138
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,174
I don't want to miss the chance
to talk to her next time.

139
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,427
[shushes]

140
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,722
Does she still have
her stone...

141
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,183
for the lake?

142
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,311
When it gets to be too much

143
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,023
and she needs to throw
those sins away,

144
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,526
she'll need to put them
in her stone.

145
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,822
I hope so.

146
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,490
"Don't forget your stone."

147
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,534
How many times
do I tell her?

148
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,330
And that's Elsinor Lake?

149
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,627
Do you need a stone, Roger?

150
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,843
They're looking for her.

151
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,225
Then we'd better
find her first.

152
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,020
[applause]

153
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,149
I told you I wasn't
gonna make no speech

154
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,901
to tell you how much
I love you

155
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,819
'cause don't nobody need
that kind of sentimentality.

156
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,279
[laughter]

157
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,656
But y'all just wouldn't
let it lie.

158
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,199
-[phone vibrates]
-You know, I chose

159
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,618
to go this alone,
just me and my baby.

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,330
But it never felt like alone
'cause y'all never left me,

161
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,373
-not for one minute
-Sorry.

162
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,832
...of this whole journey.

163
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,376
That's right.

164
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,377
These your people, too.

165
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,379
And they love you.

166
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,673
And I love you.

167
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,259
This is your family.

168
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,637
All right, anybody want to
volunteer to give birth for me?

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,264
[laughter]

170
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,224
'Cause I want to outsource
that part.

171
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,310
You have quite an aura
about you.

172
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,272
Excuse me?

173
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,316
I sense other lives.

174
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,653
You've been many others
before you.

175
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,365
And there may perhaps
be many more lives to come.

176
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,284
I lived in Seattle.
My name's Emma.

177
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,827
I don't know...

178
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,079
I don't know what else
to tell you. Hi.

179
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,290
-Hi.
-Hi.

180
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,834
You are gonna be great
at being a mom.

181
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,876
Thank you.

182
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,465
Maybe it's not your aura.

183
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,218
Maybe it's the aura
of others that I sense.

184
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,970
What?

185
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,763
[phone vibrating]

186
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,265
Excuse me.

187
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,021
Oh, my God.

188
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,570
Shit. Shit.

189
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,783
This is my work.
I'm trying to build a life here.

190
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,536
Why'd you change the locks?

191
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,415
I want my key. My key.
I am not in prison anymore.

192
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,042
Hi. Get in the truck.

193
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,877
I'm not getting
in the truck.

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,670
Is this about the girl?

195
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,422
Do you need me to keep going,
keep looking for her?

196
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,715
Is that what you need?
Tell me, 'cause I'll do it.

197
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,759
-Is that it?
-You were fired

198
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,968
from St. Jerome House.

199
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,262
You've got sealed records.

200
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,014
So I don't think
it's a great idea

201
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,599
for you to go looking
for a girl from St. Jerome.

202
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,976
That was you? You ran
a background check on me?

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,644
Oh, my God.
Wait, how'd you do it?

204
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,856
Wait, I know how you did it.
Your new boyfriend.

205
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,441
I don't have a boyfriend.

206
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,778
Sleeping with a cop
isn't exactly laying low.

207
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,654
What do you want from me?

208
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:56,948
You want to be with me?

209
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,285
You want to be
my boyfriend?

210
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,661
-Yeah.
-You jealous?

211
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm jealous, yeah.

212
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,540
Is that why you need a key,
so you can come check up on me?

213
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,210
When all the time, it's you.

214
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,379
You who's been lying to me.

215
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,884
I worked there
when I was 20.

216
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,637
Check my background.

217
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,598
Check whatever you want.
You're not gonna find anything.

218
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,183
Why are they sealed?

219
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,936
Emma, I'm a psychiatrist.

220
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
I work with
the federal government.

221
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,106
I have been vetted
through and through.

222
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,066
If there was anything shady
about my background,

223
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,110
I wouldn't be able
to do this job.

224
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,445
Now, if you don't trust me,
all right,

225
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,072
and you want to play
Nancy Drew

226
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,074
and you want
to go digging around, fine.

227
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,077
But get ready to start
from scratch...

228
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,290
new identity, new town,
new everything.

229
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,583
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

230
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,377
Why not same identity,
new you?

231
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,966
Because it's my cabin.

232
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,677
What?

233
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,346
Don't you remember
you asking me

234
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,681
for a place
where you could find peace?

235
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,933
A place where
you could breathe?

236
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,601
But a place that's my own.

237
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,646
I'm just a guy
that's protecting you.

238
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,315
Now, if you don't want me in
your life anymore, say the word.

239
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,985
I'll arrange a transfer.

240
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,113
You keep that shirt.

241
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,865
It looks way better on you
than it ever did on me.

242
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,801
Hey, Jake, honey.
It's Mom.

243
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596
Um, listen, you were, uh...

244
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,181
you were... you were right.

245
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,391
I kind of lost hold of myself
back there.

246
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,977
So, um, thank you for, um,

247
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,520
loving me, letting me know.

248
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,690
So, uh, I think
I'm gonna take off

249
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,942
for a few days to a spa.

250
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,945
You know, unplug.

251
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,155
Get some headspace.

252
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,907
Let this whole thing burn out.

253
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,661
I won't be in contact.

254
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:08,830
Okay?

255
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,415
So, uh, I love you.

256
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,709
I'll see you in a few days.

257
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,557
[three deadbolts click]

258
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,976
[keys rattle]

259
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,819
Just keep it covered.
You get any discomfort, call me.

260
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,823
Oh, you went for pink.

261
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,075
Nice choice.

262
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,623
-[laughs]
-Mmm.

263
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,822
Did you
get what you need?

264
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,658
Yes, it's an ultra-plush
wearable warming blanket.

265
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,953
They had it in her color,
which I'm picking up, is mauve.

266
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,538
It's so chilly
in her room.

267
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,207
Great.
So we go there now?

268
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,087
Well-- I'm not
so sure about "we."

269
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,882
I have a very detailed way
of working.

270
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,468
The devil is, of course,
in all those details.

271
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,723
John, I just need
an address.

272
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,142
You can get that for me,
can't you?

273
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,686
I can do exactly that,

274
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,313
but I need to do
my important work alone.

275
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,274
Okay.

276
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,446
Look, I don't want to be that
asshole boss who micromanages.

277
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,281
-I'm so pleased.
-But I'm going with you.

278
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,366
I just need to get in
and get out.

279
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,118
From Saint Cloud
Assisted Living?

280
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,036
From Minnesota.

281
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,956
Um...

282
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,668
You've taken me a little bit
off-balance here.

283
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,129
I called to say that I was
making good progress.

284
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,465
I didn't expect you to just
show up like this.

285
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,009
I had a window.

286
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,179
I don't even have
a pseudonym for you.

287
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,389
A cover name.

288
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:43,396
Uh, try this...
cousin Helen from Tampa.

289
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,940
No one questions anyone
from Florida, right?

290
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,652
The construct of Helen
is very close to Esther,

291
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,821
with the E's on either side
of the consonants.

292
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,366
Why not, say, Linda?

293
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,660
Fine. Linda.

294
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,079
Well, then a gift
would be a nice gesture.

295
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,456
A new nightgown?

296
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,000
Hers are threadbare
and food-stained.

297
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,210
Hate these institutions.

298
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,586
There's no care anymore.

299
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:12,300
Go pick something out.
Put it on your Amex.

300
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,101
[seagulls calling]

301
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,781
[Emma] I need to find out
what he did. My landlord.

302
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,242
How do I get those
records unsealed?

303
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,577
You need a court order.

304
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,372
-Okay, how do I get that?
-You don't.

305
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,125
Now, if it was me, I'd just
quit my lease and move.

306
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,547
No, I can't.
I can't break my lease, so...

307
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,424
You can
if you don't feel safe.

308
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,219
That's what I can't figure out,
like, why you stayin'.

309
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,598
Then I start to wonder

310
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:05,436
how you, in Seattle,
come across a psychiatrist

311
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,313
in north Louisiana

312
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:12,235
and rent out his cabin
in Saint James.

313
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,279
I met a lot of people
through my work.

314
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,906
You can talk to me...

315
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,450
Emma.

316
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,078
About anything.

317
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,331
You can trust me.

318
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,252
Something is going on
with you,

319
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,546
and I don't know what it is,

320
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,257
but I know that
it's keeping you alone.

321
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,385
I like to be alone.

322
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,970
-No one wants to be alone.
-Yeah, I do.

323
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,430
-I don't believe you.
-I'm better this way.

324
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,764
I don't believe you.

325
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,820
You should let me know
if you like me.

326
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,614
[Emma] And how
would I do that?

327
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,565
Hey, what's the...
what's the rush?

328
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,275
Isn't this
what you wanted?

329
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,903
I just don't want to feel
like I'm in a fight is all.

330
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,237
Well, then don't fight!

331
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:39,906
Emma.

332
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,243
Hold... Emma. Emma.

333
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,954
-Enjoy your books.
-Emma, hold on!

334
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,665
I was just saying, like,
let's just take it slow is...

335
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,177
Brought an old friend
to pay a visit.

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,472
No, there's a wolf.
There's a wolf!

337
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,516
[Denise] Please, Miss Esther,
there's no wolf.

338
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,558
Come on now.

339
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,727
Out there in the snow.

340
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,229
"In the snow"?

341
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,730
Is there something
you forgot to tell me?

342
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,273
Esther does have signs
of dementia.

343
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,775
Signs?

344
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,318
Yes, but also moments
of great clarity,

345
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,320
which we're having
with more regularity.

346
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,280
I think I'm able to center her,
and I have every confidence

347
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,907
that I will get
that address.

348
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,743
Hey, Denise.
I've got this now.

349
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:26,911
Denise. Let me.

350
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,664
Hey, you.
How's my girl?

351
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,541
It's okay.
It's all right.

352
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,959
I'm here.

353
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,502
I don't know you.

354
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,005
Yes, you do, sweetie.
It's me.

355
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,256
I don't know you.

356
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,383
Do you remember me?

357
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,845
Cousin Hel-- Linda?
From Florida?

358
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,972
Get them out.
Get them away from me.

359
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,391
I don't want to see the girls
from school.

360
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,560
We won't get
her back today.

361
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:52,979
Love you.

362
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,023
Wolf.

363
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,734
Don't call me that.

364
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,311
[stone thuds]

365
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,539
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

366
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,666
Two, two, three,
four, five, six.

367
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,668
Three, two, three,
four, five six.

368
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,754
Four, two, three,
four, five, six.

369
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,214
Stand up straight.

370
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,548
Good. Very nice.

371
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,300
One, two, three,
four, five...

372
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,887
It's a sliding step,
a sliding step.

373
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,014
You should feel like water,

374
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,434
like currents in the river.

375
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,897
Very nice.
You're doing beautifully.

376
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,277
You want to
get out of here?

377
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,445
Like you
wouldn't believe.

378
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,613
One, two, three, four...

379
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,001
So these are the things
Jess left?

380
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,733
Did you ever know
that man?

381
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,777
His name's Pete.

382
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,404
He used to work here
a long time ago.

383
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,281
He has a beard now.

384
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,701
I...

385
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,162
[aide] What's that light on?
Who's in that room?

386
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,135
What are you doing in here,
young man?

387
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,303
You should be
at the dance.

388
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,139
I just need to find
my shoes.

389
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,381
What's your mom on?

390
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,593
Who even dances like
that anymore?

391
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,428
She thinks it's 1929

392
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,263
and Wall Street
hasn't crashed yet.

393
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,941
[door opens]

394
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,570
I just want some time
alone with you.

395
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,991
I wake up at night
and I'm so hard.

396
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,832
I'm sorry,
I can't do this.

397
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:43,834
What?

398
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,056
Do you want to get high?

399
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,644
This was just
on the off chance.

400
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,814
There's a work conversation
I need to have with my boss.

401
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,898
Uh-huh.

402
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,483
I'm based in Florida.

403
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,194
You fellas sure know
how to throw a cold snap.

404
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,321
Of course, my work brings me
all over the country.

405
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,865
You got blood
on your chin, sir.

406
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,752
John.

407
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,463
Hi. I just thought,
we're both in Minnesota,

408
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,965
we should have
dinner together.

409
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,384
Unless you prefer
to dine alone?

410
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,012
I didn't give you
my hotel details.

411
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,181
I'd be pretty poor at my job
if you needed to.

412
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,574
What you'll have
to understand, Mary,

413
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,328
is dementia is not
a specific illness,

414
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,913
a disease...
It's an umbrella term.

415
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,333
It describes a collection
of symptoms,

416
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,211
all related to the decline
in memory, thinking skills.

417
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,548
I know about dementia.
My mother had it.

418
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,509
Oh, my goodness,
I'm so sorry.

419
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,887
Don't be. Really.
She's passed.

420
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,432
Then we are both of us
unmothered.

421
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,475
Did you lose your mother?

422
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,851
I did, when I was nine.

423
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:26,937
Any other family?

424
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,106
Yeah, a sister. Jane.

425
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,068
Jane?

426
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,780
Jane and John?
That's...

427
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,115
The names
of unidentified corpses.

428
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,159
-Thanks, Mom.
-Okay.

429
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,786
I need to,
uh, get my rest,

430
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,871
so I guess we'll, uh,
start again tomorrow.

431
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,498
I need you to let me
do my work.

432
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,460
This afternoon
was very unusual.

433
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,378
Um...

434
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,465
You have a certain energy,
which is understandable,

435
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,550
but it brings a tension.

436
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,135
I have an energy?

437
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,764
I think you hide
a lot of rage.

438
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,810
Don't analyze me.

439
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,609
I have a theory of my own,
of dementia sufferers.

440
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,445
I think they become
very instinctive.

441
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,865
As their conscious
processes dwindle,

442
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,743
their subconscious
becomes heightened.

443
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:27,248
And I think Esther
that felt your rage.

444
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,752
Do you want to know
about my rage?

445
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,967
It's dark, and it's
growing inside of me.

446
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:43,347
It's like a big, black lump
of burning tar.

447
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,893
It started in my chest,
and now it's in my gut.

448
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,521
And I hope it never
comes out, John.

449
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,606
I hope
I can keep it inside.

450
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,193
Have you considered
meditation?

451
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,445
Good night.

452
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,156
I meditate.

453
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,742
It helps me cleanse
after this work.

454
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,370
You have no idea of the toll
on the emotions.

455
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,167
I have a connection with her,
with Esther,

456
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,127
by being
what she needs me to be.

457
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,796
And what's that?

458
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,216
Her husband. Roger.
A remarkable man.

459
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,969
He's an engineer
and a political activist,

460
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,179
love of her life.

461
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,514
Heart attack at 50.

462
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,393
They never had the time
together they deserved.

463
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,188
Why does she think
that you're her husband?

464
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,232
I've encouraged a chemistry.

465
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:38,777
And cousin Linda from Florida
is kind of in the way.

466
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,032
We don't need three people
in this marriage, Mary.

467
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,785
I don't want you
there tomorrow.

468
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,681
See that star?

469
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:08,682
What?

470
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,063
That star...
that one up there.

471
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,439
Are you crazy?

472
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,982
There's like a billion
up there.

473
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,907
[howls, laughs]

474
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,159
[groans]

475
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,577
[both laughing]

476
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,625
I think I see it now.

477
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,294
[laughs]

478
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,923
[Rose] What were you doing there
tonight at St. Jerome?

479
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,466
Did something happen?

480
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,134
Why do you hate it here?

481
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,637
I don't fit in.

482
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,142
Aren't you the...
carnival queen?

483
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,690
Every night my mom locks me
in my bedroom

484
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,483
to keep me safe
from the world.

485
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,069
And every day
she gets me ready

486
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,780
for a stage that everybody
in town can watch me on.

487
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,035
[sighs] What's she afraid of,
your mom?

488
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,371
[Rose] Dangerous men.

489
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,874
Something very bad
happened here.

490
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,378
What?

491
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,385
You need
to go home, Rose.

492
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,970
What are you talking about?
What's happened?

493
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,806
She's right.
Your mom.

494
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,933
It isn't safe here.
It isn't a good place.

495
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,061
I don't want to go home.
I hate it there.

496
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,772
I hate it in this town.
I want to stay with you.

497
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:39,773
Go home.

498
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,193
Go home, Rose!

499
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,093
[thunk]

500
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,632
[shushes]
It's okay, Esther.

501
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:29,925
I'm your friend.

502
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,845
Linda?

503
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,847
I haven't been
a very good friend.

504
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:39,643
So I wanted to come
to you tonight,

505
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:44,022
mother to mother,
to tell you that I'm so sorry.

506
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,276
I'm so sorry I brought him
into your life.

507
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,195
Who?

508
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,365
The man who's been
coming to see you.

509
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,995
The man who's been coming
is a very, very bad man.

510
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,748
None of us
is all bad, Linda.

511
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,003
Mary. I'm Mary.

512
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,797
They wanted her to rot.

513
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,509
But I know she's growing.

514
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,138
I know she's flourishing.

515
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,767
She is?

516
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,562
Well, that's good.

517
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,773
Where is she flourishing?

518
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,357
That's my
little girl's kitten.

519
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,109
-I recognized it.
-[kitten meows]

520
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,988
Not even the worst of us
is all bad.

521
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,783
There's no monsters,

522
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,077
just frightened children.

523
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,372
Get out of my house.

524
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,916
She'll never come.

525
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,376
She's too clever.

526
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:48,962
What?

527
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,216
You think
I don't know wolves?

528
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,760
You sent your wolf.

529
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,513
But I survived him.

530
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,225
And she'll survive you.

531
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,269
Because you'd hurt her
if you could.

532
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,355
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

533
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,483
I came here
to make sure you were okay.

534
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,235
You'll never find her.

535
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,823
They keep her safe
because of people like you.

536
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,366
Get out of my house.

537
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,452
She is a monster.

538
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,831
She's part of him,

539
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:27,876
the man who broke nine women's
skulls with a hammer.

540
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,711
Get out of my house!

541
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,880
[Mary] Smashed them so they
were unrecognizable

542
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,423
except through DNA.

543
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,843
She did exactly what
he told her to do,

544
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,136
and they took my daughter.

545
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,721
[glass shatters]

546
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm going to ring my bell

547
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,975
and ask them to take you
out of my room.

548
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,810
No, no, no, no, no.

549
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,478
Get out. Get out!

550
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,273
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

551
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,985
You're gonna hear the truth
about this monster

552
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,820
that you're protecting.

553
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,572
I know she phones you.

554
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,283
I know you know
where she is.

555
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,454
So I will sit and wait

556
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,375
until you draw
your last breath,

557
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,961
if that's as long
as it takes.

558
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,715
Then you'd better
get comfortable,

559
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,426
because that's
what it'll take.

560
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:22,389
And that's the only time
my Karen's ever coming home,

561
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,266
is to kiss my coffin.

562
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,936
[coughing]

563
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,149
I can't even ask
for a glass of water,

564
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,735
seeing as you've
taken my bell.

565
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,031
Do you have it in you
to pour me a glass?

566
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,873
It's okay
that you love her.

567
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,126
Even I can
understand that.

568
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,504
It's not okay
that you hide her.

569
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,094
If she is innocent, then she
has nothing to be afraid of.

570
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,934
Why is she afraid?
Why is she hiding?

571
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:12,814
Esther, get back into bed now.
Come on.

572
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,275
You get away from me.

573
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,444
They'll call the police.
I know they will.

574
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,948
They have very strict rules
on who can come see us.

575
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,908
Back into bed.

576
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,577
I just want to know

577
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,287
-where she is.
-No.

578
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,414
If you tell me that,

579
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,999
-then I will go.
-No.

580
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,543
-Okay. [shushes]
-[whimpering]

581
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,045
Don't do that.
Don't do that, please.

582
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,588
-[grunting]
-Just stop. Stop.

583
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,757
Stop. Just stop it.
Don't make that noise.

584
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,468
Just-- pl--
You have to stop.

585
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,470
You have to stop
making that noise.

586
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,930
Please, stop it.

587
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,056
Stop it.

588
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,517
[panting]

589
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,657
[Pete] Do you recognize
any of these girls?

590
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,998
Karen, anything you can
give us will help you.

591
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,583
Anything at all.

592
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,255
I'm here to help you.

593
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,341
I'm here to be
a friend to you.

594
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,316
Her.

595
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,443
I think I remember her.

596
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,780
I think I saw her with Kit,
in his van.

597
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,035
We were in North Carolina
at a music festival.

598
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,244
It was...

599
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,667
May, two years ago.

600
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,129
This is good.

601
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,260
I'm gonna look after you.

602
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,558
Gonna stay close,
watch over you.

603
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,312
I'm gonna be
in your new life.

604
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,211
[man] Hey, it's me.

605
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,838
I want to hear
your voice again. Call me.

606
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,965
It's me.

607
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,885
I don't know what happened
back there,

608
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,553
but can you call me?

609
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,223
[woman] Do you still have
a file on me?

610
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,392
What?

611
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,978
You were my patient once.

612
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,481
Yeah, of course
I have a file on you.

613
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,649
I want to see it.

614
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,068
Why?

615
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,155
Because I want to know how you
saw me before you loved me.

616
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,831
Well, maybe...

617
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,127
just maybe...

618
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,135
I've always loved you.

619
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,777
Hello, I'm calling for, uh,
for Esther Moses.

620
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,534
[man] I'm sorry.
Esther passed away last night.

621
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,127
[sobs]

622
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,171
No.

623
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,926
Is this Karen?

624
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,334
My dad won't even notice
it's gone.

625
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,462
Yeah, well, he's gonna notice
that you're gone.

626
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,298
Then you'd
better drive fast.

627
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,510
Did you bring any money?

628
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,971
We can't disappear
for free.

629
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,098
I got 400.

630
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,266
It's not enough.

631
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,102
I have my debit.
We can get more.

632
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,687
No, we can't.

633
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,815
We can't use cards once
we're on the move.

634
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,401
I know where my dad keeps
his stash in the office.

635
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,616
You don't have to
do this.

636
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,620
You don't have to
come with me.

637
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,997
Give me five minutes.

638
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,667
Five minutes, okay?

639
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,172
I'll be right back!

640
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,364
[engine starts]

641
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:01,162
[sighs]

642
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,280
[gasps]

643
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,774
[theme music playing]

644
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,637
[child]
Tell me a story.
