1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:02,414
So, the figures show improvement
right there, Michael.

2
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:04,111
And again...

3
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,113
I'll call back.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,919
You never call back.

5
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,721
Every time Michael's
in a meeting,

6
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:14,694
he makes me come in and
give him a Post-it note

7
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,457
telling him who's on the phone.

8
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:20,228
I did it once and he freaked out.
He loved it so much.

9
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,031
The thing is he doesn't
get that many calls.

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,629
So he has me make them
up every 10 minutes.

11
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,305
Tell him I'll call him back.

12
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,936
- You can't just work 200 days...
- Sorry.

13
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,982
Oh, no, no, no. I don't
have time for this.

14
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,949
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

15
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,308
So.

16
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:41,855
You have to know how to work this.
There's no excuse for this.

17
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:43,982
Yeah. I can get you
a tutor if you need.

18
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,047
Oh.

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,324
Ah, this is a very
important client,

20
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:53,029
but I have the most important client
sitting right in front of me, my boss.

21
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,693
So I will call him back.
Oh, no, no, no.

22
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,364
Customer service is obviously priority one.
You can take the call.

23
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,430
No. Money isn't
everything, Ryan.

24
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,772
And you're my friend, and
I don't want to be rude.

25
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,869
Take the call, friend.
I refuse. No.

26
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,413
My house, my rules. I insist.

27
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,245
I insist you take
your work calls.

28
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:12,252
Okay. All right, Pam, would
you put the call through?

29
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,792
Hiya, buddy.

30
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:56,290
I don't know, I just... I never
felt welcome there, you know?

31
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:58,798
That's... It's
such a boys' club.

32
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,163
Yeah. I hate that. Good.

33
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:01,702
So, here's the deal.

34
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,999
I am on my way to New
York to be deposed

35
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:06,870
as part of Jan's wrongful
termination lawsuit.

36
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:10,709
The company fired her
for having the courage

37
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:12,143
to augment her boobs.

38
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:13,441
And they displayed

39
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,779
a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behavior.

40
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:22,619
Yes. Yes. Pattern. "Pat-turn."
My friend Pat took a turn.

41
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:24,521
That's how I remember that.

42
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,184
Could we pull over
and put down the top?

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,559
My... I'm feeling a little...
No.

44
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,757
...queasy. No, I want it up.
My hair.

45
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:32,299
Remember, it's not
just a pattern.

46
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:37,703
It's a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behaviors.

47
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:41,572
"Dis-ray." My friend
Dis Ray got new specs.

48
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,940
Dis Ray Spect.

49
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:48,415
My friend In-A-Pro drives a
Prius with his behind neighbor.

50
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:49,643
Does this work for you?

51
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:50,775
Yep.

52
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:53,082
Tell them how much you're
going to get if you win.

53
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:54,815
Come on, Michael, that's tacky.
Million dollars.

54
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,050
4 million. $4 million!

55
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:02,153
Man, that is a lot of guacamole!
Lot of the green. Lot of green.

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,825
That is why I have
memorized Jan's answers

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,698
and I've also thrown in
some "er's" and "ah's"...

58
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,964
No, Michael. ...just
to make it seem like

59
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:11,471
it's not memorized. No, come on.

60
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,029
Perfect crime! Stop
saying ridiculous things.

61
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,543
He's just going to tell the truth. The
truth is very, you know, complicated.

62
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,203
So we went over it carefully,

63
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:21,146
and just so that we wouldn't leave anything
up to chance or Michael's judgment.

64
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:23,046
Could we please pull over
and pull down the top?

65
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,812
I do not feel good. Michael,
I told you, I'm not...

66
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,116
I'm getting carsick!
...putting the top down!

67
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:28,746
I'm going to puke. I think
I'm going to throw up.

68
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,017
All right, fine. Just a second.
Hold on.

69
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,526
Hey, Schneider, real quick,

70
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:38,690
what do you call a buttload of
lawyers driving off a cliff?

71
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:41,599
A good start. And I
think it's "busload."

72
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,161
Yeah, a bunch of rich
lawyers took the bus.

73
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,070
Where did you find this guy?

74
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,600
Hey, there he is. Hey, Michael.

75
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,201
Hey, hey. Jan.

76
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:53,844
I'm glad you're here. I actually
need to talk to you for a second.

77
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,039
Yeah. Okay.

78
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,084
Can we talk off the
record as friends?

79
00:03:58,252 --> 00:03:59,810
I would love that.

80
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:05,490
Jan has put the company in
a very tough position here.

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,222
Now, you've been with us for a long time.
Over 10 years, right?

82
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:11,754
We just want to be sure that you won't do
anything to hurt us with your testimony.

83
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,563
Do you understand? Abso-fruitly.
Yeah.

84
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:17,866
I'll... I'll do anything
for the company. Good.

85
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,799
That is great to hear.

86
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:20,932
It is.

87
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,070
Game, son!

88
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,444
All right, let's run it back.

89
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,710
The warehouse got a
Ping-Pong table last week.

90
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:34,312
Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl.
Sometimes I bring him juice.

91
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,550
My boyfriend is 12.

92
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:43,493
What has two skinny chicken
legs and sucks at Ping-Pong?

93
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:45,395
Hi, Kelly. Guess
whose boyfriend it is?

94
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:49,129
I don't want to guess. I'll give
you a hint, it's not my boyfriend.

95
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:51,171
I think it's a guy over here.

96
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,998
I don't talk trash.
I talk smack.

97
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,633
They're totally different.

98
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,406
Trash talk is all hypothetical,
like, "Your mama's so fat,

99
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,571
"she could eat the Internet."

100
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,343
But smack talk is
happening, like, right now.

101
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:06,979
Like, "You're ugly and I know it for a fact
'cause I got the evidence right there."

102
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,484
Jim? Can I see you for a second?

103
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,185
Sure.

104
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:15,551
Wow.

105
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,165
Okay, it's not regulation
size, but it'll do.

106
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,691
You have to practice. You have to
get really good and beat Darryl.

107
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,601
Oh, I can't beat Darryl. Please.

108
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:27,163
Kelly's trash-talking me
because Darryl's beating you.

109
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,072
What? Seriously?
What is she saying?

110
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,010
Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs
steroids just to watch baseball.

111
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,605
Jim couldn't hit a Ping-Pong ball
if it was the size of the moon.

112
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:38,982
Were Jim's parents first cousins
that were also bad at Ping-Pong?

113
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,481
So, you're asking me to defend
your honor against Kelly?

114
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:43,353
Sort of. Yes.

115
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,659
Bring me a player. Okay.

116
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:50,324
Hi, everyone. Dianne Kelly. I'm
the company's chief legal counsel.

117
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:54,630
Hi. No. No. Absolutely not.
What is he doing here?

118
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,693
Toby? Are you renewing
your divorce vows

119
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,999
before my deposition?

120
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:59,733
Michael, I'm your HR rep.

121
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,069
I'm on your side. Never.

122
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,043
I want him gone. I don't
talk until he leaves.

123
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:05,510
Michael, just relax, okay?

124
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,377
You know what, I think they're
ready for us now, so...

125
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:08,813
Okay. All right.

126
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,814
Mr. Scott, do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth

127
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,717
and nothing but the truth?

128
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:15,847
Yes. Mr. Scott,

129
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:19,484
can you describe the circumstances of Ms.
Levinson's termination?

130
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,319
Well, it was not
just a termination.

131
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:25,126
It was a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behavior.

132
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,100
Oh, very good. Well put.

133
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,830
People underestimate Michael.

134
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,930
There are plenty of things that
he is well above average at,

135
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,668
like ice-skating.

136
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,437
He is a very good ice-skater.

137
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,738
Hey, Kevin, Jim
needs to see you.

138
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:43,306
About what?

139
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:46,148
He needs help balancing
some travel receipts.

140
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,154
Are you sure he wants me?

141
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:50,782
Because I have Oscar
balance my travel receipts.

142
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,792
Yeah, no, he asked
for you specifically.

143
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,260
He's in the conference room.

144
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:03,131
Awesome!

145
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,204
How long have you
known the plaintiff?

146
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,541
I haven't actually seen it,

147
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,704
but I have seen The Firm

148
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,147
and I'm planning on
renting The Pelican Brief.

149
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:18,242
How long have you known Ms.
Levinson?

150
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,445
Six years and two months.

151
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
And you were directly
under her the entire time?

152
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:22,978
That's what she said.

153
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,081
Excuse me?

154
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,419
That's what she said.

155
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,621
Ms. Levinson told you that
she was your direct superior?

156
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:31,464
What? Why would she say that?

157
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,193
Can we just move on to another question?
No, wait,

158
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,326
I don't understand. Who's
on record as saying this?

159
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,997
With all due respect, I'm in the
middle of a line of questioning.

160
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:41,303
Now, Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms.
Levinson said

161
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,072
regarding your employment status with
respect to her corporate position?

162
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:47,637
Come again? That's what she said? I
don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:51,708
If I may, he was just telling a joke before,
so can we move on to another question?

164
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,981
Oh, are you sure? Yes.

165
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,649
Can you go back to where
this digression began?

166
00:07:56,724 --> 00:08:00,160
Mr. Schneider, "And you were
directly under her the entire time?"

167
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,491
Mr. Scott, "That's
what she said."

168
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:07,260
Well, delivery's all wrong.
She's butchering it.

169
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,106
Yeah, that's what I thought.

170
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:25,481
Did Ms. Levinson ever say why
she thought she was being fired?

171
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:29,887
She thought it had to do with the twins.
That's what I call them.

172
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,585
Could you be more specific.
Who are the twins?

173
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:37,590
To be delicate, they
hang off milady's chest.

174
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,826
They make milk.

175
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,390
You don't need to
go any further.

176
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:42,766
Her breasts? Yes.

177
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,931
She thought it had something to do with
her recent breast-enhancement surgery?

178
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:51,206
Yes. And frankly, the timing was
nothing short of predominant.

179
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:55,573
What about your romantic
relationship with Ms. Levinson?

180
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,084
Could that have played a
part in her termination?

181
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,382
Well, if it did,

182
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:02,684
then the company is
breaking its own rules.

183
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:04,884
Interesting. How so?

184
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,262
Because before we started dating,
we disclosed our relationship to HR.

185
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:15,063
And I have the proof right here.

186
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:20,500
Okay, the company has just a few
clarifying questions, Mr. Scott,

187
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:23,065
if that's okay with you?
I will allow it.

188
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,009
Would you mind, please, just

189
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,880
taking a quick look at
this photograph, please?

190
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,915
That is you and Ms. Levinson
in Jamaica, is that correct?

191
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,014
Uh-huh.

192
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,150
And that photograph was
taken more than two months

193
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,684
prior to the start of your
relationship, does that sound right?

194
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:45,231
Mr. Scott, the timeline here
is actually very important.

195
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,597
Please, when did your
relationship actually begin?

196
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:51,035
Well, it depends on
how you define begin.

197
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:54,233
I mean, if it's from the first time
we shook hands, like, six years ago.

198
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,776
If it's from the first time we
kissed, it's, like, two years ago.

199
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,540
Excuse me? If it was from the
first time we kissed sober,

200
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,046
it was, like, four
months after that.

201
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:02,309
Can we take a short break?

202
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,874
No. Are you telling me
that your relationship

203
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:09,252
began two years ago and not in February
as you previously testified to here?

204
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,555
Line. I'm sorry, what?

205
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,425
He asked for a line,
like in a play.

206
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,193
"Mr. Scott, do you realize you
just contradicted yourself?"

207
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,760
"I did." "Yes, you did."
"Can I go to the bathroom?"

208
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,307
"No." "I really have to. I've
been drinking lots of water."

209
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:29,899
"You went five minutes ago." "That
wasn't to go to the bathroom,

210
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,376
"that was to get
out of a question."

211
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:34,471
"You still have to answer it." "First,
can I go to the bathroom?" "No."

212
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:41,311
Good game, Meredith.

213
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:42,719
Don't patronize me.

214
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,725
All right, what is going on here?
Dwight!

215
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:47,055
Thank God you're here.

216
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:50,461
As it turns out, one of our biggest
clients is a Ping-Pong master.

217
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:53,022
And I have to play him tomorrow,
or we lose the account.

218
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,796
Can you help me out? Will
you help me practice?

219
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,875
What the hell? I told you.

220
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,838
All of my heroes are
table-tennis players.

221
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,645
Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove
Waldner, Wang Tao,

222
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,084
Joerg Rosskopf and, of
course, Ashraf Helmy.

223
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:15,952
I even have a life-sized poster
of Hugo Hoyama on my wall.

224
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,615
And the first time
I left Pennsylvania

225
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:20,626
was to go to the Hall of Fame
induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.

226
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:28,659
Jan and I had an on-againloff-again
relationship for two years.

227
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:33,564
And I know this destroys
her case and I am sorry,

228
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:37,008
but I throw myself at the
mercy of the deposition.

229
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:40,171
Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's
all we needed to know.

230
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,509
Wait.

231
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:45,279
We'd like to enter into the record a page
from Michael Scott's personal journal.

232
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:46,683
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

233
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,415
What are you doing
with my diary?

234
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,787
This is plaintiff's exhibit 107.
No.

235
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,951
I quote from an entry dated

236
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:55,723
January 4 of this past year.

237
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:59,425
"Just got back from Jamaica,
tan almost everywhere.

238
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,367
"Jan, almost everywhere.
Hee, hee.

239
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:03,960
"Oh, Diary, what a week.

240
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,940
"I had sex with my boss. I don't
know if it's going to go anywhere.

241
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:11,000
"Jan was very specific that
this is not going anywhere,

242
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,773
"that it was a onetime mistake.

243
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,611
"But we had sex six
times, so you tell me.

244
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:18,618
"I am definitely
feeling very eerie."

245
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:19,778
Irie.

246
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,321
Irie. Sorry.

247
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:25,290
"More tomorrow.
X-O-X-O, Michael."

248
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,725
It would appear that
neither you nor Ms. Levinson

249
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,422
considered you
had a relationship

250
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,555
in any sense of the word.
Is that correct?

251
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:34,294
We're going to need to see a copy of
that entire journal before we proceed.

252
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,802
I don't think anyone in this room
has a right to read my diary.

253
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,101
It's basic discovery. We
have the right to review it.

254
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:42,540
Okay, let's make 10
copies of this diary.

255
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,100
Could you make it 11?

256
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:49,348
Eleven. Sure. And we'll break for
lunch, so everyone can have a look.

257
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,066
Can I sit here?

258
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:31,384
You know, I know a little bit about
what you're going through in a way.

259
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:38,087
When I was a kid, my
parents got divorced.

260
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,099
They both wanted custody

261
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:45,104
and they both asked me to testify
against the other one in court.

262
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:49,233
So, I don't know. I didn't want them to
get divorced in the first place, you know?

263
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,278
I love them both so much.

264
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,945
I just wanted...

265
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,979
How could you give up
my diary like that?

266
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:04,286
I had to. I'm sorry,
but I need to win this.

267
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,689
We need to win this.

268
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,090
How did you even find it?

269
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,685
You keep it under my
side of the mattress.

270
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,855
I don't like the lump. I'm
really upset about this.

271
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,661
All right, I stole your diary
and gave it to my lawyer.

272
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:17,033
You e-mailed a topless photo of
me to everyone in our company.

273
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,162
Let's call it even.

274
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,535
Fine. I love you.

275
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,834
I love you, too.

276
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:25,040
Mr. Scott, who is this
other woman, Ryan,

277
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:30,106
who you refer to here as "Just as
hot as Jan, but in a different way."

278
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,914
Not a woman, just a cool,
great-looking, best friend.

279
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,147
Aren't we trying to determine

280
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,689
whether Michael and Jan were
engaged in a romantic affair?

281
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:38,088
Not Michael and
this Ryan person.

282
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:40,926
- Excuse me.
- All right.

283
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,088
All right, this is
the way I see it.

284
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:48,328
Yes, I had sex with Jan and, yes,
I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend,

285
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:53,635
however, Jan clearly did not
consider me to be her boyfriend.

286
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,600
So her actions are
completely rightful.

287
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:59,646
Okay, Mr. Scott, it's admirable

288
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:03,149
the way you defend a woman
who is so obviously ambivalent

289
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:04,650
about her relationship with you.

290
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,652
Thank you very much. You
didn't have to say that.

291
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,349
Considering she consistently gave
you such poor performance reviews.

292
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:14,884
That was before our relationship.
She was going through a divorce.

293
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:17,089
And she was drinking a lot.

294
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,722
Okay.

295
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,857
Of water.

296
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:25,701
Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a
particularly negative performance review.

297
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:28,936
Would you mind reading
the date on that, please?

298
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,804
"March 17."

299
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:37,112
And that would be a month after
your relationship became official,

300
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,617
is that correct? Yes.

301
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:39,947
You may read

302
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,716
the highlighted portion
out loud if you'd like to.

303
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,559
"I am out of carrots.
I am out of sticks.

304
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,155
"Mr. Scott has time and
again proven himself

305
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:56,965
"to be an unmanageable employee
and a poor branch manager.

306
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:59,597
"I recommend he be
removed from that position

307
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:02,198
"and reassigned to
sales where he belongs."

308
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:03,971
Mr. Scott, after hearing that,

309
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,342
wouldn't you say that Ms.
Levinson's judgment

310
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:09,849
is at least very
seriously flawed?

311
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:14,684
Mr. Scott?

312
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,653
How's it going?

313
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:27,063
Well, he has gone from completely
hopeless to simply miserable.

314
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:29,295
Check this out, though.
Spin serve.

315
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:34,237
Works, like, 80%
of the time, so...

316
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:35,297
Nice.

317
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,472
So, should I schedule the
rematch with Darryl now?

318
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,671
I think I'm ready.

319
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,270
I'll make the call.

320
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:46,014
Wait a minute,
Darryl is the client?

321
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:51,288
No, no, no, he works
here, dumb ass!

322
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,890
Right.

323
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,457
Spin serve!

324
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:03,232
How could you do that to me?

325
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,504
You can respond. Just remember
it's all going into the record.

326
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,736
Michael, I'm not the enemy, okay?
Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.

327
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,677
Dunder Mifflin has
always treated me

328
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,909
with the utmost
respect, with loyalty.

329
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,050
They were going to give me your
job, and I should have taken it.

330
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,678
All right, wait, before
you go any further,

331
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,622
let me show you what kind
of loyalty they have, okay?

332
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:27,717
Lester, please read that
part of Wallace's deposition.

333
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,322
Starting at paragraph six.

334
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,298
Counsel, "Mr. Wallace,
regarding Michael Scott,

335
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,631
"was he a contender to
replace Jan Levinson?"

336
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,567
David Wallace, "Yes."

337
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:42,337
See? I was number-one contender.
I was being groomed.

338
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,502
Counsel, "Was he
your first choice?"

339
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:47,103
David Wallace, "Michael
Scott is a fine employee

340
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,411
"who has been with the
company many years."

341
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:52,543
Counsel, "Was he in the
top five of contenders?"

342
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,780
David Wallace, "What
do you want me to say?

343
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:58,086
"Come on, he's a nice guy. There
were many people that I considered."

344
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:01,889
Counsel, "Was he being seriously
considered for the corporate job?"

345
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,930
David Wallace, "No."

346
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,864
I have one more
question, Mr. Scott.

347
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,203
Wouldn't you agree with Ms.
Levinson

348
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:17,300
that the company exhibits
a pattern of disrespect

349
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:18,935
toward its employees?

350
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,776
Absolutely not.

351
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,894
Yes! Way to go! See that?

352
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:41,457
Yeah. The floppy-haired
girl you date won a point.

353
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,264
Nineteen serving four.

354
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,142
Nice, baby! Nice one!

355
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:54,772
Hey, hey, you, you I
don't like your boyfriend

356
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:57,043
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause
'Cause he sucks at Ping-Pong

357
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,745
You know what? I'm sick of this.
Let's go. You and me!

358
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,482
What? Let's go!
Pick up a paddle.

359
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:04,683
Okay. Bring it on. I am.

360
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:05,918
You think you can handle this?

361
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,119
In my sleep.

362
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,059
Okay, volley for serve. "P."

363
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:10,391
"O."

364
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,356
"P."

365
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,594
"O."

366
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,235
Do you want to go play
on the table upstairs?

367
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,294
- "P."
- "O."

368
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,634
Yes.

369
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:23,698
"P."

370
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,013
Michael, I am very sorry.

371
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:34,986
Oh, hey, no biggie. Just...

372
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,615
No, no, no. This was rough.

373
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:40,125
We never meant for you to get
caught in the middle of this.

374
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,854
I'm very sorry.

375
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:52,796
Hey, David?

376
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,101
Yeah?

377
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,472
I think you're a nice guy, too.

378
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:58,335
Thanks, Michael.

379
00:19:58,445 --> 00:19:59,776
Why did I do it?

380
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,938
I don't know.

381
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:05,451
Jan said that it was
because of the photo

382
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,009
that she revealed the diary.

383
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,950
But she already brought the
diary with her to New York. So...

384
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,021
You expect to get
screwed by your company,

385
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:18,064
but you never expect to get
screwed by your girlfriend.

386
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,765
What do you want
to do for dinner?

387
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:29,537
How about Chinese?

388
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:32,077
We should really try
to save some money.

389
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,204
How about something cheap?

390
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:39,751
That was my cheap suggestion.
Chinese was my cheap suggestion.

391
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,248
Can you do fast food? Fine.

392
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:43,949
Fast food's fine.
