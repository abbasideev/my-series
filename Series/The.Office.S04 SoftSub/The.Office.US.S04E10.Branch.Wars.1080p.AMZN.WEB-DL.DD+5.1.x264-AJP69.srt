1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,516
Dunder Mifflin. This is Rolando.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:07,484
Oh, yes. She's been
expecting your call.

3
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,924
Yeah?

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:14,291
Karen? He's on line 1.

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,262
Thanks, Ro.

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:20,159
Hey. We finally connected.
How's Scranton?

7
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,170
I am the regional manager of
Dunder Mifflin, Utica branch.

8
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,368
Turns out it's a pretty easy gig
when your boss isn't an idiot

9
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,966
and your boyfriend's not
in love with somebody else.

10
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,841
Look, all I'm saying is it
would be a great opportunity

11
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:36,009
and we'd love to have you come aboard.
So think about it, okay?

12
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:39,486
Okay. Bye.

13
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:44,116
Look, for the record, a certain
Scranton salesman approached me, okay?

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,583
This is perfect.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,718
He looks like your twin.

16
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:50,059
This is a dummy, à la
Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

17
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,793
We have tied a string to the
wrist, which goes to the door.

18
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:55,233
When somebody opens the
door, the hand goes down,

19
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:59,772
Hits the remote, turns on the tape
recorder, which is me snoring.

20
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,607
Now, nobody knows whether I
am here or whether I am gone.

21
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:06,875
I'll know. But you
will not tell anyone.

22
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:09,041
I won't need to because we'll
be together playing hooky.

23
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:10,106
Well... Yeah!

24
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:13,177
...sometimes. Most of the time
I will be with Ryan. Or Darryl.

25
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:14,482
Yes.

26
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:16,556
Oh, good, good. Stanley.
First victim.

27
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:18,023
This is what I want you to do.

28
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:20,356
Go out, come back in.
We're gonna hide.

29
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,225
I want you to tell me if
this looks like me, okay?

30
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:24,026
I don't understand why
sleeping at your desk

31
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:25,224
is better than you
not being here.

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,234
Just go out and come back in.

33
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:32,236
I got an offer from Utica for more money.
And I'm going to take it.

34
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:33,499
What?

35
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,943
Hi, everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

36
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:16,549
I just thought you all should know that
Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us

37
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,848
because our old friend,
Karen from Utica,

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,650
is going to give him
more money to work there.

39
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:24,521
Okay. No. No, no, no!

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,393
No! You completely
misinterpreted my tone!

41
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:29,688
This is a horrible thing.

42
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:34,667
Clearly, Karen is trying to get
back at us because Jim dumped her.

43
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,101
Oh, I don't think
that's what's happening.

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,695
Okay, well, smarty
pants, then why?

45
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:42,231
Why is she trying to
take Stanley from us?

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,073
I think it's because
of my sales record.

47
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:47,239
That could not possibly be it.

48
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:51,274
You cannot take the hilarious
black guy from the office.

49
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,754
Stanley is part of what makes
this branch so extraordinary.

50
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:59,759
The bluesy wisdom, the sassy
remarks, the crossword puzzles,

51
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:03,319
the smile, those big,
watery, red eyes.

52
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,730
I don't know how George Bush
did it when Colin Powell left.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,461
And if Utica thinks that they
are going to poach Stanley,

54
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,936
they have another thing coming.

55
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,413
How can I get you to stay?
Money.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,643
Yeah. We all want money.

57
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:26,082
But there is none in the budget.
So,

58
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,553
tell me why you're
really leaving.

59
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,987
Money.

60
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,155
Mo' money, mo'
problems, Stanley.

61
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:35,525
You of all people should know that.
Let me ask you this, if I were...

62
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,063
Money. Okay.

63
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,028
Oscar, did you bring it?

64
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:46,072
To be Edwardian. His best work.

65
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:48,842
Okay. Well, I have the tablecloth.
Don't forget the flatware.

66
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,002
Sure thing, Pam. Can't wait.

67
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,270
Oscar, Toby and I are founding
members of the Finer Things Club.

68
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,281
We meet once a month to discuss
books and art, celebrate culture

69
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,048
in a very civilized way.

70
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:05,424
Sometimes the debate can get
heated, but we're always respectful.

71
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:09,590
There is no paper, no plastic
and no work talk allowed.

72
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,327
It's very exclusive.

73
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,126
Besides having sex with men,

74
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:18,764
I would say the Finer Things Club
is the gayest thing about me.

75
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,675
So tell me again why I can't
be a part of your club?

76
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,042
Because some people
think that you

77
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:28,310
monopolize the conversation
by trying to be funny.

78
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:31,011
Oscar? Some people.

79
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:32,177
Hello?

80
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,050
Filippellers! How
are they hanging?

81
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,181
Michael. Michael. To the left?
To the right?

82
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:39,158
Listen, I'm... Okay, enough small talk.
Go ahead.

83
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,251
You called me.

84
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:42,159
Yes. Listen.

85
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:43,421
Um...

86
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,693
You cannot tear Stanley
from his family like this.

87
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,235
I'm pretty sure his
family is coming with him.

88
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:49,496
No, his work family.

89
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,734
Look, this is very hard for me, but
I am going to give you my best man.

90
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,241
You may have Toby.

91
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,970
Toby's not a salesperson.

92
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:01,708
You can train him. He's very,
very smart and funny and charming.

93
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:07,145
You know, I can't do it.
Toby is the worst.

94
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:12,488
That was a bluff. Listen, if you
are going to poach one of my guys,

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,118
I am going to
poach one of yours.

96
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,356
Ooh. Goodbye, Michael.

97
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,693
Okay. Goodbye.

98
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,528
Wait! Wait! Karen!

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,161
Could you transfer me to one of your
salespeople, please? Your best one.

100
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,937
I have Ben Nugent on the line.
He is the top salesman in Utica.

101
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,036
Hi, Ben. Michael Scott.
Hi, Michael.

102
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,411
I am going to cut right
to the chase here.

103
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:38,213
Do you like magic? Because
I am a genie in a bottle

104
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:40,754
and I am going to
grant you three wishes,

105
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:45,521
to move to Scranton, to have a
great job and to be my best friend.

106
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,959
Aren't you the guy that hit
the woman with your car?

107
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,893
Get out.

108
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,967
Yeah. I also saved her life, but
I guess that's not as grabby.

109
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,098
Everyone says Scranton
branch is worse than Camden.

110
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:02,802
Didn't everyone from Stamford
quit like immediately?

111
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:05,277
No, I fired them
and you're next.

112
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,444
So, what do you say?

113
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:11,746
Seriously?

114
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,619
What is that guy talking about?
Scranton is not lame.

115
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,024
Scranton is the cool, fun branch.
We're like Animal House.

116
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:26,099
Found him! Jim! We're
getting crapped on.

117
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,136
Word is our branch sucks and we
have to do something about it.

118
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,034
So what are you going to do?
What are we going to do?

119
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,972
We are going to make a monster
sale is what we're going to do.

120
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,872
Corcoran dropped Staples.
Did they?

121
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:39,709
Yes, they did. Oh, yes they did
and we are going to murder it.

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,740
You, me, Dwight are going to jump in my PT
Cruiser, we are going to crush this sale.

123
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,255
We are going to prove...
What the hell is that music?

124
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,153
It's Vivaldi. For Finer Things.

125
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,419
That's the problem.
That's the problem.

126
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:56,862
We need rock n' roll, Pam.
Rock n' roll. All right?

127
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,458
Oh, my God.

128
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:05,134
That's why people are leaving.

129
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,029
I...

130
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,006
I have no words.

131
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:24,452
We just passed the
exit for Corcoran.

132
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:27,016
What? What? We did?

133
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,996
Surprise! Yeah!

134
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,124
Look at his face!
Look at his face!

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,224
What are we doing? Egg dripping.

136
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:35,326
So psyched.

137
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,303
What are doing, Dwight?
What are we doing?

138
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,340
Oh, well, gee, Jim, I don't know.
I guess there's no sales call today.

139
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:44,742
We are going on a panty raid
to Utica is what we're doing.

140
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,609
We're going to Utica? Uh-huh!

141
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,441
I'm not going to Utica right now.
Yes, you are. Oh, buckle up, Jim.

142
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,510
No. We are going
to make Karen wish

143
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,556
that she had never
been dumped by you.

144
00:07:56,057 --> 00:08:00,494
Utica! Utica! Utica! Utica!
Utica! Utica!

145
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,319
Utica. Utica.

146
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,262
In your face! Yow!

147
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,793
I can't believe you guys. I'm not going
to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.

148
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,565
Are you calling Karen?
No, I'm not calling Karen.

149
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,437
He's lying. Yeah. Get it.

150
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,669
What are you doing?
Stop it! Dwight!

151
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:19,640
Are you kidding me?

152
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,807
No communication with
the outside world, Jim.

153
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,407
Had to be done.
It had to be done.

154
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,376
Well, that kind of sucks

155
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:29,617
because it had all the photos
of my brother's new baby on it.

156
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,555
So...

157
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,289
Oh, that is too bad. Shoot.

158
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,036
Okay. Hey, Dwight, he found it.

159
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,974
You know what? I'm just going
to call a cab from here.

160
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,808
All right. You're going to
miss the best prank ever.

161
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:58,384
All right. Wait, what are
you planning on doing?

162
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,445
Do you really want to know?

163
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:02,546
Oh, God.

164
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:05,057
Follow me. Come here.
Here's what we brought.

165
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:07,390
We brought uniforms
from the warehouse.

166
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:08,985
I brought Silly String.

167
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,998
Dwight brought gasoline and chunks
of rubber to make stink bombs.

168
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,694
Or real bombs. No, no.
Not real bombs.

169
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,634
Yeah, come on. It
will be so bad ass.

170
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,502
Oh, maybe. I don't know.
I don't know.

171
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,871
It could be bad ass.
It will. No. No.

172
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:24,206
Yeah, it will. No, absolutely
we're not doing this.

173
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,714
Come on. I already filled the bottles
with the gas. It's going to be so bad ass.

174
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:31,183
Are you kidding me? We've been driving around
with this in the trunk the whole time?

175
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:33,880
Teach her to offer
Stanley more money.

176
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:41,052
So, the deal was Dwight doesn't blow
anything up and I wear a costume.

177
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:44,829
And a mustache.

178
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:50,368
So, why did you
and Karen break up?

179
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,167
Was it the sex? What?

180
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,501
I can't imagine
the sex being bad.

181
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,166
I mean, her body is awesome.
Okay, you know what?

182
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:58,040
Why don't we play that alphabet
game that you were talking about?

183
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,912
Okay, I will start. A.

184
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:05,315
A, my name is Alan and
my wife's name is Alice

185
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:09,482
We live in Alaska and we sell...

186
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:12,219
Damn it. What can we sell?

187
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,452
Doesn't matter. I'm trying
to think of what we can sell.

188
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,462
It doesn't matter.

189
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,435
What is that? That sound. The air
conditioning leaking or something?

190
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:24,835
That doesn't make sense.
Couldn't be.

191
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,372
What is that?

192
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,177
Dwight, are you peeing?

193
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,803
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Oh, my God!

194
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,905
Oh, come on, man. That
is disgusting, Dwight!

195
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,212
You said we couldn't make any more stops.
I really had to go.

196
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:38,478
Michael, watch the road!
Oh, God!

197
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,179
Hey, you're making me spray!
Oh, my God!

198
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm going to kill you, man!
Michael, Michael, pull over!

199
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,790
That is just so disgusting!
Pull over.

200
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,588
I think I cut my
penis on the lid.

201
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:51,459
Can you imagine a life where all you have
to do is summer in the Italian countryside?

202
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:56,629
I know, right? I just want to go and
look at art and swim in the Adriatic.

203
00:10:56,871 --> 00:11:00,568
And spend time with George Emerson.
That's what I would do.

204
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,766
I mean, he's the best male
protagonist we've read, right?

205
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:07,041
Totally. I mean, come on. Such a
free spirit. What are you doing?

206
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:10,675
Just came to discuss my favorite E.M.
Forster novel.

207
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:16,319
Pam, these finger sandwiches look
finger-licking delicious, Pam.

208
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,291
I'm sorry, Andy, but
this is a closed club.

209
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:27,500
The Finer Things Club is the most
exclusive club in this office.

210
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,866
Naturally, it's
where I need to be.

211
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:34,237
The Party Planning Committee is my
backup and Kevin's band is my safety.

212
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,400
Fine.

213
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:40,438
I'll just...

214
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:45,952
Sit here in the common
area and read my book,

215
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,352
which just happens to be the
very same book you're reading.

216
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:51,323
All right, just know you're
not in the Finer Things Club.

217
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,485
Why can't I be in the club?

218
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,664
I can't believe we're here.
I can't believe this is happening.

219
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,130
Believe it.

220
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,565
Afro wig? Do you
want the afro wig?

221
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,568
No. Michael, I'm
not leaving the car.

222
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,695
Oh, God. All right, Dwight?
Yeah.

223
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:06,535
Here's how it's going to go down.
You and I...

224
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:08,865
Guy's going by. Shh.

225
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:12,537
You and I are going to sneak inside,
pretend that we are warehouse workers.

226
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:15,138
Then we will Silly String
the bejesus out of the place.

227
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,811
And if we have to defend ourselves,
I will stab the security guard in the eye

228
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:22,185
with a jumbo chalk. No. No,
you won't do that. Nope.

229
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,655
Then I'll grind up the jumbo
chalk and blow it in his eyes.

230
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:27,353
Dwight, nothing with the eyes.
Please?

231
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,327
Okay, Jim.

232
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh, my God, that's her. That's her.
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

233
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:36,736
Move. Move. Move. Move. Move.
MICHAEL: Shut up.

234
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:38,431
This is the dumbest
thing we've ever done.

235
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,847
I think it's interesting
how Forster uses Italy

236
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:54,115
to represent
sexuality and passion

237
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:58,750
and that also brought up themes
of, you know, fate and coincidence

238
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:01,226
and Lucy's torn between
these two things.

239
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,456
She's torn between
passion and convention.

240
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,895
Damn it.

241
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,298
It just...

242
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,934
To be making the
case for passion

243
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,032
in Edwardian times
I thought was...

244
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,804
Yes! Got it.

245
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:20,736
Damn it.

246
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:27,418
Made him sort of ahead of his time as a
writer. Very brave choice, I thought, also.

247
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:32,282
And George's
youthfulness, his freedom

248
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:37,227
Evokes feelings...

249
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,625
What are you microwaving?

250
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:43,965
Popcorn.

251
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,472
Why don't you use the microwave
in the kitchen, Phyllis?

252
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,737
Someone needs to clean it.
It smells like popcorn.

253
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,847
So, Stanley, are you
really out of here?

254
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,750
Yeah. Looks that way.

255
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:04,924
I'm going to miss you, man.

256
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:10,294
You've been like an uncle to me.
Like a kind old Uncle Remus.

257
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,327
I want to stay in touch.

258
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:19,671
We are in the stairwell.

259
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,640
We're climbing some stairs.

260
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,838
I am breathing heavily.
Okay, you know what?

261
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:28,814
You really don't need to be updating
me as much as you're updating me.

262
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:32,045
- There's a guy. There's a guy.
- There's a security guard coming by.

263
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:35,815
Hello. We're warehouse workers.
Would you like more proof?

264
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:37,748
Okay.

265
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,816
Oh, my God. That was very close.

266
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,417
I can see the
security guard's eyes.

267
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,759
No. No. Don't do
anything to them.

268
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,890
I have to do
something to his eyes.

269
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,764
The eyes are the
groin of the head.

270
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,404
All right, Great Scott, if you found that
choking hazard poster, just head on home.

271
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:58,036
We've got something far better, their
crown jewel. Their industrial copier.

272
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:00,179
Isn't that thing huge?

273
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:05,549
It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're
wheeling it down the hall into the stairwell.

274
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:08,681
Get the car ready, keep
the engine running.

275
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:11,520
No. That is a terrible idea.
Don't do this.

276
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:14,819
My hip bone!

277
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:19,855
We're wedged between the copier and the
railing! I'm stuck. Oh, my left hip!

278
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,128
Leave us, Jim! Leave us. Save yourself.
Help us. No!

279
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:24,466
Don't leave us. Help us.
We need help, Jim!

280
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:27,735
Okay, first of all, stop using my name.
And second of all...

281
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:28,968
You got to move out!

282
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,637
Damn it, guys. Would you
just move over a little bit?

283
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,145
I'm losing control
of my bladder!

284
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:35,909
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Karen's back.

285
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:39,475
Is that Karen? MICHAEL: Take her
to a motel. Make love to her, Jim.

286
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,350
No. I'm not doing that.

287
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,049
Just say you want to
get back together.

288
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,556
No. I'm not doing that.

289
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,186
It doesn't have to mean anything.
Just do it for Stanley.

290
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,560
Come on, Jim. Just climb on top of
her and think about Stanley. Oh, God.

291
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,827
Jim, if this is it for
me, promise me something.

292
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,869
Jim? Host the Dundies.

293
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:04,642
Hey, Karen.

294
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,311
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:10,247
First of all, hi.

296
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:11,878
What are you doing here?

297
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:13,180
You good?

298
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:16,788
I'm just checking on
the other branches.

299
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:19,553
Michael wants me to do that
from time to time. So...

300
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,925
Do not tell Karen about
the industrial copier.

301
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:25,123
Copy that.

302
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:30,299
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah,
seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser

303
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,703
in a ladies' warehouse
uniform felt pretty good.

304
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:38,440
Let me ask you, did you
accomplish what you wanted?

305
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:42,275
Listen, lady, you can expect
these kind of repercussions

306
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,647
as long as you keep trying
to poach our people.

307
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,310
I'm taking Stanley.

308
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:49,287
Then we will burn
Utica to the ground.

309
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:50,345
Dwight.

310
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:56,689
Granted, maybe this
was not the best idea,

311
00:16:56,763 --> 00:17:00,494
but at least we care
enough about our employees

312
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,229
that we are willing
to fight for them.

313
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:07,537
And if you so much as harm
a hair on Stanley's head,

314
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:11,876
we will burn Utica
to the ground.

315
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,720
Jim, hang on a second? Yes.

316
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:28,283
So you're still doing
this kind of stuff, huh?

317
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:30,626
Yeah. Trying to quit, though.

318
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,524
If you wanted to see me, you could
have just called me like an adult.

319
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:37,161
Oh, no, I didn't
want to see you.

320
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:40,434
Not that I'm not happy to
be seeing you right now.

321
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,906
I'm just saying ultimately I
was here for the copier. Equal.

322
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,810
I'd say it was equal.
So, good to see you.

323
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:52,281
I mean, it's just
that, you know,

324
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:56,288
Pam and I are still dating so...
And I just mean that

325
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,991
things are going really well
so I didn't want to see you.

326
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:07,525
Oh, things are going really well? Are they?
They are? That's great. That's so great.

327
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:10,126
I want to hear more about
how happy you are with Pam.

328
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,867
Can you tell me more about that?
Thank you so much for coming to Utica

329
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:17,934
and breaking my copier and telling me how
well things are going in your relationship.

330
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,239
Really. Thank you.

331
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:25,912
All right. You are welcome. I am
going to go because of traffic.

332
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,977
Traffic. Yeah. Oh, definitely.
So...

333
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:31,582
Go... Go because of traffic. Definitely.
Beat the traffic.

334
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,150
I will.

335
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,163
We tried and we failed.

336
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:49,768
Stanley, you may go.

337
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:56,806
Here is a box for your things.

338
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:03,690
But I doubt that that box will be
able to contain all the memories that

339
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,657
you have of this place.

340
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:11,357
Fly away, sweet little bird.
Fly away and be free.

341
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,189
Pam.

342
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:18,563
I'm going to need some
help writing a want ad.

343
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:27,037
Wanted. Middle-aged
black man with sass.

344
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:30,242
Big butt. Bigger heart.

345
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,051
I can't do this.

346
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,055
Michael, a word?

347
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,421
Of course.

348
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:44,358
I changed my mind.
I want to keep this job.

349
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,696
Really?

350
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,828
I wasn't really planning on leaving.
All I wanted was a raise.

351
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:56,570
How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?
Is he some sort of secret genius?

352
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,807
Sometimes I say crazy things.

353
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:06,744
Hey.

354
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,721
I'm so sorry. Rolando
told me everything.

355
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,117
How humiliating.

356
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,553
Would it help you to
return to another age,

357
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:21,965
a time of refinement
and civility?

358
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,368
Are you inviting me to
the Finer Things Club?

359
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,305
Oh, oh, come on!

360
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,643
Angela's Ashes. Top
of the morning to it.

361
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:36,649
Frankie's prose is finer
than a pot of gold, say I.

362
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:41,518
Okay. Did you get it
out of your system?

363
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:46,025
Yup. No, I mean I really liked it.
I thought it was a fun read.

364
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,384
Fun? Mmm-hmm.

365
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:48,758
Really? Yeah.

366
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,629
What was fun about it for you?
Was it the death of the twins?

367
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:57,026
No, that wasn't fun.

368
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,834
Did you even read it?

369
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,270
Of course I read it.

370
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,534
How does it end?

371
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,337
Who was the main character?

372
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:08,671
Angela. Nope. The ashes.
