1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,676
Okay, well...

2
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,212
I did not get the
job in New York.

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,613
But I got the real prize--

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,416
domestic bliss.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,719
Jan made me breakfast
this morning.

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,689
Well, she bought the milk.

7
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,258
It's soy.

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,694
This is why I do it.

9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,598
That's what I have
to come home to.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,570
She probably won't be
up for a few hours.

11
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,506
This is going to be
a very good year.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,641
Very good.

13
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:41,775
Jan is at home.

14
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,411
Jim is back.

15
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,080
My protégé Ryan is at corporate.

16
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,249
Good stuff.

17
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,552
Andy and Dwight are
rocking the sales team.

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:52,553
I feel very blessed.

19
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,322
D'oh!

20
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:11,372
*

21
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,464
You know, generally
it's not a good idea

22
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,831
to click on any Internet offers

23
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,433
that you haven't requested.

24
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,169
What was the exact offer?

25
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,437
It was for a...Video.

26
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,473
Yeah, well, what kind of video?

27
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,677
A celebrity sex tape.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,678
Really?

29
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,845
What kind of celebrity?

30
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,846
Not relevant.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,747
How much you pay for it?

32
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,516
Not relevant. You pa for it?

33
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,451
It all happened so fast.

34
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,454
I broke up with Karen
after the job interview.

35
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,190
And, uh...

36
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,857
It was a little awkward

37
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,426
when she came back
from the city.

38
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,195
She told me very clearly

39
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,396
that just because
we were broken up

40
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,897
didn't mean that she
was going anywhere,

41
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,866
because she had worked
really hard for her career.

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,869
But the next day,
her desk was empty.

43
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:20,508
And as for me and my
current romantic life...

44
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,842
I, uh...

45
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,578
I'm single now and looking.

46
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,348
So if you know anybody...

47
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,949
Jim and I went to
dinner a few times

48
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,818
when he got back from New York.

49
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,754
I talked him
through his breakup.

50
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,957
It's really nice to
be good friends again.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,193
Are you kidding me?

52
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,363
Pam and Jim are
totally hooking up.

53
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,931
All they do is smile.

54
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,899
They're just
keeping it a secret.

55
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:46,900
Right?

56
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:47,901
I don't know.

57
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,238
There is no evidence
of intimacy.

58
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,373
They've been in
remarkably good moods.

59
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,374
Could be other things.

60
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,776
Are you kidding me?

61
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:56,977
And Sunday,

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm thinking of going to that
flea market at the drive-in.

63
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,848
Oh, that sounds fun.

64
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,683
I'm mountain biking
on Sunday in, uh...

65
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,917
Montage mountain.

66
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,286
Cool. Yeah.

67
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,820
Well, have fun with that.

68
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,864
Ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,733
I have some bad news.

70
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,269
Meredith was hit by a car.

71
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,836
What? Where?

72
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,872
It happened this morning
in the parking lot.

73
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,674
I took her to the hospital.

74
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,777
And the doctors tried
to save her life.

75
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,779
They did the best
that they could.

76
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,882
And she is going to be okay.

77
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,351
What is wrong with you?

78
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,387
Why did you have to
phrase it like that?

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,721
So she's really
going to be fine?

80
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,722
Yes.

81
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,957
She has a slight...

82
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,593
Pelvical fracture.

83
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,696
But, uh, people have
survived far worse.

84
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,864
Thank god you were there.

85
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,334
Yeah.

86
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,535
Did you see who did it?

87
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,436
Oh, no need.

88
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,671
We can just check
the security tapes.

89
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,539
Yeah, kind of a good
news/bad news there.

90
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,342
I was able to be on
the scene so quickly,

91
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,877
because I was in the
car that hit her.

92
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,648
Who was driving?

93
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,387
Oh, Michael.

94
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,590
One day Michael came in
complaining about a speed bump

95
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,293
on the highway.

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,396
I wonder who he ran over then.

97
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,997
It's only Meredith.

98
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,866
Yeah, it's only Meredith.

99
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,735
Thank god.

100
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,870
But did you see the
way they looked at me?

101
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,972
Like I was a murderer
or something.

102
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,343
Hey.

103
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,344
Why did you do it?

104
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,645
It was an accident.

105
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,547
Was she talking back? No.

106
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,048
Just got sick of that face?

107
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,484
Did she owe you money? Uh-oh.

108
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,018
Is this downsizing?

109
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:49,490
Did she spurn your advances?

110
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,958
Hey, guys.

111
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,693
We're all gonna visit
Meredith at lunch.

112
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,928
And we're kicking
in $5 for flowers.

113
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,064
Who's we? You and Jim?

114
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,367
No, me and Stanley
and Phyllis so far.

115
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,703
Oh. I bet Jim goes too.

116
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,638
Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.

117
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,774
Oh. I bet you ask.

118
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,841
I was planning on it.

119
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,110
I bet you were.

120
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,045
Angela? Subtle.

121
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,647
What? Are you coming?

122
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,916
I can't. Sprinkles is sick.

123
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,086
She's been sick for some time.
Thank you for asking.

124
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,923
No one asks about sprinkles.

125
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,924
I have to give her her meds,

126
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,393
I have to pet her.

127
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,927
And who will she eat lunch with?

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,929
Can't your other cats
keep her company?

129
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,631
There's bad blood.

130
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,999
Jealousies, cliques.

131
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,000
Angela,

132
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,801
you're the chairman

133
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,369
of the party planning committee.

134
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,904
I shouldn't even
be planning this.

135
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:37,938
It's your job.

136
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,341
All right!

137
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,944
My lord, my liege.

138
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,978
Yes, Michael?

139
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,814
So Ryan got promoted
to corporate

140
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,550
where he is a little
fish in a big pond.

141
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,952
Whereas back here in Scranton,

142
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,087
I am still top dog

143
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:59,159
in a fairly large pond.

144
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,464
So who is the real boss?

145
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:07,468
The dog or a fish?

146
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,737
So I need a little
treat for the gang.

147
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,939
Something to win
their affections back.

148
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,140
Back?

149
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,575
Why is that, Michael?

150
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,711
Well, I ran down
Meredith in my car.

151
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,712
Oh!

152
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,880
Did you do this on purpose?

153
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,482
No, I was being negligent.

154
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,717
But she's in the
hospital, she's fine,

155
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,785
recovering nicely.

156
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,454
Tiny little crack in her pelvis.

157
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,354
But she will be--

158
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,922
did this happen on
company property?

159
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,123
Yes.

160
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,459
It was on company property

161
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,860
with company property.

162
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,563
So double jeopardy. We are fine.

163
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,498
Mm, I don't-- I don't
think you understand

164
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,132
how jeopardy works.

165
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,068
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

166
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,471
What is "we're fine"?

167
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,174
People keep calling
me a "wunderkind."

168
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,543
I don't even know
what that means.

169
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,744
I mean, I know what it means.

170
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,547
It means very
successful for your age.

171
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,916
So I guess it
makes sense, but...

172
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,451
It's a weird word.

173
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,152
Hey, d.

174
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,588
Hey monkey, what's up?

175
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,722
Can you do me a little favor?

176
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,024
Go to my place at lunch and
give sprinkles her medicine?

177
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,025
Sure.

178
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,860
I have to visit the alkie.

179
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,996
Check to see if she's faking.

180
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,164
If a car hit me, it
wouldn't crack my pelvis.

181
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,700
You know what?

182
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,101
I bet she cracked it at home.

183
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,537
Jumped in front of the car
to get some worker's comp.

184
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,807
I wouldn't put it past her.

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,142
So what do you need me to do?

186
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,243
I wrote it out. Mm-hmm.

187
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,778
There's a diabetes shot.

188
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,113
Roll the Insulin in your hands,

189
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:26,980
don't shake it.

190
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,082
She gets an Ace
inhibitor with her meal.

191
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,484
But you have to put her
right in front of the dish,

192
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,553
or she won't see it
because of the cataracts.

193
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,155
Mix one capsule of
omega fatty acid

194
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,657
in with her kidney medicine.

195
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,559
Um, and you wanna
give that to her

196
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,161
15 minutes after she's eaten.

197
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,063
And, oh--there's a fungal cream,

198
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,098
because she has this
infection under her tail.

199
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,099
So you're gonna have
to lift her tail

200
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,802
and put the cream right
at the base of her tail.

201
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:52,172
Okay, I have an announcement.

202
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,173
You pushed Darryl out the window?
No.

203
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,141
You shot Dwight? No.

204
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,144
No, that is not funny.
I love my employees.

205
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,180
Even though I hit one
of you with my car.

206
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,650
For which I take
full responsibility.

207
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,685
Look, I am just trying
to take everybody's mind

208
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,956
off of this unavoidable
tragedy and on to

209
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,024
more positive things.

210
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:14,294
So I thought we
should plant a tree.

211
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,530
Oh, good. That means
we don't have to work.

212
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,566
Okay, we're leaving for
the hospital at 1:00.

213
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,267
So, like, a freedom tree.

214
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,268
I can take three people.

215
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,703
I can also take three people.

216
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,237
- Separate cars.
- Pam?

217
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,706
All right, we'll get a
card at the hospital,

218
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,274
and we'll sign it outside her room.
Pam.

219
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,142
Sales people can go
later in the day.

220
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,578
Hourly workers can go at lunch.

221
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,645
Okay, good, good.

222
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,914
So we'll just all go down
there together at lunch.

223
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,015
Excellent. I-I was
thinking that--

224
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,049
good work, Pam.

225
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,217
But if you--

226
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,720
yaaaay, Pam!

227
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,555
All right, since I am
the boss, I will drive

228
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,556
as well.

229
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,557
Who wants shotgun?

230
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,658
You can't be serious.

231
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,993
You ran a woman
over this morning.

232
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,930
Everybody inside the
car was fine, Stanley!

233
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,299
Guess what? I have flaws.

234
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,001
What are they?

235
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,870
Oh, I don't know.
I sing in the shower.

236
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,673
Sometimes I spend too
much time volunteering.

237
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,342
Occasionally, I'll hit
somebody with my car.

238
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,944
So sue me.

239
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,113
No, don't sue me.

240
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,148
That's the opposite of the
point that I am trying to make.

241
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,056
Ew.

242
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,057
I hate hospitals.

243
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,629
In my mind, they are
associated with sickness.

244
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,665
Oh...

245
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,166
She looks like an angel.

246
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,300
She looks awful.

247
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,301
No--okay.

248
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,336
She always looks like that.

249
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,337
It was not my fault.

250
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,005
I think she's awake.

251
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,774
No.

252
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,810
She's in a coma.

253
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,346
No.

254
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,848
Okay.

255
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,817
* Meredith

256
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,320
Ooh!

257
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,256
I brought all your friends
from the office, dear.

258
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,291
At the same time. Yep.

259
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,693
Hello, Meredith.

260
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,961
This is weird.

261
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,162
Brought you some balloons.

262
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,666
Why don't we-- here you go.

263
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,267
Tie these up, cheer
up your tubes.

264
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,703
Oh, shh--

265
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,904
oh, for god's sake.

266
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,138
Whoa. Nurse!

267
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,707
No, don't bother the nurse.

268
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,908
Just put it back in.

269
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,044
I am going to be sick.

270
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,713
I am going to puke. I wouldn't--

271
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,648
I wouldn't worry about it.
Don't touch it.

272
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:17,918
What are you doing?
Just gimme that.

273
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,121
Thanks.

274
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,158
Does it hurt terribly?

275
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,393
No, it's not too bad.

276
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,128
They have me on a
lot of painkillers.

277
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,963
Oh, really? What kind? Codeine?

278
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,999
Vicodin? Percocet?

279
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,734
Fentanyl? Oxycontin?

280
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,135
Palladone? What?

281
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,136
I have no idea.

282
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,371
Oh.

283
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,041
Well, it was really great

284
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,410
of all of you to come and
visit me at the same time.

285
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,412
I'll see you guys at the office.

286
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,015
Okay, wait up, wait up, guys.

287
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,116
Guys, guys, hold on a sec.

288
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,119
You know what I was thinking
might be sort of fun?

289
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,856
Is if you forgave me...
In front of everybody.

290
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,224
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.

291
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,126
'Cause you know what they say

292
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,461
in the Bible about forgiveness?

293
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,165
Forgiveness... Is
next to godliness.

294
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,000
No, that's not.
That's cleanliness.

295
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,335
Well, just shh. Just--just--

296
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,303
you cracked my pelvis.

297
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,839
Look, I just-- I
don't understand

298
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,807
what is preventing you
from laughing this off

299
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,075
and giving me a big hug.

300
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,409
You're not forgiven.

301
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,445
Come on.

302
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,446
Michael!

303
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,782
Michael! Ahh!

304
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,183
Do I need to be liked?

305
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,417
Absolutely not.

306
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,153
I like to be liked.

307
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,155
I enjoy being liked.

308
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,023
I have to be liked.

309
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:34,161
But it's not, like,
this compulsive need

310
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,796
to be liked.

311
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,365
Like my need to be praised.

312
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,404
Hey. Hey, monkey.

313
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,939
Any problems?

314
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,507
Well, you left the TV on.

315
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,877
And your cat is dead.

316
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,078
What?!

317
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,312
Sparkles, the
white one, is dead.

318
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,081
Sprinkles.

319
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,415
That was the sick one, right?

320
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,886
Uh-huh.

321
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,255
But I thought she had more time.

322
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,256
No.

323
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,829
Did she look--

324
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,264
when you saw her,
how was she looking?

325
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,365
Really dead.

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,335
Like a, just a dead cat.

327
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,939
So... Hey, come on.

328
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,841
Don't be sad. Just...

329
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,309
Okay? Just...

330
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,244
She's in a better place.

331
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,079
All right.

332
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,917
Actually, the place that
she's in is the freezer.

333
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,918
Because of the odor.

334
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,390
It's gonna be okay.

335
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,559
Okay, you know what?

336
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,896
Everybody, let's just get
over the whole Meredith thing.

337
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,099
She cracked her pelvis.
A tiny, little crack.

338
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,100
And she's gonna be fine.

339
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,101
So let's just--

340
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,103
Michael, Angela's cat died.

341
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,472
Sprinkles?

342
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,050
Oh, sh...

343
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,886
I'm sorry, Angela.

344
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,856
Man, what a day, huh?

345
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,457
How could it get any worse?

346
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,492
Her computer crashes
with the porn,

347
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,327
and then Meredith
with the accident,

348
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,328
and then...

349
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,464
Sprinkles!

350
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,199
God!

351
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,433
That's three things.

352
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,870
I'll tell you what's going on.

353
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,038
This office is cursed.

354
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,176
And we need to do
something about it.

355
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,144
I am taking responsibility.

356
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:34,347
And it is up to me to
get rid of the curse

357
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:38,185
that hit Meredith with my car.

358
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,420
I'm not superstitious, but...

359
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,155
I'm--i am a little stitious.

360
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:45,993
Did anyone do anything

361
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,061
involving an Indian
burial ground?

362
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,162
Like what?

363
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,363
Like park on it.

364
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,466
Or dig up a body.

365
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,334
Toby?

366
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,937
Do you have anything
you wanna tell us?

367
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,274
No, I did not violate
an Indian burial ground.

368
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,977
In fact, I had some
good luck recently.

369
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,578
Alfredo's pizza picked
my business card

370
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,348
out of the basket, so I
get a week of free pies.

371
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,250
That's cool. Yeah.

372
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,551
Perfect.

373
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,120
So our tragedy is
your good luck.

374
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,923
Satan.

375
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,225
Sprinkles never hurt a soul.

376
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,394
God, in your infinite
wisdom, how can you do this?

377
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,662
She wasn't ready.

378
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,531
She had so much
left to accomplish.

379
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,599
It is only a cat.

380
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,368
You never...

381
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,370
You don't like them.

382
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,040
Cats do not provide
milk or wool or meat.

383
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,074
Dwight, please.

384
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,642
Dwight, you haven't seen
Meredith yet, have you?

385
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,609
No, I have not.

386
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,311
Well, I think you should
go to the hospital

387
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,479
and pay your respects.

388
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,614
I do not respect her.

389
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,650
But I will go.

390
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,985
All right.

391
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,055
I would now like to talk about

392
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,924
each of your individual
religious beliefs.

393
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,127
Oh, Michael, you can't ask
about religious beliefs.

394
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,663
Satan is a master of lies.

395
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,266
Everything he says
is the opposite.

396
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,169
All right, well, then you can
ask about religious beliefs.

397
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,137
Thank you for the permission.
Psych!

398
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,405
All right, let's just
go around the room,

399
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,540
and--and tell me
what you believe in.

400
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,510
- Um, catholic.
- Okay.

401
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,678
Presbyterian.

402
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,080
Oh, me too.

403
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,181
For real? Same religion.

404
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,283
All right. Cool.

405
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,685
Uh, I'm a lutheran,
and Bob is a unitarian.

406
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,387
It keeps things spicy.

407
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,289
That's why we're cursed.

408
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,324
I've been involved
in a number of cults,

409
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,159
both as a leader and a follower.

410
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,128
You have more fun as a follower.

411
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,497
But you make more
money as a leader.

412
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,199
Kelly, you are hindu.

413
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,333
So you believe in Buddha.

414
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,235
That's Buddhists.

415
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,469
Are you sure?

416
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,071
No.

417
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,706
What are you?

418
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,343
Uh, well, if you're gonna reduce
my identity to my religion,

419
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,611
then I'm sikh.

420
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,247
But I also like hip-hop and npr.

421
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,550
And I'm restoring a 1967
corvette in my spare time.

422
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,152
Okay.

423
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,253
So one sikh,

424
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,288
and...

425
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,457
As a farmer,

426
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,159
I know that when
an animal is sick,

427
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,194
sometimes the right thing to do

428
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,163
is to put it out of its misery.

429
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,732
With the electricity we're
using to keep Meredith alive,

430
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,036
we could power a small
fan for two days.

431
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,171
You tell me what's unethical.

432
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,007
Blink once if you want
me to pull the plug.

433
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,244
Don't pull any plugs.

434
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,245
How are you doing, miss Palmer?

435
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,379
Better. Excellent.

436
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,081
Are you a doctor
or a male nurse?

437
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,316
Um, I'm an intern,
which makes me a doctor.

438
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,252
Psh.

439
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,055
Her chart doesn't indicate
that she had a hysterectomy,

440
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,490
but she did, or at least,
she got time off for one.

441
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:35,362
Ah, so that is where
her uterus went.

442
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,597
Um, miss Palmer, your
last tetanus shot was

443
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,099
when you were bitten by
a bat a few months ago?

444
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,167
Yes.

445
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,035
Dwight here trapped it in a bag

446
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,570
against my head.

447
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,372
Just doing my job.

448
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,107
It also says you were
recently bitten by a raccoon?

449
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,641
And a rat.

450
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,644
Separate occasions.

451
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,714
Spend your whole life trying
to get people to like you,

452
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,649
and then you run over one person

453
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,785
with your car.

454
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,121
And it's not even one
of the popular ones.

455
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,355
Everybody gets on your case.

456
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,257
Doesn't make any sense.

457
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,226
God is dead.

458
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,429
If there was a god, then Ryan
and I would be married by now.

459
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,632
Maybe believing in
god was a mistake.

460
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,667
What did people believe in

461
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,304
before?

462
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,538
The sun?

463
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,507
Maybe there's some

464
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,311
sort of animal that we
could make a sacrifice to.

465
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,714
Like...a giant buffalo.

466
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:32,452
Or some sort of
monster, like something

467
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,388
with the body of a walrus

468
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:40,527
with the head of a sea lion.

469
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,829
Or something with the body

470
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,533
of an egret

471
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,401
with the head of a meerkat.

472
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,671
Or just...

473
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,575
The head of a monkey with...

474
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,077
The antlers of a reindeer.

475
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:04,584
With the body of...

476
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,687
Uh...

477
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,157
A porcupine.

478
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,460
I will do some research.

479
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,461
Okay.

480
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,196
I can help you with that.

481
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,134
So just to be safe,

482
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,535
they are giving her
the rabies vaccine.

483
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,471
Ohh! God, rabies?

484
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,272
Mm-hmm.

485
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,840
I was in the hospital
room with her.

486
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,876
How contagious is that?
Is that like an std?

487
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,778
No, no. You gotta be
bitten by something.

488
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,446
This place is so cursed.

489
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,381
Actually, the doctor said

490
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,216
it was lucky she came
into the hospital,

491
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,317
'cause the only
way to beat rabies,

492
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,320
is to start treatment
before the symptoms set in.

493
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,421
Lockjaw.

494
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,563
I know a lot of you
are very upset with me

495
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,500
for endangering Meredith's
life by hitting her

496
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,767
with my car.

497
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,237
But it may make you
feel a little bit better

498
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,372
to know that before
that happened,

499
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,741
Dwight endangered her life

500
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,776
by putting a garbage
bag over her head

501
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,845
and it had a bat in it.

502
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,747
Six of one, really.

503
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,751
Turns out, Meredith has
been exposed to rabies.

504
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,953
Which is, like, ten times

505
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,956
worse than a little
crack in your pelvis.

506
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,925
Thanks to me, she
went to the hospital,

507
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,228
and that saved her life.

508
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,895
Curse is broken.

509
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,897
Curse is broken, people!

510
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,267
Oh, there is a god!

511
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,336
And he has a plan
for us after all.

512
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,537
So go home,

513
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,671
get some rest.

514
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,807
Very, very good work today.

515
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,878
Got a lot accomplished.

516
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,812
Is there a god?

517
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,316
If not, what are all
these churches for?

518
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,186
And who is Jesus' dad?

519
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,829
Oh, well.

520
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,498
If they aren't together now,

521
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,333
then they probably
never will be.

522
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,304
I thought they'd
be good together.

523
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,540
Like pb & j.

524
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:12,712
Pam beesly and Jim.

525
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,914
What a waste.

526
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,550
What a waste.

527
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,886
I told you I'm
not dating anyone.

528
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,289
And even if I was,

529
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,724
I don't think it's
anyone's business.

530
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,494
I mean, when I do fall in love,

531
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,895
like, when it's for real,

532
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,464
the last person I'm
gonna talk about it to

533
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:38,638
is a camera crew
or my coworkers.

534
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,540
Almost marrying Roy Anderson

535
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,442
was as close to Pamela Anderson

536
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,377
as I ever wanna be.

537
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,414
Trust me, when I fall
in love, you'll know.

538
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,290
Michael Scott's dunder
Mifflin Scranton

539
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,758
Meredith Palmer memorial

540
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,694
celebrity rabies awareness
fun run race for the cure,

541
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,695
this is Pam.

542
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,530
Pro-am.

543
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,565
Pro-am race for the--

544
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,634
They hung up. Okay.

545
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,602
A woman shouldn't have
to be hit by a car

546
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,638
to learn that she
may have rabies.

547
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,707
But that is where
we are in America.

548
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:18,445
And that does not
sit right with me.

549
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,414
And that is why I
am hosting a fun run

550
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,816
race for the cure for rabies--

551
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,052
to raise awareness of the fact

552
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,555
that there is a cure for rabies.

553
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:32,459
A disease that has been
largely eradicated in the U.S.

554
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,328
But not very many
people know that.

555
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,997
No, rabies.

556
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,799
Babies would be a good idea.

557
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,334
Can I put you down for a dime?

558
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,005
Hi, stankley, how
many sponsors so far?

559
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,940
Zero.

560
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,008
Come on, man.

561
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,343
You gotta step it up.

562
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,844
It's for a good cause.

563
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,847
Jan called this morning
and pledged $500.

564
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:58,351
Isn't that your money?

565
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:03,356
That is for a good cause.

566
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,891
Phyllis, how is the
rabies quilt coming?

567
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,892
Oh, it's coming.

568
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:06,793
Oh, look at that!

569
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,928
Three. Way to honor
Meredith, Phyllis.

570
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,929
Michael? Yes?

571
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,931
You cannot make me run. Okay.

572
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,500
It is not a real charity.

573
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,834
It's stupid, Michael.

574
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,503
And I'm not gonna do it.
All right.

575
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,303
You didn't run for me

576
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,905
when I thought I
had skin cancer.

577
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,708
I know that you're
probably scared

578
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,743
of people seeing your
fat legs in shorts.

579
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,877
No.

580
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,546
Okay.

581
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,980
Well, back in olden times,

582
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,150
a large, fat person like this

583
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,152
was a person of power.

584
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,987
A person who had money,

585
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,589
who could buy food.

586
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:39,459
A person of respect, like the
regional manager of the day.

587
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,962
Whereas someone athletic
and trim like myself

588
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,864
was somebody who
worked in the fields,

589
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,466
and I was a peasant.

590
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,967
I just don't wanna run.

591
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,537
I didn't bring my
sneakers or my clothes.

592
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,370
Well, you're going
to have to run

593
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,039
or you're gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

594
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:59,646
It is not olden times anymore.

595
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,981
I'm petrified of nipple chafing.

596
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,618
Once it starts, it
is a vicious circle.

597
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,787
You have sensitive
nipples, they chafe.

598
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,088
So they become more sensitive.

599
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,790
So they chafe more.

600
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,559
So...

601
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:13,826
I take precautions.

602
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,097
Hey, Angela.

603
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,967
Hey, um...

604
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,203
I'm sorry about your cat.

605
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,577
This is sprinkles.

606
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,045
She was my best friend.

607
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,783
I kept her going through
countless ailments.

608
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,786
I asked Dwight schrute
to feed her once,

609
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:44,591
and she is now deceased.

610
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,596
This is Halloween last year.

611
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,765
Just a couple of kittens.

612
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,167
Out on the town.

613
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,708
Psst!

614
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,582
I'm having
relationship problems.

615
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,218
And since you're always
having relationship problems,

616
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,621
I thought you'd be able
to give me some advice.

617
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,655
What's wrong?

618
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,757
I have this crazy thought

619
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,192
that I know is crazy.

620
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,795
That maybe Dwight killed my cat.

621
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,063
Hmm.

622
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,064
When I got home,

623
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,133
sprinkles' body
was in the freezer

624
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,735
where Dwight said he left her.

625
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,037
But all my bags of
frozen French fries

626
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,505
had been clawed to shreds!

627
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,640
Oh.

628
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,174
Something's not right.

629
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,909
The vet's doing an autopsy.

630
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,778
Angela, I'm sorry.

631
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,880
Did Roy ever kill
one of your cats?

632
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,650
I'm more of a dog person.

633
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,789
So what's your
strategy for this race?

634
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,923
Well, I'm gonna start fast.
Mm-hmm.

635
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,825
Then I'm gonna run
fast in the middle.

636
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,226
What? Then I'm gonna end fast.

637
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,862
Why won't more people do that?

638
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:59,666
'Cause they're stupid.

639
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,233
What?

640
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:16,883
Oh, um, no, that's not--

641
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,217
I mean, that wasn't--

642
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,752
yeah, that was, um...

643
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,854
I mean, I can see how
it would seem a bit

644
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,623
like we, uh...

645
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,058
How it looks like, um...

646
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,227
But, I mean, nowadays, you
can edit anything, right?

647
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,730
I mean, you can
edit anything to...

648
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,099
Look like, um, anything.

649
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,901
So. Yeah, I gave
him a ride home.

650
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,904
Because... Right.

651
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,339
We're dating.

652
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,741
Wow.

653
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,810
There it is.

654
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:45,912
Uh, yeah.

655
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,580
We haven't told anybody.

656
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,850
But it's going really great.

657
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,284
Right?

658
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,587
It is going really great.

659
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,355
Ow!

660
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,690
Shut up.

661
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,025
You're taking this out on me,

662
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,593
but I was only the messenger.

663
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:02,261
Oh, really?

664
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,736
You'll feel better after the 5k.

665
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,771
Exercise is good for depression.

666
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:12,805
I am not depressed.

667
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,943
I'm in grief!

668
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,812
We have raised almost $700,

669
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,648
most of it from me and jan.

670
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,051
Um...when do they put
that on the giant check?

671
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,020
Or is that something
that we write in later?

672
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,958
Well, a giant check costs
about $200 to make up.

673
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,359
I have a print shop
standing by, but--

674
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:34,393
what do you think, Michael?

675
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,228
That's over 25% of our funds.

676
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,865
Mm.

677
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,900
It's...a tough decision.

678
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,035
Um...

679
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,270
I always imagined it
with a giant check.

680
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,772
Yeah, I mean, I personally

681
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,306
am definitely on board
for the giant check.

682
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,307
Giant check it is.

683
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,009
Well, I don't know.

684
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,778
On the other hand, it
does leave less money

685
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,846
for bat birth control.

686
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,782
Bat birth control.

687
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,149
Wait, this money is going

688
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,117
to bat birth control,
right, Michael?

689
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,852
That's what you told
me when I contributed.

690
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,654
You didn't contribute very much.

691
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,990
I was also hoping to hand

692
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,425
the giant check to
a rabies doctor.

693
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,794
How's that going?

694
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:08,795
Not well.

695
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:09,896
A doctor won't come out

696
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,831
to collect a check for $700.

697
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,033
Or $500 if we go
with the giant check.

698
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,034
Which we are.

699
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,002
And also...

700
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:19,038
There is no such thing
as a rabies doctor.

701
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,807
How about a rabies nurse?

702
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,108
I don't think so. You
know what, though?

703
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,409
I've actually seen ads

704
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,311
for nurses that you
can hire by the hour.

705
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,279
For, uh, parties
and bachelor events.

706
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,782
That's possible. Look into that.

707
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,417
Great. It's gonna cost
a couple hundred bucks.

708
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,152
And, uh-- oh, actually, more...

709
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,054
With tips.

710
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,455
Maybe we should
skip the ceremony

711
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,225
and just set up a college
fund for Meredith's son.

712
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,694
Have you met that kid?

713
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,997
Not going to college.

714
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,466
Michael.

715
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,338
5k means five kilometers,
not 5,000 miles.

716
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,840
Come in!

717
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:54,841
Hey. Hey, hey!

718
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:55,842
Oh, my god! What are you doing?

719
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:56,743
What are you doing?!

720
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,144
You said, "come in!" No, I didn't.
Just--

721
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,145
oh, my god.

722
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,179
Please, get out.

723
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,783
So I closed the door,
but the image of his--

724
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,784
baguette.

725
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:05,985
Dangling participle. Ooh.

726
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,087
Still burned in my eyes.

727
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,088
I can imagine.

728
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,960
Come in.

729
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,427
May I enter the room?

730
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:20,099
Yes. Or "come in."

731
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,302
See how I did that?

732
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,971
That's the way you
should enter a room.

733
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,806
You knock and then you
wait for the all clear.

734
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,807
You couldn't have taken
off all your clothes

735
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,808
in the men's room? Yes.

736
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,243
But I have an office,
so why would I do that?

737
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,444
On average, how many hours a day

738
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,246
do you spend naked
in your office?

739
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,114
Just ballpark.

740
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,783
European offices are
naked all the time.

741
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:37,750
They're so not.

742
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,852
Besides, my shirttail
covered most of it, so--

743
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,320
I didn't see where it started,
but I saw where it ended.

744
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,222
Phew, gross.

745
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,791
That's not gross! It
is the human body.

746
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:45,958
What is your problem?

747
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,060
Pam, you're an artist, right?

748
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,796
Think of me as one
of your models.

749
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,764
Okay, you know what?

750
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:52,832
I don't want this to detract

751
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,201
from what we really need
to be thinking about today.

752
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,369
It's not fair to
people with rabies.

753
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,439
And that's the point. Right?

754
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,440
Okay.

755
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,441
Let's go have some fun.

756
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,876
All right.

757
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,411
They say if you're
nervous around someone,

758
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,213
you should picture them naked.

759
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,016
I do not recommend
this strategy.

760
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,418
Try picturing them
with more clothes on.

761
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,453
Or a funny coat.

762
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,991
Oh, I'm sorry, is
this a working office?

763
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,928
And not a French beach?

764
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,030
Okay, name, please?

765
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,098
Creed Bratton, 75+ division.

766
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,533
You're over 75 years old?

767
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,168
82 November 1st.

768
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,236
How much is the prize money?

769
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,171
There's no prize money.

770
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,439
Well, is any of this real?

771
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,107
Check that out.

772
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:37,109
Look at me, I'm Toby!

773
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,544
I'm stretching.
I know what I'm doing.

774
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,079
Why is he even here?

775
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:47,920
So I heard that you
were peeping on Michael.

776
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,555
What? No, it was not--

777
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,257
look, I don't know
what your deal is,

778
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,591
but he's mine, okay?

779
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,860
So hands off.

780
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,129
Okay, everybody, listen up!

781
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,398
Thank you for coming.

782
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,167
Before we get started,
I wanted to say

783
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,469
a few words about

784
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,404
this deadly disease
called rabies.

785
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,274
And I'd like you to take a look

786
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,411
into the face of rabies.

787
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,146
That should scare you.

788
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,915
It scares me.

789
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,549
You people need to
educate yourselves.

790
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:21,253
Myth: Three Americans
every year die from rabies.

791
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:26,392
Fact: Four Americans every
year die from rabies.

792
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,260
How many of you

793
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,529
know someone who
has been afflicted

794
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,898
or affected by rabies?

795
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,066
Show of hands.

796
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,068
One, two, three--
too many to count.

797
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,204
It is truly the silent killer.

798
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:41,373
No, it is the foaming,
barking killer.

799
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,410
And it is something
that-- Darryl!

800
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,045
What are you doing?

801
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,113
I'm giving him a peanut.

802
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,347
No, don't give him--

803
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,183
did you hear anything I said?

804
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,952
Look how happy he is.

805
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,286
He's happy because he's insane.

806
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,287
You know what?

807
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,456
That's a perfect example
of the kind of awareness

808
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,624
we need to generate.

809
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,226
Where's the nurse?

810
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,461
This is the reason we're here.

811
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,896
Hello, Michael.

812
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,565
Oh, hey, I know you.
Elizabeth, right? Yeah.

813
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,367
Wow.

814
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,236
Very cool you went back
and got your degree.

815
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,974
I would like you to
accept this check

816
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,210
for $340

817
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,947
made out to science.

818
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,481
Make sure that that gets
into the right hands.

819
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,549
Right.

820
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,055
You got it?

821
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,222
Mm-hmm.

822
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,423
Okay.

823
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:35,928
Fettuccine Alfredo.

824
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,097
Time to carbo load.

825
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,202
Mmm.

826
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,503
Just remember, folks,
it's not about winning.

827
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,238
It is about finishing.

828
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,942
On your marks!

829
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,011
Get set!

830
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,545
Down!

831
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,995
On your left!

832
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:09,962
Wow, you're fast.

833
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,364
You're doing great, Michael.
Look at you go!

834
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,066
That's my boss!

835
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,734
Yeah, baby!

836
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,636
I'm fast. I'm very fast.

837
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,238
I'm like Forrest Gump,

838
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,474
except I am not an idiot.

839
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,678
Oh, yes, I will work out today.

840
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,114
I will work out a way

841
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,117
to avoid running
for a stupid cause.

842
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,652
I've walked two marathons.

843
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,222
Pretty sure I can handle a 5k.

844
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,524
The key is drafting

845
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,659
to eliminate wind resistance.

846
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:48,200
Yeah.

847
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,701
Oh, we're in last place.

848
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,103
Oh, would you look at that?

849
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,438
Darn it.

850
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,644
Water!

851
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,579
Water.

852
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,414
Oh! Water, babe?

853
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,682
No, no water for me.

854
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,052
Not while rabies
causes fear of water.

855
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,086
Solidarity!

856
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,620
Michael, that's irrational!

857
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,390
Rabies victims...

858
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:14,360
Have to live with an
irrational hatred of water

859
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,727
their entire lives.

860
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,365
So...least I could do.

861
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:23,069
Oh, god. My nipples.

862
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,537
It's starting.

863
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,206
Can we get another round?

864
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,675
Okay. Thanks.

865
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:33,145
So we've got what?
Another 20 minutes?

866
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,314
More or less. Mmm.

867
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,551
That fettuccini...

868
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,354
Is hitting my
stomach like a rock.

869
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,423
You got nothing to worry about.

870
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,492
I put imodium in Toby's
coffee before the race.

871
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,328
Excellent!

872
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,363
Simpsons!

873
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,500
Wait, imodium or ex-lax?

874
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,235
I'm making great time.

875
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,204
Usually I have to
take a bathroom break

876
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,505
halfway through
a race like this.

877
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,674
But...not today.

878
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,412
Ooh, an estate sale.

879
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,514
Want to go in?

880
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,549
I don't know, I'm really
committed to winning.

881
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,850
Okay, but what if I told you

882
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,385
that all the money
you spend here

883
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,420
goes to preventing a disease

884
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,421
that's already been cured.

885
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,655
Mmm, yes.

886
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,090
That's what I thought.

887
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,325
Yeah. Right?

888
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,093
Let's do some good.

889
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,862
You have reached the offices

890
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,397
of dunder Mifflin Scranton.

891
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,399
Currently the entire
staff is out doing

892
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,668
the Michael Scott d.M.S.M.P.M.C.

893
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,138
Rabies awarness pro
am fun run race...

894
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:33,772
For the cure.

895
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,407
Leave a message.

896
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,545
Oh, god.

897
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,581
Oh, Alfredo sauce.

898
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,783
I'm getting a stitch. Ahh!

899
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,819
Ow! God!

900
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,156
Watch the nipples, Kevin!

901
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,424
Back off me.

902
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,892
How you feeling? Better?

903
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,161
No.

904
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,828
Well, you look cute as button.

905
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,330
You've worked up quite a sweat.

906
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:00,166
The vet is removing
all of sprinkles organs

907
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,900
right now and sending
them to the lab.

908
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,170
I am a farmer, Angela.

909
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,204
What does that mean?

910
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,406
Okay, when a farmer sees
an animal that is in pain,

911
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,840
that has no quality of life,

912
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,442
that has no utility,

913
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:13,745
a farmer does what city folk
don't have the stomach to do.

914
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,747
You did kill her!

915
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,917
I-I sang her her favorite songs.

916
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,552
You put her in my freezer!

917
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,788
It was beautiful and
gentle and respectful.

918
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,457
I fed her antihistamines and
she gradually fell asleep.

919
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,159
Well, then she barfed
them up in the freezer

920
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,260
and tried to get out.

921
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,329
Well, I'm not responsible
for that--hey!

922
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,731
Ow! It's okay!

923
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,732
It's nothing! I'm robbing her!

924
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,268
It's nothing! It's fine!

925
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,570
How could you do that
without telling me?

926
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,938
I thought I was helping you.

927
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,573
I expected a hug.

928
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,409
I took care of that cat

929
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,844
the best way I knew how.

930
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,614
Cat heaven is a beautiful place.

931
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,617
But you don't get there
if you're euthanized.

932
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,951
I know a great taxidermist.

933
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,753
I'll pay to have her stuff.

934
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,954
Well, he's not great,
but he's pretty good.

935
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,824
You don't understand.

936
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,860
Take bat bites seriously.
Don't get bit.

937
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,231
Or we can have her buried out

938
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:08,700
at the east field by mother.

939
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,901
Huh, Angela?

940
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,837
Don't touch me, Dwight.

941
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,682
You like it?

942
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,950
It's kind of designy and cool.

943
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,918
It was $8.

944
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,322
Oh, and I get to carry it.

945
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,672
And the winner is
Toby Flenderson!

946
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,341
Have a seat. I'll write it down.

947
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,381
Where are we?

948
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:56,515
I don't know.

949
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,517
Like five kilometers
from the office.

950
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,354
He couldn't have
made it a circle?

951
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:11,963
I am not going to finish.

952
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,369
I can't beat rabies.

953
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,904
Nobody can beat rabies.

954
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:22,341
Rabies has been around
for a thousand years.

955
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,710
I was fool to think
that I could beat it.

956
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:30,949
Pictures of the dog all around.

957
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,784
Yeah, probably-- hey.

958
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,888
Michael?

959
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,490
What are you doing here?

960
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:39,758
Did you come back for us of--

961
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,827
I can't finish.

962
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,995
I feel so weak. I just--

963
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,597
well, you're
probably dehydrated.

964
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,032
What do you want me to do, Jim?

965
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,967
A glass of water
would be a start.

966
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,703
No, there are people...

967
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:54,373
All over the world with
all sorts of problems

968
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,708
and afflictions and diseases.

969
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,377
They're deformed

970
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,646
and they're abnormal.

971
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,783
And...they're
illiterate and ugly.

972
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,719
Symphonies don't have any money.

973
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,421
Public TV is bust.

974
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,089
I can't do anything about it.

975
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,058
I can't, you know--

976
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,794
there's just one of me,

977
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:19,030
and there's thousand of them.

978
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,566
And rabies wins.

979
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,569
Wow, you are a downer.

980
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,671
We were having a
pretty nice day.

981
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,105
I'm still having a nice day.

982
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,940
You are? Yeah.

983
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,776
Hey, Michael, look at this lamp.

984
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,811
$8.

985
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,413
That's a good deal.

986
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:39,751
And Michael, you
don't have rabies.

987
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:42,588
And chances are you're not
gonna get it anytime soon.

988
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,857
So you don't really have
to think about it too much.

989
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,827
Pam, if everybody felt that way,

990
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,095
nothing would get done.

991
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:54,433
Yeah, but there's
other better people

992
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,067
out there who are helping.

993
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,804
You just don't
think I am capable

994
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,539
of making a difference.

995
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,742
I know you, Michael.

996
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,577
I saw you naked.

997
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,846
You don't--

998
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,848
you don't know me.

999
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,483
You've just seen my penis.

1000
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,519
I can make a difference.

1001
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:14,853
Remember, I'm the one

1002
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,422
who started this whole thing off

1003
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,157
by hitting Meredith with my car.

1004
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,792
And I owe it to her

1005
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,062
to finish this g.D. 5k.

1006
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,831
Oh!

1007
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,069
No, no!

1008
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:46,552
Finishing that 5k

1009
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:49,988
was the hardest thing
I have ever had to do.

1010
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,726
I ate more fettuccine Alfredo

1011
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,630
and drank less water than
I have in my entire life.

1012
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,935
People always talk about
triumphs of the human spirit.

1013
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,973
Well, today I had a
triumph of the human body.

1014
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,443
That's why everybody was
applauding for me at the end.

1015
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:15,814
My guts and my heart.

1016
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,984
And while I eventually
puked my guts out,

1017
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:23,755
I never puked my heart out.

1018
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,791
And I'm very, very
proud of that.

1019
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,497
Hey, Michael. Hey, mer.

1020
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,798
How you doing?

1021
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,932
Better.

1022
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,667
It's ironic, isn't it?

1023
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,469
I mean, I'm in the hospital

1024
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:38,670
for not getting enough water.

1025
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,639
And you're in it for a disease

1026
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,207
that causes a fear of water.

1027
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,676
I'm in because you
hit me with your car.

1028
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,245
Oh. But I want to say...

1029
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,515
I heard you were
trying really hard,

1030
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:52,584
so...I'm not mad at you anymore.

1031
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,554
Thanks.

1032
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,590
I'm not mad at you anymore.

1033
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,132
Want to share?

1034
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,934
Sure.

1035
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,102
I'm not really sick.

1036
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,580
I'm good.
