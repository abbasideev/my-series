1
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:03,608
Hey. Ready?

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,714
Come on! Show me excited.

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,520
Yes!

4
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,324
Yeah. I'm pretty excited too.

5
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:13,328
Today I'm headed
over to the job fair

6
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:17,168
at valley view high school
to find some new interns.

7
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:21,176
Wanna get some fresh blood,
uh, euthanize this place.

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,812
Hey, we doin' this thing? Yeah.

9
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,550
Oh, my god, Darryl.

10
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,154
You look like Barack Obama.

11
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,688
Everybody, I'm
dating Barack Obama.

12
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,326
Why are you dressed like that?
Like what?

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,530
Like you're applying for a loan.

14
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,867
Maybe he's going to church.
Or court.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,538
Figured I'd look presentable.

16
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,808
You...went a different way.

17
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:38,845
I think you look nice.

18
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:39,713
Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:41,717
Okay. Here's what
we're going to do.

20
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,389
I'm going to instruct the kids
about management and sales.

21
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:46,526
Oscar will be in
charge of accounting.

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,200
Pam will be eye candy.

23
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:52,373
No, and also because
that is your Alma mater.

24
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,245
Darryl will hire some
kids for the warehouse.

25
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,448
We don't have to worry
about internships with them

26
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:59,687
because they definitely
ain't goin' to college.

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,757
What college did
you go to, Mike?

28
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,859
Let's go!

29
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:13,914
*

30
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:37,562
Today I am meeting
a potential client

31
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:39,267
on the golf course

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,404
because Ryan put
me on probation.

33
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,975
You remember Ryan.
He was the temp here.

34
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,979
Yeah. And, uh...

35
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,918
It is not a good time
for me to lose my job

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,424
since I have some pretty
big long-term plans

37
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:53,025
in my personal life with Pam

38
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,930
that I'd like her parents
to be psyched about.

39
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:58,771
So I am about to do something
very bold at this job

40
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:00,241
that I've never done before--

41
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,776
try.

42
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,047
Whoa!

43
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,285
Mr. Maguire.

44
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,954
It's been a couple of years.

45
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:09,024
Hey, Jim, how are ya?
Nice to see you, man.

46
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:09,827
Oh, no!

47
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,930
No, no, no, no, no.

48
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:14,936
My grandfather would
be spinning in his urn

49
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,742
if he knew that I was out
here with a dartmouth boy.

50
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,078
You take that shirt
off right now,

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,914
or I will take it
off for you, sir.

52
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,386
I am totally

53
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:23,955
and completely kidding!

54
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:26,025
Andy Bernard.

55
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,094
Cornell. '95.

56
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,930
Phil Maguire, dartmouth, '74.

57
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,369
Oop. Got some blisties.

58
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:31,436
Yeah, you do.

59
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,441
Hit about 1,200 balls last night

60
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,581
in preparation for today, so
hands are a little tender.

61
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,750
It's actually not funny at all.

62
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,820
It's incredibly painful.

63
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:40,889
Let's make it interesting.

64
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,725
Say, uh...10 bucks a hole.

65
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:43,895
Great.

66
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:44,997
What are we talkin'? Skins?

67
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,101
Acey deucy? Bingo bango bongo?

68
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,938
Sandies, barkies, arnies?

69
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,442
Wolf? What?

70
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:51,911
I'm gonna take

71
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,782
this petty cash that
I got from Oscar

72
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:59,125
and turn it into
next month's rent.

73
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:05,604
So many memories
in this old gym.

74
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,673
Pretending I have pms

75
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:08,477
so I didn't have
to play volleyball.

76
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,579
Pretending I have pms

77
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,619
so I didn't have
to play basketball.

78
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,723
Those were the days.

79
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,935
Little over the top,
don't you think?

80
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,773
Show 'em what you brought, Mike.

81
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:23,908
Um...

82
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,176
That's all we brought.

83
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,081
This is all we need. We'll see.

84
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,850
Yes, we will see, Oscar.

85
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,119
We will see,

86
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:31,856
because a blank sheet of paper

87
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,095
equals endless possibilities.

88
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,634
Conceptual. All right.

89
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,971
We are...

90
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,709
Open for business.

91
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,150
Hello.

92
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,633
Andy, you're up. Let's go.

93
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,934
Giddy-up. Let's do this.

94
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,773
People assume I'm great at golf,

95
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,143
but like everybody,

96
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,080
I hated golf lessons
when I was a kid.

97
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:03,152
So I used to just hang out
with the sailing club instead.

98
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:05,190
Got my knot on.

99
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,162
Damn it!

100
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,875
Guys, do we have
to stay all day?

101
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,079
I mean, Michael's gone.
Can't we just go?

102
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,215
Yeah. And I finished
my work months ago.

103
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:19,919
Excuse me, people.

104
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,824
It has come to my attention

105
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,662
that some of you have forgotten
who is in charge here.

106
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,935
When Michael is gone,
Jim is in charge.

107
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,842
When Jim is gone, Andy
and I are in charge.

108
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:35,719
When Andy is gone, you
answer to me, okay?

109
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,788
Excuse me, where do
you think you're going?

110
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,258
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not leaving.

111
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,362
No! Stanley.

112
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,233
Do not walk out that door!

113
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,370
If you walk out that
door, so help me,

114
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,207
I will--

115
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,113
he left.

116
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,184
Last time I checked,

117
00:04:52,217 --> 00:04:53,286
the American workday

118
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,358
ends at 5:00 P.M.

119
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,629
You will all stay at your desks

120
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,298
until that time

121
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,837
or you will suffer
the consequences.

122
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,640
What consequences?

123
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,647
I will tell on you.

124
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,317
There's some filing,

125
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,654
restocking the supply shelves,

126
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,225
replacing the water jug,
which nobody likes to do.

127
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,294
Um...

128
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,801
We, uh,

129
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,268
eat a lot of cake.

130
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:19,839
Cool.

131
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,376
Yeah, and, uh, you know,

132
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,948
you basically, you learn
how an office runs.

133
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,183
Hello. So...

134
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:26,920
Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec?

135
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:28,457
Excuse me. This is
Michael, my boss.

136
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,792
Yeah. Justin.

137
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:31,863
Hey, remember what
we talked about

138
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,299
in the car on the way out?

139
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,004
"Only the best and
the brightest"?

140
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,474
He's nice, and he
seems interested.

141
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,813
He's totally wrong, Pam.

142
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,148
Hey...

143
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,819
Hi. How you doin'?

144
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,089
Listen, I don't think

145
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,194
that a handsome, funny, smart,

146
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,231
funny-looking kid like you

147
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,433
should limit himself.

148
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,036
You could do whatever
you wanna do.

149
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,341
You could be a classy janitor

150
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:57,180
or a cashier with
dignity or a...

151
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:00,353
Migraine worker.

152
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:04,763
Maybe for you, paper
should be more of a hobby.

153
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,232
Sorry for wasting your time.

154
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, no problem.

155
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,807
And he signed!

156
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,077
He put his name
on the piece of--

157
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,847
okay, that...

158
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,819
Was supposed to
be a blank canvas

159
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,789
on which to put their
hopes and dreams,

160
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,927
and he just...

161
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,563
Made it into a stupid
piece of paper.

162
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:24,368
We need another one immediately.

163
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,305
Yeah. The booth is
lame without it.

164
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,508
I only brought the one.

165
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,046
Are you mental?

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,084
Michael, do you remember
you specifically told me

167
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,020
to only bring one
sheet of paper?

168
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:36,359
You said it only takes one
sheet to make a difference.

169
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:38,195
And I said, "are
you sure, Michael?"

170
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,432
And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam."

171
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,403
And then you sneezed in my tea.

172
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:44,375
And then you said, "don't worry.
It's just allergies."

173
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,343
Do you remember that?

174
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:47,213
I...don't.

175
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,891
Okay. I'll go look
for another one.

176
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,260
And that...Is why

177
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,365
I need a smart intern.

178
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,204
Hey, so, uh, how's the
direct mail business going?

179
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:02,011
I can't complain. People
love their junk mail.

180
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,948
Now, are you gettin' all
your paper from ppc, or...

181
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,551
You know what, Jim?

182
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,488
I'm not really looking to
change things up right now.

183
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:09,992
I just came out here to get
out of the office a little bit,

184
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:12,030
so why don't we just play, okay?

185
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,533
Absolutely. Will do.

186
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:18,208
So I guess I'll just
work on my short game.

187
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,326
Hello, there.

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,663
What is this company?

189
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,501
Well, it's funny
that you should ask,

190
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,272
because it's really...
More than a company.

191
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:34,509
Dunder Mifflin. Paper.

192
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,012
Thanks.

193
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,414
It--okay.

194
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,484
Damn it, Oscar!

195
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:41,388
Yeah, I'm trying to lure
these kids into my booth.

196
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,659
But, uh, kids are very wary

197
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:46,099
of being lured these days.

198
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,136
Thank you, dateline.

199
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,675
Thank you.

200
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,468
Extension 128.

201
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,172
Hiya, pumpkin. It's creed.

202
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,309
Say we're gonna ditch
this bitch--you in?

203
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:10,280
No. You out?

204
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,288
Pumpkin's out! Let's go, gang.

205
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,366
My old art room.

206
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,085
Oh! Maybe it's still here.

207
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,528
No. No, they must
have taken it down.

208
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,732
Never mind.

209
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,251
What do you want?

210
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:03,587
Michael, I know you're swamped.

211
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,256
I just thought you should know

212
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,494
that everyone in
the office has left

213
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,896
except for Angela and I.

214
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,433
Do not worry, though.

215
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,702
I have taken down their names,

216
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:13,674
and I have docked
them a personal day.

217
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,343
Who cares? I'm not
there, Jim's not there.

218
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:17,747
Why should they
have to be there?

219
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,552
So...what else is up?

220
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:24,696
Mich--

221
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:33,914
Thank you!

222
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,818
Whoa--what is this?

223
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,755
Piece of paper.

224
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,591
This isn't dunder Mifflin paper.

225
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,528
It's some sort of
Pendleton crap.

226
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,800
Well, I think they'll
get the spirit of it.

227
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,402
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam!

228
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,806
We're dying here.

229
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,909
I want you to go
back to the office,

230
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,647
and I want you to
get the real stuff.

231
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,685
I want you to get
ultra white card stock.

232
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,887
Are you serious?

233
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,560
Yes. And don't call me Shirley.

234
00:09:57,593 --> 00:09:59,766
Okay.

235
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,270
Oh!

236
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:08,283
Ah, damn it!

237
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:13,993
You know, you could
just pick it up,

238
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:14,995
take the triple bogey.

239
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,700
Yeah, i-- I'll get it out.

240
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,701
Thank you.

241
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:18,737
Yep.

242
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,962
Ah!

243
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,064
Come on, tuna!

244
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,874
Hey. Can't really talk now.
What's up?

245
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:55,710
Just checkin' in.
How's it going?

246
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,583
Uh...you know.

247
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,520
We'll see. We'll see.

248
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:03,492
I just drove 20 miles round
trip back to the office

249
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:05,898
to get Michael a single
sheet of white paper.

250
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,435
So...i could have just had
them fax it to me, I guess.

251
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,141
Oh, I like you.

252
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,845
Talk to you later?

253
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,881
Yeah. All right. Bye.

254
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,098
All right.

255
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,603
I'm sorry, I got to
annoy you one more time.

256
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,506
What if I bring
down shipping costs?

257
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,177
You can try.

258
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,048
But I've looked at your prices.

259
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,922
Even with free shipping...

260
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:35,823
Doesn't work.

261
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,628
It's just--it's not
in the stars, Jim.

262
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,473
Six.

263
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:44,708
Yeah.

264
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,644
All right, race
to the next hole!

265
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,652
Ooh. Winner gets ten bucks.

266
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:51,789
Wait--wait for me! Andy!

267
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,994
Shortcut! Shortcut!

268
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,029
Oh!

269
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,513
I fell in the sand trap.

270
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,555
All of these jobs suck.

271
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,226
I would rather live jobless
on a beach somewhere

272
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,164
off the money from
a large inheritance

273
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:33,072
than to have to work in
any one of these crapholes.

274
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,541
They suck.

275
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:37,914
Hey.

276
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,184
Game over.

277
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:44,628
Justin time.

278
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:45,663
Hi.

279
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,802
Justin case.

280
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,204
What's your last name?

281
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,808
Polznik.

282
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,245
"This...just in:

283
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:55,149
Justin polznik."

284
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,752
Huh?

285
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:59,224
Justin is the ugly
girl in the movie

286
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:01,561
who takes off her
glasses, and she's hot.

287
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,134
And you realize that
she was always hot,

288
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,335
she was just wearing glasses,

289
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,241
and that you were the blind one.

290
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,845
He's the most...

291
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,115
Important thing in
my life right now.

292
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,887
I want you... To meet my family.

293
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,822
Come on.

294
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:17,326
Oscar Martinez,
accountant extraordinaire.

295
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,897
This is Justin.

296
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:19,998
Hey. Hi.

297
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,734
This is Darryl philbin.

298
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,071
Isn't he big?

299
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:26,310
And you already met her,
Pam beesly, office hottie.

300
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,014
She will do you.

301
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:30,687
No. No.

302
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,657
But she has already dated
two guys in the office

303
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,294
that we know of, so...

304
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,298
This could be number
three, you never...

305
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,365
Excuse me.

306
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,069
Come here.

307
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:40,908
I would never say
this to her face,

308
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,444
but she is a wonderful
person and a gifted artist.

309
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,349
Why--why wouldn't you
say that to her face?

310
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:47,420
So...what do you think?

311
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,224
Think these guys are nice?

312
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:50,993
Guys I didn't bring
are even better.

313
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:52,797
Justin...

314
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,805
I'm willing to commit right now.

315
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,279
Would you do me the honor...

316
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:03,118
Of spending the summer with us

317
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,387
at dunder Mifflin?

318
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,357
I think--i think you
are very special.

319
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,328
You didn't want me before.

320
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,298
That's what you said.

321
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,834
No, I didn't.

322
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,973
You were--you were
kind of a jerk to me.

323
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,042
I...

324
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:16,310
And I'm-- I'm gonna go now.

325
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,715
Why don't--hey.

326
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,761
Ah-choo!

327
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,135
Bless you.

328
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,773
Thank you.

329
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,291
Okay, Jim, you owe me 120.

330
00:14:56,324 --> 00:15:00,399
And Phil, you owe me 230.

331
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,801
Let's open a tab,

332
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,274
because you and me are
gonna be playin' more often.

333
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,178
Count me in. No.

334
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:07,180
All right.

335
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,215
Okay.

336
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:11,955
You had some fun and,
uh, and got paid for it.

337
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:15,495
So let me just get my
last shot in there.

338
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:17,032
Is there anything
you can do for me?

339
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,167
I'll tell you what.

340
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,206
My fiscal year
ends in two months.

341
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:21,508
Let's talk then.

342
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,012
Sound good? Absolutely.

343
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,479
Good playing with you guys.

344
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:25,516
Right on.

345
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:30,526
You know, it's a tough thing

346
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,363
seeing a grown
man take six shots

347
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,367
to get out of a sand trap.

348
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,239
But I had to give Phil
credit for not quitting.

349
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,674
Which is what I told him.

350
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:41,180
I also told him that
I don't quit either...

351
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,917
And I'd call him
every single day

352
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,487
until he gave me his business.

353
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,357
Which he then did...

354
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:50,032
After...15 minutes of
me blocking his car.

355
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:53,405
So I am now his paper supplier.

356
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:58,214
And I shot a 102 today, so
I'm feelin' pretty good.

357
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:01,421
The job fair will be
closing in five minutes.

358
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,627
Eighth period will
commence as scheduled.

359
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,498
Hold down the fort.

360
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,566
I have to do something.

361
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:19,124
Excuse me.

362
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,427
If you can hear me,

363
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,634
I would like you to look
around at all these companies

364
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:29,577
and know that none of them
are good enough for you.

365
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,348
H&r block?

366
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,783
Come on!

367
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:35,122
I mean, I don't even
know what they do.

368
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:38,327
"Frank Regan funeral home"?

369
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,199
Too much formaldehyde.

370
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,802
The air force?

371
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,042
Air force is cool.

372
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:48,247
The refreshments?
Bush league, you know?

373
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:50,119
That's not what you want.

374
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,489
Dunder--

375
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,094
that--okay.

376
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,495
I see security is coming,

377
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,068
so I just wanted to say
come to dunder Mifflin.

378
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,371
Dunder Mifflin,
a great place to work.

379
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,042
Anybody? Show of hands?

380
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,180
Anybody wanna intern
at dunder Mifflin?

381
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:05,348
We do not offer college credit.

382
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:07,453
We cannot give you
any sort of pay,

383
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,757
but it is a really
fun work environment.

384
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:13,565
Anybody? Show of hands?

385
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,705
Damn it. Okay.

386
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,377
I'm gonna wrap it up here.

387
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:23,318
Thank you...For your time.

388
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:26,090
And drive safe.

389
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,865
Thank you.

390
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,337
You're welcome.

391
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:09,877
Beers?

392
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:10,979
You closed it?

393
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:11,981
I closed it.

394
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:14,219
Yes! Oh!

395
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,971
Um...congratulations to you, sir.
Thank you.

396
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,809
Oh, thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

397
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,545
Well done. Nice job. Thank you.

398
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:30,685
You know what? Screw this.

399
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,588
Oh!

400
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,756
Ooh.

401
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,429
* bow wow wow

402
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,697
* do do do do do do do do *

403
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,567
Today I did something stupid.

404
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:39,804
I questioned myself,

405
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,774
and I will never do that again.

406
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,012
'Cause I look at somebody
like Jim Halpert,

407
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:47,485
and I think that guy can
do anything he wants to do.

408
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,689
He could...Do anything,

409
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:54,800
and he chooses to work
here selling paper.

410
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,603
Just like me.

411
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,641
Yeah. Kiss her.

412
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:00,578
Kiss her good.

413
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,467
Hi. Hello.

414
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,002
I was just wondering

415
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:14,540
what kind of jobs
do you guys have?

416
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:16,075
Are you interested
in graphic design?

417
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,780
Yeah. Um...

418
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,684
Can I fill out an application?

419
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:20,819
Oh, absolutely. Here.

420
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,722
Take a seat.

421
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,925
I should let you know right away

422
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:25,629
this is just an entry level job.

423
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:26,831
It's really basic.

424
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,000
We're looking for
like a self-starter,

425
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:30,004
someone who can meet deadlines

426
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,475
and just pretty much just
go the extra mile, I guess.

427
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,845
I can do that. Great.

428
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,681
And, uh, obviously,
we're looking for someone

429
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,719
who knows Photoshop
and Dreamweaver,

430
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:42,128
Corel painter, Illustrator,
After Effects--all the basics.

431
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,998
I don't know any of those.

432
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,438
It's actually not
super-complicated.

433
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,172
I mean, I'm sure there's
some sort of, like,

434
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,946
adult education
classes in the area.

435
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,016
But if you're really serious
about graphic design,

436
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,920
one thing about New
York or Philadelphia--

437
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:57,091
they've got amazing programs
out there for design.

438
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:58,060
New York or Philadelphia.

439
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,497
Yeah.

440
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,066
All right.

441
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,402
Cool. Well, thanks.

442
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,839
And I'll look into those.
You should.

443
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,042
New York or Philadelphia.

444
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,046
Absolutely. That's
where the action is.

445
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,081
Thanks.
