1
00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:03,673
And the same thing goes for quarterly
reports. They are unreadable.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,218
They're just numbers
and boring and...

3
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:06,310
Blech!

4
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:09,481
So what I was thinking is that maybe
we should have some sort of graphic,

5
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:12,651
like if we have a bad
quarter, put in a storm cloud.

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:18,558
And when we have a good quarter,

7
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,501
fireworks or a racecar.

8
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:26,498
Doesn't have to be a racecar.
Use your imagination.

9
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:29,304
There's this cube on the screen,
and it bounces around all day,

10
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:33,211
and sometimes it looks like it's heading
right into the corner of the screen,

11
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:36,375
and then at the last minute, it
hits a wall and bounces away.

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,818
We are all just dying to see
it go right into the corner.

13
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:45,891
Pam claims that she saw it one day when
she was alone in the conference room.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,861
Okay. I believe she
thinks she saw it.

15
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:52,194
I saw it. I saw it,
and it was amazing.

16
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,428
Who said I didn't see it? Did
Jim say that I didn't see it?

17
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,560
I saw it.

18
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:58,567
We have a lot of
colored paper here.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,006
Why, oh, why do we keep
printing this on white?

20
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:02,838
No! Come on!

21
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,209
Yeah! I know.

22
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:07,209
I know. It's bland.

23
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:08,442
It's never going to happen.

24
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:10,347
Dude, you gotta believe.

25
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:13,043
Maybe we could have
some sort of riddle?

26
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,145
Wait for it.

27
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:20,058
Like something that you have to
look for, sort of a Where's Waldo?

28
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,759
All right. All right. Let's
quit while we're ahead.

29
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,131
That was so awesome.

30
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,535
That was awesome. Thank you.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,101
Some days I am just on fire.
What can I say?

32
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,502
Hey. There he is.

33
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,274
Hey, Meredith. How
are you feeling?

34
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,077
I never thanked you for
coming to the hospital.

35
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,640
Oh, please. It was my pleasure.
Well, we all came, so...

36
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,949
Well, I really
appreciate you coming.

37
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:21,955
I'm singling you out.

38
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:25,251
Anyway, I have this Sharpie,

39
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:28,022
and I was wondering if
you could sign my cast.

40
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,562
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:35,896
Can you write where
I can read it?

42
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,369
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:45,441
I'll read this when I get home.

44
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,878
All right.

45
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:52,516
Michael, this is the press
release I was telling you about.

46
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,316
Ryan wants you to
share it with everyone.

47
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:55,651
Does he?

48
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:56,985
He does.

49
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,952
Okay. Attention.

50
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:02,019
Earthlings, I have some news.

51
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,190
Beep, beep, beep.

52
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,824
Beep, beep, beep. Okay.

53
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:10,803
Today is the big day that I'm
heading to New York to attend a party

54
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:12,897
with sushi and important people.

55
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:16,008
On an unrelated note, if anybody
has an interesting anecdote

56
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,977
that is not boring
and easy to memorize,

57
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:20,913
please drop by my office before I leave.
Thank you.

58
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,948
Is that really what Ryan
wanted you to tell us?

59
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:29,581
And today, the Dunder Mifflin
Infinity website officially launches.

60
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:33,518
Well, the website is the
brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan.

61
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,653
It is my brain-grandchild.

62
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,925
And to celebrate its birth,

63
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,125
all of the different branches are
going to have satellite parties,

64
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:44,968
which will be connected,
via webcams and fibers,

65
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,735
to the real party, which is
going on in New York City

66
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,801
at a very exclusive nightclub.

67
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,405
That is where all of the VIPs,

68
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:59,818
including yours truly, will be
partying with New York City's finest.

69
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:01,878
And I do not mean policemen.

70
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:04,453
The company is projecting
record high sales,

71
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:08,586
and that by 6:00, the website will be
the new best salesman in the company.

72
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:09,891
Wow. Watch out, Dwight.

73
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:12,694
That's ridiculous. I'm not
gonna be beaten by a website.

74
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:13,961
Actually it sounds like you are.

75
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:15,969
Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?

76
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:18,631
That's from Ryan? Does it
mention if he's seeing anybody?

77
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,173
No, it doesn't. I'll
find out tonight.

78
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,765
Yes, please let us know.

79
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,936
I can make more sales
than a computer.

80
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,378
In fact, I challenge that website
to make more sales than me today.

81
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,881
Waste of time.

82
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,281
What's that, pipsqueak?

83
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,047
Waste of time. The
website's going to win.

84
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,782
You believe a
computer can beat me?

85
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,016
I don't care, but yes.

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,455
Well, I will prove you wrong.

87
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,356
I don't care, and you won't.
You'll see.

88
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,224
I won't be watching,
and I won't.

89
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:45,524
Dwight mercy-killed
Angela's cat.

90
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,492
It's very complicated.

91
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:52,161
It's caused a lot of unpleasantness
between Dwight and Angela,

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,333
who were both already
prone to unpleasantness.

93
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,545
Stanley, you're dancing.

94
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:05,085
No, I'm not.

95
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,919
Yeah, I created a website.

96
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:13,984
Look, at the end of the day, Apple's
apple is flying at 30,000 feet.

97
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,085
This is a paper company,

98
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:19,156
and I don't want us to get lost in
the weeds or into a beauty contest.

99
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,565
I told you I don't want you
doing these things in here.

100
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,968
You can use your own office
or do it in the hall.

101
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,235
Convergence, viral marketing,
we're going guerilla,

102
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:28,332
we're taking it the streets,

103
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:30,400
while keeping an eye on
the street, Wall Street.

104
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,809
I don't want to
reinvent the wheel here.

105
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,473
In other words,
it is what it is.

106
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,175
Buying paper just became fun.

107
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,781
And this is where I
will record your sales.

108
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:44,921
Very nice, very nice.

109
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:48,894
And then I will say something
positive like, "Kudos,"

110
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:50,658
or, "Job well done."

111
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:52,790
Or, "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah!"

112
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:56,793
I can't tell if he's mocking me.

113
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:58,498
Just ignore him.

114
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:02,234
I can't do that. It's really
hard for me to let things go.

115
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,471
I was mocking.

116
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:06,012
Thank you.

117
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:10,484
I just feel like we need something
more to acknowledge when I make a sale.

118
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,610
Yes! Like a chime or a bell.

119
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,086
Or a gong.

120
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:25,354
Go to my car, open the trunk,
inside you will see many pelts.

121
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:30,029
Under the smallest one is a case.
Inside that case is a bear horn.

122
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:31,298
Bring it to me.

123
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,532
Yes!

124
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,874
Isn't 7:00 p.m. A little
late for a lunch party?

125
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:46,414
Lunch party? It's supposed
to say "Launch Party."

126
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:48,688
What is wrong with you?

127
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,217
Angela is worse than usual lately,
and we have a party to throw,

128
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:57,355
so I googled, "How to deal
with difficult people."

129
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,594
And I got all of this.

130
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:03,398
So we're gonna try out
some new things today.

131
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,971
So, how do you feel about the
fact that the banner says "Lunch"?

132
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:12,178
I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry
at you for doing something stupid.

133
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,779
Angry at me for believing you
could do something not stupid.

134
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,986
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That must be awful.

135
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:22,852
It is awful. You've
made this day awful.

136
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,350
Maybe you could just
change the U into an A.

137
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,121
Then it would say
"Lanch Party," Kevin.

138
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:31,164
Would it really be better
if it said "Lanch Party"?

139
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,290
Lunch party.

140
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,856
It's supposed to say "Launch."

141
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,562
Okay, wow, easy, booster seat.

142
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:37,695
Nobody cares about
this party anyway.

143
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:38,796
I care.

144
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:41,467
"Plan a party, Angela. Oh, and
the entire world will see it.

145
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,703
"Oh, and here's $65
for your budget.

146
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,542
"Oh, and here are four idiots who
will do nothing but weigh you down.

147
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,104
"Oh, and your cat's still dead."

148
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:50,011
Twenty seconds to go-time.

149
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,711
Got it. Carb up.

150
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,678
Really? Power Gel?

151
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:58,020
Hey, if you want to win, you
got to fuel like a winner.

152
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:01,020
Okay, we start.

153
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:04,225
As soon as I make this shot.

154
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:05,492
Hey! Go!

155
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,624
Yeah!

156
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,462
Hello, Susan. Dwight Schrute.

157
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:13,666
What would you say if I told you
we could pull a prank on Dwight,

158
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,936
at the same time,
not be working?

159
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,479
What? He's going
through a breakup.

160
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,846
Yeah. I'm aware of that, but
he's also being super-annoying,

161
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,039
and I'm not a perfect person.

162
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,517
Yeah! Yeah!

163
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,713
Got one!

164
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:31,019
Three reams! In
your face, machines!

165
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,755
What kind of prank
are you thinking?

166
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:38,493
What if I told you I
could offer free shipping?

167
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:39,931
Sure, I'll hold.

168
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:01,150
Not sure. Just
became self-aware.

169
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,715
So much to figure out.

170
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,893
I think I am programmed
to be your enemy.

171
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:11,957
I think it is my job to destroy
you when it comes to selling paper.

172
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:37,048
It appears that the
website has become alive.

173
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,724
This happens to computers
and robots sometimes.

174
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,318
Am I scared of a
stupid computer?

175
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,262
Please, that computer
should be scared of me.

176
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:48,427
I have been salesman of the month
for 13 out of the last 12 months.

177
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,528
You heard me right. I did
so well last February,

178
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,540
that corporate gave me two
plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

179
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,506
Okay.

180
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,748
Yes, it's too tight.

181
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:05,877
Way too tight.

182
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:06,942
Really?

183
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,283
This is why I'm here?

184
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,947
Why is it so tight?

185
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,389
It's a European cut.

186
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,188
It just looks bad.

187
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:15,052
Um...

188
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:18,621
Hey, what's hanging?

189
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,462
Setting up the
webcam for the party.

190
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,126
Good, okay, cool.

191
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,465
How many pounds do you
think I can lose by 7:00?

192
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,635
Depends. How much have
you eaten already today?

193
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,475
I had one of those big...

194
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,640
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.

195
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,610
Just one second. We're in a meeting.
I'll see if he's available.

196
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,014
It's Jan.

197
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,956
Why don't you want to go tonight?
What...

198
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,890
All your friends are going to be there...
My friends?

199
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,326
Lt'll be fun. Michael,
I was terminated.

200
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:49,718
Just...

201
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,025
Is it really that
important to you?

202
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,122
Yeah.

203
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,598
All right. Thank you.

204
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,191
Go by yourself.

205
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,600
No. No.

206
00:10:56,771 --> 00:11:00,332
No. If I go by myself, everybody
will think I'm a big loser.

207
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,873
Well... Do I have your
permission to invite Carole?

208
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,036
What? Jeez, Michael!

209
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,306
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,146
I'm sorry. It's just the first
girl that popped into my head.

211
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:11,707
I'll find somebody that
I haven't slept with.

212
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,451
Nice.

213
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,387
Website check, please.

214
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:18,186
305.

215
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,355
305. You, my friend,
are winning handsomely.

216
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:25,188
It just made another sale. 380.

217
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:29,760
You, my friend, are in
a very close second.

218
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:30,895
402.

219
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,802
Okay, why don't you
just lay off, lady?

220
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,068
What do you want me to do?
Not announce it? 412.

221
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,173
So, this is the dealio.

222
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,547
God has smiled upon me

223
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:48,110
and given me two tickets to the
big party in New York, tonight.

224
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,453
What are you doing this evening?

225
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:55,993
Look at that.

226
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,691
They have their own little
language now, like twins.

227
00:11:58,766 --> 00:11:59,824
Sure, we'll go.

228
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,663
All right. Well, fight it
out amongst yourselves.

229
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,396
I was thinking Pammy,

230
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,301
but boys' night
out is also good.

231
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:06,839
I'm sorry. What?

232
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,506
One of the tickets is for him.

233
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,875
Just let me know
who the winner is.

234
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,306
Not it. Not it. No!

235
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:16,406
I won.

236
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,474
Definitely not. If
anything it was a tie.

237
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:20,349
Tie goes to the girlfriend.

238
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:25,448
No, I realize you normally reorder in
November, but what I'm suggesting...

239
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,554
You did what?

240
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:31,188
No. That's exactly what you're
not supposed to do, damn it!

241
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:32,755
Why would you reorder
from a computer

242
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,700
when you could have the
personal touch of a salesman?

243
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:38,904
How's it going? Fine. Good.

244
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:40,372
Yeah? Yeah.

245
00:12:40,774 --> 00:12:41,832
You look a little worried.

246
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,809
I do not look worried.

247
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,489
"Here's a suggestion, computer.

248
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,825
"I assume you read binary, so
why don't you zero, one, one,

249
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,923
"one, one, one, zero,
one, one, zero, one, one?"

250
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,562
Okay.

251
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:11,867
While you were typing that,
I searched every database in existence

252
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:16,205
and learned every fact about
everything and mastered the violin.

253
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,306
And sold more paper.

254
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,822
I asked for assorted cutlery,
and I got back spoons.

255
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:36,487
These are worthless.

256
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,360
I want to understand
what you're saying,

257
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:41,333
but it's difficult for me
when you use that tone.

258
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:47,735
Phyllis, these are spoons.

259
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:52,302
Spoons have rounded tops and
are used to scoop things.

260
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,078
What we need are forks,

261
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,983
which have prongs or
tiny spears on top.

262
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,819
And we need knives,
which have blades.

263
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:05,453
Do you understand me now?

264
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,559
Yes.

265
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:08,890
Goodie.

266
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:14,762
Hey, man. What's up, man?

267
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,666
What's going on? Paper delivery.

268
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,398
Oh, yeah? Kelly
ordered this online.

269
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:31,310
What are you doing?

270
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,182
I am in the fight of my
life against this computer,

271
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:34,515
and every sale counts.

272
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:37,216
But you get to put the paper in this
little shopping cart and then it says,

273
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,782
"Thanks for shopping
with Dunder Mifflin."

274
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:43,724
Damn it, Kelly! It knows!
It knows what you did!

275
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:44,821
Who knows?

276
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:45,922
Return it! Return it now!

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,228
Hey.

278
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,395
How about instead of yelling
at our sweet little Miss Kapour

279
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,133
over 500 sheets of paper,
you get back to your desk

280
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:55,767
and start selling
multiple reams like a man.

281
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,101
You don't understand.

282
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:00,771
Okay, if this makes
the difference,

283
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:03,976
I'm going to tell it that
you were responsible.

284
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,746
Who's "it"?

285
00:15:11,191 --> 00:15:12,180
There you go.

286
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,590
Thanks.

287
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,457
So, you still missing Ryan?

288
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,586
Not so much anymore.

289
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,364
I am not a bad person.

290
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:26,929
When I left Staples, I took
some of their leads with me,

291
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,066
but I never intended
to use them.

292
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,906
What did I intend
to do with them?

293
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:34,610
Who knows? Maybe keep
them as a souvenir,

294
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:35,807
maybe use them.

295
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,750
Yes, Mr. Galioto, how would you
like to pay 10%% less for paper

296
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,720
than you're paying right now?

297
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,482
It's not important how
I got your information.

298
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:48,585
What is important is
that you say yes. Good.

299
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:51,222
All right, I'm ready to go,
and I'm calling shotgun.

300
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,287
I'm driving?

301
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,799
Yes. Thank you.

302
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,459
All right. Let me just
say goodbye to Pam.

303
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:59,404
Oh, yeah. You better say goodbye to Pam.
Say goodbye to Pam.

304
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:03,573
Bye. I love you.

305
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:08,481
I love you. Okay.

306
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,416
I'm leaving inside Jim's car

307
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:13,749
I don't know when
I'll be back again

308
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:18,656
Yes, I do, tomorrow I'll be back

309
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,249
I'll be back tomorrow.

310
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,492
Yeah, so you know what? Why don't you
guys take off a little bit early tonight?

311
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,157
Because there's a party.

312
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:29,566
A party for the website I've
been planning for two weeks.

313
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:33,902
If you are not this tall, you
may not ride the rollercoaster.

314
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,032
See you guys tomorrow.

315
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:38,203
Perfect. So let me just get
some basic information from you.

316
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:50,922
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Yes.
Could you repeat that?

317
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,686
Yes! Ten reams for the U.S.
District Court!

318
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,890
Did I happen to mention the 40 reams
for the Battered Women's Shelter?

319
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:02,196
No!

320
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,406
Stop it. Give me that. Give it.

321
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:11,205
Did you see the board?

322
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,212
There's still an hour.

323
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,144
You ever read this?

324
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:20,277
Yeah. A long time
ago, but I liked it.

325
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:21,719
I got it for Ryan.

326
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:23,987
I wanted to get him Oh,
the Places You'll Go!

327
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:25,115
But they were sold out.

328
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:28,127
I figured it's the same
sort of stuff in here.

329
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,720
It's not. It's different.
It's a good book.

330
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,091
What was that?

331
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:35,829
Leaving Pennsylvania.

332
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:38,904
Two kisses.

333
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,234
One for me. One for Jan.

334
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:41,331
Gotcha.

335
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,932
You guys should come over
for dinner, you and Pam.

336
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,500
That would be fun. Friday?
That would be fun.

337
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:46,478
Want to come over Friday? Can't.

338
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,071
After work, you...

339
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,775
Oh, no, 'cause...

340
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,243
You're gonna let me know
when we're close, right?

341
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,289
Yes. Actually, I will
tell you right now.

342
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,816
It's a club called Chat Room,
and there's a password to get in,

343
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,158
which is actually
"Password," so...

344
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,322
Okay.

345
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,260
What are you doing?

346
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,494
That is an invitation
to an online party.

347
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,800
No. No. I'm sure that's not.

348
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:15,301
Are there three "W's" at the
beginning of the address?

349
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,076
Yes. Yeah.

350
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:26,477
Well, the invitation says VIPs only.
Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?

351
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:29,749
We're already in the city.

352
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:33,224
The main part, with the buildings.
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:34,453
What do you want
me to do tonight?

354
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:35,756
And if you tell me

355
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,821
that I have to drive back to
Scranton to the satellite party,

356
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,594
I am going to throw up.

357
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,629
Okay, I am going to throw up.

358
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,172
I'm throwing up. You're
making me throw up, Ryan.

359
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,435
You know what this is like?
I'll tell you what this is like.

360
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,703
This is like when the
freshmen would throw a party

361
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,143
and wouldn't let any
of the seniors go.

362
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:59,174
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that
little twerp got the promotion over us?

363
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,517
Actually, I withdrew
from consideration.

364
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:03,419
Yeah. I withdrew too.

365
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,333
Four, three, two, one!

366
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:17,700
Yes!

367
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,272
After numerous projections
that the computer

368
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:24,572
would crush all
salesmen in its path,

369
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:29,207
I am very happy to report that
our very own Dwight Schrute

370
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:33,447
has crushed his electronic
nemesis, if you will,

371
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,886
by a whopping 52 reams.

372
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,184
Reams.

373
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:38,982
- Wait, say it again.
- Announce it again.

374
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,048
Fifty-two reams!

375
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:41,185
No, no. No, the first part.

376
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,923
Dwight has defeated
the computer.

377
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:49,034
Hey, so, what do you think?

378
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:51,835
I did it for you.

379
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,736
I didn't ask you
to do it for me.

380
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:55,665
You didn't have to.

381
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,010
How do you tell
someone it's over?

382
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,573
You send them a notarized letter, right?
Well, what if the recipient is your notary?

383
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,253
Hello, Pam.

384
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:10,085
Hello. Hey,

385
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,523
do you have any men that
you can fix me up with?

386
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,288
I would like to have a
relationship with a man.

387
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,663
I'll get back to you.

388
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,199
Let me know.

389
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,612
All right, who wants to party?

390
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:38,742
Why aren't you in New York?

391
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,377
What?

392
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,422
I think I faked Oscar out.

393
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,753
You said you weren't coming
back and we could leave early.

394
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,588
I think I faked
Stanley out, too.

395
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,595
Who else thought that I was leaving
and that you could all go home early?

396
00:20:49,663 --> 00:20:52,291
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

397
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,527
Well, who needs New York?

398
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,126
Right? We can have a killer
party right here in Scranton.

399
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:58,296
Thank you.

400
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:01,398
No, no, no. This is going to be nothing
like the party you've been planning.

401
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:05,070
This is going to be good,
and everybody's gonna come.

402
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,908
What's wrong with Dwight?

403
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,039
He beat the computer.

404
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:12,950
Hey, good for you. Good for you!
Scranton power.

405
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,349
All right, you know what?

406
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:17,515
Angela, I'd like you to come
into my office in 10 minutes.

407
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:19,991
Bring something to write with
and something to write on.

408
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,118
Good!

409
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,898
It was a pretty
disappointing day.

410
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:31,301
It was kind of a slap in
the face to realize that

411
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:34,833
I wasn't as important
as I thought I was

412
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:38,036
to a certain young executive
who I'd cared about.

413
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:41,604
But, you know, I'm
not gonna cry over it.

414
00:21:42,482 --> 00:21:44,074
I did that in the
car on the way home.

415
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:45,476
How are we doing on time?

416
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,780
The party starts in an hour.

417
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:50,220
Good. These are some things that
I would like to have happen.

418
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:54,426
"Beer, light beer,
streamers, orchids,

419
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:56,291
"better lighting,
something made of ice"?

420
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,092
Those are just things. This
is how I want it to feel.

421
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:01,566
"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza
without mushrooms, white pizza, steak"?

422
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:05,002
I would like this
party to be sexier,

423
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:06,732
cooler, more important...

424
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,604
"Chocolates, someone famous"?

425
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,767
Yes. "Cool music,

426
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,708
"confetti, go-go dancers"?

427
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:14,576
I want it to embarrass
all other parties.

428
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:17,981
I want it to be a party
that the guys in New York

429
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:22,579
watch on the webcam and say, "Wow,
how did they get Al Roker to come?"

430
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,587
I can't do this. Yes, you can.

431
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:25,647
I can't do it.

432
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:27,454
Yes, you can. I know you can.

433
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:29,961
I wouldn't say that if I
didn't 100%% believe it.

434
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,657
Who else could do this?

435
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,997
Okay. Okay.

436
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,035
No, seriously, is there anyone
else who could do it better?

437
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,297
Because we don't
have a lot of time.

438
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,736
I'll get the pizza!

439
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,381
What do you think of Angela?

440
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,754
I think she's efficient.

441
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:58,290
No, not like that. As a woman.

442
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,960
W-O-M-A-N.

443
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,962
I hadn't noticed.

444
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,123
You hadn't noticed
she's a woman?

445
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:10,367
I hear she's single
and ready to mingle.

446
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:13,071
I'm thinking about
making a play for her.

447
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,230
What do you think? Crazy, right?

448
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:18,904
I think it's inappropriate to
date someone you work with.

449
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,406
Isn't that part of the fun?

450
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,710
No. I think you
should date Kelly.

451
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:26,445
She works here, too. How
is that any different?

452
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,683
She works in the annex.

453
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,748
You're also welcome
to date Toby.

454
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,118
Okay.

455
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,120
Good news! We get to go home?

456
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:42,691
Guess who just ordered from your
favorite pizza place, Alfredo.

457
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:44,361
Wait.

458
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:49,006
Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?
Or Pizza By Alfredo?

459
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,600
Same thing.

460
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:51,973
No. No, it's not.

461
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:53,409
All right. You know what?
I don't understand

462
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,673
when you all talk
at the same time.

463
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,113
Oscar, talk to him.

464
00:23:57,183 --> 00:24:00,118
Michael, there's a very big difference
between these two pizza places,

465
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:04,418
both in quality of ingredients
and in overall taste.

466
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,390
Which one did you order from?

467
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,825
Pizza By Alfredo.

468
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:12,694
All right, you know what?
Okay, okay, what is better?

469
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:17,828
A medium amount of good pizza or all
you can eat of pretty good pizza?

470
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,338
Medium amount of good pizza.
Medium amount of good pizza.

471
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:26,369
Oh, no, it's bad. It's real bad.

472
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,113
It's like eating a
hot circle of garbage.

473
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,812
You can pick one
of these things.

474
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:38,914
It's unreasonable for you
to ask me to do all of this.

475
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:43,358
It should take you no time at all if you
put the care into it that you normally do.

476
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,160
Ow!

477
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,963
That seemed to shut her up.

478
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:54,461
You looking for
dinner and a movie?

479
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,270
'Cause you're not gonna
find it in that box.

480
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:02,845
It just so happens, I know where
you can find it, but again,

481
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,542
not in the box.

482
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,155
Angela, are you hearing
words that I'm saying?

483
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,385
What?

484
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,653
Hello.

485
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,189
I have been working on
a party for three weeks

486
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:18,662
that just got thrown
out the window,

487
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,926
so now I have to pull
together a whole new party,

488
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,763
and my useless number two quit.

489
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,462
So now there's no one
in charge of orchids,

490
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:26,528
chocolates or the thing
that's made of ice.

491
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,403
And my upper back itches,
and it's itched all day,

492
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:31,932
and I can't reach it. And Kevin
had Greek food for lunch again!

493
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,742
They say you should never
mix business with pleasure.

494
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:39,842
Really?

495
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,719
Well, then explain to me how a
putt-putt golf company operates.

496
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:49,852
Yeah?

497
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:51,590
The Pizza By
Alfredo guy is here.

498
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:52,892
You don't have to
say it like that.

499
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,193
I said it normal.

500
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:00,137
Hey. Hey.

501
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:02,640
$63.50, and that's
not including tip.

502
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,198
Right. I have a coupon,

503
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:07,974
so half of $63.50 and
half the tip on $63.50...

504
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,982
Half-off coupons only apply
to orders of two pizzas.

505
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,780
Yeah, no, I told them on the
phone I was ordering eight pizzas.

506
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,286
I don't care what you
told them on the phone.

507
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:17,083
That's our policy.

508
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:19,989
You didn't actually think that I was
going to spend 60 bucks on pizza?

509
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:21,321
It's not pizza. Okay.

510
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:25,797
It doesn't say it anywhere on the
coupon, and if it's your policy,

511
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:27,856
it should say it on the coupon.

512
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,959
What do you mean?

513
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:31,060
Not my problem.

514
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:32,604
It is your problem.

515
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:38,172
That's no way to do business, okay?
I ordered

516
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,677
eight pizzas with
a half-off coupon,

517
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:43,112
so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.
End of story.

518
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:46,913
It's a great story. It's $63.50,
and that's not including tip.

519
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,476
I'm not giving that to you.

520
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:50,579
Well, then you're not
getting your pizzas.

521
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,624
No. No! You're not... No!

522
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:56,253
You are not going anywhere!
You're going to stay here

523
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,593
until we figure this out! What?

524
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:03,727
You know what? This young man needs to
learn that that's not how you treat people!

525
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,169
I don't care if it's pizza!

526
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:10,641
Good business is about respect and
accountability and follow-through.

527
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,473
You don't just make promises

528
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,514
and pull the rug out from
under somebody, do you?

529
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:18,414
Dwight, please escort this young
man into the conference room.

530
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,678
Right now. Get into
the conference room.

531
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,310
I'm not going in there. Yeah, you are.
Yeah, you are.

532
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:24,185
And you will come out when you decide
to give me a discount on the pizza.

533
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,655
Please. Thank you.

534
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,383
This is stupid.

535
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,190
No, you don't even
know what stupid is.

536
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:34,132
It's about to get all
stupid up in here!

537
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,411
You find anything?

538
00:27:49,482 --> 00:27:51,973
We think it's a
straightforward kidnapping.

539
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:54,382
Stanley, could you
look up accomplices?

540
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,818
Why can't you guys do it?

541
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:58,049
Because we're
looking up jail time.

542
00:27:58,391 --> 00:27:59,949
Fine.

543
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:01,083
I've seen this kid before.

544
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,560
He's one of the kids that sneaks
onto my farm and steals my hemp.

545
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:07,423
Yeah, I know that guy. He's that
farmer that grows really crappy weed.

546
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:17,332
You ready to give
me my discount now?

547
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,502
No.

548
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:20,944
Okay, what have you been
doing in here this whole time?

549
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,275
What kind of business is this?

550
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,474
We're a paper company.

551
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,244
The best paper company in
the whole wide world, okay?

552
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,342
All right, Dwight, knock it off.

553
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:30,579
You'd better think about what
you are doing, young man.

554
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:32,180
You better think about
what you're doing.

555
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:36,786
No! I'm an adult. I don't
have to think or do anything.

556
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:40,229
You're a kid. You're a
little, snot-nosed punk kid

557
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:42,460
who thinks he's better
than everybody else,

558
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:43,968
because he's some hotshot.

559
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,436
And you don't know
anything about sales!

560
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,530
So stop being a disrespectful
little jerk, okay?

561
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:49,665
Sales?

562
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:52,302
Yes, sales. You sell pizza. Last
time I checked, that's called sales.

563
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:53,367
You're such a loser.

564
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:54,435
What did you just call him?

565
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:56,208
A loser. What did you say?

566
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:57,442
A loser. What?

567
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,813
A loser. What was that word?

568
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,681
Stop getting him to say it!

569
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:03,053
You just made this
worse, a whole lot worse.

570
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,419
I can make him talk, Michael.

571
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,479
- Michael!
- Michael!

572
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:07,025
We are accomplices. I'm
not going to jail for this.

573
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,684
Stop talking all at once!

574
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:09,887
You need to let him go.

575
00:29:09,962 --> 00:29:13,329
Let go of little jerk-boy before
he has learned his lesson?

576
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,991
Yes. You know what, Jim?

577
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,969
The world would be a better place if people
were held accountable for their actions.

578
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:20,835
Yes, but not by kidnapping them.

579
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:22,271
I'm not kidnapping him.

580
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,639
I'm keeping him until
I get what I want.

581
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,802
As a hostage.

582
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:26,902
I think you're over-thinking it.

583
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,003
I think you're
under-thinking it.

584
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,707
Yes. Is Alfredo there?

585
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:33,117
May I speak to a manager, then?

586
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:37,915
Okay, could you tell the manager
that I am keeping his delivery kid

587
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,720
until I get my discount on
the eight pizzas I ordered?

588
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:43,622
Yes, I know it is
not on the coupon.

589
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:50,524
Also, I would like him to
throw in two, three pizzas,

590
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:53,004
just for our... Ransom.

591
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:54,164
...trouble.

592
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:57,876
Okay. All right.

593
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:00,709
What did he say?

594
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:01,803
He said no.

595
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,075
So we should let him go.

596
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:04,479
No. No.

597
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,676
Okay.

598
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:08,117
Listen up, kid,

599
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,152
I don't like you,

600
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:14,352
but because some town in Switzerland
says so, you have rights.

601
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:20,989
I have to hang these.

602
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,636
Why are you looking
at her like that?

603
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,903
Hey!

604
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:44,150
What's going on?

605
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:46,282
Michael just called the pizza
place with a list of demands.

606
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:47,985
Mr. Overdramatic.
What's up, Kevin?

607
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,051
We're getting hungry out there.

608
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:55,998
We're all accomplices now anyway,
so we figured we might as well eat.

609
00:30:56,068 --> 00:31:00,971
We would like to order some good
pizza from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe

610
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:05,603
while we wait for the hostage
situation with the bad pizza to end.

611
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:12,183
I needed another hour. It could
have been done in another hour.

612
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:13,980
I think it looks good.

613
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,021
That's why you're not
in charge, Meredith.

614
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:24,253
Here you are, my dear.
One thing made of ice.

615
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:28,531
How did you...

616
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:31,268
Where'd you...

617
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:34,101
It's just ice. It'll
melt all over the floor.

618
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:35,435
Will you help me
put it over there?

619
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:37,031
Yes, I will. Okay.

620
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,269
Excuse me.

621
00:31:39,445 --> 00:31:40,537
I stole it.

622
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,249
Thank God.

623
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:50,220
Michael? Ryan wants to introduce the
branch managers in a few minutes.

624
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:52,348
You just have to wave
and introduce yourself.

625
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,722
I'll just wave and
introduce myself.

626
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,158
Hey, quick question.

627
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:57,252
Yeah?

628
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,229
If I take a pizza,

629
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:03,064
do you think you could take some
sodas and some napkins up to the roof?

630
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:05,035
I'm all over it. Good.

631
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,701
What do we got here?

632
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:09,365
Good pizza. Yeah?

633
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,432
Cheese? Or do we
have other flavors?

634
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,602
Different stuff.

635
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,475
Which one is this? Perfect.

636
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:19,980
Do you remember what you said
to me on my first day at work,

637
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:21,576
just before you walked
me over to my desk?

638
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:22,848
Yeah.

639
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:27,086
"Enjoy this moment, because you're
never going to go back to this time

640
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:29,559
"before you met your
desk-mate, Dwight."

641
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:33,261
And that's why I knew. You?

642
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:35,800
You came up to my
desk and you said,

643
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:40,771
"This might sound weird, and there's
no reason for me to know this,

644
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,933
"but that mixed-berry yogurt
you're about to eat has expired."

645
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,170
That was the moment that
you knew you liked me?

646
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:47,337
Yup.

647
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,675
Wow.

648
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:51,978
Can we make it a
different moment?

649
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,177
Nope.

650
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:56,577
Can I start talking?

651
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:01,556
Is this thing on? Give me a
signal when you want me to start.

652
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:08,460
And now from my old hometown,
Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss,

653
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:10,161
Michael Scott.

654
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,168
Hey, I just think
you should know

655
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:15,229
that one of my salesmen
beat your stupid computer.

656
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,934
So take that,.

657
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:21,003
Always a jokester.

658
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,810
How about that image?
Crystal clear.

659
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:31,154
If anyone out there is listening,
I am being held here against my will.

660
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:32,417
I'm a minor.

661
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:37,452
Ow!

662
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,723
What are you doing?

663
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:40,697
You said your upper back itched.

664
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,324
I didn't ask you to scratch it.

665
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,733
Look, Angela, I know this is
weird because we work together,

666
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:49,433
and because up until and possibly
including now I've repulsed you,

667
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:50,839
but I like you.

668
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,604
I'm not dating you.

669
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:57,848
So Angela is stubborn as a mule.

670
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:03,412
She's giving off fairly strong
vibes that she's not interested.

671
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,288
But do I like her or not?

672
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:14,762
Because if I like her,
then I can't back down.

673
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,966
If you're going number one,
you've got 10 more seconds.

674
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,072
Hey, have you seen Jim?

675
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:27,544
I guess he wanted to get out of
here before the cops find out.

676
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:33,877
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm just scaring him.

677
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,512
Now the trick is to make him think
you're going to do something to him.

678
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:37,782
I can hear you, man. Shut up,

679
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,153
or I'm going to punch
you in the throat!

680
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,782
Hey, hey, hey, stop it. Stop it.

681
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,157
No. God. Oh, my God.

682
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:48,058
Oh, my God. Oh, no. No.

683
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,728
I kidnapped a kid. You had to.

684
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:53,567
What other choice did you have?

685
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,766
I could have paid for the pizza.

686
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:58,309
Well, yeah.

687
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:04,004
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

688
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:07,774
This is Michael.

689
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:08,945
Hello, Michael. This is Ryan.

690
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,579
First off, thanks
for the shout out.

691
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,283
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

692
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,450
And why is there a
kid on your webcam

693
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:16,790
saying that he's being
held against his...

694
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:18,994
Okay.

695
00:35:19,064 --> 00:35:22,363
I want you to go in there

696
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:26,427
and pay him for the pizzas
and give him a generous tip,

697
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:28,767
no more than 10%% .

698
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:30,001
What will you do?

699
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:32,805
I will open the door.

700
00:35:33,612 --> 00:35:34,772
Yeah.

701
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,940
And hopefully he will walk out.

702
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,544
And the rest is
out of our hands.

703
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:45,617
So I'm paying full price?

704
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,783
Yes.

705
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:51,193
Here we go, 65. You know what?

706
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,696
Here's two more.

707
00:35:58,704 --> 00:36:00,638
See you. Drive safely.

708
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:04,598
Okay.

709
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:06,743
Now what?

710
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:09,542
Now we wait and hope
that nothing happens.

711
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:13,478
All right. I assume I'm going
to be reimbursed for the pizzas?

712
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:15,782
Not now, Dwight.
Please, not the time.

713
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:20,348
A toast.

714
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,154
I'm gonna make it good.

715
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:25,488
To avoiding a class-two
felony charge.

716
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,432
Hello? Hey. Hang on a second.

717
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,571
Hello. Hang on.

718
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,329
If you change your mind

719
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:01,661
I'll be first in line

720
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:06,295
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

721
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,669
If you need me, let me know

722
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,367
Going to be around

723
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:13,201
If you got no place to go

724
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:17,738
If you're feeling down,
if you're all alone

725
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:20,182
When the pretty birds have flown

726
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:24,916
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

727
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,427
Going to do my very best
And that ain't no lie

728
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:33,954
If you put me to the
test, if you let me try

729
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:38,264
Take a chance on me

730
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,328
That's all I ask of you, Angela.

731
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:46,603
Take a chance, take a chance

732
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,538
On

733
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:55,245
Me

734
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:09,566
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Yeah. What did she say?

735
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,261
I don't know yet.

736
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:12,360
I have to call you back.

737
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:13,426
Come on, you gotta
give us something.

738
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:14,938
I'll call you back.

739
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:19,143
I have to go clean
up after the party.

740
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,186
What a horrible day.

741
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:47,794
Well, I need to get the horrible
taste of this pizza out of my mouth.

742
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,004
I'd really like some sushi.

743
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,641
I was hoping that I would have
New York-style sushi today,

744
00:38:54,713 --> 00:38:56,806
and you know what?

745
00:38:56,882 --> 00:38:58,679
What? I'm gonna get it.

746
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:01,242
Coopers has calamari.

747
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:04,686
No. There's only one place to get
authentic New York-style sushi.

748
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,223
Tokyo? New York.

749
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:08,825
Wanna go? Yes.

750
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:09,883
All right. You drive.

751
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:11,189
Okay.

752
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:12,321
Nice.

753
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:13,762
Here we go.

754
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:15,322
Mmm.

755
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,334
Perfect. I'm sorry.

756
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,302
You guys are going
to have to leave.

757
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,430
Hey. You know what?

758
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:26,574
Come on, come on, let's go.

759
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,887
Hey, you're the Scranton guy?

760
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:38,945
Guilty.

761
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:41,322
I liked your statement tonight.

762
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,059
Thanks.

763
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,389
This is the guy that
beat the computer.

764
00:39:46,465 --> 00:39:49,730
Very cool. Yeah, it was funny to
see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

765
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,735
Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:53,065
See you later.

767
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:55,164
Later on.

768
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:02,142
I'm Ryan and tonight didn't go
the way that I thought it would,

769
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:06,844
because it didn't work out for
me, and I'm very embarrassed.

770
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:08,749
I have egg all over my face.

771
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:10,316
I'm 12 years old.

772
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:13,084
I spent so much time in Scranton,
but I never sold any paper.

773
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:16,127
I never sold any paper
because I'm an idiot.

774
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,856
I started a fire
with my cheese pita.

775
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,989
I dated an Indian girl.

776
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,863
I started a fire.

777
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:23,923
I started a fire.

778
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:25,094
Now I've got a beard.

779
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,637
And I got a new suit,
and I'm your boss.

780
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,297
I get everything I
want 'cause I'm very...

781
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:30,068
I'm hot. I'm so hot.

782
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:31,336
That's why everybody...

783
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:32,671
I didn't get...

784
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,234
I don't understand that.

785
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:36,439
That's part of it, just a...

786
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:54,393
Wanna head back?

787
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,564
Yeah, let's go.
