1
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,750
Open one of those for us.

2
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,990
You know you're the only one who can stand these things?

3
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,350
They're the only things left.

4
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,580
The pigs have all gone.

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,490
Used to be full of pigs, that.

6
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,980
Yeah, that and pig shit.

7
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,290
Dogs took care of them.

8
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,960
Don't think I could hack being a pig.

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
I don't think you could either.

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,810
What's so bad about being a pig?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,260
It's undignified.

12
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,510
Undignified?

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,980
Walking about with your nose the same height as your asshole.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,950
- Snout.
- What's that?

15
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,360
Pigs have snouts, not noses.

16
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,860
So it would be your snout the same height as your asshole.

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,990
Nose, snout.

18
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,830
You're still trotting about

19
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,660
gazing up everybody else's assholes all day long.

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,550
What kind of society is that?

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,360
An equal one?

22
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,360
So what do you reckon?

23
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,570
Yes or no?

24
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,550
I can give it a go. You're not gonna be long?

25
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Five minutes, max.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,120
Fucking hell.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,310
This is mental, this is.

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,160
I mean, he's dying anyway.

29
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,890
Well, he is.

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,310
I mean, it's not like it's gonna save him.

31
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,580
He's got, what, days?

32
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,990
Well, if it's what's in there makes those days easier...

33
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,770
that'll do for me.

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,650
I promised my sister we'd help him.

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,950
We all promised her.

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,170
Plus there'll be other stuff in there. Batteries.

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,910
- All sorts.
- OK. OK.

38
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,250
Leave the keys in the ignition.

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm ahead of you there.

40
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,760
If you hear anything, yeah, don't fuck about, yeah?

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,010
Just tear straight off.

42
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,040
- Five minutes?
- No more.

43
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,630
All right?

44
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,860
You sure it's gonna be in there?

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,510
Course I'm not sure.

46
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,250
Fuck it.

47
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Fuck.

48
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,980
95dy42 95-dy42.

49
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,700
95dy42 95-dy42.

50
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
95dy42 95-dy42.

51
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,810
95dy42 95-dy42.

52
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,670
95dy42 95-dy42.

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,790
95dy... 95-dy...

54
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,740
95dy42 95-dy42.

55
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,200
Quick.

56
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,030
Fuck.

57
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,960
Go. Go.

58
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,810
Go! Go!

59
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,190
Tony!

60
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,730
Clarke! Go!

61
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, fuck.

62
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,990
Come on.

63
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,260
Yes.

64
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,800
No!

65
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,410
No!

66
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,230
Fucking hell.

67
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,480
No, please!

68
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,630
Please, no! Fuck, no! No, please!

69
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,830
Please!

70
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,350
Fuck!

71
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,180
Fuck!

72
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,440
Fuck!

73
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,070
Fucker!

74
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,670
Fuck!

75
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,570
Fuck!

76
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,100
Fuck!

77
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,940
Fuck. Fuck you, you-- Fuck!

78
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,550
Ok.

79
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,820
Shit.

80
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Ok.

81
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,570
Anyone?

82
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,590
Come in?

83
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,170
If you can hear me, it's Bella.

84
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,580
Hello?

85
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,710
Pick up. Please, fucking pick up.

86
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,400
Fuck.

87
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,650
Hello? Who is that?

88
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,960
I can't hear you. You're not clear.

89
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,650
Listen, if you can hear me, just whistle.

90
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,510
Don't say anything.

91
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,690
Ok, ok.

92
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,370
I can't talk for long.

93
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
We found a dog at the warehouse.

94
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,170
We didn't see it.

95
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,210
We don't know how long it had been in there.

96
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,450
It got Tony and Clarke.

97
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,980
So they're gone. I'm-- I'm sorry.

98
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,260
And can you tell Ali that I'm sorry too?

99
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,420
She said that we were mad to bother and she was right.

100
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,110
We... We just wanted to help her with Jack.

101
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,120
I don't know...

102
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,130
Get him something that might help.

103
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,250
I know he's in pain.

104
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,950
I've lost the dog for now,

105
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,020
but my guess is it's still operational.

106
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,450
And I'm figuring it can lock onto this signal,

107
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,510
so I'm gonna have to go dark.

108
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,840
It's, um-- It stuck me with a tracker,

109
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,540
but I managed to get it out.

110
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,990
I'm gonna have to find somewhere overnight to hide out, I...

111
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,640
Get some medical stuff or something.

112
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,890
If I don't make it back...

113
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,350
will you pass a message to Graham?

114
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,860
Just I love him.

115
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,700
Please would you pass that on?

116
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm gonna have to switch off now.

117
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,910
I'll try and make it back.

118
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,130
Bye, now.

119
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,000
Fuck.

120
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,850
Fuck!

121
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,350
Come on.

122
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,420
Stay still.

123
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,250
Shit, shit, shit.

124
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,860
You can't do it.

125
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,140
You can't do it.

126
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,690
Your arm's fucked, so you can't climb the tree.

127
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,540
Yeah, take a good look, mate.

128
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,910
You'll be waiting a long time.

129
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,550
A very long time.

130
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,200
God.

131
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,750
Welcome back.

132
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,590
1,000...

133
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,990
999,

134
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,850
998,

135
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,120
997,

136
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,960
996...

137
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,640
...nine, eight, seven,

138
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,580
six, five, four,

139
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,430
three, two, one.

140
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,720
1,000...

141
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,540
999...

142
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,350
four...

143
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,880
three...

144
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,270
two...

145
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,990
one.

146
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,580
1,000...

147
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,880
999...

148
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,140
998...

149
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,130
...three, two, one.

150
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,440
993, 992...

151
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Yes.

152
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,350
...four, three,

153
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,490
two, one.

154
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,250
Oh, fuck.

155
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,150
Ah, fuck!

156
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,320
Ah, come on.

157
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,790
Oh, come on.

158
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,110
Oh, shit.

159
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,430
Come on. Come on, come on.

160
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,840
Car keys, car keys, car keys. Car keys.

161
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,440
Car keys.

162
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, fuck.

163
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,150
Keys, keys, keys. Come on.

164
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,690
Oh, fuck.

165
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh, my God.

166
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,590
Oh, fuck.

167
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,310
Oh, fuck.

168
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,240
Fuck.

169
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
Oh, God.

170
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,400
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

171
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,320
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

172
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,710
Come on. Come on.

173
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,680
Come on.

174
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,440
*Golden brown texture like sun*

175
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,350
*Lays me down...*

176
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,800
*Every time just like the last*

177
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,530
*On her ship tied to the mast*

178
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,530
*To distant lands*

179
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,430
*Takes both my hands*

180
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,300
*Never a frown with golden brown*

181
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,590
Fuck.

182
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Fuck.

183
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,370
Is there anyone there?

184
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,930
Maybe you can hear me?

185
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,610
Maybe someone can hear me.

186
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,420
If there is anyone there...

187
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,970
This is just to say that I'm not coming back.

188
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,800
Say I'm sorry to Ali and

189
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,430
that she should give Jack a kiss from me.

00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm sorry I didn't get the replacement like I promised.

191
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,300
I know how dear it was to him.

192
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,920
And I did try.

193
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,100
We all tried.

194
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,600
I hope you can look after him.

195
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,850
And, Graham, I love you.

196
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,970
And all of you.

197
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,880
I've always loved you all.
