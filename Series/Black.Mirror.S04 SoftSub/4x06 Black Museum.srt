1
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,660
*I walk along the city streets You used to walk along with me*

2
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,340
*And every step I take Recalls how much in love we used to be*

3
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,390
*Oh, how can I forget you*

4
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,790
*When there is always something there To remind me*

5
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,800
*Always something there to remind me*

6
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,810
*I was born to love you*

7
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,850
*And I will never be free*

8
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,800
*You'll always be a part of me*

9
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,080
*When shadows fall, I pass*

10
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,840
*a small cafe Where we would dance at night*

11
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,600
*And I can't help recalling*

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,060
*how it felt To kiss and hold you tight*

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,990
*Well, how can I forget you?*

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,570
*When there is always something there To remind me*

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
*Always something there to remind me*

16
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,050
*I was born*

17
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,480
Tours begin at 11. You're the first in line. Could be a busy day.

18
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,960
Road seemed pretty empty.

19
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,370
Nice accent. You from Australia?

20
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,780
No, I'm from Britain.

21
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,070
So you got one of those crazy British names?

22
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Esmeralda or, uh...?

23
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm Nish.

24
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
- Nish?
- Nish.

25
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,130
Well, I can't judge. My name's ridiculous.

26
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,640
Rolo Haynes. Owner. Proprietor.

27
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,390
Well, just us two this morning. You sure you wanna do this?

28
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,000
This place ain't for the faint-hearted.

29
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm sure I can handle it.

30
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,980
Not everyone can.

31
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,060
So, I have to peek in your little sack there if that's OK.

32
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,070
- That's OK.
- Can't trust anyone these days.

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
If you could step through there.

34
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,850
Anything metal, put it in here.

35
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,210
Cool.

36
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,710
Dinky.

37
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,920
Oh, yeah. I call it fun size.

38
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,780
Fun size. I like that.

39
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,270
Guessing you had a gut full of this security shit at the airport.

40
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,690
Our immigration guys are pretty tight these days.

41
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,620
All clear?

42
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,800
Ok.

43
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,370
Show on the road.

44
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
So, you on vacation?

45
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,620
Sort of. My dad lives out here.

46
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,520
It's his birthday, so my mom just wants to surprise him.

47
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,940
And you're the surprise?

48
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,090
part of it, I guess.

49
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,580
- Where'd you fly in?
- Salt Lake.

50
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,720
You came here from Salt Lake?

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah, I thought it'd be nice to drive the back route,

52
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,530
but I underestimated the...

53
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,440
Heck of a trip for a girl on her own.

54
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,250
I don't mean to get old-fashioned on you. - Seriously?

55
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,610
That is quite old-fashioned.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,570
It's hot as hell in here.

57
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,640
AC must've shit the bed.

58
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,020
Sorry for the heat.

59
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,000
Goddamn digital systems.

60
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,510
Never trust a guy in tech. Jesus, I should know that.

61
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,620
So what is all this stuff?

62
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,070
Authentic criminological artifacts.

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,140
If it did something bad, chances are it's in here.

64
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,990
Take a look around, take your time, see what pops out at you.

65
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,460
Anything piques your interest, I can tell you all about it.

66
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,170
There's a sad, sick story behind most everything here.

67
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,410
Just like our main attraction just through there.

68
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,200
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

69
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,020
A lot of folks just rush behind the curtain,

70
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,200
hardly even eyeball this stuff,

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,530
and then it's a bunch of one-star

72
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,350
ratings on Trip-fucker and before you know it...

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,490
Yo, look, I am not in a rush, so don't worry.

74
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,860
Well, then, take your time.

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
I shall.

76
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
This stuff looks techie.

77
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,140
Well, neuro tech was my background.

78
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,080
Sweet.

79
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,870
So, what's this, then? Looks like a hairdressing thing.

80
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,780
Actually, that was one of my very first souvenirs.

81
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,980
Sheds a little light on how our main exhibit came to be.

82
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,480
- What is it?
- You heard of Peter Dawson?

83
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,860
Dr. Peter Dawson?

84
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,990
Well, usually I say this is Dawson's Symphatic Diagnoser,

85
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,450
and folks shriek, "No way, " and I'm like, "Oh, it very much is."

86
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,400
"How the heck did you get that? " is the next question.

87
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,170
- OK.
- My domain was med tech.

88
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,170
I worked out of St. Juniper's.

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,730
It's kind of like a university hospital.

90
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,690
Sweet setup. Part of the Land Act, actually.

91
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,210
It was in downtown New York, big old building.

92
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,570
Research up top,

93
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,170
emergency room and the great unwashed down at street level.

94
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,400
It was the perfect mix of business and health care.

95
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,010
- Seriously?
- Out of the way, asshole!

96
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,130
Idea was folks with no coverage signed up for free health care

97
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,620
in exchange for consenting to occasional experimental treatments.

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,940
I... I... I worked for the guys up top.

99
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
What, like a scientist?

100
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,760
I was more sort of... recruitment.

101
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,310
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
- Clear.

102
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,330
Shocking.

103
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,030
- No.
- No?

104
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,170
- No.
- OK, I'm going again. Clear. Clear!

105
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,780
Shocking.

106
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,590
No.

107
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,190
If I'd known she was on tricyclics, I would have nudged the dose.

108
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,390
You couldn't have known.

109
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,250
This a bad time?

110
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,870
Rolo Haynes from the tenth floor.

111
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,190
Seems you've been having some problems.

112
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,150
I think I got something that can help.

113
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,700
The big thing they're into is neuro technics.

114
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,820
Pioneering brain enhancements.

115
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,840
Neural interfaces.

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,770
All that fun stuff.

117
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,490
The holy grail they've been aiming for

118
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,900
is a way to transfer knowledge.

119
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,060
So one of the teams here is working on an experiment,

120
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,040
trying to find a way to

121
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,820
beam information from one brain to another.

122
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,310
This is Kenny.

123
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,850
This is Hector.

124
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,940
Stay with me on this.

125
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,610
So, the experiment.

126
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,590
They built a little maze and they drop Kenny here into it

127
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,930
and he runs round over and over for months on end

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,250
till he knows it like a childhood home.

129
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,150
And then... they put this on him.

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
It's a transmitter,

131
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,380
absorbing signals from Kenny's brain

132
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,110
which were sent to Hector over here.

133
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,240
Hector had our prototype synaptic receiver fitted.

134
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,570
Now, remember, Hector had never even set paw in the maze.

135
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,710
Plan was he'd now receive Kenny's knowledge of the maze layout

136
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,330
and, boom, he'd be able to solve it, first time.

137
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,690
- And did he?
- No.

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,120
Scrabbled around like a rat, fucking imbecile.

139
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,770
So, um, why are you telling me this?

140
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,970
Because just as it becomes clear that the maze thing's a bust,

141
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,370
one of our researchers spills his coffee on Kenny.

142
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,430
Hot coffee spills all over Kenny,

143
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,770
so obviously he's squealing like hell,

144
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,680
but so is Hector.

145
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,810
Turns out, we haven't discovered how to share knowledge...

146
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,570
- But physical sensations.
- Bingo.

147
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,310
That's nuts. Holy shit.

148
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,820
And even nutsier shit,

149
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,690
Hector felt the burn, but took no damage at all.

150
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,210
All of the experience, none of the physical cost.

151
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,850
But how did he die?

152
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,880
They cut him open after to see if he was OK.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,330
Anyhow, thanks to Hector's sacrifice,

154
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,590
we prototyped this.

155
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,870
A receiver for human experiences.

156
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,420
A neural implant. Only one of its kind.

157
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,970
This is why you brought me up here.

158
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,920
What's the biggest pain in the ass with patients?

159
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,980
Finding out what's wrong with them in the first place.

160
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
Half of the assholes that roll in here

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,150
can't even describe their symptoms.

162
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,910
They're-- They're out cold or concussed

163
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,220
or drunk or dumb

164
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,230
or... two years old, or they can't speak English.

165
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,720
Imagine if you could feel exactly what a patient feels,

166
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,140
minus the physical consequences.

167
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,200
Like reading their minds.

168
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,600
So what do you say?

169
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,320
Gotta hand it to Dawson, he lept at the chance.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,960
Like, he was happy to do it.

171
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,410
And it was only a short procedure.

172
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,990
Irreversible, but, hey, he was a pioneer.

173
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,500
Plus, his mortality rates were in the toilet,

174
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,300
so this was his best shot at redemption.

175
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,340
Does it hurt if I touch it?

176
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,620
I don't think so.

177
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,280
There's something kinda kinky about it.

178
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,600
It's like the ultimate piercing.

179
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,210
If you're trying to make me feel better, it's working.

180
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,600
Time for the trial run.

181
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,990
So this is where our hairnet doohickey comes into play.

182
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,950
Theory was, if you slipped it on a willing subject,

183
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,800
it'd absorb their physical sensations

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,570
and relay them to Dawson's implant.

185
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,910
We just had to find out if it worked.

186
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,500
This one.

187
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,550
Houston, we got a miracle.

188
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,640
Right off the bat, dawson gets to work with the ailing public,

189
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,930
starts building up a kind of mental library of physical symptoms.

190
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,950
Plan was, he'd get to know how things felt

191
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,120
so that he could diagnose them quicker.

192
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,020
So, starts small in the ER, minor fractures, that sort of thing.

193
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,390
Soon graduates to bigger stuff.

194
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,030
Major injuries. Diseases.

195
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,690
Late-stage terminal stuff.

196
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,410
Dawson grit his teeth and went through it all.

197
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,670
Say a kid comes in obviously in pain.

198
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,530
Doctors suspect appendicitis,

199
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,890
they'd hook him up to Dawson just to be sure.

200
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,450
Dawson had felt appendicitis many times by now,

201
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,670
so he knows if it's something more.

202
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,890
Caught things they weren't even looking for.

203
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,770
Blastomas and so on.

204
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,690
Good luck, man.

205
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,620
That man saved lives, no doubt about it.

206
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,860
- Good luck, huh?
- Bye.

207
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,210
Stay in touch. Bye-bye. - Bye.

208
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,930
That was nice.

209
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,110
And, incidentally,

210
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,620
if you'll allow me to be crude,

211
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,670
Dawson's symphatic diagnoser came in handy in the bedroom.

212
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,240
His implant received pleasurable sensations, too.

213
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,500
So if his girlfriend slipped on that transmitting blue hairnet

214
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,940
and he tuned in his little implant nubbin...

215
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,200
he didn't just feel what he was feeling...

216
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,480
- I'm gonna come!
- ...but also felt what she was feeling.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,970
Son of a bitch was experiencing

218
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,150
male and female orgasms at the same time.

219
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,620
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,130
Oh, shit.

221
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,150
I can't get enough of your...

222
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,350
But?

223
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,870
- I'm sorry?
- Dawson's having a great time.

224
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,920
There's gotta be a "But."

225
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,690
He's having a great time, but...

226
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,280
But...

227
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,900
Coming through. Coming through.

228
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,090
- Come on.
- Almost there.

229
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,260
One day, they rush in Senator Whitley.

230
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,510
He'd collapsed at some fundraiser.

231
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,500
No one could tell what in hell was wrong with him.

232
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,310
- Lift.
- I got this.

233
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,200
Dawson's hooked up.

234
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,790
- Be careful.
- OK.

235
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,830
- Jeez.
- And has the roughest ride.

236
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,470
- Pete?
- Like he's got no clue what this is.

237
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,500
- Pete?
- Just one more minute, please.

238
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,510
Let the man work.

239
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,200
It's a pain he's never known.

240
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,200
- Pete, he's flatlining.
- Just one more moment.

241
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,520
And then it happened.

242
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,330
Pete?

243
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,670
Dawson blacked out, for, like, five minutes.

244
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,870
Turns out the senator had been poisoned,

245
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,280
a rare poison at that, some kind of Russian shit.

246
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,840
He'd been into that whole thing.

247
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,930
But Dawson had experienced death and come out the other side.

248
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
At the moment of death,

249
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,930
a whole galaxy of synapses fritzes out of existence.

250
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,880
Tsunami of endorphins.

251
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,990
And then there's this rolling dark wave of nothing rushes in behind.

252
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,200
When he came round, they ran every kind of test

253
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,110
and he was all systems go, nothing wrong.

254
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,500
"Shaken but unharmed," They put on his report.

255
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,250
Next day, he was back up and at 'em.

256
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,110
But there was something wrong, right?

257
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,570
To go through all that without dying?

258
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,680
Fucked up his implant like that.

259
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,630
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,040
- I'm just gonna get some water.
- OK.

261
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,020
Oh, goddamn it.

262
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,790
Fair to say his relationship with pain had shifted a little.

263
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,330
That hurt like hell.

264
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,850
Now, he was into it.

265
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,320
He really threw himself into his work after that.

266
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,390
He tried to hide it at first, but thanks to that little nubbin,

267
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,790
the more pain he felt, the more pleasure he got.

268
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,100
OK, no. Stop, stop.

269
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,540
Stop. OK, safe word. Stop!

270
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,660
- You said that we could try it.
- And we did.

271
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,210
Look, we tried the hair pulling and that choke thing.

272
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,470
I'm not into it, OK? It's just not me.

273
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,440
Maybe I should go.

274
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,620
No. No, please.

275
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,340
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,940
Stay. Please?

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Pete!

278
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm going.

279
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,940
See, it's like eating chilies.

280
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,980
You acclimatize fast.

281
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,450
First time you had a jalapeno, bet you spat it out, too hot.

282
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,330
But persevere and it becomes addictive.

283
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,720
Soon, a jalapeno's not enough.

284
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,130
You work your way up, red-hot chilies, bird's-eye chilies,

285
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,070
till you get to them Scotch bonnet devils.

286
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,230
Dawson's craving was just the same.

287
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,600
Before you know it, he's hanging around the ER

288
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,890
just waiting for a juicy accident victim to latch onto.

289
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,670
All he can think about is that next hit gnawing away up there.

290
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,960
"Give it back to me. Give it back. I gotta have it back."

291
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,910
Sarah, will you just, um, file these for me?

292
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,150
- Sure thing.
- Pete.

293
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,790
- This isn't your shift.
- Take him round to bay four.

294
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,850
- OK.
- I just...

295
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,390
Pete.

296
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,450
Careful.

297
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,240
And three, two, one.

298
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,860
Lift.

299
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,180
Let me get this.

300
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,790
Soon as he jacks in, he feels it.

301
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,980
It's a cardiac arrest. She collapsed in the street.

302
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,360
I just wanna be sure.

303
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,680
It's a heart attack all right, but he says nothing.

304
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,800
Plays for time.

305
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,220
Figures he can ride that pain train

306
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,380
all the way through to nirvana.

307
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,380
Eventually they have to physically pull Dawson away from her.

308
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,220
Give Aunt Ethel her CPR.

309
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,030
She flatlines in front of him, and he's like an alcoholic

310
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,670
watching someone pour a glass of good Scotch down the sink,

311
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,710
sick at the waste of good shit.

312
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,000
Look, we always knew going into this there might be side effects.

313
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,390
I mean, we can look into how we deactivate,

314
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,140
but it's gonna take some time.

315
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,150
I can't just pull all the people off the other projects, Pete.

316
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,880
I mean, we have milestones to hit. You know the drill.

317
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,310
But we'll get there.

318
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,990
In the meantime, we can't have you near patients,

319
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,130
so just go home,

320
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,490
put your feet up and binge a miniseries, whatever.

321
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,760
No one could have known what'd happen next.

322
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,300
Authorities are expected to confirm

323
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,280
the body is that of missing WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley.

324
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,740
Certainly a major police presence there, as we can see.

325
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,590
Let's take a look at the timeline...

326
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,740
Dawson was home alone 24/7,

327
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,410
climbing the walls. Withdrawal, I guess.

328
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,320
She was last seen the evening of Friday, September 15th...

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,960
He didn't have patients to leech pain off anymore.

330
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,810
So he started inflicting it... on himself.

331
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,450
For her safe return,

332
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,580
or for any information from witnesses...

333
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,190
Spent a week just whittling away at himself.

334
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,010
Cut here, a gouge there.

335
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,280
I mean, the guy was a doctor.

336
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,420
He knew how far he could go without it getting fatal.

337
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,210
But it was never enough.

338
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,250
None of it was enough.

339
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,350
When he worked on himself,

340
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,630
there was a crucial ingredient missing.

341
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,060
Fear.

342
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,470
The amygdala.

343
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,600
Little almond-shaped nubbin in your brain.

344
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,190
When you're afraid, it lights up

345
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,930
like a midnight airstrike, sharpens the senses.

346
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,630
The fear the patient feels

347
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,140
when they're staring up at that ceiling light,

348
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,860
the fear accompanying each sudden jab of agony,

349
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
he'd come to appreciate that, too.

350
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,900
It went with the pain.

351
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,850
Complemented it, like red wine and steak.

352
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,760
You can inflict pain on yourself, but not terror.

353
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,190
For that, you need a volunteer.

354
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,230
Dawson was practically coming when they found him.

355
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,130
He'd enjoyed one big old speedball of fear and pain and death.

356
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,810
Tell me they put him in jail.

357
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,390
In the hospital.

358
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,580
He wound up in a vegetative state.

359
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,990
Good.

360
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,380
Still there to this day.

361
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,080
In a coma, deep as the ocean.

362
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,700
But the thing of it is,

363
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,040
they say he still has that look on his face.

364
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,780
Blissed out.

365
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,770
Still riding that high.

366
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
You're fucking with me, right?

367
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,640
OK, I added the boner. I couldn't resist.

368
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,720
- Fun story, huh?
- Yep, fun story.

369
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,300
Oh, man.

370
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,660
Do you want some water?

371
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,810
- Really, I'm fine.
- No, man, it's no bother.

372
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,230
Thank you kindly.

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,240
So, how come you didn't stay in med tech?

374
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,710
Well, I did for a while.

375
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,010
Just 'cause Dawson went la-la, neuro research didn't stop.

376
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,270
TCKR adapted it and fine-tuned it.

377
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,100
It's how they wound up

378
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,980
with the digital consciousness transference,

379
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,310
what they call cookies today.

380
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,860
Uh, like when they upload old people to the cloud?

381
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,690
Yeah, but this was way before that.

382
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,240
We didn't have that whole immersive VR environment shizzle back then.

383
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,530
What we dealt with was more organic, almost lo-fi.

384
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,630
How so?

385
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,320
Gotta say you ask more questions than the average bear.

386
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,290
Well, to be honest, my car's still charging,

387
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,360
so I've got a bit of time.

388
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,680
Well, then, what I wanted to show you, um...

389
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,570
Part of what I was working on...

390
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,020
It's, um... cute?

391
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,300
Actually, one of the saddest things in the whole place.

392
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,040
Doesn't look it.

393
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,570
You ever had one of those relationships

394
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,280
where you just can't get someone out of your head?

395
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,750
- Yeah.
- Some years back, boy meets girl.

396
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,490
Boy's called Jack, girl's called...

397
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,210
- Jill.
- Carrie.

398
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,410
Cupcake?

399
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,730
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

400
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,650
* Spread your love like a fever *

401
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,200
* And don't you ever come down *

402
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,370
- Are you the sheriff now?
- Yeah.

403
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,720
- And I'm the prisoner?
- You're in trouble, sir.

404
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,780
* Spread my love like a fever *

405
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,680
Come and arrest me.

406
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,400
* I ain't ever coming down *

407
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,960
Eventually, he dick-pukes a little baby paste up her wazoo,

408
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,430
which takes hold.

409
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,290
Before you know it, out pops a boy.

410
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,450
Parker.

411
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,680
Boom. They're a family unit.

412
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,380
A walking commercial for a sunnier future. Happy as hell.

413
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,570
I wanna... I wanna take a photo.

414
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,910
OK. I'm gonna get the lake in the background.

415
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,070
- All right, buddy.
- OK, you ready?

416
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,420
Parker.

417
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,060
Wave to Mommy. Say hello. Say hi to Mommy.

418
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,930
Carrie gets hit by a truck.

419
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,130
Winds up at St. Juniper's.

420
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,480
Come back to me.

421
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,150
Come back.

422
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,590
Years go by.

423
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,860
Jack visits her every week, talks to her,

424
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,530
plays her recordings of their son, shoots the shit.

425
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,000
She never wakes up.

426
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,150
But they tested the comm box on her.

427
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:31,050
A kind of basic device that let coma folks sort of respond back.

428
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,830
I got you some room fresheners. You want pine forest?

429
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,730
Ok.

430
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,840
What about citrus fresh?

431
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,260
Gotcha.

432
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,020
And I recorded Parker singing with some other kids.

433
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,900
You wanna hear it?

434
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,530
*Twinkle, twinkle, little star*

435
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,500
*How I wonder what you are*

436
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,570
The woman in 302, Carrie Lamasse.

437
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,780
You're the partner, right?

438
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,270
Jack?

439
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,900
Rolo Haynes. I represent neuro R&D for TCKR.

440
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Ok.

441
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,030
We're working on a project that

442
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,120
might be of interest to someone in your position.

443
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,720
What's... What's my position?

444
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,180
We're exploring something that could give the likes of Carrie

445
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,120
a whole new lease of life.

446
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,510
I'm talking miraculous.

447
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,060
What do you mean?

448
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,400
So the guys at TCKR have been working

449
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,520
on digitally extracting a consciousness out of one brain

450
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,650
and kind of rehousing it in a host brain.

451
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,810
- What does that even mean?
- OK.

452
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,550
So, even on a good day, we only use 40% of our brain capacity.

453
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,720
There is this whole other 60% of our noggin

454
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,800
hanging around like an empty Airbnb.

455
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,800
And so...?

456
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,490
And so with our new compression technique,

457
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,790
we figure we can fit another whole consciousness

458
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,490
into that unused space.

459
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm talking about taking

460
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,620
Carrie's consciousness from that broken shell

461
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,920
and putting it in there.

462
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,640
What? Um... Like a voice inside my head?

463
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,310
Like the whole of her inside your head.

464
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,630
Like a hitchhiker. Like a passenger.

465
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,790
Vicarious sensations. She sees what you see.

466
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,380
She feels what you feel.

467
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,740
She can live again.

468
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,930
-"Feels" as in...?
-You got a little boy. Parker.

469
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,990
How do you know all this?

470
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,680
You hug Parker and Carrie feels it too.

471
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,570
She can hug your son via you.

472
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,200
How much does this all cost?

473
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,190
Won't cost a thing.

474
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
We will have to euthanize

475
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,350
her physical body during the transfer process,

476
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,520
but we would earmark her organs for transplants.

477
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,350
Giving back to the community.

478
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,260
So what do you say?

479
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,590
I'd have to think about it.

480
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,620
Carrie's done her thinking.

481
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,130
How about you?

482
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,920
Commencing upload procedure.

483
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,400
Now moving to download.

484
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,270
OK, she's installed.

485
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,230
She's home.

486
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,130
You can open your eyes now, Jack.

487
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,740
Carrie?

488
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,320
If you can hear me, tell Jack what you see.

489
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,660
An... An apple. I... I see an apple.

490
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,360
I can hear her.

491
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,160
Apple. Apple. She's saying apple.

492
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,990
Hey, baby.

493
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
Hey, Jack.

494
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,020
Take it.

495
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,850
Grip it.

496
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,560
Carrie, you feel that?

497
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,830
She says she feels it.

498
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,110
Sensations looking good. Take a bite.

499
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,870
Oh, God.

500
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,960
So long since I tasted anything.

501
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,360
You can taste that?

502
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,350
She tastes it. Holy shit.

503
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,000
Looks like you're all set.

504
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,710
- Shall we bring him in?
- Come on in, honey.

505
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,850
Is that Parker?

506
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,480
He got so big.

507
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,440
Oh, God, Jack, hold him. Hold our little boy.

508
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,270
Give me a really big hug, please.

509
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,430
I feel him. I really feel him.

510
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,620
Mommy says she loves you.

511
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,490
Truly heartwarming.

512
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,350
Yeah. But this is where you say "But."

513
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,080
Well, not to wax philosophical, but...

514
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,730
how long can happiness realistically last anyhow?

515
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,160
Turn the page already.

516
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,840
Man, you read slow.

517
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,210
I like to take in the pictures.

518
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,760
That's what the graphic part of a graphic novel is.

519
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,850
It's true.

520
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,740
I gotta take a piss.

521
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,260
I'll never get used to this.

522
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,740
Feels good, huh?

523
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,920
You're not washing our hands?

524
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,540
Our hands?

525
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,130
Seriously, though, it's kind of gross.

526
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,750
38-year-old Clayton Leigh was today found guilty

527
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,510
of the horrific murder of WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley,

528
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,920
whose mutilated remains were discovered one year ago today.

529
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,470
We should turn this off. It's disturbing to a four-year-old.

530
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,160
He's fine. He's not even listening.

531
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,530
Parker! Jesus.

532
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,940
- Don't snap at him.
- But snapping at me is fine?

533
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,550
Baby, you're-- - How does that work?

534
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,520
He's a child.

535
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,980
This is serious, man. Wha--

536
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,280
No, no, I'm not being... I'm not being unreasonable.

537
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,490
No, just wait. No. Just-- Just hear me out.

538
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,230
Having a back-seat driver glued into the back seat

539
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,150
ain't no fun for anyone in the car.

540
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,930
No privacy for him. No agency for her.

541
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,650
- It'd drive you mental.
- Exactly.

542
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,350
You know, fine, forget it.

543
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,970
All right, go ahead. Keep talking.

544
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,750
I'm going for the anchovies.

545
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,410
You gonna be quiet?

546
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,970
You wanna shut up now? You're good?

547
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,180
You--

548
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,140
Fuck you.

549
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,470
Fuck.

550
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,470
Yeah. I don't... I don't care.

551
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,980
You... you're still talking.

552
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,170
You...

553
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,510
Anyhow,

554
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,540
soon he or they come to me.

555
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,220
Like I'm their relationship therapist.

556
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,260
Would you pipe down and let me speak?

557
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
Let me finish a goddamn sentence.

558
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,350
Guys, I see the problem.

559
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,550
She's the problem.

560
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,360
Familiarity breeding contempt is the problem.

561
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,580
You need to ration your contact.

562
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,430
Ration how?

563
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,940
She's running through my head like a goddamn tune I can't shake.

564
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,410
Well, we could upgrade your privileges, Jack.

565
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,290
Give you a little more control.

566
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,780
Shut up! Sorry. Go on.

567
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,920
Well, maybe if you had the ability

568
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,540
to place Carrie on pause now and then...

569
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,390
it'd make things easier for the both of you.

570
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,800
Do it.

571
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,240
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Do it.

572
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,010
So he upped his privileges.

573
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,790
- Should be able to put her on pause.
- This one?

574
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,110
- That's it.
- OK.

575
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,270
Didn't take him long to use 'em.

576
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,600
So now we're just openly checking out women's racks?

577
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,340
And don't say you weren't

578
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,790
because I can feel the fucking boner forming, OK?

579
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,620
And he checks her ass too as she leaves. Holy fuck.

580
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,330
So I checked her out. What?

581
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,510
I'm horny as fuck, haven't jerked off in, like, a month.

582
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,440
Well, I'm not stopping you.

583
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,950
You're looking over my shoulder but from the inside.

584
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,600
It's like trying to jerk off in front of a cop

585
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,970
who's also your mom.

586
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,910
- Fuck you!
- OK, you know what?

587
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,090
That's it. That's it. That's it.

588
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,590
Time out. I'm putting you on pause.

589
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,910
No. Jack, don't you dare.

590
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,830
Jack. Jack, I'm warning you.

591
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,470
Not cool.

592
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
Don't do that again.

593
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,120
Are... Are we at home?

594
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,190
Why the Halloween pumpkin?

595
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,120
Halloween's months from now.

596
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,400
Actually, it's today.

597
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,130
How long was I on pause?

598
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,160
Just a few weeks.

599
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,550
I don't know. Eight?

600
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,770
OK, I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

601
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,640
I know. I'm sorry. I felt really bad.

602
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,800
So, um, I got you this.

603
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,940
Figured it's kind of our anniversary, so--

604
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,510
Fuck you. You're a fucking asshole.

605
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,590
You want me to eat this cupcake or not?

606
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,770
Orange cream icing.

607
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,940
- Where's Parker?
- Your favorite.

608
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,230
I wanna see Parker.

609
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,270
You had him away from me for months.

610
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,180
I wanna see my boy.

611
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,120
Ok.

612
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,040
Ok.

613
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,620
Where is he?

614
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,830
What you got going on there?

615
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,970
- Is that a fire truck?
- Yeah.

616
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,020
Tell him I love him.

617
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,730
Buddy, Mommy loves you.

618
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,820
What?

619
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,730
Tell him I need a hug.

620
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,380
You wanna know something else?

621
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,740
Mommy needs a hug.

622
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,310
God!

623
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,080
Parker complicated things.

624
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,580
They both felt responsibility for him,

625
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,240
so they tried to compromise,

626
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,950
you know, reach an agreement, like adults.

627
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:38,370
Jack put Carrie on pause except for the weekends,

628
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,480
when they'd take Parker out with Carrie in attendance,

629
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,650
kind of like a divorcee with visiting rights.

630
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,820
You go hide.

631
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,720
That's it!

632
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,390
You tricked me.

633
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Come down here.

634
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,890
I'm coming.

635
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,010
It worked OK.

636
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,500
For a while.

637
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,970
Looks like we're neighbors.

638
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,480
I've just moved in.

639
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,640
- Emily.
- Jack. Nice to meet you.

640
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,260
Oh, please.

641
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,580
- Who's this?
- It's Parker.

642
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,570
Cool name.

643
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,820
Guess I'll see you around.

644
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,470
Yeah.

645
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,440
Guess I'll see you around.

646
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,720
She was nice, OK?

647
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,170
Cut the shit.

648
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,510
I know when your hormones are flowing, OK?

649
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,600
Our balls are brewing up a blow load as we speak.

650
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,890
I can't. I'm with our son.

651
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,670
I didn't hit on anyone.

652
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,960
You know what? Fuck it. Visiting time is over.

653
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,720
No. Jack, don't you dare. Jack.

654
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,540
Jack, you son of a bi--

655
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,820
Parker, wait up.

656
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,010
Anyhow, as time passed by,

657
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,950
Jack got it on with the neighbor.

658
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,450
And Carrie didn't take it so good.

659
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,380
She works all week. We just wanted to spend a weekend together.

660
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,430
Jesus, can't you just be happy for us?

661
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,290
No, Jack, weirdly enough, I can't.

662
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,350
Christ, you are so bitter.

663
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,270
No. Why?

664
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,850
Is she giving you shit?

665
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,930
Carrie, stop giving him shit.

666
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,740
Tell her to back off.

667
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,330
I-- - Tell her.

668
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,910
Jesus Christ.

669
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,910
So the weekend thing isn't working.

670
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,840
And we tried limiting her to an hour--

671
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,320
But you can tell that she's in there,

672
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,800
like that judging and bitching.

673
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,070
The time frame is frustrating for Carrie.

674
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,780
Carrie is frustrating for us.

675
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,580
You got Carrie on pause now?

676
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,090
OK, well...

677
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,960
there's always deletion.

678
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,980
- As in...?
- As in permanent erasure.

679
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,100
No.

680
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,460
That'd... That'd be killing her.

681
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,920
Not legally.

682
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,220
But ethically.

683
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,390
Please. She is just some leftover code in your head.

684
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,500
It'll be like... like deleting an email.

685
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,410
No.

686
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,660
No. No deletion. I'm not doing it.

687
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,770
She wants to be near Parker.

688
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,610
I can't take that away from her.

689
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,660
There's gotta be something you can do.

690
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,100
My friends...

691
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,350
you're in luck.

692
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,310
It's something we're beta testing.

693
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,690
It's actually aimed at terminally ill parents.

694
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,930
Kind of like a souvenir for their kids.

695
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,290
Here.

696
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,880
A monkey?

697
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,570
More like a keepsake.

698
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,490
We can put her in here.

699
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,020
In there?

700
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,800
It's... It has a consciousness receptor,

701
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,660
kind of like the one we put in your head, but a prototype.

702
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,640
And there's a camera here so she can see Parker.

703
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,730
Plus the whole body's got haptic feedback,

704
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,330
so if little Parkie gives it a cuddle, she'll feel it.

705
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,390
And she can communicate back,

706
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,890
but in a kid-friendly, controlled way.

707
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,500
Yeah, I don't know. I'm gonna have to think about it.

708
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,150
I say yes.

709
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,640
Well, she's done her thinking. How about you?

710
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,700
The transfer went pretty fast.

711
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,480
Carrie wouldn't have even been aware it was happening.

712
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,160
Till she woke up.

713
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,820
Come on, buddy, you gotta tear it. Tear into that thing.

714
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,330
- Jack?
- You almost got it.

715
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,530
There you go.

716
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,610
All right, pull it out.

717
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,210
There you go.

718
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,930
What is it, Parker?

719
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,810
Monkey.

720
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,900
What?

721
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,260
That's pretty cool, huh?

722
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,700
Jack. Jack, what the fuck?

723
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,880
But you know something?

724
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,110
This... This, uh...

725
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,360
This is a very special monkey.

726
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,470
- Mom wanted you to have it.
- What?

727
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,880
Every time you hug it, Mom will know,

728
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,250
and she'll feel that hug too.

729
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,740
No. No, no, Jack, Jack, put me back in your fucking head.

730
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,980
Jack!

731
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,120
And this monkey can speak to you.

732
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,570
It can let you know how it feels.

733
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,670
How did she speak?

734
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,400
Well, the comm setup was a little rudimentary.

735
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
I mean, this is a prototype.

736
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,540
Jack!

737
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,400
No.

738
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,390
Monkey loves you.

739
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,830
What was that?

740
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,820
Monkey needs a hug.

741
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,640
Give monkey a hug.

742
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,740
Monkey loves you.

743
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,400
Monkey needs a hug. Monkey loves you. Monkey loves you.

744
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,970
Monkey loves you. Monkey... Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.

745
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,850
- Yeah, I think...
- Monkey loves you.

746
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,840
Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.

747
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,570
Monkey just needs a minute

748
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,480
to get used to how things are gonna be.

749
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,010
Now, listen, you fucking bitch.

750
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,540
We can still have you wiped.

751
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,110
That what you want?

752
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,600
Do "Monkey needs a hug" for no.

753
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,370
Monkey needs a hug.

754
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,670
Are you gonna be a good toy?

755
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,640
Are you gonna be a good toy?

756
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,920
Monkey loves you.

757
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,590
You better.

758
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,600
Anyhow, in the end,

759
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,600
Parker got tired of his new toy.

760
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,630
But that's kids.

761
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,190
They're ingrates.

762
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,900
Monkey needs a hug.

763
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,740
Wait, so this is a crime museum.

764
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,890
Where's the crime in this?

765
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,490
Well, the monkey is the crime.

766
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,830
See, a couple of years back,

767
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,110
the UN made it illegal

768
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,310
to transfer human consciousnesses into limited formats like this.

769
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,260
Gotta be able to express at least

770
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,960
five emotions for it to be humane, apparently.

771
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,640
Human rights for cookies. Right, Carrie?

772
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,500
Monkey needs a hug.

773
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,540
She's still in there?

774
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,320
It'd be illegal to delete her too, so, yeah.

775
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,350
Go figure.

776
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,130
Anyhow, ACLU raised one heck of a stink,

777
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,720
and so thanks to this son of a monkey,

778
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,580
I was out on my ass from TCKR.

779
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,750
Not even a severance package.

780
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,270
It's why I started this place.

781
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,880
Had to branch out somehow,

782
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,900
and it appealed to the carny in me, I guess.

783
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,690
Monkey needs a hug.

784
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,050
Goddamn AC's still not working. it's hot.

785
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,350
But I've kept you waiting too long.

786
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,020
You ready for the prime exhibit?

787
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,470
Step right this way.

788
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,030
Listen, I gotta warn you,

789
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,790
he's not the man he once... was.

790
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,940
- Sorry.
- Do you want some more water?

791
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,770
I'm fine.

792
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,760
He's this way.

793
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,520
Come on, mister! You got a visitor.

794
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,140
May I present Clayton Leigh,

795
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,470
weather girl killer.

796
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,100
I know, he's kind of mopey these days.

797
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,530
Cuts kind of a pathetic figure.

798
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,070
But don't feel too sorry for him.

799
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,510
He is a convicted murderer.

800
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,570
Lest we forget Denise Stockley.

801
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,550
Tragic and cute.

802
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,790
Ain't that right, Clayton?

803
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,450
He's actually looking at you.

804
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,380
Look out. Maybe you're his type.

805
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,420
He looks so real.

806
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,020
Well, it is him, or a fully conscious upload of him.

807
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,670
You're probably wondering how he got in here.

808
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,910
After TCKR kicked me out,

809
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:43,500
my plan was to branch out into celebrity consciousnesses,

810
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,810
sign up famous people and

811
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,130
reincarnate them as holograms after they die.

812
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,990
Kind of like a living Madame Tussauds.

813
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,160
But celebrities, that's just a quagmire.

814
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,940
Too many rights issues, asshole representatives.

815
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,620
But convicted killers?

816
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,130
It's a different story.

817
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,950
Mr. Leigh, allow me to introduce myself.

818
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,690
- My name is Rolo Haynes.
- They say you're in technology.

819
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:42,160
- Uh, yes, that is true.
- So you can look into this DNA thing?

820
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,580
Prove it wasn't me?

821
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,110
Um, yes, that's certainly a possibility,

822
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,210
but that's not why I'm here.

823
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,990
- I have a proposal.
- Goodbye.

824
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,570
No, wait. I have a proposal. I can help.

825
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,480
I can help your family.

826
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,770
How'd you talk him into it?

827
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,840
He didn't need much convincing.

828
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,600
So really it's just signing over the rights to your digital self

829
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,780
in case the worst happens,

830
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,750
and I promise your relatives

831
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,850
will receive the lion's share of any profits.

832
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:17,070
So if, you know, God forbid,

833
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,880
you do get sent to the chair,

834
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,870
you know your family will be provided for, for life.

835
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,060
- How'd his family feel about it?
- They didn't give a shit.

836
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,980
Abandoned him the moment he got locked up.

837
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,290
I know, right?

838
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,020
Jesus Christ, Clay, it's your soul.

839
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,670
Ain't no such thing.

840
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,010
It's just a computer simulation or somethin'.

841
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,190
Then why does he need your permission?

842
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,820
If my pardon comes through, it won't matter.

843
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,910
And if it doesn't?

844
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,920
Then if they send me to the chair, this is gonna pay.

845
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,640
It's gonna keep you and the kids above water,

846
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,660
maintain a roof over y'all.

847
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,180
Baby, don't.

848
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,240
This could be a good thing.

849
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,340
But he never did get that pardon.

850
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,840
Shit, no, 'cause he was guilty.

851
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,790
But wasn't there some doubt? You know, that documentary?

852
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,010
Fake news. Hatchet job.

853
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,160
- What about the DNA tampering?
- Seriously?

854
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,220
There's no doubt about it.

855
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,020
The day he got the chair

856
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,570
was a great day for justice.

857
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,920
Clayton couldn't complain.

858
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,190
I mean, he was gonna be a pioneer.

859
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,650
I was gonna slurp up his entire consciousness.

860
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:52,730
He'd be the first guy on death row to survive his own execution.

861
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,950
The transfer went beautifully.

862
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,430
Before I knew it, Clayton was born again.

863
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,490
Hi, buddy.

864
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,990
Congratulations to you.

865
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,050
You're in the afterlife, so to speak.

866
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,280
Looking good.

867
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,830
Am I a ghost?

868
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,730
If that helps, yeah.

869
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,340
I just gotta test a few things here, OK?

870
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,820
So this may seem a little weird. Just hang on in there.

871
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,060
What the fuck?

872
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,880
See, I knew just seeing the guy walking around captive,

873
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,060
that was good, but that wasn't much of a draw.

874
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,750
But pulling the lever yourself?

875
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,690
Now, that's an attraction.

876
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,600
OK.

877
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,720
Three, two, one.

878
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,610
Dawson's pain tech had paved the way for it.

879
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,060
A perfect re-creation

880
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,950
of exactly how the agony of electrocution feels.

881
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,140
Every volt simulated for real.

882
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,130
Key was, never let him exceed 15 seconds at max voltage.

883
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,750
That would wipe his digital synapses out for good, kill him.

884
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,010
Ten seconds seemed to be the optimum shock length,

885
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,710
so that became the intractable limit.

886
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,680
OK. Have a little rest.

887
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,550
Get used to your room.

888
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,150
Official opening's tomorrow.

889
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:53,310
In fact, in the early days, the problem was fitting everyone in.

890
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,930
Please don't do it.

891
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,800
Please, please, please, please, please. Please.

892
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,420
Please don't do it. Please.

893
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:11,510
But, of course,

894
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,520
it was really the souvenirs that were driving trade.

895
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,090
It was beautiful.

896
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,000
Every time you finished juicing him,

897
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,380
out pops a conscious sentient snapshot of Clayton,

898
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,100
not a recording, a true copy of his mind

899
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,740
perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain.

900
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,500
Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony.

901
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,240
Always on.

902
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,560
Always suffering.

903
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,850
And what you'd call...

904
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,170
fun size.

905
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,840
Take a seat if it makes it easier.

906
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,130
Sit down.

907
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,320
What? My accent?

908
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,340
Not fucking British.

909
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,740
Sorry to disappoint.

910
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,390
Who are you?

911
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,570
You left some parts of the story out, Mr. Haynes. Why is that?

912
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,090
You forgot to mention the protests.

913
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,750
His wife started a campaign, got some momentum behind it.

914
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,500
Guess you'd call it virtue-signaling bullshit,

915
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,630
but I know it hurt your attendance.

916
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,540
And even the protesters got bored after a while.

917
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,900
As soon as it was clear the state

918
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,150
wouldn't do a damn thing about clearing him,

919
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,820
they just moved onto the next viral miscarriage of justice

920
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,990
they can hang a hashtag off of.

921
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,190
But they did their job, right?

922
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,100
This place was on the shit list.

923
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,450
Who was your core clientele after that?

924
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,770
You lost the day trippers, the tourists,

925
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,880
fun family crowd. Who was left?

926
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,710
You again, you pasty-faced motherfucker?

927
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,080
Loners. Sadists.

928
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,980
The supremacist sicko demographic.

929
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Out, out, out.

930
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,170
And that crowd's not big enough.

931
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,100
They don't keep the lights on.

932
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,000
So if someone shows up,

933
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,690
some classic race-hate rich guy with a hard-on for power...

934
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:51,220
and he slips you some extra for a longer time at the crank...

935
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,520
you take it.

936
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,290
Thank you.

937
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,630
Wasn't the same after that, was he?

938
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,390
Not dead but hardly alive either.

939
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,860
Even the perverts didn't wanna pull a... a lever on a vegetable.

940
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,550
Where's the joy in that?

941
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,780
But someone came to see him, right?

942
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,370
She saw him.

943
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,610
She stood on this spot.

944
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,660
Saw what you had done to him.

945
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,570
Clay?

946
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,630
He was like a docile animal.

947
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,830
God knows if he even recognized her.

948
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,300
God knows if he even recognizes me.

949
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,280
Dad.

950
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,930
Happy birthday.

951
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,070
What my mom saw that day was more than she could take.

952
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,360
She had hoped during the whole fight to clear his name,

953
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,940
but that broke her.

954
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,280
You know what she did when she came home?

955
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,120
Bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka.

956
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,320
I found her. You fucking piece of shit.

957
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:15,980
Is it hot?

958
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,950
It's humid, right? I'm sorry.

959
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:22,280
Stupid digital AC.

960
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,460
Easy to hack.

961
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,750
Never accept drinks from strangers.

962
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,690
My daddy taught me that.

963
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:41,310
Going by the color of your lips,

964
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,820
you're gonna be gone in 30 seconds.

965
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,780
Hey, don't worry.

966
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,470
We're gonna see you on the other side.

967
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,880
Computer says you're awake.

968
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,150
Congratulations. You're a pioneer.

969
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,890
What the fuck did you do?

970
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:28,010
It turns out that it is possible

971
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,280
to transfer a fresh consciousness inside a virtual one.

972
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,390
My daddy's giving you a ride.

973
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:36,820
Get me out of here, you fucking cun--

974
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,710
I'm guessing you're screaming and calling me names right now,

975
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:40,940
but I wouldn't know.

976
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,040
You-- - I mean, my dad can't talk, thanks to you.

977
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:47,130
Otherwise I'm guessing he'd pass on your goodwill messages.

978
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,660
You fu-- You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!

979
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,430
In other news, you'll shortly be undertaking another first.

980
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,520
The first double-decker mercy killing.

981
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,300
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

982
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,590
I took off the ten-second limit

983
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,850
so Daddy'll get a full hit of juice.

984
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,130
Should be enough to set him free.

985
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,930
You... however...

986
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,790
burrowed away inside there, Mr. Haynes, you'll feel it all.

987
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:17,160
All the pain.

988
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,340
Fuck y-- - Every perfect little shot of it.

989
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,360
- Fuck you!
- I'm getting myself a souvenir, too.

990
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

991
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,830
Hey, please, please. I...

992
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,610
Always on.

993
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:32,240
- Always suffering.
- Fuck! No, no, no.

994
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,630
Bye, Daddy.

995
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,940
Monkey loves you.

996
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,260
How'd I do, Mom?

997
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,990
All good?

998
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,380
Just great, honey.

999
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,950
I'm proud of you.

1000
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,050
Aw, thanks.

1001
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,680
*Always something there to remind me*

1002
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:52,230
*I was born to love you*

1003
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,900
*And I will never be free*

1004
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,650
*You'll always be a part of me*

1005
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,430
*If you should find you miss*

1006
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,990
*The sweet and tender love We used to share*

1007
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,880
*Just come back to the places *

1008
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,370
*Where we used to go and I'll be there*

1009
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,570
*Oh, how can I forget you*

1010
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:38,850
*When there is always something there To remind me*

1011
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,480
*When there is always something there To remind me*

1012
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,070
*I was born to love you*

1013
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,640
*And I will never be free*

1014
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,320
-*When there is...*
- *When there is...*

1015
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:02,100
*When there is always something there To remind me*

1016
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:07,710
*Oh, always something there To remind me*

1017
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:13,370
*Oh, always something there To remind me*

1018
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,780
*I was born to love you*

1019
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,470
*And I will never be free*

1020
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,100
-*When there is... *
-*When there is...*

1021
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:30,840
*When there is always something there To remind me*

1022
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,770
*Oh, always something there To remind me*
