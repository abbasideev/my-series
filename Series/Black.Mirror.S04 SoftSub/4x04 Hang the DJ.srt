1
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,700
- Coach.
- Yes, Frank?

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,910
- Where do I go?
- Proceed to the hub.

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,120
Got ya.

4
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,820
- How will I know who he is?
- This is him.

5
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,370
Sorry. Fork.

6
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,480
- Amy.
- No, no, my name's not fork.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,630
I guessed. It was just... It's Frank.

8
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,460
Do you wanna sit?

9
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,300
- Shall we sit?
- I think it's that or stand.

10
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,760
Come sit, yeah?

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,450
That's, um... I was on that side.

12
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,120
- Shall I...?
- No, no, it doesn't matter.

13
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,990
Why bring it up?

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,510
Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.

15
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,420
It's my first time on the, you know, the system.

16
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,780
- Me too.
- Oh, really?

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,250
Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate.

18
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,130
- Come to mention it, you look terrified.
- Do I?

19
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,210
Yeah, quaking with fear.

20
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,050
Or maybe shaking with revulsion?

21
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,350
At least you stopped... shitting.

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,850
Are you sure about that?

23
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,450
Shall we stop talking about shitting?

24
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,320
Maybe order some food? Good plan.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah. OK.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,380
- Do you know how we order?
- I think we use these.

27
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,990
Menu choice already established.

28
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,080
- Here you are, sir.
- Ta.

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,220
And for you, madam.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,660
Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl.

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,930
Yeah, I'm a, uh...

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,910
...fishcake...

33
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,370
- It's good.
- Can I try some?

34
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,680
Are we... allowed to do that?

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,380
Fuck it.

36
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,980
Yeah, fuck it.

37
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,150
That is good.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,050
So... we're both first-timers.

39
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,630
Shall we check our expiry date?

40
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,190
- Yeah, good plan.
- Yeah?

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,830
All right, um, so I think it's under "info."

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,330
Yeah, uh, "tap to reveal."

43
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,030
We have to tap to reveal at the same time.

44
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,130
OK. So, on three,

45
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,460
two, one. Go.

46
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,980
- Twelve hours.
- Yeah, 12 hours.

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,080
- OK.
- Bit, um...

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,260
- Yeah.
- Bit short.

49
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,620
It is a bit short, isn't it?

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,400
And getting shorter. I didn't realize it would...

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,620
sort of count down like that.

52
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,960
It's sort of sad.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,460
Maybe we should eat quickly.

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,480
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.
- The race is on.

55
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,300
Come on, hurry up.

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,680
I guess this is us.

57
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,800
And this takes us to the place?

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,960
Yeah, suppose so.

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,400
- After you.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,600
It's massive.

61
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,730
- Here we are.
- Yep.

62
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,480
- Do you wanna open it or shall I?
- You go ahead.

63
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,340
All right.

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,230
Too slow.

65
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,660
You're a knob.

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,980
Oh, God. It's a shithole.

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,820
- You're kidding.
- I am, yeah.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,010
It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp.

69
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,680
- Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp.
- Fuck off.

70
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,590
Right.

71
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,670
That's, uh...

72
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,000
There's an en suite.

73
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,000
- Shower or bath?
- Both.

74
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,520
That's good.

75
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,670
Well, I'm... I'm just gonna use the loo.

76
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah, I've got to, uh... over here, so...

77
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,730
Yeah.

78
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,180
OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,680
Query too broad. Please narrow.

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,550
Well, I mean, are we just meant to...

81
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,600
I don't know, like, just go at it?

82
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,510
Define "go at it."

83
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,860
Fucking hell.

84
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,650
So, are we meant to just have sex with each other?

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,070
Participants are not required to take any specific action.

86
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,470
Yeah, but I mean we can, right?

87
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,460
I mean, people do if it's just a short time?

88
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,070
If that's your decision.

89
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,460
- It's up to us?
- It's up to you.

90
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,460
I could just sleep here.

91
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't be daft. You'll be scrunched up in a ball.

92
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,720
It's not awful.

93
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,710
The bed's pretty big. I'm sure we could both fit in it.

94
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,840
Yeah, OK.

95
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,660
Must have been mental before the system.

96
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,330
How do you mean?

97
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,770
Well, people had to do the whole relationship thing themselves,

98
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,010
work out who they wanna be with.

99
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,850
Option paralysis.

100
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,700
So many choices, you end up not knowing which one you want.

101
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah, exactly, and if things seem shitty,

102
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,940
they'd have to figure out

103
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,860
whether they wanted to break up with someone.

104
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,350
How to break up with someone. Fuckin' hell.

105
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,360
- Just a nightmare.
- It's not like when it's all mapped out.

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,220
God, no. It's so much simpler when it's all mapped out.

107
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,570
- This is weird, though.
- It really is.

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, then.

109
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,310
So...

110
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,910
Thanks for being my first.

111
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,330
Bloody time.

112
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,230
It was great, you know. You were nice.

113
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,950
So were you.

114
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,040
If we had this time again, you would totally get it, by the way.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
- You... You bastard.
- Sorry.

116
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,810
- You'd get it, too.
- Fucked that one up, didn't we?

117
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,410
Yeah, totally.

118
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,690
I guess I just don't see the point in something that short.

119
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,170
Twelve hours.

120
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,500
Even your reaction to a brief encounter

121
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,850
provides the system with valuable information.

122
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,110
Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.

123
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,450
The system thinks I'm a prude.

124
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,520
The system makes no moral judgments.

125
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,060
Yeah, but how do I know she wasn't the perfect match for me?

126
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,980
I mean, she was...

127
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,030
Your ultimate compatible other has not yet been selected.

128
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,250
Yeah, I know, but it's--

129
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,690
The system gains insight as each participant

130
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,710
progresses through numerous relationships

131
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,130
and uses the gathered data

132
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,600
to eventually select an ultimate compatible other.

133
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,390
On your pairing day, I know,

134
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,220
and it always finds your perfect match.

135
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,930
In 99.8% of cases.

136
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,640
But I have to go through loads of relationships to find it.

137
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,150
- That is correct.
- Great.

138
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,490
What was that?

139
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,630
- Another relationship.
- What, already?

140
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,450
What's this, another one?

141
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,150
That is correct.

142
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,920
I'd best go get changed, then.

143
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.

144
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,100
I cannot confirm identity until a personal introduction is made.

145
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,770
Identity confirmed.

146
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,140
- I like your hair.
- Yours is good too.

147
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,150
It's all my own.

148
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,130
It's just funny.

149
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,820
I'm Frank.

150
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
Nicola.

151
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,240
I've been here a while.

152
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,720
Aye, sorry. I was getting changed.

153
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,990
- Really?
- You started already?

154
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,400
- I was hungry.
- Yeah, course, yeah. Sorry.

155
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,890
Come on, let's get it over with. Checking the expiry.

156
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,750
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,800
One year.

158
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,680
We've got each other for one year? Could be a mistake.

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,530
- Coach, is this a mistake?
- This is not a mistake.

160
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,100
Jesus fucking Christ.

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
There'll be a reason.

162
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,010
Thanks.

163
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,580
Look on the bright side. Chicken tikka masala.

164
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,010
What?

165
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,490
Chicken tikka mas-- It's a joke.

166
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,390
Right.

167
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
So you're the sort of person that makes jokes.

168
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,050
- OK, so on three.
- Two, one.

169
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,250
Interesting.

170
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,740
Nine months.

171
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,330
Well...

172
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,320
cheers.

173
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,400
Cheers.

174
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,780
Pretty much the same as my last one.

175
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,540
How many of these have you had?

176
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,510
Relationships? So far? Five.

177
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,660
I'm an old hand, I suppose.

178
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,950
Listen, I'm just gonna jump in the shower.

179
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,450
- OK.
- Won't be long.

180
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,060
So, listen, if you're OK with it,

181
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,620
this is relationship five for me,

182
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,370
and I've found it's best to have sex straight away upfront.

183
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,220
Right, yeah.

184
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,530
Kind of breaks the ice,

185
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,050
gives an early overview of compatibility and so on.

186
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,170
Yep.

187
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,160
So I'm consenting to everything now.

188
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,510
Whenever you feel comfortable doing the same--

189
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,680
Tikka masala. Just...

190
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,840
- What?
- It's a bit tikka masala.

191
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,560
- I'm sorry.
- Talking makes it worse.

192
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,330
Sorry.

193
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,020
No, no, you're gonna have to do it from behind.

194
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,140
- You what?
- From behind.

195
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,880
Bit faster?

196
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,250
More motion.

197
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,730
Not like that. More motion. You're all in out, in out,

198
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,130
like you're trying to shut a drawer into a filing cabinet.

199
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,970
- Sorry.
- It's just boring.

200
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,080
Want a bit more side to side.

201
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,860
Like this?

202
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,340
No, not really.

203
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,010
What was that?

204
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,880
Nothing.

205
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,060
Fucking hell.

206
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,780
So I can't just walk away?

207
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,320
That is correct.

208
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,030
One day it will provide you with the ultimate match.

209
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,660
One day. One day.

210
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,010
So I'd just like to say,

211
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,210
do have faith in the system, because it does deliver.

212
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,480
It did for us.

213
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,190
You have so many experiences,

214
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,790
and then one day it pairs you up with your ultimate match,

215
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,860
the best in show, as it were.

216
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,230
So if you're having doubts, just hang on in there.

217
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,970
Because it really does work.

218
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,600
Garlic dip. Thanks for that.

219
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,280
You all right.

220
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,900
Was that, uh, your...?

221
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,560
- Yeah. Nicola.
- Oh. Nicola.

222
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,470
You OK?

223
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
No, you're not being...? Are you being serious?

224
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh, my God. OK, this is happening. OK, um, just...

225
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,150
Thanks.

226
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,680
- You look well.
- Thanks.

227
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,580
I'd return the compliment,

228
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,580
but you've just spat food on my shoe, so...

229
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,750
To be fair, it is a revolting shoe, so...

230
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,190
All the better to kick you with.

231
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,090
Was that really hard?

232
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,220
- Ouch.
- I'm so sorry. Fuck.

233
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,700
Shit.

234
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,780
Lenny, this is, um, Frank. Frank, this is Lenny.

235
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,980
Hi, Lenny. You all right?

236
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,030
We were together for a bit.

237
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,870
- A small... small bit.
- Yeah, just before we...

238
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,820
So you two...? Oh. That's... that's great.

239
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,990
So, I mean... it looks like you two make a great team.

240
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,610
Yeah.

241
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,480
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll see you.

242
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,210
Yeah.

243
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,420
- You know that noise you make?
- What noise?

244
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,190
Do I do that?

245
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,950
Yeah, you do, quite often.

246
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,560
Does it bother you?

247
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,240
A bit, yeah.

248
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,800
- I'll try not to.
- OK.

249
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,250
So it's been great, really.

250
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,340
- Shame it has to end.
- But end it must.

251
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,330
Anyway...

252
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,970
OK, bye.

253
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,870
Another partner already?

254
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,420
That is correct.

255
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,520
So, three, two, one, go.

256
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,000
Thirty-six hours?

257
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,210
Well, uh... bye.

258
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,110
- Bye.
- Bye.

259
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,780
Three, two, one.

260
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,200
- I just wanna say...
- Don't.

261
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,970
Well, I learned what it's like to cohabit with someone I despise.

262
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,710
Is that useful for the system?

263
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,950
Everything happens for a reason.

264
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,340
That's sooner than I expected.

265
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,120
Hello, you.

266
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,630
Is this right?

267
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,300
- Yeah.
- I mean...

268
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,450
Yeah, I didn't think the system would hook us up again.

269
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,810
No, me neither.

270
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,920
I mean, I hope it's right, obviously, but...

271
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,700
Coach, are we sat at the right table?

272
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,640
Yes, that is correct.

273
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,200
OK, well...

274
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,110
Wait, um... Can we not check the expiry date?

275
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,310
- Why?
- Just sick of it.

276
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,040
The system's just bounced me from bloke to bloke,

277
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,070
short fling after short fling.

278
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,240
I know they're short flings, they're just meaningless,

279
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,480
and I get really detached. It's like I'm not really there.

280
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,970
So the other week, I was with this guy,

281
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,680
God knows who, basically just a haircut.

282
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,610
And I literally had this out-of-body experience.

283
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,230
I wandered out of my body,

284
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,770
and I sat in this chair across the room

285
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,960
and I watched myself fucking this guy.

286
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,400
And I was, like, what is that all about?

287
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,340
That is literally just a dick going in and out of a hole.

288
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,150
Yeah, that's pretty detached.

289
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,800
When it's a long-term thing, it's just as bad,

290
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,250
watching the clock like you're a prisoner,

291
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,610
counting the hours, the minutes.

292
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,480
- Oh, God, I've been there.
- Yeah.

293
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,380
- Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.
- Yeah.

294
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,530
- It's a deal.
- Deal.

295
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,450
OK.

296
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,210
Bring on les fishcake.

297
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,790
I don't know.

298
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,080
- So?
- So...

299
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,890
- Might as well.
- I suppose we have to.

300
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,720
Don't know how much time we've got.

301
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,870
Yeah, it could be ten minutes.

302
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,860
- Think you could last ten minutes?
- Fuck off.

303
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,880
All right. OK, then.

304
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,920
Wait. One of us should get undressed first.

305
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,510
- Why only one of us?
- It'll be funny.

306
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,300
Go on then. Get your kit off.

307
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,870
No. No, it was my idea.

308
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,350
All right.

309
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,470
This is kind of emasculating.

310
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,850
Well, then, you'd better make up for it in a minute.

311
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm gonna see your dick

312
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,730
Sorry.

313
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,610
- I'm gonna fucking see it
- Yeah, OK. Yeah- -

314
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,780
What if there is no scrutiny,

315
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,910
it's just putting us together in any old order,

316
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,120
and we all go along with it

317
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,550
'cause they're always telling us how clever it is?

318
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,430
Yeah, but it does put people with the one.

319
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,160
It's got a 99.8% success rate.

320
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,100
But how do you know they're perfect matches?

321
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,480
I mean, what if all it's actually doing

322
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,380
is gradually wearing us down,

323
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,220
putting us in one relationship after another

324
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,950
for random durations in a random sequence?

325
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,240
Each time you get a little bit more pliable,

326
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,770
a little bit more broken,

327
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,180
until eventually it coughs up the final offering

328
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,470
and says that's the one.

329
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,650
And by that point you are so defeated and so exhausted

330
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,660
that you just accept it, you settle.

331
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,430
And then you have to live the rest of your life

332
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,650
convincing yourself you didn't.

333
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,790
Well done. That's one of the bleakest things I've ever heard.

334
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,920
Thank you.

335
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,500
Right. Do you wanna know my theory?

336
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,070
Let's assume the system isn't random.

337
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,940
- It's as sophisticated as they say it is.
- OK.

338
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,310
Right, so using these, it slurps up all your reactions, yeah?

339
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,910
It builds up a complex profile.

340
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,040
Every crazy thought you've ever had,

341
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,600
all your dreams and your weaknesses and--

342
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,210
- And your mad theories.
- Yeah, like, everything in your head.

343
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,830
Right. So if it's everything in your head...

344
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,950
"What if that's us and we're stuck in a simulation?"

345
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,350
Well, how would we know?

346
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,060
I think that settles it.

347
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,750
I might have been programmed to go "Ow."

348
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,760
Ok.

349
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,010
- Come here.
- No.

350
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,090
- Coach?
- Hello, Frank.

351
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,840
- I've gotta know.
- What would you like to know?

352
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,870
The expiry date for me and Amy. I need to know how long.

353
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,880
You're not gonna talk me out of it?

354
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,900
Would you like me to talk you out of it?

355
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,100
Yeah. Uh... No. I...

356
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,600
Don't know.

357
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,530
No, I'm not gonna do it. I said I wouldn't.

358
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,200
We shook on it.

359
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,490
Fuck it.

360
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,980
Recalibrating.

361
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,380
Coach?

362
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,170
- Coach.
- Recalibrating.

363
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,350
Coach. What's happening? Coach, it's getting shorter.

364
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,140
One-sided observation has destabilized the expiry date.

365
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,560
- What?
- One-sided observation

366
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,380
has destabilized the expiry date.

367
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,670
Recalibrating.

368
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,510
'Cause I looked at it on my own, it made it shorter?

369
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,580
- That is correct.
- Why?

370
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,430
Everything happens for a reason.

371
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,920
All right, well, undo it, then. Make it go back.

372
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
I cannot do that. Recalibrating.

373
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,350
What if she looks at it?

374
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,250
Once shortened, the expiry date cannot be extended.

375
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,150
Why?

376
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,010
Everything happens for a reason.

377
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,660
- Come on. Come on.
- Recalibrating.

378
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,270
- When will it stop?
- It will stabilize

379
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,520
once recalibration has completed. Recalibrating.

380
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,080
Stop it. Stop it. Just...

381
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,710
You OK?

382
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,460
Yeah, I'm fine.

383
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,140
- All right.
- I'm good.

384
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,620
Have you ever had more than four or less than four?

385
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,320
What you thinking about?

386
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,470
Nothing.

387
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,060
All right, seriously, what's up?

388
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,150
I looked.

389
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,870
Looked at what?

390
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,640
We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.

391
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,930
Don't you wanna know what it said?

392
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,340
No. That was the point.

393
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,570
- It's almost done anyway.
- How almost done?

394
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,000
We've got, like, an hour.

395
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,970
Why didn't you tell me this before?

396
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,410
- Didn't wanna spoil today.
- And this hasn't spoilt it?

397
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,490
It was supposed to be five years, but now...

398
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,510
I looked at it, something happened, it started going down.

399
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,450
- I don't know what it was.
- So you broke it?

400
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,770
No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I don't... I don't know.

401
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,000
Why did you have to look at it?

402
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,030
Look, I was thinking maybe we could overcome it somehow.

403
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,190
Why did you have to look at it?

404
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,790
Because I like you.

405
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,750
Like properly, really, I like you.

406
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,880
For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?

407
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,630
That's not the point.

408
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,580
I looked, but that's not the issue here.

409
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,850
Are you sure about that?

410
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,640
What the fuck! You're more wound up about that

411
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,440
than how short the time is.

412
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Yes, because we had agreed.

413
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,750
Listen. Listen. Listen.

414
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,830
- What if we just ignore it?
- We can't.

415
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,900
Listen, we'll just fuck the system. We'll fuck it--

416
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,340
- And do what?
- We'll jump out, over the wall, get out.

417
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,140
There is nothing out there.

418
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,540
How d'you know? How d'you know?

419
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,030
- Amy...
- You've ruined this.

420
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,020
You've ruined it.

421
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,910
Hey, it's nothing.

422
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,160
- Amy.
- Don't follow me.

423
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,950
Amy, I'm sorry.

424
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,380
Amy.

425
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,580
- Everything happens for a reason.
- What reason?

426
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,510
The system will be assessing your reaction

427
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,920
to the painful premature termination of a treasured relationship

428
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,450
and will adjust and improve its profile

429
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,780
of your eventual chosen one accordingly.

430
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,210
- You're a great comfort.
- Thank you.

431
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,470
I swear to God, I feel like scaling the wall out there

432
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,660
and jumping in the fucking wilderness.

433
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,240
That would contravene the rules of the system.

434
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,220
The fucking system.

435
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,230
Failure to comply with the system may result in banishment.

436
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,820
All right, I know.

437
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,300
Christ, will you let me be angry at least? Will you give me that?

438
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,280
You must vacate your current living quarters

439
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,730
when the time expires.

440
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,740
Like I didn't know.

441
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,050
And if I hadn't have looked, we'd have been together years.

442
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,940
She was...

443
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,450
You know when you meet someone and you just know?

444
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,860
You just know that...

445
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,540
Reckon you could pop this in me now? I've sort of got jaw ache.

446
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,630
Yeah, come on.

447
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,300
And after all that,

448
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,860
he never even apologized, not once.

449
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,320
That's too bad.

450
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,620
Do you mind if I think about her?

451
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,560
If I can think about him?

452
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,440
Yeah, sound.

453
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,890
One, two, three, four.

454
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,570
One, two, three, four.

455
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,540
Congratulations, Amy.

456
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,800
Your ultimate match has been identified.

457
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,700
Your pairing day is tomorrow.

458
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,340
- Ultimate as in "The one"?
- That is correct.

459
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,800
- And we meet tomorrow?
- That is correct.

460
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,600
Tomorrow you'll be coupled with your ultimate match

461
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,950
and together you will leave this place forever.

462
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,500
Ok.

463
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,020
Are you allowed to tell me anything about them?

464
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,150
- Do I know them already?
- Negative.

465
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,430
- Right.
- There is one more thing.

466
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,590
Yeah, and what's that?

467
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,260
Prior to pairing day,

468
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,540
you have been allocated a short farewell period

469
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,390
with an individual of your choosing.

470
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,010
A farewell period? Like, I get to say goodbye to someone?

471
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,350
That is correct.

472
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,580
Data shows this can help provide psychological closure.

473
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,780
Frank, I choose Frank.

474
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,530
Your choice has been registered.

475
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,150
Wait. Where are we meeting?

476
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,340
Usual booth, 7:30 p.m.

477
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,450
Right.

478
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,240
- Coach?
- Yes, Amy?

479
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,650
Count to four.

480
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,980
One, two, three, four.

481
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,850
Wait, wait. How long have we got?

482
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,400
Look, the system's set my pairing day for tomorrow.

483
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,970
- Yeah, me too.
- Right.

484
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,370
I don't want whoever the system reckons the one is, OK?

485
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,080
- I want you.
- I want you.

486
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,790
Failure to comply with the system

487
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,950
- may result in banishment.
- You can fuck off.

488
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,620
Can you remember where you were before you came here?

489
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,970
You can't, can you?

490
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,110
- No.
- Me neither.

491
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,320
- Why can't I think of that?
- It's a test.

492
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,100
Do you remember the first night that we were together?

493
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,960
How did you feel?

494
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,010
I felt safe, happy, comfortable.

495
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,170
It felt right.

496
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,190
It felt like something locked into place,

497
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,170
like we'd met before.

498
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,200
Like it had happened before and it'll happen again,

499
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,320
like it's happened a thousand times over and over again.

500
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,450
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

501
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,330
Ever since we've met, this world has been toying with us.

502
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,090
It's trying to keep us apart. It's...

503
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,150
It's a test, I swear it is,

504
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,140
and the two of us rebelling together

505
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,920
is something to do with passing it.

506
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,200
We've gotta fuck it all off.

507
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,470
Exactly. We've just gotta fuck the whole thing off and go.

508
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,430
- Yeah, over the wall.
- Right over it.

509
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,490
- No matter what's out there.
- OK.

510
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,370
So let's go.

511
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,560
Yeah, let's go.

512
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:11,930
Come on.

513
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,740
*Burn down the disco*

514
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,160
*Hang the blessed DJ*

515
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,840
*Because the music That they constantly play*

516
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,930
*It says nothing to me about my life*

517
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,340
*Hang the blessed DJ*

518
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,680
*Because the music they constantly play*

519
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,760
*On the Leeds side-streets That you slip down*

520
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,480
*The provincial towns you jog 'round*

521
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,920
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

522
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,010
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

523
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,950
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

524
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,820
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

525
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,480
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

526
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,110
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

527
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,800
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

528
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,520
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

529
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,030
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

530
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,860
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

531
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,530
*Hang the DJ, hang the DJ*

532
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,180
