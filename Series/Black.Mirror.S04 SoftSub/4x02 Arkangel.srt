1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,970
How are the pressures and saturation?

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,270
Pressures are good. Oxygen saturation is 100%.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,060
- Feel anything?
- No.

4
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,870
How about now?

5
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,130
And when he does that?

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,860
Nothing.

7
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,330
OK. All set, then.

8
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,360
Making initial incision. Hand me the Bovie.

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,250
We've entered the peritoneum.

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,040
I can't believe I couldn't do it.

11
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,680
I couldn't push anymore.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,830
Don't be ridiculous. Don't apologize.

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,220
We've moved the bladder. Here's the uterine incision.

14
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,750
- Oh, God...
- Hey, it's gonna be fine.

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,620
I won't tell anybody if you want to hold my hand.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,700
OK, we're ready now. How are the vitals?

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,800
Still good. You're gonna feel a little pressure now.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,760
Occiput is visible and...

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,880
baby is out.

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,970
Cutting the umbilical cord.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,370
Is she OK?

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,230
What is it?

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,560
What's...

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,360
- Say she's OK.
- It's OK.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,660
Oh, God! Oh, God...

26
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,330
- Is she OK?
- Just relax. Hold on. OK?

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,250
Good job.

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,790
She's great.

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,790
She's beautiful.

30
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,280
One, two, three and open your mouth and eat this down, OK?

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,700
One, two, three, boo.

32
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,630
No, no. Big "Ah" and in it goes.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,970
So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, soldier?

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm not a soldier.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,240
You want me to take over?

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,840
I think your mother should know by now that

37
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,510
your grandfather's not a quitter.

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
One, two, three, and...

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,910
I want to take Sara to the park. You want to come?

40
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,210
No, I'm gonna pass if you don't mind.

41
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,510
I'd like to get at that painting, get it finished.

42
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,630
- The horse?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,570
Yep. Have a good time.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,110
No, no.

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
Mommy.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,160
Here we are!

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,070
Marie?

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,000
I thought it was you.

49
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,440
This is Mikey.

50
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,840
- Hello, little guy.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,770
Hey, there.

52
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,710
- How old is he?
- He's seven months.

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,010
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Thank you.

54
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,720
Kitty!

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,780
- I'm so tired.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,520
Hopefully he'll sleep through the night one of these days.

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,140
Yeah, well, you're past that. How old's Sara now?

58
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,190
Sara is three and she's...

59
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,600
Sara!

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,770
Sara!

61
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,450
Come say hi to this little boy.

62
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,420
Sara?

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,690
Sara?

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,680
- Sara!
- Sara!

65
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,720
- Sara!
- Sara!

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,360
Sara!

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,580
- Mommy's looking for you!
- Sara!

68
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,990
Sara!

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,590
- It's OK. We're gonna find her.
- Stop!

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,490
- Lady!
- Sara!

71
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,610
I found her!

72
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,890
She was down by the track. Fallen down the slope.

73
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,530
Said she... she followed a cat?

74
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,550
- She followed a cat.
- I'm so sorry.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm right here.

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,190
- Miss Sambrell?
- Yes.

78
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,820
And Sara, right? Follow me.

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,190
You have a recommendation,

80
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,080
so Sara will be part of our trial period.

81
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,850
- Well, it's been tested though, right?
- Of course.

82
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,750
- I mean, she's not, like, a guinea pig.
- Yes.

83
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,140
It's all fully tested, perfectly safe.

84
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,380
This is just us fine-tuning our subscription model

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,760
before the full launch.

86
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,370
Look at the kids.

87
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,560
We're getting feedback on

88
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,000
which features our customers use most in the real world.

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,210
Do you wanna go up? Yeah!

90
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,450
Response so far is just incredible.

91
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,310
The sense of security, peace of mind.

92
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,890
I mean, the stories we've been hearing, they're inspirational.

93
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,220
Can you see the screen?

94
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,850
- OK, then.
- There you go.

95
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,500
- You like cartoons?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,560
Yeah? Shimmer and Shine?

97
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,420
OK.

98
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,420
Then you watch that and I won't be a moment. OK?

99
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,710
- That's it?
- That's it.

100
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,210
So...

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,370
Let's get you all set up.

102
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,700
- I'll run you through everything. OK?
- OK.

103
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,210
Feel free to ask any questions.

104
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,130
This is your parental hub.

105
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,130
I'm just pairing it with Sara's implant.

106
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,080
OK. We're all set.

107
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,660
So, this is Sara's current location,

108
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,950
which is here, of course.

109
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, look at that.

110
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,480
Now, if she ever goes missing, all you have to do is tap here,

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,820
enter your PIN, and law enforcement is automatically notified.

112
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,340
OK.

113
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,430
These are her vitals.

114
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,210
Healthy heartbeat. Oh, I see her iron levels are a little low.

115
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,570
How is she eating?

116
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,590
Man, she's picky. Um, she hates greens, so--

117
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,000
You might want to think about nutritional supplements.

118
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,850
OK.

119
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,170
Now, tap this icon here...

120
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,810
to relay her optic feed.

121
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,130
This is what she's seeing now?

122
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,330
That's right.

123
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,140
That's amazing.

124
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,420
Mommy! It's funny.

125
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,190
And there are parental controls you can apply to that.

126
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,400
- Uh, controls?
- Content limitations.

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
If she witnesses something

128
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,570
that causes her cortisol levels to rise, like stress,

129
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,070
it can kind of paint out whatever's triggering it.

130
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,150
- Let me show you.
- OK.

131
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,830
It's OK. Look.

132
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,760
See, the imagery causes a cortisol spike, and this...

133
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,520
Filter on.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,170
...is what she sees and hears.

135
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,730
OK.

136
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,010
Yeah, I'm not sure that we'll...

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,630
It's all optional.

138
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,500
Ok.

139
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,010
How much?

140
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,700
Nothing. It's a free trial.

141
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,940
Oh, free.

142
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,850
And it's completely safe.

144
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm sure it is, honey.

145
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,400
I am 2,000 years old...

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,820
and I remember when we used to open up the door

147
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,390
and just let the kids be.

148
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,450
And I remember breaking my arm

149
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,080
because you wouldn't get a baby gate.

150
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,250
And how is the arm now?

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,770
Feels OK.

152
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,730
Are you there? Mommy!

153
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,050
Where are you?

154
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,190
Mommy?

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,450
Are you here?

156
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,100
Mommy?

157
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,250
- What's up, sweetheart?
- I'm looking for Mommy.

158
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,270
You're looking for Mommy? I got no idea where she's at.

159
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,960
Upstairs. Go on. Go look upstairs.

160
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,030
Mommy, where are you?

161
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,650
Mommy, I hear you.

162
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm gonna find you.

163
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,120
I hear you, Mommy.

164
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Filter on.

165
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,450
You guys gonna be all right?

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,650
I raised you all right. You turned out OK.

167
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,680
Took you a while, but you did.

168
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,710
All right, sweetheart. I'll see you later.

169
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,610
Terrorize your grandpa. He can handle it.

170
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,210
Bye.

171
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,370
Bye.

172
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,290
Orange straw.

173
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,640
- OK, just push on my hand. OK.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:27,920
Relax.

175
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,580
Again. Is that all you got?

176
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,080
I think the range is getting better.

177
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,380
So how long till I can get back on the bike again, you think?

178
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,900
I'd say two weeks and maybe don't drive so fast.

179
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,910
Yeah, right.

180
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,840
OK. So, same time next week?

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,940
No, actually it's got to be Thursday. I got plans Monday.

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
Something exciting?

183
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,530
Girlfriend's folks are in town, so nope.

184
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,040
Well, uh, Thursday it is.

185
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,770
I'm liking yours. That's the way.

186
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,890
You're not shy about using color, are you?

187
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,770
That's the way a real artist...

188
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm gonna try this...

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,660
Sorry, honey. Just, uh...

190
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,090
Grandpa's gotta sit...

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,870
Grandpa?

192
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,620
Sara...

193
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,160
Sara...

194
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,240
Sara...

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,350
Oh, my God!

196
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,590
OK, very good.

197
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,400
The nurse left your thing on.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,860
Yeah, she probably forgot to take it off.

199
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,530
- I'll get it.
- I can get it.

200
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,200
- You good?
- Quit bugging me. Jeez.

201
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,010
There you go.

202
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,210
It's warm in here.

203
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,840
I don't need that.

204
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,960
Give me that.

205
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,070
Sara! One cookie.

206
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,530
Bad for your teeth.

207
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,360
Thanks.

208
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,440
What color for the hair?

209
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,430
Mom?

210
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,430
Whatever you want.

211
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
But I'd say brunette.

212
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,110
He's got his arms in the air. He's given up.

213
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,460
He's got a stick out and...

214
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,690
- He just, like, pounds on him.
- Turn it off, Trick. It's gross.

215
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,810
What is it?

216
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,960
Great. The walking snitch.

217
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
- She never snitches.
- She's just weird.

218
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,390
I want to know what you're watching.

219
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,150
What do you care, chip-head?

220
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,420
It's parental advisory. You're locked out.

221
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,750
I want to know.

222
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,960
You're better off not seeing it. Wish I never did.

223
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,650
What if I tell you what's in it? That work?

224
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,680
So, he brings it down, like, wham! There's all this blood.

225
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,850
You seen much blood?

226
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,880
It's like juice. Thick, red juice.

227
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,370
Then the guy on the ground is all, like, "Hell, no!"

228
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,610
And he keeps...

229
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,550
It's too much. I'm fine to have my face on the flier,

230
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,280
but on the poster, it's like, "Look at me."

231
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,040
Sara, what are you doing?

232
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,100
Sara!

233
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,000
What's happening in this picture?

234
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,820
Are they happy or...

235
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,630
They're talking.

236
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,800
Just talking?

237
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,860
I don't know what about.

238
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,610
OK. Next one.

239
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,440
- How about that one?
- I don't know.

240
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,220
Is she happy?

241
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,090
So is this, like, an autism thing?

242
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,910
The spectrum is wide, but in my opinion, she's not on it.

243
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,400
But what about the pencils, like, self-harm?

244
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,780
And these pictures are...

245
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,420
Has Sara ever shown any undue anger before now?

246
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,220
No.

247
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,500
Well, then consider this part experiment,

248
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,010
part acting out, for your benefit.

249
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,490
The Arkangel never launched nationwide.

250
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,590
It was banned in Europe.

251
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,650
It'll be pulled here, too, by the fall.

252
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,520
I did this to her.

253
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
You can't remove the implant,

254
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,140
but you can get rid of the parental unit.

255
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,390
The screen.

256
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,980
Just throw it away. Problem solved.

257
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,080
Filter off.

258
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,220
Goodbye.

259
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,840
You're gonna be on your own today. OK?

260
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,760
No Arkangel.

261
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,040
The system isn't gonna be on.

262
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,470
OK? So, no fuzzy pictures.

263
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,720
And you won't see me?

264
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,780
I won't see you.

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,090
But, you do not have to be afraid. I'm right down the street.

266
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,710
- You won't know if something happens?
- Nothing is gonna happen.

267
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,320
It's important that we do this.

268
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You're gonna be fine.

269
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,990
Be good, sweetie.

270
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,400
Watch out!

271
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,680
Watch it, kid.

272
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,490
Come on, come on, come on.

273
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,820
OK! OK, this is enough!

274
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
Don't touch my stuff again, Trick.

275
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Yeah? I'll do what I want.

276
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,020
What do you want?

277
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,180
Are you OK?

278
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,300
Yeah, sure.

279
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,250
My dad's gonna see this and then bust it all over again,

280
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,550
'cause I got in trouble.

281
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,420
Ever seen a bust lip before?

282
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,030
Not till now.

283
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,760
She turned the system off.

284
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,580
Ok...

285
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,340
This is porn. Like, people doing it.

286
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,910
They can't make babies that way.

287
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,950
They have to do it different for that.

288
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,500
So this one's got a hacksaw

289
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,200
and he's gotta cut his own foot off.

290
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,100
So, the terrorist guy...

291
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,560
OK, OK, keep an eye on the knife.

292
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,330
See?

293
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,340
He's gonna take his whole head off!

294
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,990
Be good, sweetie.

295
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,640
Good boy, Petey.

296
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,300
You hang on in there.

297
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,430
- You added something.
- Oh, it's like a new kind of probiotic.

298
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,400
- It keeps your stools firm.
- Oh, Jesus, Mom.

299
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,350
Oh, you've got to be kidding!

300
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,390
When was the last time you went anywhere?

301
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,970
That's not dancing.

302
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,080
She said he was English.

303
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,410
He's not English.

304
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,970
She said he said "cup of tea," or something.

305
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,070
Doesn't mean anything. Susan's an idiot.

306
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,260
Hey, it's Trick.

307
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,900
Holy fuck, he's got wheels!

308
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,070
Yo, Trick!

309
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,420
Hey, guys. What's up?

310
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,890
- Interesting hair.
- Shut up.

311
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,780
I'm fucking with you. It's cool.

312
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,260
- How are you doing?
- Didn't know you cared.

313
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,650
Maybe I don't.

314
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,110
- You a delivery guy now?
- Kinda.

315
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,390
- Of sorts.
- Shut up.

316
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,770
So intriguing. I gotta go.

317
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,960
Hey, uh, we're headed to Lake Dalston later

318
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,100
if you girls want to hang.

319
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,280
We'll think about it.

320
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,420
- It'll be fun.
- Why don't you just come?

321
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,510
Come on!

322
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Like my dad's gonna let me set foot in Trick's van.

323
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,180
Look, we tell our folks we're at Reilly's for movie night.

324
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,760
Oh, come on, it'll work.

325
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,290
It's worth a shot, I guess.

326
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,360
So, anyhow...

327
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,600
- You and, uh, Trick, huh?
- What?

328
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm not gonna do anything.

329
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,590
- Yeah, OK. Sure.
- Oh, fuck you!

330
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,670
You're home.

331
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,950
Not for long. I was gonna go to Reilly's with Meryl. Movie night.

332
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,980
Oh, I thought movie night was on Wednesday.

333
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,170
Her mom's got guests over then, so we're doing tonight.

334
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,320
Gonna watch some vintage thing. The Breakfast Gang.

335
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,330
The Breakfast Club.

336
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,470
That's it.

337
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,890
Um, be home, like, 11:30. Her mom will drop me back.

338
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,200
Well, I might be heading out, too. So...

339
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,290
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

340
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,240
OK. Last one home's a rotten egg.

341
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,990
Ok!

342
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,330
Hey, there. How you doing?

343
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,790
You look hot. Later.

344
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,170
I don't know...

345
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,550
She called me fat. I got over it. I still remember it...

346
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,670
- Would you like some?
- Yeah, sure.

347
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,300
- What was that?
- I heard it.

348
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,230
Cold?

349
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,290
Only a bit.

350
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,350
Come here.

351
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,990
It's late.

352
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,210
I should go.

353
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,050
Same time next week?

354
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,950
Hi, it's Sara. Leave a message. Make it good.

355
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,860
Hey, it's Mom. All right, call me.

356
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,150
OK? All right, bye.

357
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,530
Ava. I was just wondering

358
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,190
if the girls were done with the movie.

359
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,050
What movie?

360
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,510
- Breakfast Club?
- They never ended up here.

361
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,170
- They didn't?
- No. Do you want to speak to Reilly?

362
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,640
I don't know. I must have got my wires crossed.

363
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,600
- OK, thanks.
- All right.

364
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,560
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Marie.

365
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,910
I was wondering if Sara and Meryl were together.

366
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,870
They said they were headed down to Reilly's.

367
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,100
No, I haven't seen them.

368
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,080
Hi, it's Marie, Sara's mom.

369
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,270
- Yeah, I was just...
- What's up?

370
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,350
- Have you heard from her?
- Uh... no.

371
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,940
I'm sorry, I know it's late. I was wondering, have you seen her?

372
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,100
- No. Everything OK?
- No, everything's fine.

373
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,090
Hi, it's Sara. Leave a message. Make it good.

374
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,750
Um, hey, it's Mom. Where are you? Call me.

375
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,400
Hi, it's Sara. Leave a message. Make it good.

376
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
Sara?

377
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,850
Sara?

378
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,890
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

379
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,150
Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on.

380
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,850
What is that?

381
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,780
Fuck me harder.

382
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,340
Fuck me.

383
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,470
- Oh, God, oh...
- Please.

384
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,370
Here. Let me do it.

385
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,890
My hands are warm.

386
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,490
- You gotta be a liar.
- What?

387
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,770
You said you'd never done that before.

388
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,230
No way you never done that before.

389
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,710
Swear to God.

390
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,690
You know, you didn't have to talk like that.

391
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,420
Like what?

392
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,710
Like the porn stuff.

393
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:11,560
I mean, like, you don't have to talk like that... for me.

394
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,530
Ok.

395
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,930
What?

396
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,540
Just... just you.

397
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,290
What about me?

398
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,300
You know...

399
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,420
You've got muscles, but...

400
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,780
...you're a pussy.

401
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,450
Yeah.

402
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,290
I'm busted. My mom knows I'm not at Reilly's.

403
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,660
Yeah, I mean...

404
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,180
We gotta go, OK?

405
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,830
- Come on.
- Fuck.

406
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,040
No lights. Maybe she's still out.

407
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,890
Pretty sure she had a date.

408
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,310
Maybe she got laid.

409
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,930
Oh, please, that's gross.

410
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,390
- Sorry.
- Check out that laugh.

411
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

412
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,800
Later.

413
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,550
Sara?

414
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,280
- Sorry, Mom. I am a little late.
- It's OK.

415
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,200
How was Reilly?

416
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,210
She's great.

417
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,370
I gotta go to bed.

418
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,230
- OK.
- Night, Mom.

419
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,050
I love you.

420
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,810
Hmm, probiotics.

421
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,700
I gotta go.

422
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,230
I'm gonna be a little late back from school.

423
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,990
Oh, yeah?

424
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,550
Said I'd help Meryl with a project.

425
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,230
She's being a dork about it, so...

426
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,690
- OK.
- See ya!

427
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,570
Bye!

428
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,620
- Have a good afternoon.
- Thank you, dear.

429
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,110
All right. What do you think?

430
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,550
OK, that's awesome, but I can't put that on the van.

431
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,900
- Why not?
- Well, A, it's not my van,

432
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,090
and, B, it's better if I'm anonymous.

433
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,090
For your special delivery?

434
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
Maybe, yeah.

435
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,880
- You got any on you?
- Any what?

436
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,900
Oh, come on, Trick. I'm not dumb. I know what you sell.

437
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,200
You got any?

438
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,960
It's not for you.

439
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,840
Bet it's in your backpack.

440
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,360
- Under the seat...
- Sara.

441
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,210
- With tape.
- Come here.

442
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,790
- Hey, Sara, give me that.
- Duct tape.

443
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,590
Give me that. No, no, no.

444
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,660
Come on, give me that.

445
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,960
- I bet it's in the pocket.
- No!

446
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm making a little money on the side so I can move out, OK?

447
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,340
It's not like I use that shit.

448
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,490
Have you tried it?

449
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,850
Of course I've tried it but, I mean, it's not even good coke,

450
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,990
it's, like, average.

451
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,730
It's for people who like to

452
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,380
talk about themselves all the time. Yada yada yada.

453
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,380
Show me what it looks like.

454
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,350
Come on. I just want to see.

455
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,840
Please.

456
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,140
Are you sure it's not sugar?

457
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,560
Go away.

458
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,470
So, one of the things people do is they put it, like...

459
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,420
- under their gum, bottom gum.
- OK.

460
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,930
So...

461
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,720
Gross.

462
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,380
All right, let's, uh, let's put it back.

463
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,460
- I don't think you should...
- I want to try some.

464
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,130
Just a little, just once.

465
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,380
Just once.

466
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,410
- Hi, can I help?
- I'm just looking.

467
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,620
Ma'am?

468
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,970
Excuse me? Are you Ryan Tribecky?

469
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,450
- You stay away from my daughter.
- Uh... I don't know what

470
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,480
Sara. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You stay away.

471
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,280
- OK, she's...
- She is 15, you junkie piece of shit.

472
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,670
You want the cops in on this?

473
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,280
- I didn't do anything.
- I will show them what you did.

474
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,650
OK, you stay away from her, or I will show them this. OK?

475
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,160
You still got that system?

476
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,240
Yes, I have it. So whatever she sees,

477
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,950
I see, and I am watching you.

478
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,340
- OK.
- So you stay away.

479
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,710
OK, if she calls you, you hang up.

480
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,910
If she comes to see you, you tell her to get away.

481
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,720
- You just stay away from her.
- I'll stay away.

482
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,100
You stay the fuck away.

483
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,240
Hey, Mom.

484
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,860
The mailbox you're attempting to reach is full.

485
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,040
Please try again.

486
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,780
Sara?

487
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,910
Hey, dinner's ready.

488
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,980
I'm not hungry.

489
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,770
It's Mexican.

490
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,770
Please, I just...

491
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,610
I'm tired, and I want to sleep, OK?

492
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,050
Ok.

493
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,390
So you're cutting me out.

494
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,050
Standard dick move. That's what this is, right?

495
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,840
Look at me.

496
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,300
- Why can't you just look at me?
- It was a mistake.

497
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,360
It didn't seem like a mistake from where I was laying.

498
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,260
I can't be with you.

499
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,180
What the fuck?

500
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,340
I don't want to be with you.

501
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,150
I don't want you, OK?

502
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,030
You know what?

503
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,830
Fuck you.

504
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,900
Hey, Mom.

505
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,730
OK, so why is he so down?

506
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,140
"Nothing can make me other than what I am."

507
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,500
He still holds himself morally responsible.

508
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,560
He doesn't blame fate for what's happened to him.

509
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,370
Moral responsibility implies the existence of free will,

510
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,490
but actually...

511
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,960
You feeling any better?

512
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,020
So, listen...

513
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,980
I had to run some tests, in case we had a noro outbreak here.

514
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,910
Honey, it was the EC pill that made you sick.

515
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,810
- EC?
- Emergency contraception.

516
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,830
For terminating your pregnancy.

517
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,740
There's no... There's no pregnancy.

518
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,810
Seriously, I'm... I'm not...

519
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,160
I can't... I haven't...

520
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,810
I understand, sweetheart.

521
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,790
And it will work, in spite of the vomiting.

522
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,130
You don't have to worry about that.

523
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,220
You're not pregnant anymore.

524
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,720
I gotta put it in your file, but I don't have to flag it.

525
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,100
And I want you to know I got your back.

526
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,050
Please.

527
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,330
Sara?

528
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,610
Sara?

529
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,710
You watched me.

530
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,470
No, I... honey...

531
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,900
- Honey...
- You watched me with him.

532
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,940
- I... No, I didn't mean to.
- Give it to me.

533
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,480
Give it...

534
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,980
I was trying to protect you. I was trying to keep you safe.

535
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,130
How do you turn it off?

536
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,880
Everything I've done, I've done for you.

537
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,260
- Honey, I love you...
