1
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,386
Ah, come on. No.

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,472
No. No.

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,450
It's got to be...

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,893
- What is that?
<i>- ♪ Tainted love ♪</i>

5
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,021
{\an8}<i>- ♪ Now I know I've got to...</i>
- No.

6
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,150
{\an8}Where are the...?
Damn it.

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,902
Why can't anything ever be
where it's supposed to be

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,279
when I need to...

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,073
- Did you see it there?
- I did not.

10
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,259
I was digging through this bag
for ten minutes,

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,367
and you just sat there?

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,678
I thought
you were looking for a pen.

13
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:35,846
Why would I be
looking for a pen?

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,972
Because you often
look for a pen...

15
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,181
There's a pen right there
on the table. Two pens.

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,766
- ...when a thought occurs to you.
- You're the one taking notes.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,560
Not everything that happens
to you is somebody else's fault.

18
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,837
Okay. Should I write that down
with one of the two pens?

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,922
- Do you remember...
- Yes, I remember where I was.

20
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,633
I should shave my head.

21
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,761
She'd just love that.

22
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,262
I always remember where I was.

23
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,490
I can keep several complex
thoughts in my head at one time.

24
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,392
That's why NASA keeps begging me
to move to Florida.

25
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,189
Four o'clock in the morning,
the phone rings

26
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,750
because that's
when she finishes her work.

27
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:05,774
Doesn't matter that
the rest of us have

28
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,027
to be in a lab at 8:00 a.m.

29
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,611
I mean, she's just so...

30
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,821
And everything has to be...
Plus, there's the whole...

31
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,199
- Finish the thought.
- What?

32
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,302
You're supposed to be working
on finishing your thoughts.

33
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,096
- I am finishing my thoughts.
- Well, in your head, yes, but out loud...

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,331
I'm tired of
being criticized by you.

35
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,999
By her.
It's not my fault

36
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,727
that everyone in the world
is slower than I am.

37
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,960
They always were.

38
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,772
The only person I could
ever talk to was Grandpa.

39
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,589
That's it.
Are you staying over there?

40
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,466
I thought we were
doing the couch today.

41
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,277
You said we were working
on proximity issues.

42
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,844
Sure. Sorry.

43
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,197
You're the one
who set the agenda.

44
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,430
I just wanted some Klonopin.

45
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,932
I'm all settled. Good?

46
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,055
- I don't want bangs.
- You don't have to get bangs.

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,769
Who calls people
at 4:00 in the morning?

48
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,814
Huh? I'm working on my PhD.
That's important, too.

49
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,190
I mean, does the woman not know

50
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,484
that Reno and Boston aren't
in same time zone?

51
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,299
- What are you writing?
- You wouldn't understand.

52
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,449
Well, make me understand.

53
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,701
Molecular kinetic sequencing?

54
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,179
That's what you'd like me
to make you understand?

55
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,889
I thought you were
writing about your mother.

56
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,749
Not everything in the world
revolves around...

57
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,504
I am trying to figure out
how to use DNA mutations

58
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,298
to change the very trajectory
of disease and rearrange it

59
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,884
so we can control the very
basic process in which we...

60
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,761
Wait.

61
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,558
Okay, I did it.

62
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,268
You did? Are you sure?

63
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,311
- Want to check my work?
- No.

64
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,939
I believe you.

65
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,775
My God, Esther, that's amazing.

66
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:33,237
I mean, what you've done,
right here in my office,

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,573
that's a monumental achievement.

68
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,991
Oh, yeah?

69
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,534
Well, tell it to my mother!

70
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,129
How the fuck was I ever
convinced to use a top sheet?!

71
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,714
God.

72
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,093
- Susie somebody's office.
<i>- Susie.</i>

73
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,845
Oh, good.
I thought you weren't there.

74
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,305
- Who is this?
<i>- It's Rose.</i>

75
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,140
Miriam is very ill.

76
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,309
What? No.

77
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,870
No, no, no. She doesn't get it
till the 14th.

78
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,854
- I got it marked on the calendar.
<i>- It's not that.</i>

79
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,815
She came home very late
last night, practically frozen.

80
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,699
What the fuck was she doing
out in a blizzard?

81
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,974
<i>I was hoping you could tell me.</i>

82
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,945
Well, she's your daughter.
You live with her.

83
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,197
She's your client,
and she's never home.

84
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,009
I'm not the one who was supposed
to teach her about snow.

85
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,492
That one's squarely on you.

86
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,662
Well, whosever fault it is,
she got home a block of ice.

87
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,165
Her coat was wool,
so it shrank on her,

88
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,250
and we had to borrow
garden shears from the super

89
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,877
to cut it off her.

90
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,921
We threw her in a hot shower
and put her into bed.

91
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,465
The doctor came.
She's got hypothermia.

92
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,550
- Jesus.
<i>- She's so agitated.</i>

93
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,511
She can't sleep.
She just lies there, babbling.

94
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,139
So we need you to come over
and interpret for us.

95
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,432
You speak Miriam's language

96
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,476
<i>and are familiar with
all that showbiz patois.</i>

97
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,062
- Uh, okay, yeah, I'll be right over.
<i>- Good.</i>

98
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,564
Now, when you get here,
be careful not to mention toes.

99
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,942
There's a chance
she may lose one or two of them.

100
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,777
She's gonna lose her toes?

101
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,129
We're hoping just
the left middle one.

102
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,672
She'll still be able
to walk somewhat normally,

103
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,114
and fitting into narrow shoes

104
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,574
will actually be easier
without it.

105
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,493
So, lemonade.

106
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,703
<i>- We'll see you soon?</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

107
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,541
Hello? I'm here.

108
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,126
- Susie?
- Yeah.

109
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,253
That door was locked.
How did you get in?

110
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,005
- I still have my key.
- Why?

111
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,900
I don't know. It's on my key necklace.

112
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,217
I just forgot to take it off.

113
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,593
Oh, thank God you're here.

114
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,470
- Let herself right in.
- How is she?

115
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,763
She's still talking nonsense.

116
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,199
She kept the key.
It's now a necklace.

117
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,265
So what?

118
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,850
Hey. Miriam. Update. Please.

119
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,054
No improvement. She's
practically speaking in tongues.

120
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,230
There's a lot of random words,
strange sounds.

121
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,982
She could be speaking bebop.

122
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,793
On the way here, I remembered
she went to Carnegie Hall

123
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,360
last night
to see Lenny's show.

124
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,196
Well, at least we're finally
getting some information here.

125
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,323
Carnegie Hall.

126
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,033
So, she didn't
just lose her mind

127
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,244
and wander out into the snow
because it's pretty.

128
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,829
That was my first theory.

129
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,789
Abe, my God. Your shirt.

130
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,541
It's how it came back
from the cleaners.

131
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,584
Well, put on another shirt.
We have a crisis here.

132
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,712
They all came back like this!

133
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,398
Look, I'm gonna go see
what I can find out.

134
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,756
About the shirt?

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,551
Because that's not important
right now.

136
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,304
Miriam.

137
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,390
It's me, Susie.

138
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,225
Gone, gone.

139
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,768
What's gone?

140
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,145
The window.

141
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,022
- The window's gone?
- Open.

142
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,356
The window's gone open?

143
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,067
It's closing.
A door. It's closing.

144
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,485
Nothing's closing.

145
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,237
Cheese and crackers.

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,655
Tony Bennett.

147
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,032
What about him?

148
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,575
I slept with him.

149
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,201
You slept with Tony Bennett?

150
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,595
When the fuck
did you meet Tony Bennett?

151
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,621
- He went to bat.
- Who?

152
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,373
Get my hat.

153
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,751
Are you trying to rhyme?

154
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,918
Mm.

155
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,670
Miriam?

156
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,763
- So, apparently, she had sex with Tony Bennett.
- What?

157
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,431
And she wants
some cheese and crackers.

158
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,141
I brought her
a perfectly good manchego.

159
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,727
- She wouldn't eat it.
- How does she know Tony Bennett?

160
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,103
Did she mention a hat?

161
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,772
When doesn't she mention a hat?

162
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,499
And there was something
about a window and a door.

163
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,917
And these are not helping,
by the way.

164
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,301
I thought
they might calm her down.

165
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,820
Ugh, Zelda,
what smells like donkey balls?

166
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,655
Special Polish fish head soup.

167
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,492
It wards off evil spirits.
Makes your hair shiny, too.

168
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,951
Okay. Well, when you are done

169
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,637
driving down the neighbors'
property values,

170
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,663
make some coffee,
strong coffee.

171
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,540
This is gonna take a while.

172
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,917
<i>- Miriam.
- Mm.</i>

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,752
Miriam, try to focus.

174
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,546
What happened last night?

175
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,382
It was cold. Blizzard.

176
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,675
Yes, blizzards are cold.

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,761
Walking, walking.

178
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,988
So, you're walking in the cold.

179
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,056
- Frost crotch.
- What?

180
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,682
I got frost crotch.

181
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,309
Frost crotch?
Is that a thing?

182
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,270
My toes.
I'm gonna lose my toes.

183
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,831
You know, there's been
a lot of toe talk,

184
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,541
but, frankly, frost crotch
should've been the headline.

185
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,192
I'm sure
your toes are perfect...

186
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,903
Holy shit. Oh.

187
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,073
- Are they bad?
- No.

188
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,950
You put your head
between your knees

189
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,451
to keep from passing out, right?

190
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,703
- Susie, tell me.
- Jesus.

191
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,413
What the hell
does your crotch look like?

192
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,627
Oh, good.

193
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,796
Susie?

194
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,800
Susie?
Did you find out anything?

195
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,677
Should we get
the doctor back?

196
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,804
Uh, his house call rates
are astronomical,

197
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,681
- so if we can avoid that...
- I saw the toe.

198
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,641
I told you about the toe.

199
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,978
No. No, Rose, you did not
tell me about that toe.

200
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,813
You told me about
a cute little frozen toe,

201
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,398
pink and white like a cherub.

202
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,792
You did not at all prepare me
for the horror show

203
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,025
I just witnessed back there.

204
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,109
You're overreacting.

205
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,362
It's black.

206
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,280
Her toe is black, Rose.

207
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,490
That's not overreacting.
That thing is a goner.

208
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,410
It's like she was in a war,
an old one.

209
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,453
Never mind.

210
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,416
Okay. I'm going back in.

211
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,546
You know, I can't unsee
that toe now, Rose.

212
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,047
You understand that?

213
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,800
I may never
fucking close my eyes again.

214
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,260
<i>You feeling a little better?</i>

215
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,679
Yeah, you maybe want to get up?
Move around a little?

216
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,282
Hey, your kids are watching TV.
Don't you want to see your kids?

217
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,184
The kids can go fuck themselves.

218
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,105
She just said, "The kids can
go fuck themselves."

219
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,648
- What?
- No, they certainly cannot.

220
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,150
Such terrible talk.

221
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,961
I have to tell you, I don't
really know how to proceed here.

222
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,945
- You know what would help?
- What?

223
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,572
If you gave that key back.

224
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,492
Well, it certainly
couldn't hurt.

225
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,913
<i>Susie.</i>

226
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,873
Mm?

227
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,417
- Susie.
- What?

228
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,794
You're up.
How are you feeling?

229
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,671
Okay, I guess.

230
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,674
Hey, did I say my kids
can go fuck themselves?

231
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,985
If it makes you feel any better,

232
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't think
the little one heard you.

233
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,595
Oh, good.

234
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,722
So, you want to tell me
what happened last night?

235
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,682
Uh... not much.

236
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,936
I-I was at Carnegie Hall,
there was a blizzard.

237
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,064
I couldn't find a cab,
so I just started walking.

238
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,983
Hey, hey, you think you can
get the Bennett gig back?

239
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,067
Oh, I think that's gone.

240
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,195
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

241
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,423
But maybe their second choice
didn't get back to them yet.

242
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,033
Their second choice is ironing
his show pants as we speak.

243
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,540
Me and my stupid manifesto.

244
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,460
"Make me a headliner.
No opening act for anybody."

245
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,004
What an idiotic thing to say.

246
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,381
It wasn't all idiotic.

247
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,484
The part about being able to say
what you want to say,

248
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,093
that was smart.

249
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,429
Maybe I don't have
what it takes.

250
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,242
Maybe I'm not as tough
as I thought I was.

251
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,517
I mean, look at me,

252
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,019
eight inches of snow,
I've become my mother.

253
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,398
I'm in bed, popping pills,
candles everywhere.

254
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,109
Bet I got crystals
under my pillow.

255
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,278
Yep, got crystals
under my pillow.

256
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,779
Three of 'em.

257
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,198
No, no, no, no.

258
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,575
Come on, think of
something happy, think of shoes.

259
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,786
My toe.
I'm gonna lose a toe.

260
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,371
Okay, don't think of shoes.
No shoes.

261
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,872
Think of hats.
You like hats.

262
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,333
My hat. I loved that hat.

263
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,210
Listen to me,
tomorrow this will all be

264
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,337
a funny bit
you can use in your act.

265
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,216
I'm so sorry, Susie.

266
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,968
God, I'm so stupid.

267
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,554
We had a plan,
then I went rogue.

268
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,431
I-I tried to do it all myself.

269
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,099
I shouldn't have done that.

270
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,893
You are the one person
who understands me.

271
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,063
You're the person who got me
here, got me anywhere.

272
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,943
I promise
I will never stop trusting

273
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:14,281
the most important person
in my life ever again.

274
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,454
- Six months.
- What?

275
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,913
I got to break her
in six months.

276
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,165
She's got that face.

277
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,958
Harry warned me about that face.

278
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,802
He told me his biggest regret
was not knowing

279
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,795
what that face meant
till it was too late.

280
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,714
They got that face,
they're about to give up.

281
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,591
She's not giving up.
We've come too far.

282
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,985
- And Mike's the key.
- Who's Mike?

283
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,009
I got to go.

284
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,262
Okay. Just one more thing...

285
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,263
I'm not giving you
the fucking key, Abe.

286
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,871
So, Thanksgiving's coming up
in a few days.

287
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,813
What?

288
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,565
Tomorrow? Really?

289
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,609
Why am I still in town?

290
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,403
Yes, Thanksgiving, folks,
a day of food and family.

291
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,864
A day you sit at a table and
look from your father-in-law,

292
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,241
who still hopes his daughter
will come to her senses...

293
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,761
...to your mother-in-law,

294
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,865
who still hopes her daughter
will come to her senses,

295
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,499
to your wife, who still hopes
that she'll come to her senses.

296
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,770
Your wife came to her senses,
didn't she, George?

297
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,379
Quite a few of them, actually.

298
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,256
Yes. Always marry a smart woman.

299
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,801
Sooner or later, she'll leave you.

300
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,428
You know, one of my favorite
Thanksgiving traditions

301
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,281
is to sit in my living room
and watch the overinflated

302
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,516
cartoonish figures of my youth float on...

303
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,434
...by outside
without saying a word.

304
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,158
Then when Grandma and Grandpa

305
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,663
are ready to come on inside,
we watch that

306
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,873
little thing that Macy's puts on.

307
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,151
Yeah, I love the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

308
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,070
Although
it really does let you know

309
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,822
your pecking order
in show business.

310
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,532
I mean, the <i>Gordon Ford Show</i> has

311
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,301
the greatest studio audience
in the business,

312
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,035
and I do really mean that.

313
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,245
But, folks, I'm sorry,

314
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,806
your enthusiasm just pales
in comparison

315
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,123
to any group of kids

316
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,059
when a 12-foot-tall Mighty Mouse
floats overhead.

317
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,252
It's like Elvis with a tail
to those kids.

318
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,731
Another tradition
I love about Thanksgiving is

319
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,441
sitting around the table
and Grandma, of course,

320
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,801
will remind you
that this could be her last.

321
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,053
And then we say,
"Grandma, we know, we know,

322
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,347
but we're all eating
Aunt Rosie's stuffing,

323
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,267
and none of us are complaining about it."

324
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,828
Folks, we got a great show
for you tonight. Stick around.

325
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,272
- I am not trespassing.
- Oh, no?

326
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,731
I am a tourist,
visiting this city

327
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,024
for the very first time,

328
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,484
and I took a wrong turn.

329
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,653
I was looking for
the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

330
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,071
Classic mix-up.

331
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,490
Look, I'm a manager.
Big, big talent person.

332
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,534
What's your name, Willie?
Get ready, Willie.

333
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,244
You and I are gonna
become best friends.

334
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,997
- You are gonna speak at my wedding.
- I hate weddings.

335
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,874
Elevator's
your final destination.

336
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,668
NYPD must be kicking themselves
for turning you down, huh?

337
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,836
Hedy, no!

338
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,629
And I said,
"That is not an ashtray.

339
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:38,300
That is a 19th century
French barbotine vase."

340
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,344
Oh, you just have to laugh.

341
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,055
Otherwise, the stupidity
of people will make you cry.

342
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,486
Zelda,
it smells like it's boiling.

343
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,505
- It's not boiling.
- It's supposed to simmer.

344
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,369
- It's simmering.
- Do you know the difference?

345
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,384
- I know the difference.
- Boiling is rapid bubbles.

346
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,076
Simmer is slow bubbles.

347
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,953
She knows simmering,
Shirley.

348
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,955
Salt, Zelda, salt.

349
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,041
What is this,
currency back in your country?

350
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,292
Use your fist.

351
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,336
Pushy old broad.

352
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,459
- Cheap goy.
- Fight fair, you two.

353
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,132
- Well, my flowers arrived and they're all dead.
- What?

354
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,843
They must have gotten my order
mixed up with someone else's.

355
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,847
- What do we do?
- I guess we won't have flowers.

356
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,389
We can't not have flowers,
Miriam, it's Thanksgiving.

357
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,600
All anyone cares about
at Thanksgiving is the flowers.

358
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,101
I'll figure it out.

359
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,811
He smells
the turkey.

360
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,414
He sniffed the air,
I swear he sniffed it.

361
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,731
Rose, look at him sniff.

362
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,149
Astrid, I have scissors here.

363
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,610
If you say something, he'll turn
and look right at you.

364
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,421
Try it, Midge. Here, here. Say something.

365
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,245
Uh, did you know
the day after Thanksgiving is

366
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,175
- the busiest day for plumbers?
- Oh, look! He turned!

367
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,076
- Oh, Shirley, he turned!
- Astrid.

368
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,536
This is a stove.

369
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,120
Never wave a baby
over a stove

370
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,164
unless you're trying
to potty train him.

371
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,874
Get the baby out.
Get the baby out.

372
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,793
I'll take the baby, Miss Astrid.

373
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,003
He's just so aware.

374
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,297
And awake, you know,
like, he's always awake.

375
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,840
You know, never sleeps.

376
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,610
Wait, Shirley, did you just say
you potty train a baby

377
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,010
by dangling them over a stove?

378
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,303
It warms their tush,

379
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,906
that reminds them of
what their tush is for.

380
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,891
I got Joely trained
in an hour and a half.

381
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,977
How often do you all cry?

382
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,522
Where am I?

383
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,940
Aren't you next to Mom?

384
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,863
Oh, actually, I moved
some of the cards around.

385
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,419
I thought it'd be nice
to have the little ones

386
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,603
at the grown-up table so that
Chaim doesn't feel weird.

387
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,031
So, Rose, you're there.
Noah, there.

388
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,533
Moishe, Shirley there, there.

389
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,594
Abe, Midge, and Joel,
I moved you to the kids' table.

390
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,204
- But I'm a grown-up.
- I'll go to the kids' table, Pop.

391
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,848
Oh, no, but it's Chaim's
first Thanksgiving.

392
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,291
You can't abandon him.

393
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,334
Daddy's just
being silly.

394
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,961
- Don't be scared.
- Sorry, Pop.

395
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,713
He's asleep. He won't care.

396
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,880
I think he will.

397
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,674
Yes, but you aren't
a great thinker.

398
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,859
Papa, come sit with us.

399
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,803
I brought some extra salt

400
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,513
in case the food is
under-seasoned.

401
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,890
Joel, I'd like that seat.

402
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,350
Why?

403
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,394
Because I am head of the family.

404
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,105
- I should sit at the head of the table.
- The kids' table?

405
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,482
How important is winning
this particular battle to you?

406
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,152
Oh, boy,
who killed the flowers?

407
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,278
They came that way.

408
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,988
And you paid for that?

409
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,449
I could have put out
dead flowers for free.

410
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,868
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

411
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,454
I would like to propose a toast.

412
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,706
- What? From there?
- Yes, from here.

413
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,589
A toast should come
from the grown-ups' table.

414
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,001
- But...
- I'll do the toast.

415
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,395
Oh, you're in luck,
Chaim.

416
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,838
Once a year,
we gather together...

417
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,482
- Ah! Did you see him point at you?
- Did he point?

418
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,666
- Right at you.
- Do it again.

419
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,901
- Point at Daddy.
- Point at Daddy.

420
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,925
Point at Daddy.

421
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,969
To pointing! Let's eat.

422
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,319
Noah, did I tell you
about the trip I won?

423
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,389
Really?

424
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,642
- From her bank.
- What?

425
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,268
You won the trip from your bank!

426
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,062
I don't know what you said
way over there,

427
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,314
but I won a trip from my bank
to Palm Beach.

428
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,067
The manager called,
out of the blue, to thank me

429
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,319
for my loyalty
and then offered me a trip.

430
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,403
- Fun.
- What?

431
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,946
- Fun!
- Whatever.

432
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,310
Anyhow,
we're going this weekend.

433
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,534
And the best part is,
our daughter has refused

434
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,746
to bring our grandchildren
to the airport to see us off.

435
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,039
Very disappointing.

436
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,374
I'm working that day.

437
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,709
- Wait, how come you can hear him?
- What?

438
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,437
We have a little announcement
to make ourselves.

439
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,962
We were saving it
for the proper time.

440
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,106
Shirley, you want to tell 'em?

441
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,149
No, you go ahead, Moishie.

442
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,884
Shirley and I are
getting divorced.

443
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,388
Stuffing needs salt.

444
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,764
Wait, what?

445
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,432
No. Why?

446
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,327
We just realized
we're not right for each other.

447
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,936
Now? Now you realized?

448
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,064
Once Moishe almost died,
I assumed he'd retire.

449
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,708
He been talking about retiring
for years.

450
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,401
I did,
but once you're close to death,

451
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,695
you realize how short life is.

452
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,571
And I thought, I haven't done
half the things

453
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,574
I set out to do in my business,
so I decided to expand.

454
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,368
And now we're kaput.

455
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,994
How's the turkey? Need salt?

456
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,705
Oh, the turkey's delicious,
Shirley.

457
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,788
It's Thanksgiving.

458
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,849
We're all sitting down
to dinner,

459
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,125
and you just dump this on us?

460
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,085
Relax, Joel, everything's fine.
We're fine.

461
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,671
We're still sharing the home
for now. Nothing's changed.

462
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,232
Yeah, we just put a piece
of plexiglass

463
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,383
down the center of the bed
so we don't touch butts,

464
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,510
but you can still see
if the other person is

465
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,636
choking in their sleep.

466
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,846
So there's still love.

467
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,556
Guys, can't you two
work this out?

468
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,974
Really?

469
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,559
You're the one asking
that question?

470
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,328
Little Miss "One strike
and your husband's out"?

471
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,645
Don't talk to Midge that way.

472
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,355
You and Ma have
to work this out.

473
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,481
Not gonna happen, Joely.

474
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,691
We tried. We talked.

475
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,234
And then Moishe said
something to me

476
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,738
that I never thought I would
ever hear my husband say,

477
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,531
and he can't unsay it.

478
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,825
And in response
Shirley said something to me

479
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,308
I never thought
another human being,

480
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,746
let alone my wife of 34 years,
would say to me,

481
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,831
and she can't unsay it.

482
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,958
- Well, I'm on Mom's side here.
- What? Why?

483
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,335
Why? You had a heart attack,
of course you should retire.

484
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,463
Well, thank you
for your loyalty to the gender.

485
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,339
Very nice.

486
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,425
Hey, since we're all sharing
big life news,

487
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,027
you have something to tell
the people, don't you, Joel?

488
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,970
- Really, Pop?
- An announcement.

489
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,656
Something you've been
sitting on way too long.

490
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,806
What announcement?

491
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,767
Well, uh...

492
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,102
This wasn't exactly when
I was going to tell you, but...

493
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,771
Watch it!

494
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,214
- Ethan, switch with Daddy.
- Okay.

495
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,566
Can't believe
I have to... Okay, so,

496
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,693
as my newly single father
just said,

497
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,903
I do have some news.

498
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,321
It's about me and my girlfriend.

499
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,907
- Hey, watch it.
- Esther, kids' table. Move.

500
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,493
- Okay.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

501
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,662
We are gonna get married.

502
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,955
Oh, my God!

503
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,665
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my God. Yes.

504
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,749
And we're gonna have a baby.

505
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,878
- Uh, mazel!
- What? Oh, my God!

506
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,463
W-Well, who is this girl,
thi-this fiancée?

507
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,547
- You know her.
- I do?

508
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,631
- You met her.
- When?

509
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,110
- You played mah-jongg with her.
- Where?

510
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,493
- At the hospital?
- What hospital?

511
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,196
The hospital
when Pop had his heart attack.

512
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,430
- Oh. Did I win?
- Yes. You met her,

513
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,824
you love her,
we're getting married.

514
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,934
A grandchild.
Rose, did you hear?

515
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,936
How dare you keep this from me?

516
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,646
He kept it from you, not me!

517
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,940
You want me to be miserable,
but I won't.

518
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,442
I'll have a daughter-in-law
and a grandchild,

519
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,070
and you will drop dead

520
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,239
in a pile of
the men's spring collection.

521
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,508
What a thing to say
on a holiday.

522
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,786
Enjoy the Zen beauty
and relative anonymity

523
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,413
of this table
as long as you can.

524
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,835
<i>I'm starving.</i>

525
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,169
Impossible.

526
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,022
I think you ate
the entire turkey by yourself.

527
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,674
- Ha, you ate the turkey by yourself.
- Did not.

528
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,094
<i>- Wânshàng hâo,</i> Mrs. Chou.
<i>- Wânshàng hâo,</i> Mrs. Chou.

529
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,428
Watch out, watch out.

530
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,058
Put that bag in the kitchen,
Ethan.

531
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,937
A lady already lives here.

532
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,188
What?

533
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,692
Uh, kids do me a favor,

534
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,527
can you go in Daddy's bedroom
for a minute?

535
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,530
- Take my hand.
- No!

536
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,813
- I'm supposed to show you.
- I know where it is.

537
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,803
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back today?

538
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,287
I missed you.

539
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,376
I didn't know about the kids.

540
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,879
That you had them.
Today, I mean.

541
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,213
It's okay.

542
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,094
You want something to eat?

543
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,446
I have a whole Thanksgiving meal
in the kitchen.

544
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,471
I'm moving to Chicago.

545
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,682
Easing into a conversation's

546
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,076
really not your strong suit,
is it?

547
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,810
Sorry. How was your Thanks...

548
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,979
- Moment's passed, Mei.
- Right. Sorry.

549
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,648
- Sit down.
- No.

550
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,358
- You won't sit down?
- No.

551
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,361
I just need to stand here
and say what I came to say.

552
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,197
I think my residency is gonna
wind up in Chicago.

553
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,824
I like the hospital
and the people.

554
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,659
Uh-huh. Well, I don't know
if you noticed,

555
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,994
but I don't live in Chicago,

556
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,397
and I can't really move
right now.

557
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,997
- I know.
- There's no hospital

558
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,141
in the entire Northeast
that could work?

559
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,123
- No.
- You've looked?

560
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,208
- No.
- Should you?

561
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,752
Because we're having a baby.

562
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,046
No.

563
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
No?

564
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,257
We're not...

565
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,802
...anymore.

566
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,889
What happened?

567
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,724
Are you all right?
Why didn't you call me?

568
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,993
I would have been
on the next train to...

569
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,602
Nothing happened. I just...

570
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,563
We're...

571
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,817
...just not having
a baby anymore.

572
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,195
I don't understand.

573
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,241
Oh, shit. I understand.

574
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,036
I'm sorry.

575
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,371
I'm gonna sit down.

576
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,456
All my life I've had one goal.

577
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,376
You knew
I never intended to have

578
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,211
a serious relationship
with anyone,

579
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,838
and this thing with you was...

580
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,841
Daddy!
Esther's pointing at me again!

581
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,678
- I'll be there in a minute!
- Daddy, she won't stop!

582
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,930
In a minute, Ethan!
Goddamn it!

583
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,059
Shit. Sorry, Ethan!

584
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,894
- I know you're upset.
- I don't understand.

585
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,872
If you were gonna do this,
why the hell did you tell me

586
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,898
you were pregnant
in the first place?

587
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,584
I mean, since I don't matter
in the equation.

588
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,902
- That's not true.
- Can Jews be monks?

589
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,363
'Cause my fucking
relationship track record...

590
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,490
I know I should have
thought it through better.

591
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,994
But I didn't,
because you are...

592
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,371
You're you.

593
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,373
I never saw you coming.

594
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,725
You should be
an optometrist, then.

595
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,209
Might help with that eyesight.

596
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,169
Don't be sarcastic, please.

597
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,879
Okay. Don't be upset,
don't be sarcastic,

598
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,425
- don't give a shit.
- I didn't say that. I just...

599
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,762
I can't have it all, Joel.

600
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,142
The world doesn't work that way.

601
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,563
If I'm really gonna be a doctor,
then I just have to be a doctor.

602
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,817
Please understand.

603
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,738
I really need you to understand.

604
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,700
Okay.

605
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,829
Okay, fuck it. Fine.
I understand.

606
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,040
I do. You're gonna be
a terrific doctor.

607
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,667
- Thank you.
- You got all your stuff?

608
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,461
You must've left
some things here.

609
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,920
Oh, just this sweater.

610
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,797
One sweater.

611
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,924
Boy, I'm really not
very observant, am I?

612
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,593
Girl leaves nothing
but a sweater,

613
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,612
- that's a pretty big fucking sign.
- Please, Joel, I...

614
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,097
I got the kids, Mei.

615
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,351
I really do wish you luck.

616
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,569
I'll send you my new address.

617
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,987
Sure. Send the address.

618
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,282
- Bye, Joel.
- Bye.

619
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,664
You're a turkey leg.

620
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,626
You're a turkey leg.

621
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,294
You're two turkey legs.

622
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,839
Turkey leg, turkey leg,
turkey leg.

623
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,050
Esther, you keep pointing
that finger at Ethan,

624
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,511
he's gonna eat it.

625
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,406
<i>♪ Hit the road Jack,
and don't you come back no more... ♪</i>

626
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,350
Excuse me, Miss?
Uh, this turkey is very dry.

627
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,310
That's food that
someone brought from home.

628
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,645
I can't help you.

629
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,897
Uh, excuse me, Miss?
More Chianti?

630
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,899
That's wine that
someone brought from home.

631
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,526
Jesus Christ.

632
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,337
I'll be leading the whole room
in saying grace.

633
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,130
You got to say grace
at Thanksgiving, so be ready.

634
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,323
- I don't know grace.
- I do. Great ass.

635
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,450
He got you.

636
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,202
Get it all out now.
You got two minutes.

637
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,703
Susie, be in charge
of this section.

638
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,640
We all say grace together
in just over two minutes.

639
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,915
Sounds fun.

640
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,834
I just don't know
if I'm ready to tour.

641
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,937
It's not a tour. It's a two-week
stint at the Hacienda.

642
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,337
The audience comes to you.

643
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,381
- Sounds intimidating.
- It's not.

644
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,591
You do the show,
then you go back to your room.

645
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,302
I got you a really nice suite,
with maid service.

646
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,471
You ever have maid service?
A girl cleans your room,

647
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,431
makes your bed.
Hell, it's Vegas,

648
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,409
- she'll probably give you a tug if you ask for it.
- A what?

649
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,853
I even got you
a first-class plane ticket.

650
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,563
Plane ticket? I can't fly.

651
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,439
No, the plane flies,
you just sit in it.

652
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,276
I can't go on a plane.
They make no sense.

653
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,652
I mean, what keeps them up?

654
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,963
I don't know,
what keeps a bird up?

655
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,655
- Worries about money?
- Was that a joke?

656
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,657
You set me up,
but I'm not flying.

657
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,576
Oh, yes, you are.
You'll be fine.

658
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,494
You're coming, too, right?

659
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,122
Me? Are you kidding? I'm not
getting on a fucking plane.

660
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,624
Ow! Shit.

661
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,918
I think
I just fucked up my tooth.

662
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,379
Which one of you losers
brought these rolls?

663
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,215
I did.
Made 'em myself. You like?

664
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,177
- No. They're hard as rocks.
- Oh, that's on purpose.

665
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,929
It's an old family recipe.
We call 'em Hard Rock Rolls.

666
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,574
Well, that is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

667
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:34,992
You know, you're supposed
to soak 'em in hot water

668
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,326
for ten minutes
before biting into 'em.

669
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,518
Did you not know that?

670
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:38,728
No, I did not know that.

671
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,146
Everyone, an announcement!

672
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,315
The Stage Deli is
not responsible

673
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,193
for Grandma's sawdust turkey,
Grandpa's lumpy potatoes,

674
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,278
Aunt Betty's
sour cranberry sauce,

675
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,405
or the raisins
in the goddamn carrot cake.

676
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,240
So stop asking.

677
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,410
- You're dismissed, Fred.
- Okay. Enjoy your evening.

678
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,622
- Hey, Verla, can we get some more hot water
for these rolls? - No!

679
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,545
Wow, looks like
there's already plenty of food.

680
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,459
- Hi, Alfie.
- Are you limping?

681
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,127
Yeah, I almost lost a toe.

682
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,088
Hey, look at my tooth,
does it look weird?

683
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,174
You have spinach in it,
or something.

684
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh! It's moving.

685
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,636
It's the goddamn
Hard Rock Rolls.

686
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,763
Fred's rolls? You're supposed
to soak 'em first.

687
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,514
Never mind all that.
Listen.

688
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,475
I kissed Bobby's ass,
and I finally got you

689
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,894
a slot at that club on 15th,
next Thursday.

690
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,271
- Great. I'm ready.
- And Boise called.

691
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,957
I can't understand you
with your finger in your mouth.

692
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,566
Boise called.

693
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,419
They paid off the right cops
so the Wolford's reopening.

694
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,153
They still want you,
if you're into that.

695
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,131
If you're okay with it, I am.
I've got clean stuff,

696
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,795
dirty stuff,
I need a place to stay sharp.

697
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,742
Okay, everyone,
there will be no group grace

698
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,545
due to an utter lack
of interest in doing it

699
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,037
and an endless
string of jokes about

700
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,640
what to do with the turkey neck.

701
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,224
So, enjoy your food,
happy Thanksgiving.

702
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,125
- I'm not flying.
- Yes, you are.

703
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,503
- I am ready to go, too.
- I'm not flying.

704
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,339
Yes, you are. I got
a lot of irons in the fire.

705
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,384
- I'm not flying.
- Yes, you are.

706
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,177
Ugh, I am gonna kill you, Fred.

Hiya, Mike.

726
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,607
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a tree.

727
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,027
- Did you follow me here?
- I just thought we could talk.

728
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,880
You thought... <i>- Cocoa with
marshmallows, now available...</i>

729
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,031
I'm here with my kids.

730
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,258
They're running around here
somewhere.

731
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm sorry, you forced my hand.

732
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,993
I... what?

733
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,554
I wanted to talk to you
at the studio...

734
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,331
but suddenly
I can't get through security.

735
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,850
You can't get through security
'cause I gave them your picture

736
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,334
and said,
"Under no circumstances

737
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,353
- do you let this person in."
- Well, was it flattering?

738
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,171
The photo? Backlit,
little shoulder action?

739
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,131
- I'm holding a saw.
- I have to talk to you.

740
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,400
- Yeah.
- I want you to give my girl

741
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,301
Miriam Maisel another look-see.

742
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,704
Just come and see her do her
thing, you will not regret it.

743
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,823
Oh, I already offered to see her
do her thing, remember?

744
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,016
You flipped out, cursed me,
and stomped off

745
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,060
to the enchanted bog
you slithered out of.

746
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,604
- Well, let's set something up again.
- No.

747
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,898
I don't offer again.

748
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,524
I will not see your girl.

749
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,877
Fine, you don't have to see her.

750
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,061
Send someone from the office.

751
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,403
Uh, one of your women writers.

752
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,905
We don't have any women writers.

753
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,449
Oh, so Gordon Ford's just
one big cock parade, huh?

754
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,926
What's going on with your mouth?

755
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,494
It's my tooth.
Don't worry about it.

756
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,388
- Want me to saw it out of your head?
- No, thanks.

757
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,538
Go away.

758
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,374
Hey, I am being nice here.

759
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,917
I'm sorry, what?

760
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,686
I came all the way up here
to make it convenient for you,

761
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,295
and now you're brushing me off?

762
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,339
Where's a pack of wolves
when you need one?

763
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,383
Hey, who brought you
Sophie Lennon, huh?

764
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,593
I did,
and that interview worked.

765
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,721
It was huge. It single-handedly
drove your ratings up.

766
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,324
And you're strutting
around that studio,

767
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,474
taking all the credit.

768
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,975
I did that for you, Mikey.

769
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,435
You know something?

770
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,271
There is one thing that
I look forward to all year long,

771
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,608
one thing that brings me pure
happiness, and it's this.

772
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,652
Christmas tree hunting
with my kids.

773
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,655
We do it every year,
and it's a fucking joy!

774
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,534
Now you are going to stay!
Right there!

775
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,662
And I'm gonna go buy cider
for my kids

776
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,580
and forget
that you ever happened.

777
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,917
Oh, I already bought them
some cider.

778
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,545
Wanted to keep 'em occupied.

779
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,788
You know, it's weird, none
of 'em really look like you.

780
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,926
I'm giving this place
your picture next year.

785
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,191
Maybe.

786
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,610
<i>Spartacus?</i>

787
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,821
- Was it <i>Spartacus?</i>
- Maybe.

788
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,532
The three-hour movie
with all the crucifixions?

789
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,617
That was the movie
you thought would be great

790
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,035
for three kids under ten to see?

791
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,221
I thought
they'd like the horses.

792
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,288
So you've ruined Christmas

793
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,414
and crucifixions for me.

794
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,541
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

795
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,877
And because of you,

796
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,045
I picked
the worst tree on the lot.

797
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,298
You got in my head
and you blew my focus.

798
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,801
- Mike, I just...
- You will never set foot in 30 Rock again.

799
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,470
Do you understand?

800
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,264
You won't even be allowed
to stand in front of 30 Rock.

801
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,682
You're gonna make it to 20 Rock,

802
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,809
and then
you're gonna have to turn right.

803
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,562
You even won't be allowed
to walk down 5th Avenue.

804
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,365
You won't be able to stand
in front of Saks,

805
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,400
because it is across the street
from 30 Rock on 5th Avenue.

806
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,235
If you want to go to Saks,

807
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,988
you're gonna have to enter
from the 49th Street side.

808
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,091
- I don't go to Saks.
- In fact, stay out of Midtown.

809
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,315
You're not allowed in Midtown.

810
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,618
My office is in Midtown.

811
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,744
Move your office,

812
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,107
and that goes for your girl,
too.

813
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,242
She doesn't have an office.

814
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,623
She will never set foot

815
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,082
in that building either.

816
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,251
And I'm betting
that she does go to Saks,

817
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:57,463
so that 49th Street entrance
is going to fucking kill her.

818
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,008
It is miles away
from the fucking elevators.

819
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,011
Hey, kids, isn't
that Santa Claus over there?

820
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,888
- Where? Where?
- Where's Santa Claus?

821
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,723
Oops, made a mistake.

822
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,476
I don't think that
that was Santa after all.

<i>There's a ticket to Vegas</i>

832
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,123
and it needs

00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,125
- So how's your tooth?
<i>- Shut up.</i>

834
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,877
You know I can't
understand you, right?

Fuck me.

838
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,175
You have to go to a dentist.

839
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,718
I have to get this asshole...

841
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,763
I'm not going.

842
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,098
Yes, you are. Ow.

843
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,683
No. I'm not going.

844
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,369
<i>- I'm not going. I'm not going...
- You are going. Ow!</i>

845
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,144
<i>You are going,
if I have to tie you</i>

846
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,455
- to a fucking... ow.
- I'm not going.

847
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,022
I'm gonna kill myself.

848
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,482
Susie, this is ridiculous.

849
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,900
I am calling
my dentist right now.

850
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,318
You are heading right over.

851
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,903
<i>But Alfie...</i>

852
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,572
Alfie is not going!

853
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:05,948
I will take Alfie
to the airport.

854
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,283
<i>- You will?
- Will what?</i>

855
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,409
Yes.

856
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,369
Okay, but you can't just
drop him off curbside.

857
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,246
You got to see him
walk on the plane.

858
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,123
And don't let him
go to the bathroom

859
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,142
'cause he will climb out
a window or flush himself

860
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,043
- down the toilet. He's slippery.
<i>- I promise.</i>

861
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,545
I am calling the dentist.

862
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,338
Bye.

863
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,394

00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,859
Okay, out of the car.

867
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,236
No. I'm not going.

868
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,696
- Okay.
- I mean it.

869
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,822
I know you do.

870
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,216
I don't think
you're listening to me.

871
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,450
Of course I am.

Why are

879
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,859
Is there gonna be
some sort of invasion

880
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,176
that I don't know about?

881
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,386

I can just walk out of here,
you know. You can't stop me.

885
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,228
I have your cape,
and I'm not giving it back

886
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,064
until you step onto that plane.

887
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,650
You know, you're being
very silly. Flying is fun.

888
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,777
They bring you
drinks and food...

889
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,487
Oh, good. A last meal.

890
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,284
Here. It's from Susie.

891
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,952
It's used.

892
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,913
It's from Ethan.

893
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,046
So, I got a phone call
the other day,

894
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,465
which was surprising, since
I didn't know I had a phone.

895
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,967
It was from a man...

896
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,261
a talent manager.

897
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,765
And what did he want?

898
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,060
He said he'd seen
one of my shows.

899
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,354
He said he thought
I was very talented

900
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,791
and that I could be bigger than
Houdini, which is ridiculous.

901
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,608
I'm already bigger than Houdini.

902
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,151
Houdini was a very tiny man.

903
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,675
That's why he fit
so easily in a box.

904
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,947
Did you tell him
you already have a manager?

905
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,490
I did.

906
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,158
He said he knew Susie Myerson

907
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,953
and that she was
an elevator operator.

908
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,496
A what?

909
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,790
Someone you meet
going up or going down.

910
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,834
He said
if you want to be on top,

911
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,627
you have to get off
the elevator.

912
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,462
At the top, presumably.

913
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,382
Alfie, do you know why
you're getting on this plane?

914
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,717
Because you stole my cape.

915
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,637
Because you are about to
play a 2,000-seat room in Vegas.

916
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,723
You have top billing,

917
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,683
amazing accommodations,
and you are making

918
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,369
more money than you've
ever seen in your life.

919
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,437
That's not true.
I slept in a safe once.

920
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,189
Six months ago, you were
hustling drunks in a bar.

921
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,108
You were done.

922
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,693
No one cared
what happened to you.

923
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,903
No one except Susie Myerson.

924
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,655
I know that.

925
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,116
It's easy to see a diamond

926
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,160
once it's in the window
at Tiffany's.

927
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,078
It's a little harder
when it's throwing up

928
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,164
in a bucket in your office.

929
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,584
Susie is one of a kind.

930
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,961
You'll never find another Susie.

931
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,380
You just remember that.

932
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:16,221
Yeah, so that's
Gate 4, right?

933
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,973
Hi there.
This is Alfie Zielinski.

934
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,933
He's on the 2:45 to Las Vegas.

935
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,226
All right, wonderful.

936
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,550
It's his first time on a plane,

937
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,896
and he's a little nervous.

938
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,397
I see that noted here.

939
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,649
Don't you worry,
we'll take good care of him.

940
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,194
Hello, Alfie, welcome to TWA.

941
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,112
We're going to be great friends.

942
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,655
Hey!

943
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,633
It's a little sign that
tells everyone who you are.

944
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,951
I won't have to explain a thing.

945
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,912
Call Susie when you land.
Have a great run.

946
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,456
And remember
what we talked about, hmm?

947
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,294
<i>Welcome
to the TWA Flight Center.</i>

948
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,670
Alfie, wait!

949
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:49,922
I have your cape.

950
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,882
Oh, I got it back an hour ago.

951
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,532
- Right down this way.
- Come on, honey, hurry! Don't lock the gate!

952
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,766
Miriam?

953
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,477
What are you doing here?

954
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,729
Oh, hi. I'm doing

955
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,916
a last-minute favor for Susie.
There was an emergency.

956
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,275
Oh, so for Susie
she could come out here.

957
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,319
For her parents, bubkes.

958
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,922
I'll admit it doesn't
look good, Miriam.

959
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,298
Susie has a client
who's going to Vegas.

960
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,949
She needed someone
to see him off.

961
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,826
I have yet
to hear anything remotely

962
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,452
resembling an emergency.

963
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,454
- Her tooth hurt.
- Should we give you a moment

964
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,039
to come up with a better story?

965
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,225
Why aren't you
on a plane right now?

966
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,708
They canceled our flight.

967
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,044
No, Rose.
They did not cancel our flight.

968
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,671
The flight is happening.

969
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,714
- They canceled us.
- What are you talking about?

970
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,734
They couldn't find our
reservations, and nothing else

971
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,261
was available,
so now we're going home.

972
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,888
We'll be there when you're done
with your very important favor

973
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,640
for the friend with a sore tooth

974
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,308
who did not put you
through Bryn Mawr.

975
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,893
Hey, why don't we share
a cab home?

976
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,562
- No.
- Hmm?

977
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,939
We came alone,
we'll go home alone.

978
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,400
Much like birth and death.

979
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,361
Okay. I'll wave to you
as I drive alongside

980
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,863
all the way back home.

981
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,532
You know,
we seem to be experiencing

982
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,450
a streak of very bad luck.

983
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,869
I don't know about that.

984
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,663
The dry cleaning, the dead
flowers at Thanksgiving,

985
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,082
I had two flat tires this week.

986
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,252
Now suddenly
our plane reservations.

987
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,171
What is it? What's the matter?

988
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,340
Rose?

989
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,676
Nothing. Let's just go home.

990
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,511
All right.

991
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,930
Let's beat Miriam to the taxis.

992
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,767
<i>Yes, I know</i>

993
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,227
the flight was canceled.

994
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,330
What I'm just trying to figure
out is how it happened.

995
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,441
Was the woman who canceled
by any chance Italian,

996
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,526
very intimidating?

997
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,237
Or was it an Irish woman
with a very thick Irish accent?

998
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,615
You know, "That's
a lovely hat by the way."

999
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,742
Yes,
that's an Irish accent.

1000
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,869
I'm not an impressionist,
forgive me.

1001
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,288
Rose! I got a taxi!
Let's go!

1002
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,707
One minute!
Well, could you hear anything

1003
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,543
in the background then,
like screams, perhaps?

1004
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,795
Hacksaws or bones breaking?

1005
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,464
Rose! Come on!

1006
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,757
I'm not joking.

1007
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,301
Rose Weissman,
I'm leaving without you!

1008
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,219
I have to go.
My husband's having a fit.

1009
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,846
Abe, for God's sake!

1010
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,431
We lost the cab.

1011
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,891
There'll be another cab.

1012
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,893
Like there was
another flight?!

1013
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,695
<i>Now arriving
at Gate 10, Flight 192</i>

1014
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,530
<i>from Los Angeles.</i>

1015
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,366
<i>Now arriving at Gate 10,</i>

00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,660
<i>Flight 192 from Los Angeles.</i>

1017
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,475
- Hello.
- Hello.

1018
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,978
First time traveling?

1019
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,271
And carrying things, yes.

1020
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,357
Can I, uh...?

1021
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,200
Rothstein, Myers,
Friedman and Yabromowitz.

1022
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,035
Your rabbis?

1023
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,662
My lawyers.

1024
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,330
Ah.

1025
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,332
Well, you don't want
to lose this.

1026
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,750
No.

1027
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,377
They charge by the word.

1028
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,462
- Mm.
- Double for the bad ones.

1029
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,636
So, you're taking a trip?

1030
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,015
I am West Coast bound, yes.

1031
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,975
- Really?
- Yes.

1032
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,061
Gonna see what
an L.A. holding cell is like.

1033
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,688
I hear 72 and sunny.

1034
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,356
No humidity.

1035
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,775
How have you been?

1036
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,902
Good. Really good.

1037
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,821
Good.

1038
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,783
Are you off somewhere?

1039
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,953
No. I just forced
a very nervous magician

1040
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,164
to get on a plane
by holding his cape hostage.

1041
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,749
I did that last week.

1042
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,834
The bastard left rabbits
all over my apartment.

1043
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,919
Mm.

1044
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,339
So, how long are you gonna be
out west?

1045
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,091
Don't know.

1046
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,593
I've got some gigs lined up.

1047
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,136
I rented a house.

1048
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,055
Wow.

1049
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,182
You're a man with a lease.

1050
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,017
It happens to the best of us.

1051
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,564
Well... I...

1052
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,983
think you'll really enjoy L.A.

1053
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,861
With all the... sun and...

1054
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,863
oranges and Disneyland.

1055
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,990
- All the things you love.
- Oh, I'm sure I'll find

1056
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,159
a cloud or two to hide under.

1057
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,582
My kid's gonna come stay
with me for a while.

1058
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,751
Lucky girl.

1059
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,295
Yes.

1060
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,591
Well, I should probably go

1061
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,718
find a plane heading west.

1062
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,764
I'm sorry I didn't call.

1063
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,475
Oh, no. We don't do that, right?

1064
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,435
Okay.

1065
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,979
You take care.

1066
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,776
Lenny!

1067
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,614
I'm not gonna blow it.

1068
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,126
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1069
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,606
<i>This is

with a two-drink minimum.

1084
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,429
- Any sign of Joel?
- Nothing.

1085
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,514
And he locked
the cash up in his desk.

1086
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,725
I'm using my mad money
to make change.

1087
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,269
Here you go. Enjoy the show.

1088
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,146
Oh! Finally!

1089
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,523
Archibald!
My faithful companion.

1090
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,317
Okay, so Archibald
is not my name.

1091
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,569
Sure, it is. Archibald,
short for Archie.

1092
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,613
No. Archie would be
short for Archibald.

1093
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,157
Like I said, Archibald,
my faithful companion!

1094
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,117
Hey, we should get some horses.

1095
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,286
- Uh...
- Get some boots and chaps.

1096
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,787
Ride out into the sunset.

1097
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,456
- Catch us some varmints.
- Yes.

1098
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,416
Something to consider.
Not the chaps,

1099
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,603
but the rest we can talk about.
Hey, where have you been?

1100
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,212
I just stopped off at a bar.

1101
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,255
You own a bar. Why are you
stopping off at a bar?

1102
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,275
Variety is the spice of life.

1103
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,967
Allow me, pal.

1104
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,053
How are you tonight, beautiful?

1105
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,932
Thank you.

1106
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,618
Absolutely. So what do you
think of the place?

1107
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:01,394
I'm the owner, so, any problems,
you just come to me.

1108
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,188
Excuse me, we were having
a conversation.

1109
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,773
In here? No.

1110
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,733
You want to talk,
you go to a quiet restaurant.

1111
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,526
Take a walk on the beach.

1112
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,946
You come here to drink, dance,

1113
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,031
to get close enough
to smell her perfume.

1114
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,491
- Hey!
- Joel!

1115
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,052
There's a terrible
martini olive problem

1116
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,619
that needs
your immediate attention.

1117
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,971
The place falls apart
without me.

1118
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,038
I'll be right back.

1119
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,374
No, he won't. No, he won't.

1122
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,341

Hey, stop playing.

1123
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,343
Jesus.

1124
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,303
You see a man is up here
trying to talk?

1125
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,264
Fucking musicians.

1126
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,391
Hello, everyone.

1127
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,394
My name is Joel Maisel,
the owner of the Button Club.

1128
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,582
You know, the great thing
about owning a club is that

1129
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,167
all the things
that made you look like a loser

1130
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,652
before are now part of your job.

1131
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,154
For example,
right now I'm not drunk,

1132
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,073
I am doing research.

1133
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,908
And I am a very hard worker.

1134
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,120
Hey, I got a laugh.

1135
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,205
See?
We don't need this shitty band.

1136
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,790
No way, pal.

1137
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,793
I used to want to do this
for a living. Comedy?

1138
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,921
Oh, yes. But, turns out,

1139
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,340
my ex-wife is the one
who had the talent for comedy.

1140
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,511
Ah, you know her.
Yes. She is very funny.

1141
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,346
First time I saw her onstage,

1142
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,491
she spent ten minutes
talking about my jockey shorts.

1143
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,160
That's ten minutes more
than she ever

1144
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,686
spent washing my jockey shorts.

1145
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,563
And I will admit, as a man

1146
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,040
it was a little hard
listening to your wife

1147
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,232
talk about you onstage.

1148
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,276
But now that I'm up here,

1149
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,653
I'm thinking turnabout
is fair play.

1150
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:34,737
Right?

1151
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,992
Okay, well...

1152
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,787
My wife has great tits.

1153
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,373
Really stellar. Right, Archie?

1154
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,000
Never seen 'em. Wouldn't know.

1155
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,210
He's shy.
His wife has good tits, too.

1156
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,712
Not like mine, though.

1157
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,214
My wife has
Olympic gold medal tits.

1158
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,050
Who else's wife has great tits?

1159
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,402
All right,
buddy, that's enough!

1160
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,570
Come on,
get off the stage.

1161
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,220
Raise your hand
there, man.

1162
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,097
Your wife's look pretty good.

1163
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,308
Unless that's not
your wife, in which case...

1164
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,643
What are you doing later,
gorgeous?

1165
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,272
Okay, everybody!
The bar is open.

1166
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,024
And next round's on me.

1167
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,527
Seriously, Joel,
get off the stage.

1168
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,363
I'm just joking around.

1169
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,198
Fucking joking.

1170
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,450
Fine. Whatever.

1171
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,452
Hey, how about some tunes?

1172
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,329
He just called us shitty, man.

1173
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,997
Hey, tell us a joke!

1174
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,507
Hey.

1175
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,967
Hey!

1176
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,471
You.

1177
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,556
You did this, didn't you?

1178
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,519
You couldn't just
let us figure it out?

1179
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,896
She still would have been
a fucking doctor.

1180
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,732
How many goddamn times
do I have to say this?!

1181
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,403
Say something! I'm right here!

1182
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,466
Go back upstairs.

1183
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,694
Hey, there you are.
How'd it go with the dentist?

1184
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,880
Mm, yeah. It went great.
Very thorough guy, terrific guy.

1185
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,614
She's a woman.

1186
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,241
Well, the deep voice fooled me.

1187
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,659
You didn't go, did you?

1188
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,661
Nope, I'm cured. Amazing, right?

1189
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,472
I'll deal with it later.
How's the night going?

1190
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,623
- Great.
- Oops. What happened?

1191
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,333
I'm so rusty, Susie.

1192
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,085
Last set, I was grasping
for a punch line,

1193
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,646
and I rhymed "mittens"
with "tittens."

1194
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,963
What's "tittens"?

1195
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,048
Beats the fuck out of me.
But I said it really loud

1196
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,092
and smiley like it was
supposed to be hilarious.

1197
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,927
It was not hilarious.

1198
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,114
Don't sweat it, this is where
you work out your rustiness.

1199
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,640
Go ahead, suck. We'll get
a drink after, compare notes.

1200
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,476
Okay.

1201
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,616
Hey, can I get some ice?

1202
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,243
- For what?
- You want to read my diary, too?

1203
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,847
Shit. Is that Gordon Ford?

1204
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,933
- Where?
- There! Follow my hand.

1205
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,267
Yeah, that's him.

1206
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,870
Boy, he's much better
looking in person.

1207
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,687
Fuck. Fuck.

1208
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,773
What do I do? Should I go
tell Midge he's here?

1209
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,775
No. That will fuck
with her head, right?

1210
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,945
Or will it light
a fire under her ass?

1211
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,406
Fuck. I don't know.
Protect her head or her ass?!

1212
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,034
Jesus Christ,
I told her to suck.

1213
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,620
Maybe a little nudge is good.

1214
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,081
Right?
Okay, I got to think like Midge.

1215
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,959
What would she want?
I don't know.

1216
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,503
Shit. Shit. Fuck. Cock.
Why are the lights changing?

1217
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,630
- Am I having a stroke?
- The number's done.

1218
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,590
Oh, it's done.
The universe decided.

1219
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,260
Bring me a Scotch
with a whiskey in it, okay?

1220
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,345
What the fuck are you
standing there for?

1221
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,722
Oh. I just get really
amped up, you know?

1222
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,939
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1223
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,733
It's nice to be here.

1224
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,194
So...

1225
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,780
I am just really full

1226
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,700
from Thanksgiving still.

1227
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,702
Which is not a joke.

1228
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,121
It's more of a disclaimer.

1229
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:58,293
My son, he likes these
weird leftover combinations,

1230
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,295
like, like turkey and gravy

1231
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,630
between two pieces of pecan pie.

1232
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,216
It tastes...

1233
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,343
bad.

1234
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,682
Does anyone know
if it's gonna rain tomorrow?

1235
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,310
Don't say tittens,
don't say tittens.

1236
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,020
Wow, that was
a really bad start.

1237
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,355
I think I'm gonna start again.

1238
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:22,108
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

1239
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,871
Ignore the woman
who was here a minute ago.

1240
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,403
She's gone.

1241
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,697
Like your alibi tonight, sir.

1242
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,325
Your friend fell asleep
at a strip club.

1243
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,493
I'd hate to see what it takes
to keep him awake.

1244
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,040
Hey, you know
what I discovered today?

1245
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,791
You can take
your kids to the airport,

1246
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,586
put them on a plane, and just
fly them somewhere else.

1247
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,131
Technology is amazing.

1248
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,942
It used to be, for that kind
of peace and quiet,

1249
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,736
you had to leave your kids
on the steps of a church.

1250
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,127
And the dangerous thing is not

1251
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,323
that you're sending
your kids off

1252
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,747
with complete strangers
on a vehicle

1253
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,350
that has something
called a cockpit.

1254
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,060
No.

1255
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,038
The really dangerous thing
is that once they're gone,

1256
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:01,731
you have a chance
to remember what life

1257
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,358
was like without them.

1258
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,196
Right? It all comes
flooding back.

1259
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,406
The clean floor.

1260
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,076
The calm apartment.

1261
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,952
Your goddamned waistline.

1262
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,665
Sex.

1263
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,921
Sex where you make it all
the way to the end.

1264
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,756
Or at least your husband does.

1265
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,426
- Ah. Got you, fucker.
- Sex anywhere!

1266
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,011
In any room, on any appliance.

1267
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,262
Well, almost any appliance.

1268
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,431
I'd steer clear
of the cake mixer.

1269
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,392
No more turning
the volume on the news up

1270
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,286
so when your kid asks
what those loud sounds were,

1271
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,288
you can say "Khrushchev
was banging his shoe again."

1272
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,649
I am going to admit to you
that, as scary as a threat

1273
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,943
of a Soviet takeover is,
a small part of me is thinking,

1274
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,404
"Well, that'll cover blow job
Fridays for a while."

1275
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,491
All right, my time is up.

1276
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,827
I'm wanted in hell.

1277
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,746
Please return your friend
to the upright position.

1278
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,249
You have been a kind
and forgiving audience.

1279
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,875
Don't forget
to tip your waitress.

1280
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:04,799
She's saving up to send
her kids to Pittsburgh.

1281
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,504
I'm Mrs. Maisel. Thank you

1282
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,214
and good night.

1283
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:21,602
- Again with the arm.
- Get Midge.

1284
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,105
- I'm working.
- Quick, hurry, go.

1285
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,524
Did you just tip me?
Holy shit.

1286
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:37,326
Excuse me, excuse me, pardon me.

1287
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,163
Excuse me, excuse me.

1288
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,665
Excuse me?

1289
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,250
Mr. Ford?

1290
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,626
Oh, there you are.

1291
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,878
I'm, uh, Susie Myerson.

1292
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,254
Of Susie Myerson and Associates.

1293
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,590
Okay. Well, hello,
Susie Myerson.

1294
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,717
How'd you like the show?

1295
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,302
Uh, I didn't see much of it.

1296
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,345
Oh, you saw my comic.
I saw you watching my comic.

1297
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,698
You were watching me
watch the show?

1298
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,782
I didn't even take my top off.

1299
00:50:58,806 --> 00:50:59,891
What'd you think? Honestly.

1300
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,601
- Your girl's funny.
- She is.

1301
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,121
And kind of a looker, hmm? Good
package for TV, don't you think?

1302
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,688
- Well...
- Why don't you

1303
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,692
put her on your show?
I think she'd be a big hit.

1304
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:08,732
She's not right for my show.

1305
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:09,735
Why not? Too funny?

1306
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,194
Too downtown.

1307
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,946
I'm playing to the cornfields.
But, yeah, she is good.

1308
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,364
She can do cornfields.

1309
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,575
Sorry. But good luck.

1310
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,785
Okay.

1311
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,126
Put her on your staff.

1312
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,045
- What?
- Your writing staff.

1313
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,922
I know you don't have
any female writers.

1314
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,090
You sell soap.
You know who buys soap?

1315
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,426
- Laundromats?
- She can help you with those jokes.

1316
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,654
How do you know I don't have
any women on my writing staff?

1317
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,639
- Just a hunch.
- Well, my wife has been saying

1318
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,366
that the show could use
a woman's perspective.

1319
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,870
Sounds like your wife is
a smart lady.

1320
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,977
- Smarter than I am.
- Susie.

1321
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,063
Aha, here she is.
Miriam Maisel,

1322
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,439
I'd like you
to meet Gordon Ford.

1323
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,149
Gordon Ford, Miriam Maisel.

1324
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,568
Nice to meet you.
You're a very funny lady.

1325
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,654
Well, thank you.
I'm a big fan of your show.

1326
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,381
- And you, by extension.
- Want to come write for me?

1327
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,698
I'm sorry?

1328
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,116
Susie Myerson
and Associates here

1329
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,240
has been talking you up.
Says you could be my woman.

1330
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,495
Writers' room-wise.

1331
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,705
Oh, no.
I-I'm not a writer.

1332
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,040
- Sidebar.
- What?

1333
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,750
Sidebar, sidebar, sidebar.

1334
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,169
- What's at the sidebar?
- Do you trust me?

1335
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,712
Yes.

1336
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,422
Take this job.

1337
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:15,400
- I don't want to be a writer.
- Of course not. No one wants

1338
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,152
to be a writer, but this job
gets you in the building.

1339
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,404
And once you're in the building,
you will get in his face,

1340
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,490
and you will make him fucking
laugh every time you see him.

1341
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,391
And finally he will see you
for what you are,

1342
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,226
a goddamn star.

1343
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,811
This is it.

1344
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,396
This is the break.

1345
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,565
You in?

1346
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,028
I'm in.

1347
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,115
Gordon?

1348
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,358
we accept your offer and
we are super excited about it.

1349
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,161
Okay. We'll start her Monday.

1350
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,247
