1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,281
Good morning, sweetheart.

2
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,929
Good night. I love you.

3
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,721
Good morning, sweetheart.

4
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,049
Good night. I love you.

5
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,209
Good night. I love you.

6
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,006
Mary?

7
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,729
Mary, please look at me.

8
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,085
I don't get...

9
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,041
I can't understand
why you came back and went away again.

10
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,445
Why would you?

11
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,846
I'm doing it all exactly
the same way it was that day.

12
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,289
The same song, the same places,
the church, the supermarket,

13
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,091
the same fruit in your shake,
the same burrito,

14
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,930
but it isn't working.

15
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,570
I know it was this place.

16
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,929
It was the first night we were here
and I know it was this place

17
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,286
because you woke up, Mary.

18
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,725
We spoke.

19
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,285
And we laughed.

20
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,726
And we...

21
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,246
For three hours you were awake,

22
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,448
and I don't know why
you went back to sleep.

23
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,165
Is it a test?

24
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,890
Can you look at me?

25
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,328
Just give a small sign that you're here?

26
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,731
Oh, this isn't fair.

27
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,369
You can't give that to me
and take it away again.

28
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,851
So you...

29
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,925
You need to look at me now, Mary, okay?

30
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,130
Look at me.

31
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,891
Look at me!

32
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,483
<i>Please pull over
to the waiting area.</i>

33
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,244
<i>Visitors coming through.</i>

34
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,289
<i>We'll let you all through in five minutes.</i>

35
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,726
<i>Please pull over to the waiting</i> area.

36
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,921
Excuse me, sir.

37
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,923
My wife has an appointment. We need to--

38
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,082
We'll let you go as soon as we can, sir.

39
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,366
<i>Let's</i> go!

40
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,171
<i>Please pull over.
Visitors coming through.</i>

41
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,801
<i>Please pull over. Visitors coming through.</i>

42
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,122
Think they could invest
in a bigger bridge, huh?

43
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,487
<i>- Come on in.
- Visitors coming through.</i>

44
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,967
That's true, Matt,

45
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,885
but then the town
would lose its authenticity.

46
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,005
- What's happening?
- Get back in your car, sir.

47
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,527
- Can I--
- We have runners. We have runners.

48
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,724
Go, baby, go!

49
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,241
Hey!

50
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,006
<i>TECH". Any allergies?</i>

51
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,522
No allergies, but she has
an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

52
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,690
<i>TECH". And the reason for the scan?</i>

53
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,890
I was hoping to find out if there's been
any improvement in brain function.

54
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,804
Anything in her behavior
to suggest a change?

55
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,204
I'd just like to compare her results
to her last scan, please.

56
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,086
You can send them
to our doctor in New York.

57
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,571
You got it.

58
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,811
Can you tell me how much the co-pay is?

59
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,405
You'd have to talk to billing.

60
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,330
Will she feel it?

61
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,490
I don't know.

62
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,410
Sir, personnel only once the scan starts.

63
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,006
Someone will come get you
when she's through.

64
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,725
Yeah, okay.

65
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,521
Oh, oh!

66
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,805
Shit! Shit!

67
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,001
Fuck!

68
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,846
Mr. Jamison!

69
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,524
Would you mind coming back inside?

70
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,967
- Why?
- We'd like to discuss the results.

71
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,963
I told you to send
the results to our doctor.

72
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm not paying for any more--

73
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,289
There's no charge, sir.

74
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,761
But if you could please
just come on back in.

75
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,490
<i>It's important.</i>

76
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,890
Mr. Jamison.

77
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,769
Charlie Simpson. How are y'all today?

78
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,410
I'm good, thanks.

79
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,370
Sorry, are you a doctor?

80
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,164
Uh, no, sir, lam not.

81
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,928
If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this
and signing it, y'all can be on your way.

82
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,968
Waiver of liability? I don't...

83
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,764
Sorry, I don't...

84
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,969
They said this was about Mary's results.

85
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,367
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, sir, there is.

86
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,211
You failed to disclose
your wife's condition.

87
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,321
If you had, we would have
never administered the contrast dye.

88
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,245
I told you about her condition.

89
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,561
I answered all the nurse's questions.

90
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,206
You told us she was
in a persistent vegetative state.

91
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,966
You did not tell us that she was pregnant.

92
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,728
Our blood draw showed
HCG levels well over 1,000.

93
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,688
We couldn't have children.

94
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,969
I never thought...

95
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,045
You're pregnant?

96
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,245
Well, congratulations.

97
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,368
Now if you'll please
just sign the release.

98
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,051
What is this?

99
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,523
It indemnifies the imaging center

100
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,081
<i>in the event that the pregnancy
is no longer viable.</i>

101
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,930
Why wouldn't it be viable?

102
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,448
<i>Because your wife is a 40-year-old woman
in what amounts to a coma.</i>

103
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,446
You're looking at close to a 90% chance
of her miscarrying.

104
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,287
<i>That's why we ask for consent
before we administer an MRI.</i>

105
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,250
<i>But our tech did not ask
for it in this case, sir,</i>

106
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,802
<i>because your wife
is not capable of giving consent.</i>

107
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,402
And if she's not capable
of giving her consent for a test,

108
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,331
she cannot give her consent for anything.

109
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,570
<i>You take my meaning?</i>

110
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,886
No.

111
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,765
She was awake.

112
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,408
She was awake when we...

113
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,645
I would never do that.

114
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,964
Of course you wouldn't.

115
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,322
Just like you wouldn't want to
have to say that under oath

116
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,364
if you didn't have to.

117
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,569
Now please sign the release.

118
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,489
I want my co-pay back.

119
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,801
I knew <i>it!</i>

120
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,486
Ten years we tried. Ten years and nothing.

121
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,648
And in one night... One night!

122
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,770
It's that place.

123
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,323
That's why you woke up, isn't it?

124
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,329
So this could happen.

125
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,128
Don't you worry about that 90% business.

126
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,568
Once we're back across that bridge,
you'll be fine.

127
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,521
You and the baby.

128
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,564
You and the baby.

129
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,205
Oh, poor guy-

130
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,203
Hey there. You okay?

131
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,486
<i>I've been better.</i>

132
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,889
Anything I can do to help?

133
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,646
Yeah. Just conked out on me.

134
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,121
I think it might be the radiator.

135
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah. I tried to call for a tow,
but there's no reception out here.

136
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,244
Well, let me try.

137
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,324
Dropped it in the toilet.

138
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,766
Ah, I've lost two that way.

139
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,208
Well, we're just
a couple of miles out of town.

140
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,124
I can give you a ride.

141
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,884
Is that your wristband?

142
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,167
You live there? In Miracle?

143
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,401
Yes.

144
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,324
Me and my wife, Mary.

145
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,561
She okay?

146
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,845
Getting better all the time.

147
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,601
Oh, hey.

148
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,684
What's your name?

149
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,246
Is that your son?

150
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,531
I'm sorry.

151
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,528
We, we have to get in.

152
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,364
<i>Get his wristband, son.</i>

153
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,804
<i>Careful, don't rip it.</i>

154
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,204
<i>I can't get it off.</i>

155
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,090
Stand over here, God damn it.

156
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,610
We have to get in.

157
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,281
All right, come on. Door, get in.

158
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,361
<i>Matt.</i>

159
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,324
Matt, we have to hurry.

160
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,485
You have to get us back in.

161
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,406
Mary?

162
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,329
He won't last out here.

163
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,687
I'm gonna lose the baby, Matt.

164
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,566
<i>Please, honey.</i>

165
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,846
Get us back in.

166
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,921
I will.

167
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,201
Mary?

168
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,884
It's okay, honey.

169
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,165
I heard you.

170
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,889
We'll go right now.

171
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,241
No.

172
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,846
No!

173
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,767
Hey!

174
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,841
Hey!

175
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,491
Hey!

176
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,731
God damn it!

177
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,606
Hey!

178
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,766
Don't worry, sweetheart. I heard you.

179
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,969
We're almost home. Almost home.

180
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,167
Hey!

181
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,611
Friend.

182
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,930
Where are you coming in from?

183
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,129
Shit, are you hurt?

184
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,764
Do you want to get in?

185
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,604
I know all the ways.

186
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,564
Back door, my friend.

187
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,606
- How much money you got?
- We live here.

188
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,961
Oh...

189
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,450
Well, a thousand pardons, sir.

190
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,965
Almost home, sweetheart.

191
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,200
"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,

192
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,408
"safe out of fortune's shot."

193
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,689
Hello. Excuse me.

194
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,524
This access is for park personnel only.

195
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,766
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to return to camp.

196
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,049
We live in the park.
We were attacked, me and my wife.

197
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,168
A man and his son, they were in a red car.

198
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,362
Would you like to report this
to the local sheriff's office, sir?

199
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,806
I'd like to report it to you.

200
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,327
Sorry, but we got no jurisdiction
if you're not in the park.

201
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,802
We live in the park. Please just let us in
so I can get my wife home.

202
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,048
- The longer she's--
- I cannot let you cross

203
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,931
without a valid ID, reservation,
or a wristband.

204
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,128
They stole our wristbands.

205
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,328
We live on Scarborough Street.

206
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,529
I work at the Sacred Mission
with Reverend Massey.

207
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,690
We shop at the Safeway on Amarillo.

208
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,606
We attend the Jarden community pool
every Sunday and Wednesday.

209
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,209
My sister just moved here,
but I haven't memorized her number

210
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,562
and my phone fell in a toilet.

211
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,166
Please.

212
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,211
We live here.

213
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,605
Y'all need to go to the visitors' center,

214
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,491
get yourselves
some replacement bands, okay?

215
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,005
Yes, sir.

216
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,045
Yeah, thank you.

217
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,921
- God bless you.
- He does every day.

218
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,603
<i>The visitor wristband
is your ticket into Miracle.</i>

219
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,762
<i>Visitors must wear their wristband
at all times.</i>

220
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,922
Spell your name again for me.

221
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,004
J-A-M-I-S-O-N.

222
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,362
Is this gonna take much longer?
We got a wedding in town.

223
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,806
You said it was a sanctuary pass?

224
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,487
Yes, Reverend Massey sponsored us,
of Sacred Mission.

225
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,244
My sister just moved here.

226
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,211
Um, could she sponsor us?

227
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,407
What's her name?

228
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,607
- Nora Durst.
- Durst.

229
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,326
Excuse me. Can you help us?

230
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,642
Could you just wait a minute?

231
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,961
May I?

232
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,125
- Hello?
- Kevin?

233
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,284
Oh, thank God. Um, Mary and I...

234
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,650
They won't let us back into town.

235
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,611
We're at the visitors' center.

236
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,808
- Our wristbands were stolen--
- Jesus Christ, man.

237
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,883
- Step aside.
- And now they won't give us any new ones.

238
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,281
- I'm on the phone.
- I don't care.

239
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,569
Sir, unless they've been here
for six months, I can't help you.

240
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,167
Now, you hear that? She can't help you.
Now step aside, man.

241
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,243
Please, will you mind your own business?

242
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,765
No, I did my business.

243
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,406
I've got my documents and you don't.

244
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,210
So why don't you just
roll her on out of here

245
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,647
'cause she doesn't look like
she's in a rush to get anywhere.

246
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,163
- You've got your documents?
- That's right.

247
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,243
- You've got your documents.
- Yes.

248
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,925
Let's see them, huh?

249
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,766
<i>Welcome to Miracle National Park...</i>

250
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,245
She pretending?

251
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,207
No, she's not pretending.

252
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,486
He will die.

253
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,526
What?

254
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,644
She says if you don't get her back inside,
he will die.

255
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,440
Who?

256
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,244
<i>RANGER". Matt and Mary Jamison.</i>

257
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,404
Jesus, Matt. Are you okay?

258
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,686
Yeah.

259
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,001
Thank you.

260
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,525
You zip-tied him?

261
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,047
Man got a busted hand.
Works at the church.

262
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,287
What, you scared
he gonna baptize you or something?

263
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,965
Give me the clippers.

264
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,042
This is John.
He's gonna help you and Mary.

265
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,486
Yes, we met.

266
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,961
Mmm-hmm.

267
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,206
Thank you.

268
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,366
You're welcome.

269
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,166
You should get it looked at
in case it needs to be set.

270
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,648
Erika will take care of him
once we get back into town.

271
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,690
My wife's a doctor.

272
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,683
I'll be fine. Thank you.

273
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,722
I'm sorry about your daughter.

274
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,928
I've been handing out
fliers at the church.

275
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,091
Appreciate it.

276
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,484
Try to keep it elevated.

277
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,130
I always do.

278
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,124
I wish I could say this never happens,
but every man for himself out there.

279
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,531
<i>It can get rough.</i>

280
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,004
What were y'all doing in Austin?

281
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,130
Just getting a test, a scan for Mary.

282
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,080
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

283
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,487
We do it every six months or so

284
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,247
to see if there's been
any change in her condition.

285
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,402
- Was there?
- Sorry?

286
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,609
Any change in her condition.

287
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,450
No.

288
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,691
Except for the pregnant part.

289
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,005
The what?

290
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,810
You... You went through Mary's bag?

291
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,647
It fell out.
One of the rangers picked it up.

292
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,690
- Matt, what's he talking about?
- Please, this is very complicated.

293
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,330
<i>JOHN". It is complicated.</i>

294
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,842
Yes, and we, you know...
They said the pregnancy is high risk,

295
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,570
so the longer we're out here...

296
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,007
I need to get Mary back into town now.

297
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,366
<i>Why?</i>

298
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,086
What?

299
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,083
Why do you need to get
Mary back into town now?

300
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,811
John, he's been attacked.

301
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,766
Yes, and I'm trying to help,
but I'm not getting the whole story.

302
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,085
Did she wake up?

303
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,563
You brought her here,
all the way to Miracle, Texas,

304
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,686
and she woke up, right?

305
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,764
And while she was awake, you made love.

306
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,411
And then, shit,
she went right back to this.

307
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,402
That the story you gonna tell?

308
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,244
The only story you can tell?

309
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,730
<i>'Cause it's not true.</i>

310
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,048
Because that doesn't happen here.

311
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,964
People don't get healed.

312
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,927
My wife lost her hearing a long time ago,
and it's still lost.

313
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,248
So, what, God likes your wife
better than mine?

314
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,245
Your friend Kevin here
asked me to help you out.

315
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,522
I owe him, so I will.

316
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,885
But you got to tell me the truth.

317
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,125
The truth?

318
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,811
In about five months,
when your wife starts to show,

319
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,207
and everybody knows she's pregnant,

320
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,681
you need to say that you were sad

321
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,330
and lonely and confused.

322
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,441
<i>And that you are very sorry
for what you did</i>

323
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,085
because you knew it was wrong.

324
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,323
- Jesus, John--
- That's the truth.

325
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,726
<i>Right?</i>

326
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,561
Yes.

327
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,290
She never woke up.

328
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,845
She never woke up.

329
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,881
Okay.

330
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,571
Well, let's get you home.

331
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,931
What happened to you?

332
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,971
Excuse me?

333
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,965
I know your daughter is missing
and that's terrible, I'm sorry,

334
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,680
but you were like this before that.

335
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,527
You're angry at this place.

336
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,525
What happened to you?

337
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,971
You know what?

338
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,801
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to get those wristbands after all.

339
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,566
<i>- Hey, come on. Hey, John. Hey!

340
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,241
What the fuck was that, Matt?

341
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,965
How much money do you have?

342
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,526
- What?
- I'm gonna need money.

343
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,051
<i>How much do you have?</i>

344
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,321
Me and Nora
are gonna talk to the officers.

345
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,767
- Now, Kevin. I need to get her back now.
- Okay, okay.

346
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,285
I got that. Thank you.

347
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,090
<i>- Get her on the bridge.</i>
- I've <i>got</i> her.

348
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,527
<i>- Coming through.
- We'll be fine, Kevin.</i>

349
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,044
I'll get us back in.

350
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,765
You'll be fine.

351
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,890
You and the baby.

352
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,966
Excuse me, um...

353
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,645
Excuse me.

354
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,569
Excuse me, um, ladies.

355
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,402
I'm looking for a tall man
with a samurai bun.

356
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,086
Excuse me, gentlemen, um...

357
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,811
Look at him.

358
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,964
<i>You beat that little grubworm
of yours?</i>

359
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,811
- Hey, what you looking at?
- Suck on that!

360
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,321
<i>Punk!</i>

361
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,650
<i>You want to free him?</i>

362
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,161
What?

363
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,404
Do you want to free him?

364
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,241
<i>Look over here!</i>

365
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,004
Yes, of course.

366
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,564
Then take his place.

367
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,882
Yeah! Go!

368
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,281
- Get up there.
- Yeah!

369
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Yeah, I didn't think so.

370
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,451
<i>Yeah, get up there.</i>

371
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,766
Hey!

372
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,080
Y'all okay?

373
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,051
Yes, thanks.

374
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,041
I'm looking for a tall man
with a samurai bun on his head.

375
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,647
Swedish guy?

376
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,245
Yes, I think so.

377
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,528
Name's Elmer or something.

378
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,723
Trailer, big green stripe.

379
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,809
- Thank you, sir.
- Yep.

380
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,046
Elmer?

381
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,446
Elmer?

382
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,127
Elmer?

383
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,965
- Not Elmer, Almer.
- What?

384
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,408
Almer. Fucking Almer!

385
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,691
I need your help to get in.

386
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,841
Hey-

387
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,485
Friend, how much money you got?

388
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,366
How much does it cost for me and my wife?

389
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,651
Can she get out of the chair?

390
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,201
No.

391
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,441
Uh...

392
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,760
$1,000.

393
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,206
Okay, I have about just over 400 here.

394
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,171
- I'll get you the rest when we're in town.
- Come on, friend.

395
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,800
You want fair deal, $1,000.

396
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,691
No, I live there.
I can pay you back, I promise.

397
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,128
Friend, I'm not going anywhere.
Come find me when you have the money.

398
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,044
No, it has to be now. We have to go now.

399
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,804
My wife is pregnant.

400
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,611
- She needs care.
- She's pregnant?

401
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,051
Can you help me? Almer, please.

402
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,442
Yes.

403
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,085
For $1,000.

404
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,360
It's all right.

405
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,050
It's all right.

406
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,725
I'll find a way.

407
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,684
He'll show us a way.

408
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,280
Please.

409
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,605
<i>MATT". Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

410
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,409
<i>Is this your cross?</i>

411
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,401
Yes, sir.

412
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,725
I'm Reverend Matthew Jamison.
This is my wife, Mary.

413
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,806
Sandy.

414
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,448
Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you.

415
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,125
May I have a moment of your time?

416
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,926
I have a friend I met
doing some missionary work years ago.

417
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,084
He preaches at a small church
across the bridge there.

418
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,290
And he's been trying for years
to get me to come out and visit him,

419
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,447
so I decided to take my friend up
on his offer and come here to Jarden.

420
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,329
The plan was to stay for about a week.

421
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,643
We've been here for three months now.

422
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,801
How?

423
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,090
Um, religious exemption.

424
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,128
They gave Mary and I wristbands
that said "Sanctuary" on them.

425
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,640
This morning, a man attacked us
and took those wristbands.

426
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,371
<i>And now they will not let us back in.</i>

427
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,807
Sandy, I'm asking for your help.

428
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,043
I'm calling upon your sense
of community and charity.

429
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,163
Mary and I need some money so that I can--

430
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,651
How much?

431
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,281
$500.

432
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,643
I know that's an extraordinary
amount of money,

433
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,644
but I give you my word as a Christian,
I will pay you back.

434
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,211
What denomination?

435
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,406
20s. It's whatever you can--

436
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,642
No, no, you're a reverend.
What denomination?

437
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,489
Episcopalian.
- Why?

438
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,526
My father was a reverend,
I was raised in the faith,

439
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,604
but I welcome all beliefs into my church.

440
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,491
Where'd you go to seminary?

441
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,371
Berkeley Divinity.

442
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,284
<i>- Where's that?
- Connecticut.</i>

443
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,084
What's your favorite book?

444
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,002
Of the Bible. You got a favorite book?

445
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,286
Job.

446
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,846
What's his wife's name?

447
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,884
She isn't named.

448
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,162
And she speaks only once.

449
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,601
"Does thou still retain thine integrity?
Curse God and die."

450
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,330
Wait right here.

451
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,569
Good thing I didn't say Lutheran.

452
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,530
This is Reggie.

453
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,201
Hello.

454
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,641
I'm Matt Jamison. This is my wife, Mary.

455
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,121
- You'll do it?
- I haven't asked him yet.

456
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,366
Do what?

457
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,370
You want $500?

458
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,085
- Yes.
- Okay.

459
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,407
You got to hit him just once,
but as hard as you can, with this.

460
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,731
And he has to say it.

461
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,210
Yeah, when you hit him,
you got to say, "Brian."

462
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
Who's Brian?

463
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,890
What the fuck do you care?

464
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,842
I don't understand
why you want me to do this.

465
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,082
Look, you're a bona fide man of God.

466
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,242
If you do this, it counts.

467
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,648
You're a man of God, right?

468
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,121
Yes.

469
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,011
Well, you want your fucking money or not?

470
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,122
Go on, shoo! You sick fucks. Go on.

471
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,806
- Come on, hit him hard.
- And say "Brian."

472
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
I want my money first.

473
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,843
You get paid when you do your job.
Hit him. Hard.

474
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,482
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Go on.

475
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,086
<i>- Go on, 'mt mm. Come on.
- Hit him!</i>

476
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,011
Hit him! Hit him!

477
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,965
- Hit him like you mean it.
- Hit him!

478
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,365
- Come on, no.
<i>- What?</i>

479
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,841
- No. Hit him hard.
- That's as hard as I can.

480
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,002
- Come on, you're holding back.
- You didn't say it.

481
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,367
- I can't, my thumb.
- You're holding back.

482
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,726
- I did not.
- Bullshit.

483
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,525
- No.
- Why won't he say it?

484
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,045
- Come on, hit him harder.
- What? I hit him.

485
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,282
- No, not hard... Not hard enough.
- We had an agreement.

486
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,408
We had an agreement that
you'd hit as hard as you could.

487
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,722
- He's not gonna do it.
- Honey, you want a shot at it?

488
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,009
I bet you can hit harder.
Want to get out here and swing? Come on.

489
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,690
Go, hard.

490
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,729
Why won't he say it?

491
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,280
He's not gonna do it.

492
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,762
Brian!

493
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,890
Was that hard enough
or do I need another oar?

494
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,009
You are short $60.

495
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,884
Okay, my friend.

496
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,530
We are good to go.

497
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,921
Are you claustrophobic?

498
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,326
Am I what?

499
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,881
How far?

500
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,965
Just a couple minutes.

501
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,090
There's a gate on the other end.

502
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,128
Sometimes they lock with chain.

503
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,166
Here.

504
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,610
You're not coming?

505
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,363
You pay for me to show you,
not to hold your hand, friend.

506
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,251
Come find me
when they throw you out again.

507
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,042
What do you think, Mary?

508
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,242
Lighten our darkness,
we beseech thee, O Lord,

509
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,129
and by thy great mercy

510
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,007
defend us from all perils
and dangers of this night.

511
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,766
For the love of thy only son,
our savior, Jesus Christ.

512
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,047
<i>Amen.</i>

513
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,967
<i>Well, at least we're out of the rain.</i>

514
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,125
<i>All that money for pointing us to a drain
and a pair of bolt cutters.</i>

515
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,927
<i>I could... I need to...</i>

516
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,085
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

517
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,011
I got it.

518
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,966
<i>Yes!</i>

519
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,643
<i>Oh, don't worry, Mary. I've cut it.</i>

520
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,450
<i>I just had</i> to...

521
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,841
<i>Yes!</i>

522
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,405
<i>God!</i>

523
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,208
No, no, no!

524
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,088
<i>No!</i>

525
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,361
MEW-

526
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,446
You're okay.

527
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,162
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

528
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

529
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,489
We'll leave when it stops raining.

531
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,210
Get the fuck out!

532
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,001
<i>Now!</i>

533
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,649
<i>Matt!</i>

534
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,444
<i>Matt Jamison!</i>

535
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,724
<i>Matt Jamison!</i>

536
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,451
Matt!

537
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,686
Nora?

538
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,166
Hey.

539
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,604
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,728
- Where's her chair?
- We lost it.

541
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,921
Thanks for coming.

542
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,650
We pushed out the back seat
a little for air.

543
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,484
- Get in.
- They're searching trunks.

544
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,483
They won't search ours.

545
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,966
What's happening?

546
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,283
There was an anonymous tip
that those missing girls

547
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,044
were spotted out here in the encampment.

548
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,851
<i>You'?</i>

549
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,849
It was anonymous, Matt.
Now get in the trunk.

550
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,086
There.

551
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,970
<i>- You good'?
- Let them through. Here comes the truck.</i>

552
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,491
All right, let's go. Forget it.

553
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,881
<i>Move it.</i>

554
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,248
Remember that train in Frankfurt?

555
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,007
You and me crammed
into a single sleeper berth.

556
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,926
I had to hold you
so you wouldn't fall out.

557
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,684
You thought it was romantic.

558
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,644
"Do Yeats," you said.

559
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,244
And I said, "I only did Yeats
to get you to fall in love with me.

560
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,925
"I don't need poetry anymore."

561
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,890
And you said, "You still need it."

562
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,924
<i>"Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,</i>

563
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,011
<i>"I will find out where she has gone</i>

564
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,287
<i>"And kiss her lips and take her hands</i>

565
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,971
<i>"And walk among long, dappled grass</i>

566
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,166
<i>"And pluck till time and times are done</i>

567
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:59,126
<i>"The silver apples of the moon
The golden apples of the sun"</i>

568
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,883
Sir?

569
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,605
There's an accident.

570
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,966
Goddamn goats.

571
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,926
He's dead.

572
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,809
We have to go. Help me.

573
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,326
It's mine.

574
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,210
What are you doing?

575
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,965
Will you take care of her?

576
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,161
What are you talking about?

577
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,563
- We have to get back in the car.
- I shouldn't have to hide, Nora.

578
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,929
Will you take care of her
just for a little while?

579
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,042
God damn it, Matt. Seriously?

580
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,606
Please?

581
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,761
What's going on?

582
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,850
Where are you gonna be?

583
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,441
Not far.

584
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,448
I love you. Good night.

585
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,600
<i>What happened?</i>

586
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,689
<i>He's not coming with us.
Get in the car.</i>

587
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,809
Who the fuck is that?

588
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,122
My wife woke up
the first night we arrived in your town.

589
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,648
It's the only time in over three years
she's talked to me.

590
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,207
And there may be no way to prove it,
but it happened,

591
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,328
and I will never say it didn't.

592
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,722
I don't want your wristband.

593
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,527
Mary found hers,
so she's back where she belongs,

594
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,047
and I have no doubt
that she'll wake up again soon.

595
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,370
And when she does, I'm going to come back
and you and I will have a talk.

596
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,970
This boy needs help.

597
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,724
His father's dead.

598
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,801
Okay.

599
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,291
Okay what?

600
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,484
I want to free him.

601
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,527
Why?

602
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,810
'Cause it's my turn.

603
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,721
