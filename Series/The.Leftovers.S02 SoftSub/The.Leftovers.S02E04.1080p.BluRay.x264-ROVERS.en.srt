1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,921
Kevin?

2
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,451
Kevin?

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,806
Hey. Hey.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,361
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,285
Shh. It's okay. Okay, let's go see.

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,489
Hey. Hey. Oh, my God.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,961
- Hey. What's happening?
- Nothing. It's okay.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,090
<i>Go back to sleep, sweetheart. It's okay.</i>

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,726
Kevin?

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,246
Kevin?

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,326
Ah, fuck.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,571
- She's still not answering.
- Wait. Get in the truck.

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,605
<i>Hi, this is Kevin Garvey. Leave a message.</i>

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,330
Kevin, where are you? Your truck is here.

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,124
You need to call me.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,721
I don't know where you are.
You need to call me.

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,006
Are you okay?

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,890
Evie didn't come home last night.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,527
She was out with her friends
and they're gone, too.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,521
Gone?

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,041
No.

22
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

23
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,451
No fucking cable.

24
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,647
Fuck.

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,284
Okay.

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,131
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,327
Did...

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,606
Did it happen again?

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,086
Ma 'am, can you repeat--

30
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,727
I can't find my...
Uh, my boyfriend isn't here.

31
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,245
Did it... Did it happen?

32
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,606
Ma <i>'am, if you've experienced
the earthquake--</i>

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,964
No, no, not the fucking earthquake!

34
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,527
Not the fucking earthquake!
Did it... Did...

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,610
Are the people gone? Are they gone?

36
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,921
Looks like you have
some explaining to do, sport.

37
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,368
Hey, did you see my phone?

38
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,525
I had cigarettes in here.

39
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,247
Maybe you smoked 'em
while you were out sleepwalking.

40
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,211
Where'd you go?

41
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,842
I woke up in a drained pond.

42
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,804
<i>When I crawled out,
there was a car parked up on top.</i>

43
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,170
<i>A white Mercedes. It was empty.</i>

44
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,686
Then I saw another car coming.
And it was John, the neighbor.

45
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,565
His son was with him.

46
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,408
I think my phone is probably up there.

47
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,361
They're gonna find it.

48
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
I think I should tell the cops.

49
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,126
Tell them what?

50
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,290
You're gonna say
you don't remember anything

51
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,045
before you woke up in the exact spot

52
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,487
where our neighbor's daughter
and her two friends disappeared from?

53
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,885
Wait, Evie's missing?

54
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,605
This your truck parked out front?

55
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,001
Yeah.

56
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,243
Putting together
a search and rescue out the woods.

57
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,564
Gonna need to rig some winches.
Think you can help us out?

58
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,606
Yeah, sure.

59
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,491
Just follow me over here.

60
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,371
- Yes, I'll unhook my trailer over here.
- All right.

61
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,646
- Need help?
- No, I'm good.

62
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,847
Okay.

63
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,767
This area <i>is</i> restricted.

64
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,763
<i>We need you to stay behind the line.</i>

65
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,004
Come in. Go, go.

66
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,084
- Stay <i>behind the tape, please.
- Hold on.</i>

67
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,609
<i>Do not park your vehicle here.</i>

68
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,011
<i>There's a table up the road
for volunteers.</i>

69
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,281
Jesus.

70
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,130
You woke up down there?

71
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,369
Yeah. I came up that embankment.

72
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,965
That's when I saw the car.

73
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,891
You should get down there.

74
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,611
If someone else finds your phone,
you can say you just lost it today.

75
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,809
That's pretty fucking smart.

76
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,201
Thanks.

77
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,163
You might want to start at the car
and work your way back down.

78
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,081
- Where are you going?
- To find the girls.

79
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,887
<i>Hey. Can I help you?</i>

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,763
Oh, I'm part of the rescue.
I brought the winch in.

81
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,570
- Wristband.
- Sorry?

82
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,961
I need to scan your wristband.

83
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,009
Oh, yeah. Of course.

84
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,650
We had to close the park down.

85
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,211
Make sure everyone belongs here.

86
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,007
It says temporary,
but we just bought a house, so...

87
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,003
They told us to keep wearing it.

88
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,208
You bought a house? Where?

89
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,361
Um...

90
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,361
Uh, Stanton.

91
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,089
You have an address?

92
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,204
It's 41, I think.

93
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,967
- You think?
- Yeah.

94
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,408
Vega, that's my neighbor.

95
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,724
<i>Oh, yeah, sure, John.</i>

96
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,041
Want to give us a hand?

97
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,487
Yeah.

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,927
Take that.

99
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,251
<i>Thanks for coming out.</i>

100
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,568
<i>We appreciate you helping us with this.</i>

101
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,090
You see anything that don't belong,
don't touch it.

102
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,322
Leave a ribbon, find one of us.

103
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,961
Let's go.

104
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,922
God be in my head,
and in my understanding.

105
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,926
God be in mine eyes, and in my looking.

106
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,921
God be at mine end, and at my departing.

107
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,324
We are the 9,261. We are spared.

108
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,286
We are the 9,261.

109
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,686
We are spared.

110
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,569
<i>For that, we are grateful.</i>

111
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,929
- Amen.
- Amen.

112
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,404
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

113
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,644
hallowed be Thy name.

114
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,290
Oh, shit. Okay. Whoa.

115
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,007
Hi.

116
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,727
Hi.

117
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,166
I heard about your sister.

118
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,445
My dad and Nora went to go help, you know,
look for her.

119
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,006
Thanks.

120
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,966
Why are you wet?

121
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,969
Do you know how to fix a sink?

122
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,521
That's it.

123
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,169
- I got it?
- Yeah.

124
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,166
You got it.

125
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,851
Sorry I bothered you.
Didn't know what else to do.

126
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,446
It's okay.

127
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,081
What?

128
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,682
Why aren't you with them looking for her?

129
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,451
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.
You don't have to answer that.

130
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,804
My sister isn't here anymore.

131
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,526
Where is she?

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,640
When I talk about this to people like you,
they just look at me like I'm crazy.

133
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,121
People like me?

134
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,880
Who don't believe in God.

135
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,601
I think
I just made your sister uncomfortable.

136
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,049
You don't make me feel uncomfortable.

137
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I should get back.

138
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,441
Thanks for saving me.

139
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,601
Any time.

140
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,046
Get back!

141
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,441
I'm not telling you again!

142
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>Make room for these people, now.
Come on!</i>

143
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,408
<i>Let's go, let 'em through.
Let 'em through.</i>

144
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,250
- Close it up.
- Hey, step back!

145
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,689
- Nothing down there.
- You sure?

146
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,002
- Certain.
- Thank God.

147
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,644
This is our neighbor Kevin.

148
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,881
- How are you?
- Sam and Loretta.

149
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,321
- Sam.
- Emily.

150
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,204
Their daughters were with Evie.

151
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,171
Oh, I'm sorry.

152
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,650
If there's anything we can do to help--

153
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,923
Hey, they're towing the car up to Austin.

154
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,481
Didn't find anything?

155
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,210
Nothing came up on the black light.

156
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,728
They did pull a palm print
off the driver's side window.

157
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,567
What?

158
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,128
Yeah, the state guy said it was too big
to be one of the girls'.

159
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,921
A palm print?

160
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,051
Stop that! No, stop!

161
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,844
God, these fucking animals.

162
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,480
Okay, we'll get 'em out of here.

163
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,205
No, let them.

164
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,970
It's just water.

165
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,087
Any luck?

166
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,481
No.

167
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,641
If the phone turns up,

168
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,724
I'll just say I dropped it today,
you know, like you said.

169
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,931
So, I should just keep looking?

170
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,685
That's probably a good idea.

171
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,521
Here.

172
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,171
- Are we okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

173
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,283
- Love you.
- I love you, too, Kevin.

174
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,807
Thanks.

175
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,249
- Earthquake?
- Yeah.

176
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,485
What can I do you for?

177
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,964
Can I get a fifth of Wild Turkey
and a carton of Reds, please?

178
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,849
Shit, forgot my wallet.

179
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,520
Put it on my tab.

180
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,641
- You don't have to do that.
- Eh, my pleasure.

181
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,082
Looks like you got a fun night planned.

182
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,009
But you really shouldn't smoke.

183
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,801
They're for my boyfriend.

184
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,769
- I'm enabling him.
- Ah.

185
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,086
Give me your address. I'll pay you back.

186
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,683
No, no, consider it a gift
from me to your boyfriend.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,128
Thank you, sir. I'm Nora.

188
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,369
Virgil. Virgil.

189
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm so sorry for your loss.

190
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,361
What?

191
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,081
Your loss.

192
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,011
What a horrible thing.

193
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,528
<i>God damn it, Virgil,
what did I tell you?</i>

194
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,001
<i>You want to come in here,
you can't do this shit.</i>

195
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Get out.

196
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,885
I'm sorry if I caused any distress.

197
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,767
<i>PATTY. I know exactly
where your phone is.</i>

198
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,967
I can tell you
what happened to those girls, too.

199
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,921
All you have to do is ask.

200
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,604
Smart. Retrace your steps.

201
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,288
You're a regular fucking Hardy Boy.

202
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,130
Dipshits, those two.

203
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,006
Hey, why didn't you tell Nora

204
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,289
about the whole cinder block
tied around your ankle thing?

205
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,448
<i>You afraid she'll jump to conclusions?</i>

206
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,883
I know what conclusion I'd jump to.

207
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,965
<i>You're cold, buddy. Cold, cold, cold.</i>

208
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,724
<i>Cold.</i>

209
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,371
<i>Warm.</i>

210
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,448
Oh, yeah. Getting warmer.

211
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,401
<i>Oh.</i>

212
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,890
Oh, yeah. Warmer.

213
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,289
You're getting real hot now, Kevin.

214
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,041
<i>Oh, you're on goddamn fire.</i>

215
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,682
Don't get in that car, Kevin!

216
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,166
You still here, man?

217
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,684
Yeah, I just...

218
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,366
I lost my phone
when I was out here earlier today.

219
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,326
Find it?

220
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,651
Yeah, I did. It's bricked, so...

221
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,406
I was gonna maybe go
check with the rangers,

222
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,170
see if they needed some help in the woods.

223
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,243
They ain't gonna find
nothing in the woods.

224
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,083
Hop in, I'll give you a ride.

225
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,770
No, Nora was gonna come back,
swing around, pick me up.

226
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,844
Hop in, man. I got you.

227
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,647
All right.

228
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,806
What's that?

229
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,124
Birthday present.

230
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,724
Feel that quake last night?

231
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,642
- What?
- Earthquake.

232
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,646
Did it wake you up?

233
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,643
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that woke us.

234
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,971
Hand me one of those.

235
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,810
- You can help yourself.
- I'm good.

236
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,890
Thought you didn't drink.

237
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,165
My daughter's missing.

238
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,401
Don't... We live back there.

239
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,886
- Patrick.
- John, hey.

240
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,921
- How you holding up?
- Open the gate, please.

241
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,850
The natives in the camp are restless
'cause we closed the park.

242
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,731
- You might want to roll your window up.
- Will do.

243
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,405
We're here for you, man.

244
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,401
These fucking people
wait for weeks to get in for 10 hours

245
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,164
just so they can buy a T-shirt.

246
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,887
I think they're looking
for more than a T-shirt.

247
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,161
Yeah?

248
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,970
Well, what are you looking for?

249
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,811
A fresh start.

250
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,806
No, you paid $3 million for a house
that's cracking apart

251
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,008
just so you could live
on the other side of that bridge.

252
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,448
What you were looking for is to feel safe.

253
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,602
Hey, what's going on in there?

254
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,930
Why won't they let anybody in?

255
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,165
What happened to you guys?

256
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,967
No safer here than anywhere else.

257
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,884
Of that I am sure.

258
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,722
There are no miracles in Miracle.

259
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,965
God damn it.

260
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,926
What's happening?

261
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,681
Stay in the car.

262
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,730
<i>TA". You need to go home now.</i>

263
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,008
No, I told you guys what I need.
Now move your damn truck.

264
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,889
What's he doing here?

265
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,520
<i>I asked you to go with me,
you said no, so he's coming.</i>

266
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,650
<i>- Now move your truck.
- John, listen to me.</i>

267
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,331
Isaac didn't do anything.

268
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,251
There was a palm print on the car
that my daughter was in.

269
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,290
Like it was left for me.
A goddamn palm print.

270
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,606
<i>PATTY. Lucky duck.</i>

271
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,802
<i>We have a problem.
Now I'm going to take care of it.</i>

272
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,686
Looks like you framed someone
without even trying.

273
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,571
<i>- Isaac didn't do anything.
- I don't have time.</i>

274
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,684
- I'm not hearing that.
- Jesus,John.John!

275
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,811
Hold on.

276
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,410
<i>John!</i>

277
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,486
John, don't do this.

278
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,484
Come on, brother, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

279
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,406
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

280
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,607
I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

281
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
- Who?
- A liar.

282
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,210
Said he could tell people their future.

283
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,727
Said something bad was gonna happen to me,
now my daughter's gone.

284
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,245
Why would he have your daughter?

285
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,448
Well, I might have burned down his house.

286
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,045
You coming with me?

287
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,405
Hey, hey! Why'd you bring me here, man?

288
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,642
- What?
- You picked me up.

289
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,802
Why? 'Cause you wanted company?

290
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,485
'Cause your friends said
you weren't thinking straight?

291
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,846
- No.
- Well, you're not.

292
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,611
- Let me talk to this guy.
- No, come on, man. Step aside.

293
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,041
Hang on, hang on.

294
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,602
You think he's gonna let you in the door
with that bat?

295
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,206
I was a cop.

296
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,729
- No shit.
- No shit.

297
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,244
Look, if he knows
anything about your daughter,

298
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,643
or knows anything about these girls,
then I'll fucking know.

299
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,521
We'll take it from there.

300
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,206
What's his name?

301
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,528
- Isaac.
- All right, Isaac.

302
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,566
What room is he in?

303
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,849
- Twelve.
- All right, so I'll go talk to Isaac.

304
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,406
You wait here.

305
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,126
All right.

306
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,281
Wait here.

307
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,965
Gosh, you sure defused that bomb.

308
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
Nice work, Chief.

309
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,290
My husband, Neil... Sorry, my ex-husband

310
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,161
was engaging in
some pretty suspicious texting activity

311
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,047
and then he would leave late at night
to go to the office.

312
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,205
"To the office."
That was the best he could do.

313
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,366
I mean, put some
fucking originality into it, Neil.

314
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,640
So, I followed him
to a motel just like this one.

315
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,006
Sat in the car.

316
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,208
I watched while he walked into the room.

317
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,809
And I considered turning around
and going back home.

318
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,166
I was scared, Kevin.

319
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,085
Scared that when I caught him,
it'd be over.

320
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,486
<i>He would leave me.</i>

321
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,406
<i>But I needed to see,</i>

322
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,321
<i>to know.</i>

323
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,610
So, got out of my car,
walked over to the room and I took a peek.

324
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,643
<i>There was Neil buck naked and some woman.</i>

325
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,207
She had her shirt on. That was it.

326
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,368
She was taking a shit on him, Kevin.

327
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,047
A shit.

328
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,927
<i>I was married to that asshole for 17 years</i>

329
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,445
and never once

330
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,489
did he ask me to shit on him.

331
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,889
Laurie ever tell you about that?

332
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,407
- She was my shrink for a long time.
- Security.

333
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,761
I always wondered whether

334
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,520
that doctor-patient confidentiality thing
was bullshit.

335
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,890
Security! Can you please open your door?

336
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,007
- Is Isaac here?
- Who?

337
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,290
<i>Open this door!</i>

338
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,205
I know you're in there!
You used your credit card!

339
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,361
John!

340
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,371
Open this...

341
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,561
Oh, shit.

342
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,807
Let go of me!

343
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,802
He knows where she is! Where is she?

344
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,969
Enough of this shit, John!

345
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,083
Hey, relax. It's okay.

346
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,850
Relax? Get the fuck out of my room!

347
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,684
You've been shot. You've been shot.

348
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,888
- Where is she?
- Who?

349
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,246
My daughter.

350
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,003
Whatever you're looking for,
it ain't here.

351
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,367
Now get the fuck
out of my room, John Murphy. Go!

352
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,527
Let's do that. Let's go back.

353
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,081
Go.

354
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,046
Let's go.

355
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,491
Let's go. Let's go.

356
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,923
<i>Ain't nothing more dangerous</i>

357
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,646
than a man who don't believe in nothing.

358
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,007
Hey-

359
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,444
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

360
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,324
- No.
- You're shot.

361
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,531
- You need to go see a doctor.
- No hospitals.

362
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,080
You said before you'd do anything to help.

363
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,805
Well, help.

364
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,970
Hey, I'm driving.

365
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,211
<i>JOHN". Hey, babe.</i>

366
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,005
I got shot.

367
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,931
-Hey.
-Hey.

368
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,050
- She asleep?
- Yeah.

369
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,682
I couldn't find the box with the books
in it, so I made up a story.

370
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,650
Did it have a happy ending?

371
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,203
What kind of a sick fuck
do you think I am?

372
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,201
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

373
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,169
Oh, he's still out there looking.

374
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,966
You're 18, right?

375
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,927
Seventeen.

376
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,681
Close enough.

377
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,805
Why do you think he sleepwalks?

378
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,526
I don't know.

379
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,526
Stress?

380
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,564
The town was losing its shit

381
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,087
and he was in charge.

382
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,846
And I guess now,
he needs to lose his shit, too.

383
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,970
He's not in charge anymore.

384
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,806
And we left town.

385
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,920
Wherever you go, there you are.

386
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,243
Young lady, you are wise.

387
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,240
Michael, the boy next door.

388
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,005
He says his sister departed.

389
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,451
She didn't depart.

390
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,240
<i>- How do you know that?</i>
- Because I <i>do.</i>

391
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,761
How?

392
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,606
Before I worked in benefits in the DSD,

393
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,764
they had me
in the fraudulent claims department.

394
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,528
People who said their family members
departed so they could get a check.

395
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,288
My beat was secondary departures.

396
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,926
<i>I got assigned this woman.</i>

397
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,129
She and her husband used to
walk their dog together every morning.

398
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,370
It was about a year
and a half after the 14th.

399
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,642
And as they're walking out the front door,
the phone rings.

400
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,802
So, she goes back inside
and she picks it up.

401
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,408
Talks for like 30 seconds and hangs up.

402
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,961
When she steps back outside,
there's the dog,

403
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,963
leash just lying on the ground,
husband's gone.

404
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,609
So, the logical explanation

405
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,560
is that he went
where 140 million other people went.

406
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,925
Into thin air.

407
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,682
I found that fucker in Puerto Rico.

408
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,281
He was careful.

409
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,485
He made small withdrawals
from their bank account

410
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,648
for six months
so he could build a nest egg,

411
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,371
and then he just chose his moment
and he ran.

412
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,601
Why?

413
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,767
Because he had the greatest scapegoat
in the history of civilization.

414
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,970
The Sudden Departure
was a one-time-only event.

415
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,683
The flood happened
three years ago on October 14th,

416
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,361
and the ark took on
all the animals it needed.

417
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,521
Why in God's name
would it take on any more?

418
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,001
All right.

419
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,404
Easy, easy.

420
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,561
- Lay back. Lay back.
- Easy. Just lie back, lie back.

421
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,762
You're all right.

422
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,566
- What was it?
- .22 through the door.

423
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,888
<i>It's not that deep.
I can see the bullet.</i>

424
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,641
- I think I should just go.
- You're good here.

425
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,603
- What's that?
-It's for the pain.

426
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,650
<i>No, no,
I don't want to be knocked out.</i>

427
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,921
Okay.

428
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,967
Just relax.

429
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,200
That's better.

430
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,444
She knocked me out.

431
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,850
I thought I could find her.

432
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,531
<i>I</i> know. <i>I</i> know.

433
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,690
I gotta go out.
Will you keep an eye on Lily?

434
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,042
Yeah. Where are you going?

435
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,486
Church.

436
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,243
<i>If they asked me,
I'd say lean into it.</i>

437
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,721
That's the sermon they need to hear.

438
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,561
These people haven't been
in this situation.

439
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,564
I offer expertise based on experience.

440
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,050
But they're not gonna ask.

441
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,770
I'll sit there
while Winston goes on about Proverbs

442
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,082
and the congregation's eyes glaze over.

443
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,841
Nora.

444
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,807
Is it real?

445
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,287
What?

446
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,405
Is this place real?

447
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,048
I'm not sure I understand the question.

448
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
<i>One of the only reasons
we chose this place</i>

449
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,730
was because you said it was special.

450
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,570
You told us we would feel safe here.

451
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,446
Now I'm waking up to fucking earthquakes
and missing teenagers.

452
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,322
<i>My boxes aren't even unpacked and
it's the same goddamn thing I left.</i>

453
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,760
Mary woke up.

454
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,166
What?

455
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,322
The very first night we were here.

456
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,610
I thought I was dreaming,
but she was back.

457
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,364
I said we should go to the hospital,

458
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,648
but Mary, she just wanted to talk.

459
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,250
The last thing she remembered
was the accident,

460
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,767
so I told her everything
that happened since.

461
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,926
<i>We talked for hours.</i>

462
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,285
And we cried.

463
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,491
Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.

464
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,167
And when I woke up,
she was like this again.

465
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,921
For some reason, the people in this town
don't want me to talk about what happened.

466
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,924
Maybe they don't believe me.

467
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,040
Maybe you don't.

468
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,691
But I got a glimpse,

469
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,321
a moment.

470
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,730
And every day since, I've wondered
if it's ever gonna happen again.

471
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,201
If I'll get her back for good this time.

472
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,449
But the one thing I've never wondered
is if it's real.

473
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,406
It's real.

474
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,850
You left this at our house.

475
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,286
Thanks.

476
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,801
What are those for?

477
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,249
There's one on our house, too.

478
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,522
Um, before park services took over,

479
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,728
some people from the government
came by to every house

480
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,690
to make sure it was true.

481
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,170
That no one was gone.

482
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,121
Oh.

483
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,411
Do you want to come in?

484
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,649
I can't. I'm watching Lily.

485
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,321
You alone?

486
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,361
Mmm-hmm.

487
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,126
Me, too.

488
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,164
John said he, uh,
burned that guy's house down.

489
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,646
The guy who shot him.

490
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,129
Well, then I guess they're even now.

491
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,688
Burning down houses is new.
Usually, he just gives a warning.

492
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,926
Warning for what?

493
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,451
When people found out
about what happened here,

494
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,970
there was a lot of confusion.

495
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,765
<i>And then there were claims,</i>

496
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,165
claims that were untrue.

497
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,529
John was in at the time.

498
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,687
But when he came home
and saw what was going on...

499
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,321
He wasn't having it.

500
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,004
"There are no miracles in Miracle."

501
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,370
- He gave you the speech?
- Mmm-hmm.

502
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,441
Evie was a miracle.

503
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,001
She came too early. Twenty-four weeks.

504
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,524
You know, a lot of people don't know
that twins can be born two months apart.

505
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,563
Michael, he stayed put,

506
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,888
but Evie,
she couldn't wait to get started.

507
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,242
She was one pound, one ounce.

508
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,201
Now look at her.

509
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,649
<i>I know what people are saying.</i>

510
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,087
They're saying
that something bad happened.

511
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,727
She's...

512
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,765
Playing a joke
and she's giggling in the woods.

513
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,607
No one would ever want to hurt Evie.

514
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,287
She would never want to hurt anybody else.

515
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,364
She's better than that.

516
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,524
She is exceptional.

517
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,287
<i>Exceptional.</i>

518
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,051
Just like this town.

519
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,883
Things are gonna change now.

520
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,289
I like them, the Murphys.
They're exciting.

521
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,928
And that Erika is something, huh?

522
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,210
Gets the call
her husband's been fucking shot.

523
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,370
She just pulls the bullet out,
no questions asked.

524
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,163
<i>That's real commitment. That's trust.</i>

525
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,005
<i>That's love. Not like what you've got.</i>

526
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,411
What you've got, Kevin, isn't love.

527
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,050
It's damage control.

528
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,526
Your family blew up,
Nora's family blew up.

529
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,207
And now you're all
just clinging on to each other

530
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,965
'cause you need to cling on to something.

531
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,849
<i>That's why she bought the house.</i>

532
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,721
<i>She didn't really care
whether you wanted to, or not.</i>

533
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,484
Her money, her choice.

534
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,924
That must have been emasculating.

535
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,326
And, you, Jesus.

536
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,883
If you loved them, you'd trust them
enough to tell them about me.

537
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,681
If you loved them, you wouldn't lie.

538
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,564
Shut the fuck up!

539
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,009
I didn't tell them about you
because you're not fucking here.

540
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,051
I love my family.

541
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,960
I love them.

542
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,047
Then why did you try to kill yourself?

543
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,561
What?

544
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,966
Come on.

545
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,249
This isn't a big mystery.

546
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,685
I was right there with you.

547
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,206
You walked out of your house
in the middle of the night

548
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,723
and you found a rope and a cinder block

549
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,851
and then you tied it to your ankle
and you threw it into a goddamn lake.

550
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,291
<i>Let's face it, Kevin,</i>

551
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,449
there are people
who try to commit suicide for attention.

552
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,081
And then,

553
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,201
there are people
who really want to fucking die.

554
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,729
<i>Like me and you.</i>

555
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,320
<i>I watched you do it.</i>

556
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,804
And you did not hesitate, my friend.

557
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,761
Plunk.

558
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,530
Right into the wet abyss.

559
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,129
And if not for an act
of divine intervention,

560
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,041
you'd be gone.

561
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,722
I'm sorry, Kevin,
but these are not the actions

562
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,167
of a man who loves his family.

563
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,724
I don't want to kill myself.

564
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,801
Well...

565
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,642
You're certainly entitled to your opinion.

566
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,401
I'm just glad we finally talked about it.

567
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,361
Oh.

568
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,164
Since you didn't seem
to give a shit enough to ask me,

569
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,887
I'll tell you.

570
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,080
They vanished.

571
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,327
The girls.

572
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,169
Drove right by in their car
listening to their music,

573
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,085
not a worry in the world.

574
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,483
Then, poof. Gone.

575
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,965
Mama was right.

576
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,686
Things are gonna change indeed.

577
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,921
Hey!

578
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,085
Who's your friend?

579
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,011
Did you find it?

580
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,566
Yeah.

581
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,326
What a relief.

582
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,367
Kevin.

583
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,206
Whatever happened to those girls,

584
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,488
I know you didn't have
anything to do with it.

585
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,961
Thank you.

586
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,966
But I can't wake up alone like that again.

587
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,561
I found these in the box
with your uniform.

588
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,808
We're in this together, right?

589
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,641
Right.

590
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,329
I hope you found the key, too.

591
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,481
Kevin.

592
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,727
Hmm.

593
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,642
Are they ever going to find those girls?

594
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,285
I don't think so.

595
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,121
