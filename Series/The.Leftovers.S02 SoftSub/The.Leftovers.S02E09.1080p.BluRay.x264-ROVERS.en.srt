1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,361
Smile.

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,165
I'm just looking for a sense.

3
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,845
And what kind of a sense
are you looking for?

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,650
- A sense of when.
- When what?

5
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,567
- You know what.
- Oh, you mean the wedding?

6
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,371
I'm just looking for a season, honey,
because if it's spring, then--

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,488
Mom, we're figuring it out.

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,802
Fine, fine. I withdraw.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,450
Here you go, ladies.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,330
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but I ordered this without the walnuts.

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,244
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,970
<i>- Let me take care of that.</i>
- Thank you.

13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,329
- I did say no walnuts, didn't I?
- You sure did, yeah.

14
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,562
Let me pay for the wedding.

15
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,963
You are relentless.

16
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,929
- Look who's talking.
- I'm not relentless.

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,481
Megan, you're the most relentless person
I've ever known.

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,921
When you have a cause,
there's no stopping you.

19
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,046
I can't let you pay.

20
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,009
Why not? I treat you all the time.

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,731
- I treated you to those boots.
- What boots?

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,451
Those boots that you saw at Bergdorf's.

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,080
I didn't have my wallet,
and I said I would pay you back.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,521
Well, that was March, this is October.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,881
Megan, no. Forget it. Please, no.

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,371
Do you remember how much they were?

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,760
<i>- Megan, forget it.</i>
- I <i>think it was 400.</i>

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,491
- No, honey, I don't want your money.
- I insist.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,165
<i>Fine, fine.</i>

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,608
- Um, what's today? October what?
- The 13th.

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,127
But 13 is unlucky. Date it tomorrow.

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,644
"October 14th."

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,969
Thank you for the loan.

34
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,125
So, once I deposit this,
you'll let me pay for the wedding?

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,001
Oh, I just thought of something
that I have to tell you.

36
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,686
I really have to pee.
Is it gonna take a while?

37
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,524
A minute or two.

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,327
No, fine. Go, go, go.

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,926
- But don't let me forget.
- I'll be right back.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,043
And ladies don't say "pee."

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,645
That's better.

42
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,645
<i>Wading in the water
Wading in the water</i>

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,566
<i>Wade in the water</i>

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,486
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

45
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,042
<i>Wade in the water</i>

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,886
<i>God's a-gonna trouble these waters</i>

47
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>See that band all dressed in white</i>

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,287
<i>God's gonna trouble the water</i>

49
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,683
<i>Must be the children of the Israelites</i>

50
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,684
<i>God's gonna trouble the water</i>

51
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,401
<i>You better wade in the water</i>

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,803
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

53
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,089
<i>Wade in the water</i>

54
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,767
<i>God's gonna trouble the water</i>

55
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,042
Hey, now that is
some pretty nifty singing.

56
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,611
Give yourselves a hand.

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,046
<i>All right.</i>

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,726
<i>Hey, folks,
thanks for coming out to visit us.</i>

59
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,408
Please forgive us, as we're
a little rough around the edges right now.

60
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,881
We've only been up and running
for a couple of months.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,250
<i>On your left as you get off,</i>

62
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,607
<i>there'll be golf carts and audio tours.</i>

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,445
And please make sure we see
those wristbands at all times.

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,001
<i>Now, the park closes at sundown.</i>

65
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,801
So, if you ain't on that last bus,
we're gonna come hunt you down.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,367
Welcome to Miracle, come on.

67
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,006
- We're not doing the audio tour.
- Oh, hell, yes, we are.

68
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,243
<i>It's pretty common
for folks to get confused</i>

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,643
<i>about where you've come to visit today,
so let's clear it up.</i>

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,963
<i>The moment you cross the bridge,
you enter the town of Jarden.</i>

71
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,247
<i>Miracle is the national park
that surrounds and protects that town</i>

72
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,290
<i>from those who would corrupt
its exceptional properties.</i>

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,243
<i>Historic site number seven.</i>

74
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,641
<i>Some say the earthquakes
that occur in Jarden</i>

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,408
<i>are a result of man-made fracking
and wastewater disposal in nearby towns.</i>

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,643
<i>But this crack in the street
wasn't caused by a quake.</i>

77
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,209
<i>It was a result of a gas explosion
in the sewage system on October the 14th</i>

78
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,443
<i>that sent manhole covers
flying a few blocks over.</i>

79
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,841
<i>Instead of repairing the damage,
the town has left it as a reminder.</i>

80
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,571
<i>Historic site number 13.
This is Cecilia's place.</i>

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,007
<i>It turns out that the gown
she tried on that afternoon</i>

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,844
<i>wasn't even her cup of tea.</i>

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,322
<i>Then when she heard what happened
around the world on October the 14th,</i>

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,369
<i>she bought it immediately.</i>

85
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,364
<i>And to this day,
Cecilia still wears that dress</i>

86
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,364
<i>- for</i> a <i>few hours, just in case.</i>

87
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,646
Y'all want a picture?

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,211
Thank you.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,283
Oh, uh... No, we're good. Thank you.

90
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,728
Let's go. Let's go.

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,211
Nice dress.

92
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,205
There's no number. Why are you stopping?

93
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,927
There's a man in there who can help me.

94
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,731
Jesus, Meg.

95
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,925
Another psychic?

96
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,724
I've heard amazing things about him.

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,928
This is why we took
a road trip to Texas? This guy?

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,566
He's only been doing readings
for a few weeks,

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,245
and they say that he's the real deal.

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,207
I want you to find
what you're looking for, I do.

101
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,042
How's this guy gonna be any different
from any of the others?

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,969
Because this place is different.

103
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,085
It's special.

104
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,210
And he's from here.

105
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,486
So,

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,089
she died the day before the departure?

107
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,528
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

108
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,690
Oh, honey, I'm really sorry.

109
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,363
It was two years ago. I'm okay.

110
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,770
People say I'm lucky.

111
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,451
How's that?

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,321
That I know what happened to her,

113
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,164
where she went.

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,249
You lose your mama,

115
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,570
and the very next day,
nobody gives a shit about her or you

116
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,927
because they think the world is ending.

117
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,564
"Lucky."

118
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,448
<i>Please, have a seat.</i>

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,762
<i>Make yourself comfortable, please.</i>

120
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,209
You need my handprint?

121
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,490
No, that is for people
who want to know their future.

122
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,691
You don't want to do that.

123
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,844
I brought one of her sweaters.

124
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,685
You chilly?

125
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,884
No, I... I just...

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,765
I mean, the others
wanted something that belonged to her.

127
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,367
Well, Miss Abbott,
I don't need anything from her.

128
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,326
But

129
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,444
I need something from you.

130
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,686
Just chew that.

131
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,601
It's safe. Don't swallow it.

132
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,208
Here, just spit it here.

133
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,042
- In your hand?
- Yeah, in <i>my</i> hand.

134
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Mmm.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,646
What do you want to know?

136
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,850
You can just ask her?

137
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,124
You can ask me.

138
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,609
What do you want to know?

139
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,208
She was gonna tell me something.

140
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,848
Just before I got up from the table
to go to the bathroom.

141
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,887
I want to know what it was.

142
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,042
What she was gonna tell me.

143
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,844
You know, uh,

144
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,408
people on their deathbeds,

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,166
they have a chance
to put their last words together,

146
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,481
make them count.

147
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,644
Say something profound, poetic.

148
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,126
But usually when
folk don't know that they're about to die,

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,169
they, uh... Well...

150
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,969
No disrespect to your mother or anything,
Miss Abbott.

151
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,450
They say a lot of stupid shit.

152
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,971
What do you mean?

153
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,802
I can tell you what you want,

154
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,884
but I've been doing this long enough
to know that

155
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,447
no matter what I say,
you're gonna be disappointed

156
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,171
because it's not gonna fix
what's broke inside.

157
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,051
Bullshit.

158
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,161
Sorry?

159
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,691
You don't know.

160
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,408
You're not fucking real.

161
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,005
I'm gonna be disappointed?

162
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,128
Because whatever it is
that you're about to tell me

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,169
-is fucking bullshit--
- Walnuts.

164
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,161
What?

165
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,201
Your mother sent her salad back
because she asked for no walnuts.

166
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,326
She was very polite about it, though.

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,002
Are you sure you want to know?

168
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,251
Tell me.

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,486
<i>Well?</i>

170
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,369
He wasn't the real deal.

171
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,563
<i>All right, folks, you better rise.</i>

172
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,121
<i>We've got five minutes
till the first bus gets here.</i>

173
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,847
Want a baby carrot?

174
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
What?

175
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,131
You can't cry while you eat them.
It's impossible.

176
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,366
Thanks.

177
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,964
<i>Folks, please make sure
your vendor number is clear</i>

178
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,122
<i>and visible at your stalls.</i>

179
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,765
Is it working?

180
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,206
Shit.

181
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,807
I would tell you a joke,
but I don't know any.

182
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,562
<i><i>All right, folks,
two minutes.</i>

183
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,922
<i>We have two minutes till the first bus.</i>

184
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,967
Knock, knock.

185
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,811
Who's there?

186
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,685
Broken pencil.

187
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,884
Broken pencil who?

188
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,609
Never mind, it's pointless.

189
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,204
I'm Evie.

190
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
Meg.

191
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,089
I'm sorry you didn't find
whatever you were looking for here.

192
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,770
No one ever does.

193
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,964
<i>DARREN". Who was that?</i>

194
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,163
She gave me some carrots.

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,648
Let's get out of here.

196
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,764
<i>Let's go ahead and board,
folks. We'll be leaving in two minutes.</i>

197
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,365
<i>Two minutes.</i>

198
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,727
<i>Hey, no. Let me go.</i>

199
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,764
What did we do?

200
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,806
Let us out!

201
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,529
What about the bus?

202
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,890
If you want to have a conversation,
let's just have a conversation.

203
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,082
We thought we had an understanding
after the incident with the dogs.

204
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,009
But a school bus, Megan?

205
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,243
We don't target children.

206
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,247
Why not? Nobody got hurt.

207
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,324
For the same reason
we don't allow them to live in our houses.

208
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,005
The authorities would overreact--

209
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,324
We stone each other to death,
but we're afraid of the authorities?

210
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,445
- Please, can you explain that to me?
- Explanations are useless.

211
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,407
Don't give me that mysterious bullshit.

212
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,164
That's what you say to them.

213
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,851
I've been inside for almost a year now,
and I need to know.

214
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,681
<i>- Need</i> to know <i>what?</i>
- Why we're not fucking stepping it up.

215
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,126
They're forgetting.

216
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,131
And if I'm supposed to be
a living reminder,

217
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,970
it's not enough for me
to stand outside of their fucking houses

218
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,044
staring at them
until they start screaming in my face.

219
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,124
<i>Why do I have to just stand there</i>

220
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,681
when I can put my cigarette out
in their fucking eye?

221
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,644
That's a reminder.

222
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,883
Violence is weakness.

223
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,644
You're wrong.

224
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,526
And I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

225
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,041
Are you contacting the heads
of other houses again, Megan?

226
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,049
Why would I be doing that?

227
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,125
There are rumors

228
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,123
you're planning your own action
on October 14th.

229
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,005
I'm not authorized to plan my own action.

230
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,721
Just like you're not trying
to purchase plastic explosives?

231
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,445
That's ridiculous.

232
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,087
It is ridiculous, Megan.

233
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,610
So,

234
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,128
I take it
you and your house will be present

235
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,124
at the Heroes Day celebration
in Dobbs Ferry?

236
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,051
Absolutely.

237
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,531
We've been painting our signs all week.

238
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,124
You will be in Dobbs Ferry
with your members

239
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,726
and you will carry out the action.

240
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,970
Mmm-hmm.

241
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,609
I need to hear you say it.

242
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,564
You can count on me.

243
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,165
Can we, Megan?

244
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,485
Because we counted on you to handle this.

245
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,649
We lost 10 members from New Rochelle
last week.

246
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,290
Apparently, he's hugging their pain away.

247
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,962
I wanted to do what he could do.

248
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,084
I wanted to be something.

249
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,531
So I said yes.

250
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,768
And he wrapped his arms around me

251
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,089
and I felt everything I was,
everything I would be.

252
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,931
I felt it get born and die
over and over again.

253
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,849
I had been afraid to use it.

254
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,641
Afraid of...

255
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,286
Afraid of what it meant.

256
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,084
Of what came next.

257
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,681
But I knew I couldn't let you
hurt anymore, not if I can take it away.

258
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,724
I'm not afraid anymore.

259
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,330
So,

260
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,890
who wants a hug?

261
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,130
- Hello.
- Hi.

262
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,851
- What's your name?
- Kristen.

263
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,610
Do you want me to
take your pain away, Kristen?

264
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,125
Thank you.

265
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,367
Hi.

266
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,006
What's your name?

267
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,690
It's Meg, right?

268
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,640
Do you want me to
take your pain away, Meg?

269
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,088
I can do this for real.

270
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,201
Hey.

271
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,210
Did you forget about Paramus?

272
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,882
I had 30 people there waiting to see you.

273
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,804
I tried to call you. You didn't pick up.

274
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,445
I had to give their donations back.

275
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,127
-"Donations"?
- What?

276
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,361
You mean their money?

277
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,086
You had to give their money back.

278
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,241
Well, we're gonna need money

279
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,765
if we're ever gonna get
the permanent space.

280
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,685
- We don't need a permanent space.
- Yes, we do, Tommy.

281
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,730
It's been a month, and renting out
these halls is very expensive.

282
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,043
I don't want their money and
I don't want to build a fucking church.

283
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,888
When they pay us,
that is their commitment to change, okay?

284
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,929
If it were free, it wouldn't work.

285
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,203
- We're helping people.
-"We"?

286
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,242
<i>I'm the one up here lying.</i>

287
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,890
You're not lying.

288
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,449
We stole it, Mom.

289
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,045
You said that if we took Wayne's story
and used it,

290
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,521
people would believe in us
the way they believed in him.

291
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,524
Well, they're getting better.
Isn't that what matters?

292
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
It works.

293
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,250
It doesn't work on me.

294
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,890
Did something happen?

295
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,526
Yeah.

296
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,725
Something happened.

297
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,567
Your book didn't work out,
so you figured...

298
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,644
You figured you would pimp out
your own fucking son.

299
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,371
<i>So that you wouldn't have to
run people over anymore.</i>

300
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,923
So that you didn't have to feel bad
about leaving your whole fucking family.

301
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,965
I'm sorry.

302
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,165
I'm so sorry.

303
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,445
Tommy, I'm so sorry.

304
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,242
<i>Tommy, Tommy, please.</i>

305
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,649
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,561
Stay.

307
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,685
Hey, everybody!

308
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,211
Remember me?

309
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,969
I was here a month ago

310
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,690
trying to recruit you.

311
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,970
I just wanted you to come get better

312
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,964
with some great group therapy
from my mommy.

313
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,051
You! You.

314
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,888
I tried to recruit you.

315
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,883
You looked so sad.

316
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,042
Then you blew your fucking whistle at me.

317
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,441
You blew the whistle
and they came and put me

318
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,887
in a fucking van
that brought me to Meg. Hmm?

319
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,287
Meg. You know Meg?

320
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,846
You know Meg?

321
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,569
You know Meg, huh?

322
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,291
You know her? Where's your whistle?

323
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,965
Where's your whistle?
Where's your fucking whistle?

324
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,730
Where is it?

325
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,166
Blow your fucking whistle!

326
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,129
Blow the whistle that brings Meg!

327
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,089
Where is she?

328
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,561
Where the fuck is Meg?

329
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,449
What do you want?

330
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,603
You said you could do it for real.

331
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,000
Do what?

332
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,450
Take my pain away.

333
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,647
Why don't you just hug yourself?

334
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,691
Please.

335
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,009
I'll do anything.
I just want to be a part of this.

336
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,683
You don't understand this.

337
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,849
You're not looking for this.

338
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,004
You're looking for a family.

339
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,450
If I wanted a fucking family,
I'd move to Texas.

340
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,366
What?

341
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,931
Texas.

342
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,521
They moved there, my dad and my sister.

343
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,370
Where in Texas?

344
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,845
Miracle.

345
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,400
Jarden.

346
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,521
<i>What?</i>

347
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,247
The town is Jarden.

348
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,921
Miracle is the national park

349
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,530
that surrounds and protects it

350
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,571
from those who would
corrupt its exceptional properties.

351
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,604
I just so happen to be
headed there myself.

352
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
My phone's in the glove compartment.
Get it for me.

353
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,601
Yeah?

354
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,450
How many?

355
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,611
Yeah, okay. Good.

356
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm gonna need to see the bridge myself.

357
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,124
<i>No, no, alone.</i>

358
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,723
<i>I'll be there in the morning.</i>

359
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,725
This is hard, huh?

360
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,681
Not knowing what's gonna happen.

361
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,526
You must be curious about what
I'm gonna do when we get to Texas.

362
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,965
Are you, Tom?

363
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,324
'Cause it's pretty fucking amazing,
what I'm gonna do.

364
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,809
Why'd you fuck me?

365
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,169
I know why you poured gasoline on me.

366
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,529
I know why you threatened me,
to try to send a message to my mom.

367
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,321
But why did you fuck me?

368
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,851
Oh, look.

369
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,284
<i>A hunky-tank.</i>

370
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,844
You wanna go dancing, Tom?

371
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,530
Thank you.

372
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,204
Mmm.

373
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,124
Your turn.

374
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,722
If you're not gonna drink...

375
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,811
Now we're talking.

376
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,249
So who's the blonde?

377
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,801
What?

378
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,082
Both your parents have dark hair.

379
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,289
- You know my dad?
- The former chief.

380
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,725
Nice guy.

381
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,969
Yeah, he's not my biological father.

382
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,847
- But he raised you, right?
- Yeah.

383
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,606
Yeah, he and my mother
got together when I was four.

384
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,683
- He adopted me.
- Oh, yeah?

385
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,888
My dad died when I was a baby.

386
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,604
Then my mom got remarried
to this guy Elliot.

387
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,361
He wanted us to be an official family.

388
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,643
I was really young, but I remember

389
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,121
going down to the courthouse
and everything.

390
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,568
The judge gave me a lollipop.

391
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,444
Good old Elliot.

392
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,965
He left my mom a year later
and I never saw him again.

393
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,569
<i>Can we get two more?</i>

394
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,805
- Please?
- You got it.

395
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,568
- Thank you.
- You <i>bet.</i>

396
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,529
So where's your mom now?

397
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,329
She's in space.

398
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,925
What?

399
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,560
When she died, we had her cremated

400
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,291
and we shot her ashes into space.

401
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,651
Seriously?

402
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,164
She didn't like the idea
of being in a box, you know,

403
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,485
in the ground.

404
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,161
And she was really into astrology.

405
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,566
There's this company, and they do it.

406
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,922
Costs $12,000.

407
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,410
Seems reasonable, right?

408
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,689
What's happening right now?

409
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,929
This feels nice, right?

410
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,246
Yeah.

411
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,445
It feels nice.

412
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,043
To get you pregnant.

413
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,885
What?

414
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,121
I wanted to get you pregnant.

415
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,289
That's why I fucked you, Tom.

416
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,644
Nice to see you again.

417
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,410
Open the chain.

418
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,164
- Just fucking tell me.
- Somebody got on the property.

419
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,849
<i>Come on, just let me go.</i>

420
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,605
Please, I didn't do anything.

421
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,325
There's a bike trail about a mile
behind the property.

422
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,284
<i>Guess he decided to go off it.</i>

423
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,291
Where'd you find him?

424
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,763
Right outside the barn.

425
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,445
Did he see?

426
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,850
Yeah, we think so.

427
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,048
What? What did I see?
I didn't see anything.

428
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,441
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

429
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,125
We can just keep him here until tomorrow.

430
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,521
Once it's over, it won't matter anymore.

431
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,130
Stone him.

432
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,130
What does that...
What did she say?

433
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,964
What does that mean?

434
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,131
Hey! Wait, guys!

435
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,645
<i>Please! Just let me go!</i>

436
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,560
Hey!

437
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,810
What are you doing?

438
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,289
I was following you.

439
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,363
<i>I don't want you to follow me.</i>

440
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,602
You wanted to come here, and you're here.

441
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,484
And now we're done.

442
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,327
So what am I supposed to do?

443
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,244
Make yourself useful.

444
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,369
<i>Let me go!</i>

445
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,765
<i>Please, let me go!</i>

446
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,606
Come on! I didn't do anything!

447
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,560
<i>- No! I didn't fucking do anything!</i>

448
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,960
<i>Please!</i>

449
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,363
<i>Stop! I'll do anything!
You don't have to do this!</i>

450
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,045
<i>Please! No!</i>

451
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,970
Let me go!

452
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,964
Please! Please!

453
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,885
<i>No! Come on!</i>

454
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,530
<i>No!</i>

455
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,645
<i>Megan?</i>

456
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,641
My God, what are you doing here?

457
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,285
It's Matt.

458
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,807
Matt Jamison from Mapleton.

459
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,240
Oh, yeah.

460
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,560
The priest.

461
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,290
You're talking.

462
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,851
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

463
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,244
So you left them, the Remnant?

464
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,644
I sure did.

465
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,086
Good for you.

466
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,764
So Kevin and Nora
have been taking care of Mary,

467
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,446
and I'm immensely grateful for that.

468
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,801
So the rangers just won't let you in?

469
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,481
Their rules are very particular.

470
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,281
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

471
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,764
No, it doesn't.

472
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,285
I can't get over it.

473
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,924
- What?
- Well, seeing you here in Texas.

474
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,961
It's pretty amazing, don't you think?

475
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,411
Not really.

476
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,010
I mean, if we were just anywhere,
it would be a coincidence.

477
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,528
But we're here in Miracle.

478
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,765
I think we both came here
for the same reason.

479
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,090
What reason is that?

480
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,048
Because this place is safe.

481
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,606
- Now that you've left the Remnant.
- Exactly.

482
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,683
It was really hard to get away, you know,

483
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,683
because they're everywhere.

484
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,881
But I started to think to myself,

485
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,849
there must be somewhere that the
Guilty Remnant wouldn't work, you know?

486
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,445
Wouldn't work?

487
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,689
Right, because
in order to get someone to join them,

488
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,922
that person needs to be in pain.

489
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,647
And the people on the other side
of that bridge, Matt, they were spared.

490
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,610
They're just not suffering
like the rest of us are.

491
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,764
You know, Megan,

492
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,810
I don't think you're being
entirely honest with me.

493
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,487
You think I'd lie to a priest?

494
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,807
Today is the anniversary, isn't it?

495
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,841
Of the departure?
No, I believe that's tomorrow.

496
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,601
Not the departure. Your mother's death.

497
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,566
You do remember attacking me in Mapleton?

498
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,731
I was outside your house
handing out fliers

499
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,406
with your mother's photo on them.

500
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,520
I know it was cruel, I'm sorry
for digging into your life like that.

501
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,241
But I was doing everything I could
to make you feel again.

502
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,803
I had forgotten that.

503
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,609
Well, then I apologize for being your

504
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,890
living reminder.

505
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,685
Can I ask you something?

506
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,321
Sure.

507
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,929
What are you waiting for?

508
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,810
I'm sorry?

509
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,202
You and all these people out here,

510
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,451
you're so close.

511
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,445
It's right there.

512
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,365
Just over the bridge.

513
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,731
You want it,

514
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,442
but you're not doing anything to get it.

515
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,483
So what are you waiting for?

516
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,448
You want me to tell you?

517
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,006
Yes.

518
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,050
You're waiting for me.

519
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,965
Who are you?

520
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,521
English - SDH
