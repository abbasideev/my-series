1
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,329
Look what I found.

2
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,244
You're a natural.

3
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,481
Hi.

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,091
Just got off with the FBI.

5
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,368
No abductions, no missing persons.

6
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,561
Oh.

7
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,088
We're keeping her, right?

8
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,481
I mean, someone left her here for us.

9
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,766
Yeah?

10
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,406
Do you want to stay over?

11
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,724
My luggage is in the car.

12
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,841
Look, this... If we're gonna be...

13
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,570
We can't just...

14
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,760
We don't really know each other.

15
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,281
Okay.

16
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,729
What do I need to know?

17
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,165
Uh, I've been...

18
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,681
I've been walking in my sleep.

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,291
Uh, I was taking medication.

20
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,688
Uh, so I tossed my pills.

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,009
I figured that'd be the end of it,
but then I, um...

22
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,322
I grabbed Patti Levin.

23
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,969
And I took her to a cabin.

24
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,084
<i>And when I woke up,</i>

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,083
I tried to let her go,
but she wouldn't let me.

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,928
And she killed herself.

27
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,448
<i>So I called your brother, Matt,</i>

28
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,443
and we buried her.

29
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,001
And nobody else knows.

30
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,764
And I smoke.

31
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,648
I hire prostitutes to shoot me.

32
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,245
I lied to you about my gun.

33
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,131
I won't ever do that again. I'm sorry.

34
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,127
It's okay.

35
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,730
It's okay?

36
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,526
It's okay.

37
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,763
Do I have to say something crazy now?

38
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,445
It's okay.

39
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,130
Do you know whose baby that is?

40
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,441
Sorry?

41
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,608
Do you know whose baby that is?

42
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,485
She's mine.

43
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,290
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

44
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,005
What's going on?

45
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
Hello.

46
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,606
Hello...

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,365
One second.

48
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,680
Hey, I'm on my way home.

49
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,168
The old washer is busted,
so I had to be at the laundry...

50
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,685
What? No.

51
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,890
You said 11:00.

52
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,003
Oh, shit. Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

53
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,803
I love... Fuck.

54
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,729
- I swear to God I thought you said 11:00.
-It's okay. Here, give her to me.

55
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,405
I've got to fix
that fucking washing machine.

56
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,722
Kevin, it's okay. Here.

57
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,609
Three loads at the laundromat.

58
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,842
- You're gonna do all the talking, right?
- You'll be great.

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,525
Just tell them
it felt like it was meant to be.

60
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,364
Felt like it was meant to be.
Felt like it was meant to be.

61
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,324
- You can put it in your own words.
- I got it.

62
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,727
Deep breath. Clear it out, man.

63
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,726
Good.

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,889
Let's go make a family.

65
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,720
Come on.

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,290
She was on your porch?

67
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,044
No, it was Kevin's porch.

68
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,328
- I was just the one--
- Was there a note?

69
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,481
Uh-uh. it was just her in her car seat.

70
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,210
- So no idea of who left her there?
- No.

71
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,124
Kevin was the chief of police,
so we assumed--

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,645
You're a cop?

73
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,162
I was. I took a leave
so I could help with the baby.

74
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,204
It felt like it was meant to be.

75
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,241
Any other kids?

76
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,163
Uh, my daughter lives with us.

77
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,850
She's great with the baby.

78
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,528
My children were both departures.

79
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,844
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,923
Any other relatives in the area?

81
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,243
Um, my dad lives nearby.

82
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,721
He's not really in the, you know...

83
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,166
Not really what?

84
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,641
He's in a psychiatric facility.

85
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,488
But he's not
dangerous or anything.

86
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,005
- He's...
- No.

87
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,170
Marital status?

88
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,081
- Well, we live together.
- We were both previously married.

89
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,969
- We're committed, obviously.
- We love each other.

90
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,281
<i>- Very, very much.
- Yeah.</i>

91
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,125
In the event of a separation,
who would take care of the child?

92
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,282
- We're not going to separate.
<i>- But if</i> you <i>did--</i>

93
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,811
We're not.

94
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,200
We're not.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,729
Would you like to adopt another child?

96
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,880
We want this one.

97
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,246
In addition to this one.

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,562
Um...

99
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,847
<i>MAN". One month old, adorable.</i>

100
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,849
He's white, though.

101
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,930
I'm sorry, no. We're... We're good.

102
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,845
- Yeah, we're pretty...
- Yeah.

103
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,491
Name of the child?

104
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,529
Lily with One "L."

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,324
Lily with One "L."

106
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,886
Now, I want you to take this
to any of the judges down the hall.

107
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,321
The wait shouldn't be too bad.

108
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,441
So...

109
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,445
Congratulations.

110
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,449
She's all yours.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,570
She's all ours.

112
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,045
We got you.

113
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,886
Fuck!

114
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,290
You see a tag on this?

115
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,684
I think it's $17.95. Cool?

116
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,801
What?

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,486
I'll take that, too.

118
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,363
Please turn off the vehicle, sir.

119
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,726
There's a body in the back of my truck.

120
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,923
You're my sister. Did you know that?

121
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,447
We're sisters. See?

122
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,364
What's she wearing?

123
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,522
It was in the box that your brother sent.

124
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,090
- Check it out.
<i>- Aw.</i>

125
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,208
That was sweet of him.

126
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,011
Hi. You want to go for a walk with us?

127
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,560
Urn, no.
I'm gonna meet a friend for coffee.

128
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Is he cute?

129
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,451
Not as cute as he used to be.

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,761
Remember, we have dinner at 7:00.

131
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,685
Dad's gonna wear a sport coat
and everything, so get ready to celebrate.

132
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,171
Oh, I'm ready.

133
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,048
- Thank you.
- Anything else I can get you?

134
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,890
Sorry, it's not for me.

135
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,127
Waiting for someone

136
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,362
-who's just 20 minutes late.
- Okay.

137
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,289
"Looking good, Billy Ray."

138
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,044
"Feeling good, Louis."

139
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,804
- Sorry, I'm sick.
- Oh.

140
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,564
<i>I don't want to infect you.</i>

141
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,171
That sucks.

142
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,447
<i>I</i> ordered you a cheeseburger.

143
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,971
Ah, thank you.

144
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,131
Um, school good?

145
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,765
It's August.

146
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,410
it's August.

147
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,085
- You're right.
- Yeah.

148
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,401
Um...

149
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,641
Dad and Nora adopted the baby.

150
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,801
Wow.

151
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,969
They still calling it Lily?

152
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,526
Yeah, you don't like that?

153
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,168
Who cares what I like?

154
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,846
I care.

155
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,687
I mean, you gave her to us.

156
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,167
- Did you tell Dad?
- No.

157
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,685
- Jill, did you?
- No.

158
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,921
You can't tell Dad.

159
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,481
I promised you that I wouldn't.

160
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,924
You know, you should really
just call him sometime.

161
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,408
<i>- He worries</i> about you.
<i>- We're not starting that, Jill.</i>

162
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,689
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not. I'm not angry.

163
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,201
Well, can I just tell him
that I know you're okay?

164
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,601
No, Jill, you can't.

165
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,486
Why not?

166
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,888
'Cause nobody's okay.

167
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,406
I am.

168
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,361
And so is Dad and Nora.

169
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,244
We're all okay.

170
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,003
That's good for you.

171
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,244
You deserve that.

172
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,688
One big, happy family.

173
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,967
Well, you can be a part of it.

174
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,406
I mean, anytime.

175
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,531
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,840
She, um...

177
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,126
She wanted me to give this to you.

178
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,091
I love you.

179
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,044
I love you, too.

180
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,688
<i>- Hello.
- Nora, Mike from Century.</i>

181
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,729
- Are you <i>sitting</i> down?
- No, I'm standing.

182
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,043
<i>There's an offer on your house. 2.7.</i>

183
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,088
<i>- Million?
- Yeah, million.</i>

184
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,169
But we listed it for $600,000.

185
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,526
<i>- Why</i> would <i>they--
- It's</i> a <i>preemptive bid.</i>

186
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,045
<i>Listen, they put it on a clock.</i>

187
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,123
<i>We have until end of day to respond.</i>

188
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,487
<i>So, I'm saying yes, yes?</i>

189
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,201
<i>Nora?</i>

190
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,168
Why are you offering me four times
what I'm asking for my house?

191
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,009
Your residence has been flagged
as a highly desirable property

192
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,810
by a number of separate institutions.

193
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,690
What's your institution?

194
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,366
We're from MIT.

195
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,488
- Good school.
-It is, thank you.

196
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,771
<i>We're spearheading a research project,
and the university is financing the grant.</i>

197
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,331
- To buy my house?
- Yes.

198
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,563
- Why?
- Because it is anomalous.

199
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,323
It's a deviation
from the statistical norm--

200
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,606
She knows what it means.

201
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,881
You want to buy my house

202
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,042
because my husband and children
disappeared from here.

203
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,567
Yes, and our deepest condolences
for your loss.

204
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,888
- So you have a guess?
- Sorry?

205
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,246
If they're writing you a grant that big,

206
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,084
you must have a guess
as to where my family went.

207
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,886
We can't determine where, only why.

208
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,890
I don't understand.

209
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,641
Our guess is that
it's a matter of geography.

210
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,411
<i>Places.</i>

211
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,286
<i>And the richest data
can be gathered from sites</i>

212
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,843
where multiple departures
have occurred in the same proximity,

213
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,371
like right here.

214
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,004
But I was here with them.

215
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,721
Our understanding is that
your family was here at the table,

216
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,121
but you were over by the sink, yes?

217
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,009
You're saying if I was sitting right here,
I would have gone, too?

218
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,530
If you sell us your house, we'll be
one step closer to answering that.

219
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,842
- Then what?
- Sorry?

220
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,526
If you're right, then what?
What does it matter?

221
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,563
People want to be able to
protect themselves against a recurrence.

222
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,811
You think it's gonna happen again?

223
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,523
Why wouldn't it?

224
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,685
Staties offer you anything?

225
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,047
Some shitty coffee out there.

226
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,810
Lois Makepeace from ATFEC.

227
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,004
Kevin Garvey.

228
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,729
Want to ask about the eye?

229
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,201
No.

230
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,042
Most people are curious.

231
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,409
So they confirmed the ID
of the body in your truck.

232
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,766
Patricia Levin.

233
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,530
Regional leadership of the Guilty Remnant.

234
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,365
- She went by Patti.
- Did you kill her?

235
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,889
No, I disinterred her body.

236
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,121
You know who did kill her?

237
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,041
- She killed herself, but I was--
- So she killed herself?

238
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,885
Yes, but I was responsible for--

239
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,362
But she killed herself?

240
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,644
Yes, she did.

241
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,643
<i>-I--
- Don't</i> care.

242
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,048
I don't care how you knew
where she was buried,

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
or why you dug her up
because I don't care about her.

244
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,560
I read your official resignation.

245
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,051
Chief Kevin Garvey of Mapleton PD.

246
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,729
You quit being a cop.

247
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,845
Probably 'cause
this piece of shit, Levin, liked smoking

248
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,810
and telling those
other chickenshits in her little club

249
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,531
to cause a riot in your goddamn town.

250
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,804
So she killed herself.

251
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,564
The world spins on.

252
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,042
Good riddance, Patricia,
we hardly fucking knew you.

253
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,082
Are you letting me go?

254
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,090
Do you want to blow your life up?

255
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,601
What?

256
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,961
Do you want to blow your life up?

257
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,487
No.

258
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,561
<i>Then go home, Kevin Garvey.</i>

259
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,528
What the fuck was that?

260
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,006
<i>- I'm losing circulation.
<i>- I know.</i>

261
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,482
<i>GARVEY SR; She's got a grip on her.</i>

262
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,129
Hey, there he is.

263
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,125
<i>Hola, bambino.</i>

264
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,331
<i>Your dad's been released.
Isn't that great?</i>

265
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,249
Released? When?

266
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

267
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,567
You're dubious.

268
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,846
I'm supposed to trust you

269
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,002
just because you're wearing
normal clothes, not a bathrobe?

270
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,525
Good fit, huh?

271
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,523
Guy I stole them off
is in a ditch, bleeding to death.

272
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,841
Boys.

273
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,528
Do you want to call the nuthouse?

274
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,244
What are they gonna tell me if I do?

275
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,046
That I'm cured.

276
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,567
And he's moving to Australia.

277
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,169
Not moving, just visiting
for an indefinite period of time.

278
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,322
I'm gonna take her up for her nap
and hop in the shower.

279
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,447
Okay.

280
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,802
Hi. Your son's taking us
to dinner tonight.

281
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,486
He made a reservation and everything.

282
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,210
What a gentleman.

283
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,842
<i>NORA". Why don't you two catch up?</i>

284
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,369
She's a great woman.

285
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,363
You said that about Laurie, too.

286
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,522
Well, I still like Laurie.

287
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,082
I just like Nora more.

288
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,370
Try not to drive her
into a fucking cult, okay?

289
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,046
Jesus, your sense of humor is back.

290
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,162
Will wonders never cease?

291
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,407
I got to admit, it's pretty convincing.

292
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,601
What?

293
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,921
You.

294
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,728
You seem pretty normal.

295
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,608
You implying that I'm not?

296
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,529
Well, watched you for four years
yelling at shit that wasn't even there.

297
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,121
Who says it wasn't there?

298
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,250
I don't know.

299
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,282
Laws of fucking nature.

300
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,091
Well, son, wouldn't you agree

301
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,121
that the laws of fucking nature
seemed a bit upside down, as of late?

302
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,926
So, what, your voices,
they just went away?

303
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,851
No, sir.

304
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,010
I just started doing what they told me to.

305
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,768
They tell you to go to Australia?

306
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,131
God, I love this town.

307
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,247
But now everywhere I look,
all I see is what's gone.

308
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,683
So, I can sit around and cry
about how the world fucking ended,

309
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,006
OF...

310
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,002
I could start it up again.

311
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,286
And we offer that grilled
on a bed of daily cut spinach.

312
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,681
Or you can have it roasted
in our brick oven

313
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,365
with fingerling potatoes.

314
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,531
The pasta is homemade agnolotti
with veal ragu,

315
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,284
and we prepare that al dente.

316
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,485
Just a little brittleness to the bite.

317
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,763
And just to remind you,
the chef requests no substitutions.

318
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,008
Can I get the pasta
with the sauce on the side?

319
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,685
Yes, of course.

320
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,569
And can I, um, get that
without the brittleness to the bite?

321
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,409
That's not technically a substitution.

322
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,480
I'd be happy to ask.

323
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,807
Thanks.

324
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,530
That'd be great.

325
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,566
What?

326
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,167
Do you want to get out of here?

327
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,570
Out of the restaurant?

328
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,487
No.

329
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,089
Not the restaurant.

330
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,480
Jill, honey.

331
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,520
We're here.

332
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,649
<i>Please proceed to the visitor center
to get your wristbands.</i>

333
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,450
<i>If you do not have a reservation,</i>

334
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,443
<i>you'll have to turn around
before the bridge.</i>

335
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,644
Excuse me, sir.

336
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,607
- Do you want to sell your wristbands?
- Uh, sorry?

337
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,161
We, my family,
we've been camped out for two weeks,

338
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,810
<i>and I've got cash.</i>

339
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,526
Uh, we rented a place,
so I don't think we need a wristband.

340
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,482
Come on, keep on coming.

341
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,240
<i>If you do not have a reservation,</i>

342
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,164
<i>y'all need to turn around
before the bridge.</i>

343
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,926
Morning.

344
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,047
Do you mind
if we get the keys to your trailer?

345
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,326
Some folks hitch a ride in.

346
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,130
We just want to make sure
you didn't pick up

347
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,282
any unwanted guests along the way.

348
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,845
Here you go.

349
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,002
Thanks. Y'all got a reservation?

350
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,930
Uh, we rented a place in town.

351
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,081
Good for you.

352
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,811
Just need to see a copy of the lease,
and we'll let y'all on in.

353
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,247
Is this okay? We did it all online.

354
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,526
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,091
So, you just take this to the rental desk
at the visitor center.

356
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,844
It's just over the bridge.

357
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,610
They'll set your vehicle up
with some stickers

358
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,286
so you can drive on into town, okay?

359
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,090
Great. Thanks so much.

360
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,083
Welcome to Miracle.

361
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,242
<i>Welcome to Miracle National Park.</i>

362
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,444
<i>Nonresident vehicles
are prohibited in Miracle.</i>

363
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,043
<i>Visitors must ride a shuttle bus
to and from the center.</i>

364
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,810
<i>- All visitors must stay...</i>
<i>- Come on,</i> buddy.

365
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,124
<i>...near the visitor center
with their wristband before borders close.</i>

366
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,405
Sir. Sir, you're gonna need
to take that animal to quarantine

367
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,369
if you're going into town.

368
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,363
What? No one told us
there was a quarantine.

369
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,885
Sir, it's right over there.

370
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,330
Rules are rules.

371
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,801
All right.

372
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,689
You go on in. I'll take him.

373
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,001
Okay.

374
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,771
Sixty days?

375
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,125
No wildlife admitted into the park
until we can clear their blood work.

376
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,331
But it's not fucking wildlife. It's a dog.

377
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,611
Here we go.

378
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,522
I will call you
as soon as he can come home,

379
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,250
but you're free to visit anytime.

380
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,526
I'll let you say your goodbyes.

381
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,528
Come on. Come on.

382
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,446
It's okay. It's okay.

383
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,801
It's okay. It's all right.

384
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,085
Hey, come here.

385
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,322
Come here, buddy. It's all right.

386
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,891
Come here.

387
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,805
I know, I know, I know.

388
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,570
<i>I'll be back.</i>

389
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,721
I'll stay with him if you want.

390
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,881
Maybe he'll fucking talk to me.

391
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,969
Welcome to Miracle National Park.

392
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,650
We're excited to have you.

393
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,245
<i>Within the boundaries of the park</i>

394
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,961
<i>sits the town of Jarden,
a town with a unique history.</i>

395
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,928
<i>The most populous bordered area
unaffected by the sudden departure.</i>

396
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
<i>All visitors access the park
via Miracle Way.</i>

397
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,081
<i>There are shuttles from the visitor center
every 30 minutes.</i>

398
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,244
<i>The visitor wristband
is your ticket into Miracle.</i>

399
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,085
<i>Visitors must wear
their wristband at all times.</i>

400
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,571
<i>Each wristband is valid between
the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.</i>

401
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,165
<i>on the day of issue.</i>

402
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,891
<i>Miracle isn't just</i> a <i>national park.</i>

403
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,010
<i>It's a living, functioning town
with a rich history.</i>

404
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,889
<i>That was true before October 14</i>

405
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,010
<i>-and incredibly has remained true since.</i>
- I <i>am the</i> Lord your <i>God...</i>

406
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,286
<i>The residents of Miracle
request that you join them</i>

407
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,967
<i>in the project of preserving
this extraordinary place they call home</i>

408
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,168
<i>by honoring these rules and regulations.</i>

409
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,442
<i>Once inside the park,
you may purchase goods</i>

410
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,046
<i>from any of Miracle's registered vendors.</i>

411
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,202
<i>As you explore our town,
you'll notice that</i>

412
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,489
<i>we've designated
several areas as historical sites,</i>

413
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,647
<i>each marked with a white reference number.</i>

414
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,610
<i>Most of these sites have been
preserved exactly as they were...</i>

415
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,285
Auction's in five minutes.

416
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,970
Oh, we've already rented a house.

417
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,168
- I'm just looking for my family.
- Temporary residential?

418
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,761
Right next to the day-pass line.

419
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,680
Thank you.

420
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,171
<i>So, please, make safety
your number one priority.</i>

421
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,280
How are you?

422
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,847
Sorry?

423
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,526
How are you?

424
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,086
I'm fine, thanks.

425
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,083
I'm out on Leddecker Road.

426
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,329
Under the big oak.

427
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,323
Trailer with all the Christmas lights.

428
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,165
You should come see me anytime.

429
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,969
I can help you...

430
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,243
With your situation.

431
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,644
<i>NORA". That's unacceptable!</i>

432
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,531
<i>We drove here all the way from New York.</i>

433
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,684
<i>I can't believe this.
This is unbelievable.</i>

434
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,128
We paid a deposit. A $50,000 deposit.

435
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,851
- What's going on?
- They say our house burned down.

436
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,047
- The house we rented?
- Yes!

437
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,884
If you talk to the owner, maybe they--

438
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,411
We did it online. We don't know the owner.

439
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,244
Nora, calm down for one second.

440
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,243
- Are there any other rentals available?
- Not currently.

441
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,051
But we'll get y'all to the top of
the wait list, should one come available.

442
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,282
- When's that gonna be?
- Hard to say.

443
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,284
Y'all were lucky
to get one as easy as you did.

444
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,410
Lucky? Our entire house
is in the back of a U-Haul,

445
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,891
and you took our fucking dog.

446
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,724
Well, I can make a call
on over to quarantine.

447
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,803
- See what I can do.
- Dad!

448
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,244
AUCTIONEER 450,000 where?

449
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,204
I think she's buying a house.

450
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,880
<i>500,000, 25</i> where?

451
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,168
500. Can I get five and a quarter?
25, thank you.

452
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,521
-525?
- MANI 500.

453
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,011
<i>Five, at 500. Now give me 525.</i>

454
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,730
- Five and a quarter, 525 and half.
- Here.

455
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,963
<i>- NOW 600. Not' 575, 600.</i>
-650!

456
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,925
- I have you. I'm at 650.
-750!

457
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,406
- What are you doing?
- Bidding.

458
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,483
Ladies and gentlemen, remember,
there are no escrow.

459
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,723
All sales are final. On 750. 750, 800.

460
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,605
-800!
- I've got you at 800, ma'am.

461
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,040
Can we talk about this?

462
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,611
We talked about it
when we committed to the rental.

463
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,086
That was for six months.

464
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,844
Okay? We're gonna take this
one step at a time.

465
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,002
- Our steps burned down.
- Nora, you need to take a breath.

466
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,161
There's gonna be other chances.

467
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,367
How often do they have auctions?

468
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,086
That's the first one
they've had this summer.

469
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,004
-950!
- I've got you at nine and a half.

470
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,491
- One million.
- I'm looking at $1 million now.

471
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,166
We don't have to do this.
There are other places that we can live.

472
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,850
This place.

473
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,649
This is the place we decided on.

474
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,081
- Yeah, but--
- You want to live here, buddy?

475
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,844
- Yeah.
- You in, Jill?

476
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,804
Yeah, I'm in if you guys are.

477
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,361
Three million!

478
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,807
Ma'am, you realize the current bid
is $1,600,000?

479
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,769
I understand that. Thank you.

480
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,524
All sales are final.

481
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,961
<i>- We clear on that?
- Yup.</i>

482
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,522
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a $3 million bid on this house.

483
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,126
<i>I'm at $3 million. Three one where?</i>

484
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,011
I'm at three million,
now reeling three one.

485
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,650
Three million once.

486
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,086
Three million twice.

487
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,006
- I have sold the house for $3 million.
- We won!

488
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,124
Hey, we won.

489
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,323
Please don't take these off
till you get

490
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,528
your permanent resident cards.

491
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,809
<i>It'll keep the rangers in town
off your back.</i>

492
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,846
- Too tight?
- No, it's fine, thank you.

493
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,843
Once the wire transfer
from your bank goes through,

494
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,889
y'all can come pick up the keys.

495
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,169
- Initial here and here.
- Okay.

496
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,924
There's no hotels in the park,

497
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,084
so y'all are gonna need to find
other accommodations for tonight.

498
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,369
We don't need accommodations.
We have family here.

499
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,080
Think this is the right place?

500
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,811
Yup, he said the cottage
next to the church.

501
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,562
Looks like a storage shed.

502
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,481
- Hello?
- Matt! It's us.

503
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,721
Oh!

504
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,448
You're here! Oh!

505
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,048
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

506
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,680
My God, she's so big already.

507
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,764
Hey, I'm your Uncle Matt. Remember me?

508
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,401
Okay, come in.

509
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,762
Mary will be happy to see you.

510
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,207
Let's go.

511
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,480
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

512
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,085
Me, too, Matt.

513
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,644
- Come on.
- All right.

514
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,843
Hi, Mary. How are you?

515
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,401
This is Lily. Can you say hi?

516
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,807
Yeah.

517
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,244
I know it's not much,
but we have our own bathroom.

518
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,004
And Reverend Massey, it's his church.

519
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,289
He and his wife let us use the kitchen
in the main house whenever we want.

520
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,480
How was it coming into town?

521
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,967
The visitor center's something, huh?

522
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,761
It was, you know... They took our dog
and they told us our rental burned down,

523
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,127
but other than that,
you know, smooth sailing.

524
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,447
What?

525
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,602
We were hoping we could stay
with you guys tonight.

526
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,406
Oh, sure. Of course.

527
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,370
We're just a little short of space.

528
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,490
Oh, we have a tent.

529
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,960
$3 million?

530
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,561
That's almost exactly
what I got for my place back home.

531
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,724
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah, it was meant to be.

532
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,848
I'm sure it's very nice.

533
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,806
We haven't actually seen it yet.

534
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,368
Guess that's why they call it
a leap of faith.

535
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,324
Yeah, a leap of something.

536
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,563
You know, why don't you and Mary
come stay with us for a while?

537
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,530
No. That's very generous,
but I don't think it's a good idea.

538
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,206
You'd rather live in a garage
than stay with us?

539
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,529
No, it's just I've been
helping out at the church.

540
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,409
I should be close by.

541
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,005
What aren't you telling me?

542
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,240
He doesn't want to, Nora.

543
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,926
- But why doesn't he want to?
- He just told you. Let it go.

544
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,044
Oh, so you two bury a body together
and now you got each other's backs, huh?

545
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,325
You told her?

546
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,249
Yeah. We tell each other everything.

547
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,528
It should be coming up here
on the right in just a sec.

548
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,525
There it is.

549
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,521
At least it's big.

550
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,604
I get to call my room.

551
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,364
Oh, no, you don't.

552
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,885
<i>Watch yourself.
You're carrying a baby.</i>

553
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,050
Come on. Fucker.

554
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,086
Ah! Fuck! Jesus Christ.

555
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,881
Kevin.

556
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,691
I'm sorry I had to do that to you,

557
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,925
but we just cannot go on
with you treating me like I don't exist.

558
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,807
I do exist.

559
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,521
I need you to talk to me.

560
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,850
I just need you to talk-- Aah!

561
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,601
Kevin?

562
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,326
What happened?

563
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,448
Just... I slipped on some water.

564
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,841
I was checking the stove.
There's got to be a leak.

565
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,889
- You're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

566
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,925
I'm fine.

567
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,323
- Are you--
- Go ahead and get that.

568
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,084
I have Band-Aids in my purse.

569
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,288
- Okay, I got him.
- Let's go answer the door.

570
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,289
Come on. Let's go see.

571
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,845
Feel like such a fucking idiot.

572
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,287
That 'cause there's no water on the floor?

573
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,325
Well, I slipped on something.

574
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,811
<i>Obviously.</i>

575
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,366
Sit down.

576
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,045
Please don't put that on my head.

577
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,611
It'll clear out.

578
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,566
Ow, careful. Just be careful.

579
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,290
Don't be a baby.

580
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,647
There you go. No more owie.

581
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,800
Hey, sweetie.

582
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,485
Who was that?

583
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,846
- Who was that?
- Our new neighbor. You okay?

584
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,041
Uh-huh.

585
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,850
You want to go to a birthday party?

586
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,571
What? We just got here.
We haven't even unpacked.

587
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,041
We'll just drop by for 15 minutes,
make an appearance.

588
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,441
<i>- Fifteen minutes?
- Fifteen minutes.</i>

589
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,971
All right.

590
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,641
Shit.

591
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,047
Evie.

592
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,561
Evie. Come back, Evie.

593
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,565
Evie, come on, baby.

594
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,723
Evie, come back, baby.

595
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,411
- I went away?
- Mmm-hmm.

596
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,290
<i>Um, she has epilepsy.</i>

597
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,284
This doesn't happen
unless she forgets to take her meds.

598
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,125
Sorry. I ruined your cake.

599
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,090
No, no, no. It's... I burned it anyway.

600
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,089
The pie! They brought us a pie.

601
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,810
It's on the kitchen counter.
Will you run and get it?

602
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,770
- Oh, yeah. I'll be right back.
- Do you have any more candles?

603
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,442
Chief Garvey has secured the pie.

604
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,602
Pie is secure. Over.

605
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,881
Very interesting family, those Murphys.

606
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,204
Hard to tell if they're part of your story
or you're part of theirs.

607
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,840
I'll see you when you get home, Kevin.

608
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,763
I'm not going anywhere.

609
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,125
You just bring
this pretty little thing over here.

610
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,362
You'll be sorry you said that.

611
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,201
- Let's go, sweetheart.
- Thank you for having us.

612
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,488
Oh, well, thank you for stopping by.

613
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,290
I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better, Kevin.

614
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,488
Yeah, me, too. Bye.

615
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,001
See you later.

616
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,001
Oh, Jesus.

617
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,806
Hey-

618
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,648
- Are you the new neighbors?
- Uh-huh.

619
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,884
Welcome to Miracle.

620
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,880
Thanks.

621
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,364
<i>ERMA". Bye, sweetheart.</i>

622
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,325
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

623
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,850
I like them.

624
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,445
They're nice.

625
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,007
What?

626
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,131
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, just tired.

627
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,484
God damn it! God damn it!

628
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,608
Jesus Christ, it's just a lightbulb.

629
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,967
No, it's not just a lightbulb.
It's the whole fucking house.

630
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,491
What's wrong with you?

631
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,041
This was not the plan.
This was not what it was supposed to be.

632
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,601
- What was it supposed to be?
- Not this!

633
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,890
Not spend all our money on a house
that we've never even seen or been in.

634
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,611
We were supposed to try it out,
see what happens.

635
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,529
And you went all fucking in.

636
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,370
Why? For what?

637
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,681
What?

638
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,403
She needs to be here
'cause it makes her feel safe.

639
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,442
And what if it's no safer here
than anywhere else?

640
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,563
Then why do we have
these awesome wristbands?

641
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,561
Please don't fuck this up, Dad.

642
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,249
I'm fucking it up?

643
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,009
Well, not yet, but...

644
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,202
You're showing potential.

645
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,765
She asleep?

646
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,281
Uh-huh.

647
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,044
I'm an asshole.

648
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,081
Uh-huh.

649
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,805
I'm sorry.

650
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,490
I like it here.

651
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,206
Me, too.

652
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,326
Kevin.

653
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,721
Hmm?

654
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,925
If there's something you want to tell me,
whatever it is, I can handle it.

655
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,011
I love you.

656
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,046
Dad!

657
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,644
The water's gone.

658
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,526
Evie!

659
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,282
Evie!

660
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,922
<i>Evie!</i>

661
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,961
Evie!

662
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,881
Uh-oh.
