1
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,570
One, two, three.

2
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,529
<i>Oh, my God! What am I doing?</i>

3
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,887
<i><i>I can do this. I can do this.</i>

4
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,769
- Ready? You ready? Ready?
- Go. Go. Go.

5
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,371
- Go!
- Jump, jump, jump.

6
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,010
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

7
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,160
- Is it cold?
- It's amazing!

8
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,766
- Come on, chickenshits!
- Oh, my God!

9
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,166
Oh, my God! You bitch!

10
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,204
I'm a bitch?

11
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,966
You new?

12
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,041
Sorry?

13
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
Why're you sorry?

14
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh, I wasn't. I didn't hear you.

15
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,130
What's your name?

16
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,650
- Dr. Goodheart.
- For real?

17
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,481
For real.

18
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,406
What's your first name?

19
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,805
Brian. What's yours?

20
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,165
Evie.

21
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,247
If I pee in here,
it gonna throw off your measurements?

22
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,608
Leave him alone. You're scaring him.

23
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,127
Shut up.

24
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,809
Bye, Dr. Goodheart.

25
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,846
- Bye, Dr. Goodheart.
- Bye, Dr. Goodheart.

26
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,210
Bye.

27
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,125
Okay.

28
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,405
How long you been waiting?

29
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,244
- Just a couple minutes.
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,802
Oh, good God, no! You're no fun.

31
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,411
Yeah, I know.

32
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,769
- They up?
- Just Mom.

33
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,483
- Hey, Mama.
<i>- Hey, babe.</i>

34
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,160
- How was the sleepover?
- Great.

35
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,526
Did you get any sleep?

36
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,762
<i>- You want me to lie?
- Yes, I want you to lie.</i>

37
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,684
- Did you take your meds?
- Yeah.

38
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,045
Sorry.

39
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,003
What about choir practice?
You have a ride?

40
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,161
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,521
What?

42
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,168
- Ah. Wait for your father.
- I'm starving. Where is he?

43
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,924
- Still in bed.
- Oh, Jesus.

44
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,003
Why does he always sleep in this late?

45
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,571
Stop eating the bacon.

46
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,161
John.

47
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,249
<i>- John.
- It really is amazing.</i>

48
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,490
Shh.

49
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,008
Are you serious?

50
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,847
- What?
- Man, get out of bed.

51
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,287
- You gonna eat that bacon?
- Maybe.

52
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,326
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

53
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,765
And what are the factors
influencing your decision?

54
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Leave his bacon alone.

55
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,607
Girl, if you made more,
I wouldn't have to prey upon my children.

56
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,091
If I made more, your heart'd stop.

57
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,808
You can have some of mine.

58
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,409
Thank you.

59
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,882
I got an hour before I run my errands.
You wanna throw?

60
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,008
I have choir practice.
Maybe when I get back?

61
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,361
Oh!

62
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,761
You hear that?

63
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,121
- That's it.
- Please, not again.

64
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,248
- Look,shh.
- You're never gonna find it.

65
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,925
<i>- Where was that?
- It was by the dishwasher, I think.</i>

66
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,684
No, no, it's not by the dishwasher.

67
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,644
It sounded like it came
from the dishwasher.

68
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,842
- It's <i>definitely</i> not <i>by</i> the--
- Hey, if y'all keep talking...

69
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,290
I'm just saying
it's not by the dishwasher.

70
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,044
- Maybe it's in the ceiling.
- You're not gonna find it.

71
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,051
Uh-uh. I'm gonna find it.

72
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,371
Hey.

73
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,042
I got eggs and bacon.

74
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,449
There's a letter in there.

75
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,244
I'll take care of it.

76
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,007
- Hey, how you doing, sir?
- I'm good, I'm good. I'm in 121.

77
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,844
Okay, yeah.
You can go ahead and set up over there.

78
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,286
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

79
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,561
Just a reminder,

80
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,087
<i>you're now required to check in
before you set up your stall.</i>

81
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,364
How are you? How y'all doing?

82
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,650
<i>Just a reminder, you're now required
to check in before you set your stalls up.</i>

83
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,089
<i>Folks, please make sure your vendor number
is clear and visible at your stalls.</i>

84
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,162
<i>All right, folks. Two minutes.
We have two minutes till the first load.</i>

85
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,208
Fucking frackers.

86
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,968
At least it adds to our mystique.

87
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,685
<i>All right, first bus coming in, everybody.
First bus coming in.</i>

88
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,405
<i>All right, first bus coming in, everybody.
First bus coming in.</i>

89
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
- Thank you, Lord.
- Jesus.

90
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,603
<i>- Thank you, Jesus.</i>
<i>- Thank you, Jesus.</i>

91
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,491
<i>WOMAN 'l: Hallelujah. Thank you, God.</i>

92
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,886
- How much?
-It's whatever you wanna give.

93
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,450
This is a test?

94
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,766
No.

95
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,126
Your water, will it make us safe?

96
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,644
It's just a souvenir.

97
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,408
Church service
is just past the 18 marker.

98
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,202
Services are an hour
before the last bus leaves.

99
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,970
God bless you.

100
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,007
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- There's</i> a <i>line.</i>

101
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,521
<i>- People are waiting here.</i>
- I'll <i>just be</i> a <i>minute.</i>

102
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,850
How much is it?

103
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,929
<i>Just $140, if you don't mind.</i>

104
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,081
- Hey, John.
- Isaac.

105
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,047
Uh, didn't mean to interrupt.

106
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,007
No, it's all right.
We were just finishing up.

107
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,921
<i>It's all right.</i>

108
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,883
And you remember,
just after Thanksgiving, all right?

109
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,849
Thank you, Mr. Rainey.

110
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,565
Oh, oh...

111
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,243
You, uh, thirsty? I got lemonade.

112
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,562
Uh, sounds good. Thanks.

113
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,083
Big line.

114
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,642
Seems like business is doing good.

115
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,689
I... I hear you're renting out
your top floor.

116
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,722
Yeah, I filled all the paperwork out
with park services,

117
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,325
and they said okay.

118
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,484
Well, if this is gonna be
a two-family residence,

119
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,610
fire code says
upstairs needs a separate entrance

120
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,922
and its own exterior stairwell.

121
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,121
Oh, uh...

122
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,768
Yeah, I can get all that done.
I just need a couple weeks.

123
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,764
No problem. As long as it happens.

124
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,126
So, uh, let's do this.

125
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,767
Sorry?

126
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,763
Your thing.

127
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,371
Can you do me?

128
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,961
Oh, uh...

129
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,170
- You want a reading?
- Yeah.

130
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,931
A reading.

131
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,207
<i>Okay.</i>

132
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,005
Yeah, sure.

133
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,046
Uh...

134
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,806
You a lefty or righty?

135
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,364
All right.

136
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,962
Okay, try and focus all your energy
into your hand,

137
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,571
and, uh...

138
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,164
And rest your palm down into the paint

139
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>and then press down
as hard as you can on this here paper.</i>

140
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,206
<i>YUP-</i>

141
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,085
<i>Like that.</i>

142
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,331
- Good?
- Yeah, yeah.

143
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,527
- You can lift it.
- Okay.

144
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,762
- Yeah. Got some Wet-Naps there.
- Thank you.

145
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,491
- Paper towel.
-It's a little messy.

146
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,046
All right.

147
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,167
- You got a good one.
- Oh, good.

148
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,130
<i>You got a birthday coming up?</i>

149
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,001
Yeah, day after tomorrow.

150
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,281
Oh.

151
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,090
Happy birthday.

152
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,887
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

153
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,841
What?

154
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,567
- Nothing.
- No, come on. What?

155
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,525
Nothing, man.
I'm not getting anything off you.

156
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,886
Tell me.

157
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,289
Something bad is gonna happen.

158
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,600
To you.

159
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,607
Well, shit, Isaac.

160
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,241
That is not ideal.

161
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,928
Look, I know why you're here, John.

162
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,889
Yeah, listen, you and me

163
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,691
have known each other
since the third grade.

164
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,683
<i>Now, in all those times,</i>

165
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,731
you've never once mentioned to me
that you had superpowers.

166
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,245
<i>I don't have superpowers.</i>

167
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,568
Well, magic powers.

168
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Come on, man.

169
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,129
It's just the two of us talking.

170
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,720
You and me.

171
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,161
Now, this...

172
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,283
It's all bullshit, right?

173
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,564
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

174
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,127
I want you to tell me the truth.

175
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,405
John, what I do

176
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,645
is real.

177
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,801
Ah.

178
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,166
Well...

179
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,970
I gotta respect that.

180
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,165
Now...

181
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,962
<i>How much do I owe you?</i>

182
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,201
No, man, it's on the house.

183
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,646
Uh-uh-uh.

184
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,048
$60 enough?

185
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,571
Hey, John.

186
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,485
Be careful.

187
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,568
Yeah, I sure will.

188
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,081
Ooh!

189
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,325
Knock, knock.

190
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,367
- What?
- Knock, knock.

191
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,045
Who's there?

192
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,091
Broken pencil.

193
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,445
"Broken pencil" who?

194
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,802
Never mind. It's pointless.

195
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,487
Come on.

196
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,205
Gentlemen.

197
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,362
- It's three.
- Two and a half.

198
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,841
- Two.
- Three.

199
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,681
Five.

200
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,247
Jesus, John.

201
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,521
What?

202
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,246
Five?

203
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,046
He's selling a lie,
and folks are buying it.

204
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,325
It's a five.

205
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,161
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

206
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,402
- Leave the house, Isaac.
- Hold up. <i>What</i> are you doing?

207
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,164
Kitchen's over there. Gas stove.

208
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,010
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

209
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,764
John, hold on! John, hold on!
I don't understand!

210
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,405
Oh, you understand.

211
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,726
Okay, okay, what do you want to hear?

212
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,451
This is not real. Okay?
This is all bullshit.

213
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,602
Please. You don't have to do this.

214
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,650
Please, John. Brother, don't do this.

215
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,691
Fuck you, man.

216
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,687
Nah, I ain't leaving.
I'm not leaving my house.

217
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,968
You're gonna have to kill me.

218
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,960
I'm not leaving.

219
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,841
You're gonna need stitches.

220
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,442
I can do it myself, or I can refer you
to a plastic surgeon in Austin.

221
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,887
I was born here.

222
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,042
I have a right to be here.

223
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,046
When did he start burning
people's houses down?

224
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,641
Tonight.

225
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,004
You were who you said you were,

226
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,125
you should've seen it coming.

227
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,051
Yeah, well, you tell your husband
I meant what I said.

228
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,920
Ain't no avoiding it.

229
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,369
Avoiding what?

230
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,565
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

231
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,043
Must be under something.

232
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,530
- You're not gonna find it.
- No, lam gonna find it.

233
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,891
- Well, at least it got you out of bed.
- Oh, ho-ho.

234
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,963
I got out of bed,

235
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,207
so I could join y'all for church.

236
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,921
Mmm-hmm.

237
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,970
"Mmm-hmm," what?

238
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,962
God damn it!

239
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,809
<i>A reading from Thessalonians.</i>

240
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,569
"Now we ask you, brothers,

241
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,451
"to give recognition to those
who labor among you

242
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,570
"and lead you in the Lord
and admonish you."

243
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,801
Yes. Yes.

244
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,601
"And regard them very highly in love
because of their work.

245
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,444
"Be at peace among yourselves."

246
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,726
Yes. Yes.

247
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,128
- "Comfort the discouraged."
- Yes.

248
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,442
-"Help the weak."
- Yes.

249
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,127
<i>-"Be patient with everyone."
- That's right.</i>

250
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,043
"See to it that no one
repays evil for evil to anyone.

251
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,561
"But always pursue what is good."

252
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,161
<i>Yes!
MAN". That's right. That's right.</i>

253
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,968
"For one another and for all."

254
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,248
<i>- CONGREGATION:: Yes.
- Hallelujah.</i>

255
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,044
This is the word of the Lord.

256
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,611
<i>Yes!</i>

257
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,128
We are the 9,261.

258
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,401
We are spared.

259
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,325
We are spared!

260
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,482
- And for that, we are grateful.
- Amen!

261
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,130
Thank you, Michael.

262
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,928
Just a reminder for y'all,

263
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,447
I'm up in Austin this week
getting my surgery.

264
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,126
So if you are so inclined,

265
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,965
ask of the Lord for competent doctors.

266
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,168
<i>Yes!</i>

267
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,288
And a powerful anesthesia.

268
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,290
So I'll miss a few sermons.

269
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,324
But just like my hip,
y'all will get a great replacement.

270
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,250
Met him doing some missionary work
down in Brazil.

271
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,444
- He don't know our style...
- That's all right.

272
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,840
...but he knows the Good Book.

273
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,646
Amen, amen.

274
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,370
<i>Better than most.</i>

275
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,161
Certainly better than me.

276
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,290
My friend, Matt Jamison.

277
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,480
Thank you, Reverend Massey.

278
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,889
I'm so grateful for your kindness
and for letting me be here.

279
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,128
I haven't had the pleasure
of meeting most of you yet.

280
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,521
We've...

281
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,763
My wife, Mary, and I
have only been here for a month or so.

282
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,730
Well, I'm a man of faith.

283
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,722
Amen!

284
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,611
But when I heard about this place,

285
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,125
when I heard about what happened here,

286
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,124
I'd be lying
if I told you I understood it.

287
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,725
Yes, <i>yes.</i>

288
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,570
But I understand it now.

289
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,085
Because you've shared your home with me,

290
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,891
I wanna share with you
what has happened to us, to Mary,

291
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,323
who, I was told by countless doctors,
would never recover.

292
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,527
<i>MASSEY". Thank you, Matt.</i>

293
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,131
We all know what
a truly special place we've got here.

294
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,965
<i>Yes!</i>

295
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,122
<i>And I know I speak
for everyone here when I say,</i>

296
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,321
<i>welcome, brother.</i>

297
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,450
- Welcome!
- Welcome, sister.

298
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,371
Praise Jesus.

299
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,723
<i>Now, let us bow our heads
for a reading from the Gospel of Luke.</i>

300
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,441
- So nice to have you.
- Thank you.

301
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,128
- Hi.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

302
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,963
John. So nice to see your face
in there today.

303
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,406
Hey, I'm not too bad.
Come on, now, Calvin.

304
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,807
You're gonna make the new reverend here
think I never come to church.

305
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,207
- John Murphy.
- John, nice to meet you.

306
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,209
Matt Jamison, my wife, Mary.

307
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,721
Uh... A pleasure, Mary.

308
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,723
Welcome to Jarden.

309
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,960
<i>Now, where you two in from?</i>

310
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,130
Mapleton, New York.
It's just outside the city.

311
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,806
- New York City.
- Ah, figured.

312
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,286
Yeah.

313
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,920
- So what were you gonna say up there?
- I'm sorry?

314
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,491
Well, right before
Calvin here cut you off,

315
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,244
it seemed like you were
about to share something about your wife.

316
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,004
On.

317
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,721
I was just gonna say that I felt a burden
lift off of us when we came to your town.

318
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,922
For the first time, in a long time,
we feel safe.

319
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,243
Well, there's no place in the world safer.

320
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,807
- Y'all take care.
- Thank you.

321
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,889
Sorry, I asked for the bacon
on a separate plate.

322
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,164
You got it.
I'll bring that right back for you.

323
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,446
Every time.

324
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,411
Well, it wouldn't be every time
if they'd listen, sweetheart.

325
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,205
"See to it that no one repays
evil for evil to anyone."

326
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,205
Any particular reason you picked that one?

327
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,724
I didn't pick it.
Readings are predetermined.

328
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
What is a Thessalonian anyway?

329
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,611
Someone from Thessalonia.

330
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,410
From Arkansas, right?

331
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,611
Bacon and eggs separated.

332
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,330
Appreciate it.

333
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,566
Jerry, come on.

334
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,731
Jerry, please. Do you have to...

335
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,764
Sorry, folks.

336
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,361

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,569
<i>WOMAN". We know you didn't depart, Mark.</i>

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,489
<i>Why'd you fake your departure?</i>

343
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,449
No comprende. No comprende.

Tell us why.</i>

<i>Damn! Damn it!</i>

<i>They're gone,

<i>You tried to move on,
tried to live a normal life,</i>

<i>but cannot let go

351

Hey.

352
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,650
My spoon got stuck
in the garbage disposal.

353
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,963
I'm going for a ride.

354
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,049
Other people feed him, you know?

355
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,482
He likes Mom's cooking.

356
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,606
Back by 10:00.

357
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,691
Be safe.

358
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,441
You mail the letter?

359
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,081
Uh-huh.

360
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,890
Good night.

361
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,563
<i>Get off me!
Hey, we just missed the bus.</i>

362
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,484
<i>- Sure, you did. Head down, sir.</i>
<i>- You've no right to do this.</i>

363
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,005
- Ma'am, calm down.
- You can't keep us out.

364
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,605
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Fuck you, man.

365
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,000
This is fucking America. Argh.

366
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,362
<i>You can't keep people out, man.
You're not special.</i>

367
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,329
<i>Fuck your fucking wristbands!</i>

368
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,001
Hello.

369
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,321
Hi.

370
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,006
You wanna pray?

371
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,161
Okay.

372
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,041
- What's that?
- It's a pie.

373
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,891
- Where'd it come from?
- It was on the porch.

374
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,206
Is it for your birthday?

375
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,362
- I don't know.
- There wasn't a note?

376
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,648
Just a pie.

377
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,610
<i>- What kind is</i> it?
- Apple, I think.

378
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,968
- Looks homemade.
- Mmm-hmm.

379
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,960
You think someone's trying to poison you?

380
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,490
Look at your face.

381
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,769
You know, someone just moved in
the Dunbar house.

382
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,321
- A family. Mmm-hmm.
- Just now?

383
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,925
Seem nice.

384
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,370
You know, I think we ought to
invite them over for dinner tonight.

385
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,964
You're gonna work on your birthday?

386
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,763
Just being neighborly.

387
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,724
- Hi.
- Hey.

388
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,168
Saw you moving in. I'm John Murphy.

389
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,810
We're right next door.

390
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,489
Here. Welcome.

391
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,527
Oh, thanks. That's so nice. I'm Nora.

392
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,170
Well, I see you got your hands full.

393
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,681
No problem. I got her.
Did you bake this yourself, John?

394
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,689
No, ma'am, I did not.

395
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,161
And who's this?

396
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,244
This is Lily.
Say hello to Mr. Murphy, Lily.

397
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,570
Hey, Lily.

398
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,610
ls everything all right in there?

399
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,444
Fine, we're just moving in.
You know, chaos.

400
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,523
Of course. Well, I'll leave you to it.

401
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,683
Just wanted to invite y'all over tonight.

402
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,723
Having a little barbecue for my birthday.

403
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,844
That's so...
We don't wanna crash your birthday.

404
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,368
No, no pressure. Just drop by if you can.

405
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,120
Thank you.

406
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,208
'BYE-bye.
- Bye, Lily.

407
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,722
You ask them if they eat meat?

408
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,291
I told them it was a barbecue.

409
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,886
If they don't eat meat,
that would've been the time to tell me.

410
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,929
Violet wants to know
when she can pick me up.

411
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,647
Well, you tell Violet
that you will text her

412
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,882
as soon as I authorize you to do so.

413
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,491
Hello!

414
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,007
Sorry, we rang the doorbell,
but nobody answered.

415
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,208
We're back here. Come on down.

416
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,924
It's Kevin. You're John, right?

417
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,208
Right. Right. This is Erika.

418
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,805
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Erika. How are you? Nice to meet you.

419
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,644
Evie, Michael, introduce yourselves.

420
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,126
- How you doing?
- Michael.

421
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,250
- I'm Jill.
- I'm Nora.

422
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,769
- Hi.
- Hey.

423
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,964
- So we are early or...
- No, right on time.

424
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,043
Oh, I thought this was a birthday party.

425
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,050
It is. We don't have any friends.

426
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,364
<i>- Who is this?</i>
<i>- This is Lily.</i>

427
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,010
<i>Well, hello, Lily.</i>

428
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,007
- She's adorable.
- Thank you.

429
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,322
Is she adopted,
or did your mom fuck a black dude?

430
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,481
Evie!

431
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,126
You don't need that anymore.
You guys bought the house, right?

432
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,647
Yeah, but they said that we should
leave them on for a couple weeks

433
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,201
so the park rangers
don't bother us or something.

434
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,489
Your daughter is good with a baby.

435
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,926
That's gotta be nice.

436
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,809
She's not mine. She's Kevin's.

437
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,809
Oh, well, she's pretty.

438
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,961
So is he.

439
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,767
His secret is moisturizing.

440
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,726
So you have family around here?

441
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,202
- Sorry?
- In Jarden.

442
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,647
I figured someone must have
tipped you off about the house.

443
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,649
Real estate moves
pretty quick around here.

444
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,003
Oh, no, we were just in the right place
at the right time.

445
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,525
I have a brother, Matt Jamison.

446
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,529
He and his wife came out here
a couple months ago.

447
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,808
He's helping out the Baptist church.
You know him?

448
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,721
I just met him yesterday. Small world.

449
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,365
<i>Cake looks good.</i>

450
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,366
Well, she works the grill, I bake.

451
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,929
Now, what happened to your head?

452
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,485
I fell.

453
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,601
<i>Uh...</i>

454
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,922
- Can I put these in the fridge?
- Absolutely.

455
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,321
You want one?

456
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,601
Nah. I don't drink.

457
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,330
But help yourself.

458
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,571
Okay.

459
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,965
What?

460
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,450
What? What?

461
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,523
Oh, what were you looking at?

462
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,402
I was just looking at your couch
in the other room.

463
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,050
We had one just like it.

464
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,085
So I step on the carpet,
and I feel this squish.

465
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,765
I walk around the corner,

466
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,050
and trickling down the steps
like a fancy fountain is water,

467
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,282
but in my house.

468
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,805
So I'm walking up these steps.

469
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,203
And you know when you feel
like it's a bad idea,

470
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,124
but you do it anyway?

471
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,602
I open the bathroom door,
and this wave comes out.

472
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,001
A little one but a wave.

473
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,447
And this one is standing in the bathtub

474
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,651
<i>with her arms out like Moses.</i>

475
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,127
<i>And this one's up on the sink</i>

476
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,930
trying his hardest not to get wet.

477
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,242
And he just looks at me
with this serious face

478
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,041
and goes, "Evie wanted to know
what would happen."

479
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,209
Gets funnier every time, Mama.

480
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,044
- How old were they?
- Five.

481
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,885
And they're lucky they made it to six.

482
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,809
That must've been fun to come home to.

483
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,724
Well, I was in prison.

484
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,803
Yeah? Well, how long were you there for?

485
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,566
Six years, 119 days.

486
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,000
They think you're kidding.

487
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,324
Oh, sorry, no. I really was.

488
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,164
Travis County Unit.

489
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,401
Go ahead. Go ahead and ask.

490
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,001
What?

491
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,570
What I did.
It's what everybody wants to know.

492
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,127
- That's none of our business.
- What'd you do?

493
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,330
Attempted murder.

494
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,967
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,241
What happened?

496
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,169
Didn't try hard enough.

497
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,681
Shit.

498
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,725
Evie. Evie. Evie.

499
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,007
<i>Come back, Evie.</i>

500
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,810
Evie, come back.

501
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,371
Evie, come on, baby.

502
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,370
Evie, come back, baby.

503
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,166
- I went away?
- Mmm-hmm.

504
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,925
<i>ERMA". Um, she has epilepsy.</i>

505
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,163
This doesn't happen
unless she forgets to take her meds.

506
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,051
Sorry. I ruined your cake.

507
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,488
No, no, no, no. It's...
I burned it anyway.

508
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,801
Come on.

509
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,610
The pie! They brought us a pie.

510
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,250
It's on the kitchen counter.
Will you run and get it?

511
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,890
Yep. Yeah, I'll grab it.

512
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,889
Do you have any more candles?

513
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,241
Uh...

514
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,131
Let me check.

515
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,921
Babe, do we have
any more candles back there?

516
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,765
<i>Whenever you need
an extra pair of hands,</i>

517
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,321
you just bring this beautiful thing over.

518
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,050
You'll be sorry you said that.

519
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,531
Thank you.

520
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,081
Thank you so much for having us.

521
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,890
Thank you for stopping by.

522
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,843
I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better, Kevin.

523
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,491
Yeah, me, too. Bye.

524
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,601
Bye.

525
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,803
Uh, see you later.

526
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,282
Jesus.

527
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,281
- Don't open it till I'm gone, okay?
- Why not?

528
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,204
Because it's the greatest
present you ever got,

529
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,691
and I don't want you to make a scene.

530
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,405
Happy birthday, Daddy.

531
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,642
- Back by 11:00.
- Yeah.

532
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,330
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

533
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,201
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

534
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,529
Seat belt.

535
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,120
Let's go.

536
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,171
John! John, wake up!

537
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,244
Holy... Come on!

538
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,488
Let's go.

539
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,971
Give me your hand.

540
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,361
Come on, come on. Watch out.

541
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,211
Michael!

542
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,931
Over here. Stay in the doorway!

543
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,047
Evie!

544
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,121
Where is she?

545
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,568
<i>Hey, it's Evie.
I'm ignoring you,</i>

546
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,721
<i>but I appreciate your persistence.</i>

547
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,210
Hey, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Call us right now.

548
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,562
- Now, did you text her?
- She's not responding.

549
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,609
Just call us, Evangeline.

550
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,046
We need to know where you are.

551
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,051
Uh, hey. John Murphy.

552
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,322
Is Evie there with Taylor?

553
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,162
Taylor didn't come home either.

554
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,400
Hello?

555
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,685
No, Mr. Trousdale. Violet's not here.

556
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,009
Yes, sir. Thanks.

557
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,884
- You sure?
- They swim out there sometimes.

558
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,520
- I don't know if they go out at night.
- You come with me.

559
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,569
You stay here in case she comes back.

560
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,405
She's never done this before.

561
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,083
She'll come home.

562
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,291
<i>Let's go.</i>

563
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,849
<i>Hey, it's Evie.
I'm ignoring you,</i>

564
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,809
<i>but I appreciate your persistence.</i>

565
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,807
Dad!

566
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,481
<i>The water's gone.</i>

567
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,201
Evie.

568
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,404
Evie!

569
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,491
Evie!

570
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,848
Evie!

571
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,129
<i>Evie!</i>

572
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,485
Evie!
