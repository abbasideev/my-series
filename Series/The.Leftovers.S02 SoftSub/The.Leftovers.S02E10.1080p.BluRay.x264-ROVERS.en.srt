1
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,110
Thank you so much for having us.

2
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,190
Well, thank you for stopping by.

3
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:10,065
I'm looking forward to getting
to know you better, Kevin.

4
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah, me, too.

5
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,000
Bye.

6
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:22,745
Hey.

7
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:24,495
Are you the new neighbors?

8
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,745
Uh-huh.

9
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,800
Welcome to Miracle.

10
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,800
Thanks.

11
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,505
Don't open it till I'm gone, okay?

12
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,755
Why not?

13
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,340
Because it's the greatest
present you ever got

14
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,060
and I don't want you to make a scene.

15
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,515
Happy birthday, Daddy.

16
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,935
- Back by 11:00.
- Yeah.

17
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,195
Bye, sweetheart.

18
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:56,695
Bye.

19
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,745
Seat belt.

20
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,700
_

21
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,455
Holy shit.

22
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,090
How long?

23
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:23,475
Were you dead?

24
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,095
Eight hours.

25
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,800
Is she still with you?

26
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,305
Patti?

27
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,355
No. She's gone.

28
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,775
Then it worked.

29
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,900
Did you bury me?

30
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,670
My grandfather told me to.

31
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,840
He's gone, too.

32
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,260
I'm sorry.

33
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,550
Where you went...

34
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,855
did he help you?

35
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:13,310
Yeah. He helped me a lot.

36
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,980
What was it like?

37
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,935
It was like a--

38
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,070
a hotel.

39
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,275
A hotel?

40
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,325
Yeah.

41
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,880
Did you see my sister there?

42
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,165
No.

43
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,930
I saw her somewhere else.

44
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,935
I've got to talk to your father.

45
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,165
How long you been up?

46
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,490
A while.

47
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,960
No coffee in the coffeepot.

48
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,040
What are you drinking?

49
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:30,890
You going to church?

50
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,345
Now why would I do that?

51
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:37,730
It's October 14th.

52
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,430
We go to remember.

53
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,895
I don't want to remember.

54
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,540
John, open it.

55
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,530
Open it or I will.

56
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,200
It's my birthday present and
I'll open it when I'm ready.

57
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,385
Wait!

58
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:21,185
What-- what is it?

59
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,130
She found it.

60
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,270
No, she didn't.

61
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,275
What?

62
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,930
The night she disappeared, I was here

63
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,600
when you and Michael
went to find her.

64
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,365
Chirped the whole time.

65
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,540
She must have caught another
one and put it in the box.

66
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:19,245
And why would she do that?

67
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,085
Because you wouldn't let it go.

68
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,310
Fuck you, Erika.

69
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,670
John.

70
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,660
What happened?

71
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,630
The print on the car
that Evie disappeared from...

72
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,730
Yeah?

73
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,300
You know how we told you
you'd waste your time

74
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,750
trying to match it
with folks in town?

75
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,135
You weren't.

76
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:39,775
Hi.

77
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,495
Uh, hey.

78
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,365
Who are you?

79
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,750
I'm Laurie.

80
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,005
Garvey. Who are you?

81
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:53,205
I'm John. I live next door.
Is Kevin home?

82
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,090
Uh, no, he's--

83
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,095
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Jill.

84
00:12:57,145 --> 00:13:00,215
- I'm looking for your dad.
- Why? What's happening?

85
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:01,680
I just need to talk to him.

86
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,885
You know where he is?

87
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:05,555
No, but I'm sure he'll be back.

88
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,440
Are you?

89
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,140
What?

90
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,025
Sure he'll come back.

91
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,495
Oh, he's definitely coming back.

92
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:34,300
Print matched?

93
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,265
Indeed it did.

94
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,420
You want to talk,
we should go inside.

95
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,855
No, we probably should
talk somewhere neutral.

96
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,560
- Okay.
- Yeah, we'll give you a ride.

97
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,485
Everything's okay.

98
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,405
Stay here.

99
00:13:58,455 --> 00:13:59,740
Everything's fine.

100
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you doing with him?

101
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,800
Just listen to what he has to say.

102
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,890
I'll be all right. Stay here.

103
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,665
Where have you been?

104
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,550
Your dad's.

105
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,755
I thought I told you not
to go over there anymore.

106
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:06,020
I won't.

107
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,725
You going to church?

108
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,285
Go inside and get changed.

109
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,710
Jill.

110
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,090
You're gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

111
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,265
What did you just say?

112
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:52,135
I said you're gonna
have to talk to me.

113
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,220
- I have to talk to you?
- I know.

114
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,105
I know I deserve that and
I know that you're angry.

115
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,740
No!

116
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,445
You don't know shit.

117
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:05,735
I know that your father's not
doing very well right now.

118
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,400
He's got--

119
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,535
he's got some serious problems, Jill,

120
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,325
and I'm sure you know that, too.

121
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,795
I came back here looking
for your brother, okay?

122
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:17,160
And your father asked me to stay.

123
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,460
He asked for my help.

124
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,930
I'm not asking for anything.

125
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,010
Jill, this is your house

126
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,845
and if you want me to, I will leave.

127
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,565
I will leave right now.

128
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,620
He said that we should stay.

129
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,455
Oh, sorry.

130
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,120
Okay.

131
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,740
All right. Okay, sit tight.

132
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm gonna find that feeding tube
and we'll get out of here, okay?

133
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,585
Bingo! Right where Matt said it was.

134
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:49,055
I'm just gonna change her
real quick, okay?

135
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,720
Okay. Okay.

136
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,640
How about some music?
You want some music?

137
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,510
Let's try this. Okay.

138
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,150
I know. I don't like that, either.

139
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:05,820
- Oh, that's better.
- She's staying at her sister's.

140
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,605
- That's better.
- She's not coming back.

141
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:14,360
October, it's always,
you know, hard for her.

142
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,160
I can't believe it's been four years.

143
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,870
Did you lose someone?

144
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,120
Our little girl, Emily.

145
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,705
How old was she?

146
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,425
14 months.

147
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:30,045
She was talking real sentences.

148
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,265
Before any of our friends' kids.

149
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,715
I bragged about it.

150
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:36,650
Well, that's what proud fathers do.

151
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:42,185
Can I ask what happened?
Why your wife left?

152
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:47,440
I want to have another baby.

153
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,865
And your wife?

154
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,950
She says it would hurt too much.

155
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,905
Now, I told her we could start over.

156
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,490
It's a new life.

157
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,125
It'll help us, you know, forget.

158
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,580
You know what, Andy?

159
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm gonna have to side
with your wife on this one.

160
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,050
She's not ready.

161
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,750
That thing inside all of us,

162
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,005
that mechanism
that allows us to love,

163
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:16,555
your wife's, it's broken.

164
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,225
And a new baby's
not going to fix that.

165
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,310
But you know what can?

166
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,815
Jesus.

167
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:31,155
After all, he was
the original Departure, right?

168
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:33,155
Fix that, Jesus.

169
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,160
Yeah, it's okay.

170
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,055
Shh, shh, shh.

171
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,105
Nora.

172
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,995
What are you doing here?

173
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,170
Where's Matt?

174
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,515
Oh, my God.

175
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,270
Hi.

176
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,605
Hi.

177
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,160
Matt.

178
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,680
Is this real?

179
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,550
This is real?

180
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,690
It's real.

181
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,940
Oh, God!

182
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,575
Oh, thank God.

183
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,235
Oh!

184
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:44,070
Are you all right?

185
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,620
I'm a little confused, but okay.

186
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,795
You have to take her back right now.

187
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,715
- What?
- Mary, listen.

188
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:58,000
You can't be out here. It's not--

189
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,305
you have to go back
to town right now.

190
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:01,920
Okay, let's go, then.

191
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,555
No, I can't.

192
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,010
You have to take her back right now.

193
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,890
It's not safe out here. The baby.

194
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,615
The what?

195
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,870
- You didn't tell her?
- I thought you would want to.

196
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,625
I'm pregnant?

197
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:34,955
Now, Mary, do you remember

198
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:38,040
the night you woke up, we, um--

199
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,795
- Had sex?
- Yes.

200
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,560
Of course I remember.

201
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:47,635
Well, you waking up, that happened.

202
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,385
This baby happened

203
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,555
because you were across
that bridge in that town.

204
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:55,525
Now, I'll get there soon enough,
but you've got to go now.

205
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,945
Tell you what-- I'm gonna feed Lily
and I'll come back in 10 minutes.

206
00:22:57,995 --> 00:22:59,730
- Hey, Nora--
- 10 minutes, Matt.

207
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,900
And then I'll take her
back in, I promise.

208
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,450
- Okay, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

209
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:22,215
Hey, where'd you steal her from?

210
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:28,175
That's not your baby.
That's not your baby.

211
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,715
That's not her baby.

212
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,420
_

213
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,125
You know her?

214
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,245
She's your dad's girlfriend, right?

215
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,705
She sprayed me with a hose once.

216
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:59,085
I liked her.

217
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,760
Are you scared for them?
For your family?

218
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,265
There is no family.

219
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,065
Where'd you hear that?

220
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,140
I thought that's the point.

221
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,725
No, Tom.

222
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:20,110
That's not the point at all.

223
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,280
Family is everything.

224
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,255
Here we go.

225
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:55,595
Sorry, ma'am. Park's closed today.

226
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:56,845
Really? Why?

227
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,365
It's October 14th.

228
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,400
It's the anniversary
of the Departure.

229
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,655
It's a time for the townfolks
to be with themselves, reflect.

230
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,745
Reflect on what?

231
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,360
I'm sorry?

232
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,665
Well, nothing happened
here to the townsfolk.

233
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:18,420
It's kind of like a temple
closing down on Christmas.

234
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,220
Not really your holiday,
don't you think?

235
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:26,045
I'm sorry, ma'am, but
unless you have a wristband

236
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:29,425
or a dispensation form, I'm gonna
have to ask you to turn around.

237
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,355
I have 35 pounds
of plastic explosive.

238
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,570
Will that work?

239
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,225
What?

240
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Whoa!

241
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:45,245
Stop! Someone-- Hey!

242
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,915
We have a runner on the bridge.

243
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,915
- We have a runner on the bridge.
- Go, let's go!

244
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,670
Let's go!

245
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,010
Stop!

246
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,145
Get down on the ground now!

247
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,200
I said get down!

248
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,070
Get on the ground now!

249
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:37,745
Get in there, cuff her.

250
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:42,955
We got an unauthorized
vehicle on the bridge.

251
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:45,920
Possible code blue.
I repeat, possible code blue.

252
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,705
Which one is yours?

253
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:18,405
What?

254
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:21,410
Well, they took your dog
when you got here, right?

255
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,910
Which one is he?

256
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,465
I know we're not here
to talk about my dog, John.

257
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,080
No, that's exactly
why we're here, Kevin.

258
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,420
You tell me where my daughter is

259
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,435
and I'll let you take your dog home.

260
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:37,425
I don't know where your daughter is,

261
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,010
but I know she didn't depart.

262
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,895
No? Well, what did she do?

263
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,730
She staged it.

264
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,070
She and her friends,
to make it look like--

265
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,790
And you know this how?

266
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,325
I saw her do it.

267
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:04,585
You saw her do it

268
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:06,420
and you waited all
this time to tell me?

269
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,955
I didn't remember until this morning.

270
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,840
What sparked it, this memory?

271
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,210
What do you want me
to tell you, John?

272
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,545
I want you to tell me the truth.

273
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:17,730
What made you remember?

274
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,150
I died.

275
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,410
I had a-- a problem.

276
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,535
Michael took me to his grandfather's.

277
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,620
He said he could help.
He gave me, like, a--

278
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,985
My son took you
to meet his grandfather?

279
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,905
Yeah, Virgil. He helped me.

280
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,405
No, Michael wouldn't do that.

281
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:46,160
Listen, man, he did.
I swear, man, he did.

282
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,960
Prove it.

283
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:55,885
The old man told me
what he did to you.

284
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,445
I'm so sorry.

285
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm sorry. No one should ever--

286
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,150
Man, shut the fuck up. That's a lie.

287
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,065
He didn't do nothing to me.
You don't know shit.

288
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,655
All right, now--

289
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:18,775
look, let's stay focused, man,

290
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,445
because, see, I want
to make sure I get this.

291
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:23,075
Yeah.

292
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,365
You saw my daughter

293
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:30,585
pretend to disappear

294
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,875
and the only reason
you remember that today

295
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,975
is because you came
back from the dead?

296
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:41,095
I know you don't think
it can happen here, John,

297
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,765
but it did.

298
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:47,435
You're right, Kevin.
That can't happen here.

299
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,855
But I need you to explain me this.

300
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:55,060
Evie loved her mother.

301
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,580
She loved her brother.

302
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,200
And she loved me.

303
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,905
So why in God's name

304
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,455
would she do this to us?

305
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:11,495
I don't know.

306
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:15,965
Okay, well, take a fucking guess.

307
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,755
Maybe she didn't.

308
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:22,720
What?

309
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,975
Love you.

310
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,815
Who knows what goes
through people's heads?

311
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,355
You know, your daughter--

312
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:04,430
Hey!

313
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,300
- What's going on?
- John, it's Evie. Follow us.

314
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,555
What?

315
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,405
- Evie!
- John, you gotta get back.

316
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,275
No, you have got to let me through.

317
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,245
We can't. There's a
bomb in the trailer.

318
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:08,910
- What?
- Buddy, you gotta go back.

319
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,365
John, you gotta get back. The
trailer is rigged with explosives.

320
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:14,785
Why-- why would anybody do-- Evie!

321
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:16,585
What happened?

322
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,725
Can I borrow those?

323
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,820
It's the three girls.

324
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,610
What three girls?

325
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,995
The ones who departed.

326
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,680
_

327
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,490
No, no, no, no.

328
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,660
We won't be able to get back in.

329
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,830
They're gonna blow up the bridge!

330
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,250
There's a bomb!

331
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,730
Blow it up! Blow it up!

332
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,645
Blow it up! Blow it up!

333
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,735
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

334
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,255
♪ Our hearts were
pure, we knew for sure ♪

335
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:44,625
♪ A miracle ♪

336
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:50,380
♪ That God had spared our town ♪

337
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:05,280
October 14th.

338
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,330
Four years ago.

339
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,785
Everywhere else in the world,

340
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:13,905
they knew something had happened.

341
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,740
Yeah.

342
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,990
But we didn't.

343
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,210
No.

344
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,375
Not until the phones started ringing.

345
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,465
Till we turned on our televisions.

346
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:33,175
And we ran out onto the streets.

347
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:34,810
Found each other.

348
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,260
Yes, we did.

349
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,930
And everyone asked
the same question--

350
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,945
is everyone okay?

351
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,155
Is everyone still here?

352
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:49,355
Yes.

353
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:51,690
- And we were.
- Amen.

354
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,910
We were still here.

355
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,245
Amen.

356
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,165
We were--

357
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:14,930
Michael has asked to say a few words.

358
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,860
My mom tells a story.

359
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,060
A lot of you have probably heard it.

360
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,730
She says that there was water

361
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,900
trickling down
the stairs in our house.

362
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,120
And when she followed it up, she saw
that it was coming from the bathroom.

363
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,910
She opened the door and she swears
a wave just washed past her.

364
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,465
And there were me and Evie,

365
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,600
five years old
and an overflowing tub.

366
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,775
My mom says she asked
Evie why she did it.

367
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,515
And my sister said, "I just
wanted to see what would happen."

368
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,485
That's the story that you always tell

369
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:12,655
and everyone laughs,
even me and Evie.

370
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,775
She laughed to protect you, Mom,

371
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,960
because it's not the truth.

372
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:27,085
I'm the one who turned the water on.

373
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:34,625
I turned it on all the way
because Evie was crying so loud

374
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:37,045
and she didn't want you to hear.

375
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:41,185
She was crying because we didn't
know why our father was gone.

376
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:44,350
Or why he did what he did.

377
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,070
But she was crying so loud.

378
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:54,610
So I turned the water on
and I drowned her out.

379
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,750
Until she could pretend she was okay.

380
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:05,340
Nobody disappeared from here on
October 14th four years ago.

381
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,675
But they did before.

382
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,380
And after.

383
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:19,885
We are the 9,261.

384
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:24,140
We are not spared.

385
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,625
That's not your baby.

386
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:23,310
That's not your baby.

387
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,600
- She doesn't belong to you.
- Shut the fuck up!

388
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:38,730
It's okay.

389
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,945
It's okay.

390
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,005
That clock, what is that?

391
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,660
What's inside here?

392
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,845
Y'all just gonna blow yourselves up?

393
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,020
Whoo!

394
00:40:58,525 --> 00:40:59,860
Y'all need to move back now.

395
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,225
Everybody move back.

396
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,030
- Back up. Ma'am, back up, please.
- Dad.

397
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,530
Sir, I want you to step back.

398
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,115
- Back up.
- Step back.

399
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,450
- Back up.
- Erika!

400
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,735
Everybody, back up.

401
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,320
Get off the bridge!

402
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,340
Erika!

403
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,210
Are you just gonna blow yourself up?

404
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,665
'Cause if that's what it is,

405
00:41:22,715 --> 00:41:25,300
I'm not leaving
this bridge, Evangeline.

406
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm not.

407
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:31,020
You're just gonna
have to blow me up, too.

408
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,320
Get out of my way!

409
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,500
It's empty!

410
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,300
It's empty! It's empty!

411
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:04,220
It's empty!

412
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:11,965
Oh, Lord!

413
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:14,765
Nothing. It's zero.

414
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:56,425
Okay, rangers, hold that gate.

415
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:58,895
Get away from the fence.
Everybody, back off.

416
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,430
Hold the fence. Hold the--

417
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,100
- Back off!
- Back off!

418
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,185
- Everyone, back off!
- Pull back!

419
00:43:05,235 --> 00:43:06,850
- Right there.
- Pull back!

420
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,240
There's too many of them.
Let them go.

421
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,290
Let them go!

422
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,780
Why are you doing this?

423
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,750
I don't understand.

424
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,080
_

425
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:35,230
We need to go now.

426
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,740
Okay, my car's over there.
We can pack--

427
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,610
- No, we're going in.
- Matt.

428
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,530
Mary, I need you to trust me.

429
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,280
We need to get you
and the baby back in.

430
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,130
Now is our chance. Do you trust me?

431
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,255
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go.

432
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:51,505
Matt, wait.

433
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,560
Wait!

434
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,265
She's not yours.

435
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:01,100
Hey! Hey!

436
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,240
Hey!

437
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:36,100
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Hurry up.

438
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:19,845
Nora.

439
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,700
It's okay. You're safe.

440
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:45,955
Okay. Hey.

441
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:48,375

Motherfucker!

446
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,115

Dad?

448
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:46,275
Can you hear me?

449
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:48,195
I'm not fucking doing this again.

450
00:48:48,245 --> 00:48:49,910

451
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,800
Fuck!

452
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:44,800
- Hello?
- Mr. Garvey?

453
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,250
Yeah?

454
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,420
We're aware this isn't
your jurisdiction.

455
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,220
You're a police officer, right?

456
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,090
Uh, that's right.

457
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,510
Something terrible
is happening in the lobby bar.

458
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,765
Another officer, he's being attacked.

459
00:49:57,815 --> 00:49:59,515
I think they're gonna kill him.

460
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:01,480
I'll be right there.

461
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,630
Yeah.

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,130
- - Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

You're all lovely people.

465
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:39,970
Who wants to spin the wheel?

466
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,275
An officer of the law.

467
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:44,575
Will you regale us
with a tune, Officer?

468
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,950
- No.
- I will. I want to.

469
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,870

Of course you fucking know me.

477
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,845
We met on the bridge. You
tied a noose around my neck.

478
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:24,350
Oh, sure. I remember.

479
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,850
The uniform threw me off.

480
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,820
- Did you call me?
- Call you?

481
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,575
I got a call. There was a cop
getting attacked down here.

482
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:35,660
Huh. Only cop I see around
here is you, Officer.

483
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:39,200
Suppose this crowd could turn on
anyone if they can't sing for shit.

484
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,115
Just tell me what I
need to do to get back.

485
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,370
Why do you want to go back?

486
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,005
Because I have a family.
Because I love them and I--

487
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:49,510
Yes, you love your family.
It's not your time.

488
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,340
Still got so much to live for.

489
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,380
Oh, come on, be original, mate.

490
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,715

491
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:01,605
Because I deserve to.

492
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:03,555
You deserve to?

493
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,980
Yes. Now tell me how.

494
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,280
I already did.

495
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,285
Excuse me?

496
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:17,285
If you want to get out of here,
all you have to do is sing.

497
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:21,075
I don't believe you.

498
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,625
Why not?

499
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:24,075

501
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,880
