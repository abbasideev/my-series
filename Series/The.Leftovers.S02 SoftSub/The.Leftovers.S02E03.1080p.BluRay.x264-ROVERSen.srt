1
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,401
Come with me.

2
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,406
Hey.

3
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,724
This is Susan.

4
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,962
I told her it was safe here.

5
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,571
Hi, Susan.

6
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,251
I'm Laurie.

7
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,644
Would you like to join us?

8
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,845
So there's a bathroom
down the hall.

9
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,925
It's not locked,

10
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,926
but as long as you're in there after 9:00,
you probably won't see anyone.

11
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,001
I need to go across the street
to get some of my things,

12
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,369
but if it's okay, I'd like to come back

13
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,166
<i>and sleep here for the next few nights</i>

14
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,602
so you're not alone.

15
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,761
Is that okay?

16
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,285
<i>These are for you.</i>

17
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,965
Oh, and...

18
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,964
My number is the only one
programmed in there,

19
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,363
so if you need anything ever,
you just call me.

20
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,126
The phone can't text,
so you'll have to talk.

21
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,886
You married?

22
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,006
Kids?

23
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,446
Me, too.

24
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,762
Tommy, the one that brought you out,

25
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,126
he's my son.

26
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,489
If you let me, I will help you come back.

27
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,720
You can.

28
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
I did.

29
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,129
<i>But I am grateful for it.</i>

30
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,366
<i>And I don't need to know how it works.</i>

31
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,003
<i>I just need to know that the world</i>

32
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,001
<i>is in decay.</i>

33
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,245
<i>And I can feel your pain coming off you</i>

34
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,370
<i>in hot, throbbing waves.</i>

35
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,361
<i>And I can take it.</i>

36
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,371
<i>I can take it from you.</i>

37
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,286
<i>Who wants a hug?</i>

38
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,046
What time is it?

39
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,641
It's almost midnight.

40
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
Go sleep in my bed.

41
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,962
I'm gonna go back over there, be with her.

42
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,722
<i>You want me to make you a sandwich?</i>

43
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,246
No.

44
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,329
You find the next hive yet?

45
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,970
<i>Don't call them that.</i>

46
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,207
Why?

47
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,128
Because they're people,
Tommy, not insects.

48
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,562
I know they're people.

49
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,609
<i>I did hear of a house in Hackensack.</i>

50
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,969
It's got almost 30 members.

51
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,204
You know, you just got
to give yourself a few days,

52
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,930
get yourself back.

53
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,410
Myself back?

54
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,050
I'm worried about you.

55
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,126
They know your face now.

56
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,764
Maybe you should try something else.

57
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,001
They don't know shit.

58
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,131
Chapters are spread all over.
They don't talk to each other.

59
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,887
Jesus, they don't talk at all.

60
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,203
It only works from the inside.

61
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,841
It's the only way for me
to get them to trust me.

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,731
The only way for me
to get them to trust you.

63
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,526
Fuck Hackensack.

64
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,289
You go get 'em, kiddo.

65
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,005
You ever miss it?

66
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,321
<i>What?</i>

67
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,646
The quiet.

68
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,647
No.

69
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,887
What is that?

70
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,801
Sorry?

71
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,165
What are you writing?

72
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,086
Oh, it's a book.

73
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
What's it about?

74
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,280
It's about us.

75
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,128
There she is. Dr. Ruth.

76
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,845
- Hey, good morning, Viktor.
- Hey.

77
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,168
- You got a light?
- I quit.

78
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,728
Really? Me, too.
Here, let me get this for you.

79
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Ah, so how's the counseling business?

80
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,688
- So far so good.
- Really?

81
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,127
Uh, if you need anything
else in the space,

82
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,930
I got a guy who can
rent you out some furniture.

83
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,241
Ah, no, we're okay. We're okay.

84
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,404
And, hey, I know...
I know it's a little late,

85
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,528
but I'll have the check
for you on Friday, okay?

86
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,205
Yeah, all right. No problems.

87
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,360
That's great. Yeah, uh, Laurie? Uh...

88
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,929
It's gonna be an extra 200
here on out, okay?

89
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,526
- Why?
- Because this is a commercial building

90
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,284
and you got people living there.

91
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,769
No, no, sometimes I work late.

92
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,926
Yeah, well, you know, these toilets,

93
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,403
they can handle day poops,
not night poops.

94
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,129
Okay, look, I'm writing a book.

95
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,326
It's going really well,

96
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,165
but, you know,
money's just a little tight right now.

97
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,888
Yeah, well, see if you
can shake some loose.

98
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,966
Okay.

99
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,811
Those bagels?

100
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,201
Oh...

101
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,362
<i>Everybody walks around
like nothing happened.</i>

102
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,726
<i>They don't even think about it.</i>

103
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,121
<i>Like they just had it erased or something.</i>

104
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,768
The stuff they care about
just feels so stupid sometimes.

105
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,891
What do you care about?

106
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,966
My family.

107
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,689
Was that a question? 'Cause your voice
kind of went up at the end.

108
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,485
On.

109
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,721
We were eating dinner, it was nice,

110
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,203
and then my husband said something,
I said something back.

111
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,328
And while I'm talking, I'm thinking,

112
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,084
<i>"This is so fake.</i>

113
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,404
<i>"You're in someone else's movie
and you're just saying lines."</i>

114
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,366
I felt...

115
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,161
Outside.

116
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,123
Beats the fuck out of inside.

117
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,686
You are not welcome here.

118
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,443
- How'd they find us?
- Doesn't matter.

119
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,331
<i>They can't hurt you now.</i>

120
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
They're cowards.

121
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,251
You leave.

122
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,089
And then after a while,
he asked me if I wanted to come in.

123
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,324
What did you talk about?

124
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,330
How Kyle was doing.

125
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,168
Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.

126
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,524
And then he asked me if I was coming home.

127
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,725
Sounds like you're surprised.

128
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,684
I didn't think he'd want me to.

129
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,126
<i>But</i> he does.

130
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,481
Maybe.

131
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,161
You don't believe him?

132
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,526
He was just so nice.

133
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,603
I mean, I was just gone

134
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,285
for almost two months,

135
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,681
and it was just like
water under the bridge.

136
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,565
Because I know he's angry.

137
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,366
You don't know that.
Maybe he just wants you home.

138
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,202
Yeah, but he's angry, too.

139
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,726
Like you.

140
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,448
I'm not angry.

141
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,687
Okay.

142
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,406
Susan.

143
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,521
Your family doesn't want to hit you.

144
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,330
They want to forgive you.

145
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,765
This is Howard.

146
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,405
I told him it was safe here.

147
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,000
Hello, Howard.

148
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,841
I'm Laurie.

149
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,290
Would you like to join us?

150
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,046
<i>Resurrection ?</i>

151
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,804
<i>That's the claim from Australia.</i>

152
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,130
<i>As witnesses describe a man
previously believed dead</i>

153
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,850
<i>emerging from a cave in Wanneroo</i>

154
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,650
<i>outside the city of Perth.</i>

155
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,607
<i>MAN". Walked out covered in mozzie bites,</i>

156
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,723
<i>saying he'd just been in a hotel.</i>

157
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,690
<i>The man, identified as David Burton--</i>

158
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,330
I made you a grilled cheese.

159
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,486
Jill texted you.

160
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,366
You went through my phone?

161
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,683
It was lying right there and it buzzed,
and I couldn't help it.

162
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,405
You two are meeting tomorrow?

163
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,401
Can I drive you?

164
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,931
She's not ready yet, Mom.

165
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,481
If I wrote her a note,
would you give it to her?

166
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,161
<i>Okay-</i>

167
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,120
Can I drive you?

168
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,289
I promise, she won't even see me.

169
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,804
It'll be like I'm not even there.

170
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,086
Okay.

171
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,801
What are you doing?

172
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,651
Nothing. There was a... It's nothing.

173
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,364
Jill's happy.

174
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,641
- Did she take my letter?
- Yeah.

175
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,206
Yeah, she did.

176
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,844
- What's going on?
- The door's padlocked.

177
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,923
They threw us out.
They put all the stuff in the hallway.

178
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,526
- No.
- Where am <i>I</i> gonna <i>stay?</i>

179
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,091
<i>It's okay.
We can meet at our apartment.</i>

180
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,366
<i>We'll figure this out, okay?</i>

181
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,722
- Has anybody seen my laptop?
- Are you sure it was in there, Mom?

182
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,406
Yes, Tom. I was writing here this morning.

183
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,404
And this is everything?
This was everything in the hallway?

184
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,766
Mom, calm down.

185
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,366
My book was on it,
and I don't have a backup.

186
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,726
You didn't email it to yourself?

187
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,444
That motherfucker took it.

188
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,767
I know I'm behind,
but I can get you that money.

189
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,371
I just need to move some things around.

190
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,602
Okay, so as soon as you do,

191
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,970
you can get your space back.

192
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,451
- I need my laptop.
- Your what?

193
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,931
My laptop. it was in the office.

194
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,320
It was on one of those cots.

195
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,564
The cots no one's sleeping on?

196
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,886
Mmm-hmm.

197
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,169
Uh, Viktor, look, I'm sorry.

198
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,084
My work, the people that I'm helping,

199
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,605
they need... They... I...

200
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,161
I shouldn't have lied to you.

201
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,600
And I will get you that money.

202
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,961
You can even have the laptop.

203
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,600
I just need one file off of it, my book.

204
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,564
I just... I can't write it again.

205
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,484
I just cannot start over.

206
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,523
If I give you your file back,

207
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,004
that would be proof
that I have your computer.

208
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,330
<i>- Is that</i> your <i>son?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

209
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,851
Don't you want to go home tonight
and tell him that you're a good man?

210
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,886
That somebody asked for help
and you gave it to them?

211
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,246
My kid's an asshole.

212
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,130
And I don't have your laptop.

213
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,521
Mom!

214
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,244
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

215
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,401
What the fuck?

216
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,571
Hey! Hey!

217
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,405
Who the fuck are you?

218
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,523
What did you do in my house? Hey!

219
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,041
What the fuck?

220
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,891
<i>Is your mattress soft?</i>

221
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,041
Sorry?

222
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,568
Susan is used to sleeping on the floor,
and then a cot,

223
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,405
so comfort takes some getting used to.

224
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,891
Oh. Oh.

225
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,163
It's one of those foam memory ones,

226
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,288
you know, that adapts to your contours.

227
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,481
Wow.

228
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,161
That's fancy.

229
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,367
Well, you might find Susan
sleeping on the floor

230
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,086
or on the couch, and if that happens,

231
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,171
I would just gently encourage her
to come back to bed.

232
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,801
Yeah, I...

233
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,401
I can do that.

234
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,725
What are you thinking?

235
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,771
Is she gonna talk about it?

236
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,244
Look, I don't want to say something
that makes her leave again.

237
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,524
My husband... Or my ex-husband, Kevin,

238
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,291
he thought that I left
because of him, too.

239
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,849
Of course he did.
I couldn't tell him otherwise.

240
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,010
You didn't make her leave.

241
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,441
They did.

242
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,130
<i>She's not gonna leave you again.</i>

243
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,209
<i>And she's not gonna go back to them.</i>

244
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,646
Tell him.

245
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,921
I'm not.

246
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,167
Thank you.

247
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,006
Welcome home.

248
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,409
You want to follow me around, huh?

249
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,962
You want to stand outside
my fucking house?

250
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,324
You want to say something to me,
you little pussy?

251
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,201
Talk!

252
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,606
Fucking talk!

253
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,969
Shh, shh.

254
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,564
You don't have to do that.
You don't have--

255
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,406
Get the fuck off me!

256
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,682
Hey, I didn't do it. Get the fuck--

257
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,046
Get off me!

258
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,930
Motherfucker! Fuck you!

259
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,921
<i>Fuck you! Get--</i>

260
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,530
Listen, you don't have to...
I didn't do anything.

261
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,687
Wait, what are you... What are you doing?

262
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,047
You don't...

263
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,247
Hey-

264
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,527
Wait.

265
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,121
Wait.

266
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,962
Get the fuck off me! Get off me!

267
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,211
Fuck you! Get off me!

268
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,961
Get off me!

269
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,243
Fuck!

270
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,961
Fuck!

271
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,921
Please.

272
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,520
Please don't.

273
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,608
Tell your mom Meg says hello.

274
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,285
<i>It's</i> a <i>great piece.</i>

275
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,125
<i>Special occasion?</i>

276
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,329
Oh, it's for a meeting.

277
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,884
With a publisher.

278
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,480
I wrote a book.

279
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,285
I mean, I just sent it to some places.

280
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,771
I wasn't holding my breath, you know?

281
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,681
But then one called
and wanted me to come in.

282
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,645
So that's got to be good, right?

283
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,201
It's got to be.

284
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,728
Right, it's $849.

285
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,926
What's your return policy?

286
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,046
Who's Meg?

287
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,843
- What?
- Who's Meg?

288
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,843
What? Why aren't you
at the New Rochelle house?

289
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,525
Who is she, Mom?

290
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,846
She's a woman in Mapleton.

291
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,364
I... When I was on the inside,
they had me recruit her.

292
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,170
I haven't really seen her since I got out.

293
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,961
- You recruited her?
- Yeah.

294
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,646
Like you recruited me?

295
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,286
- Tommy, that's not--
- It's fucking useless, you know?

296
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,841
- What?
- The program! The meetings!

297
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,287
What we're doing!

298
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,761
-It's not working, Mom.
- Honey, tell me what happened.

299
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,127
What happened is I'm in there!
I'm in there with them!

300
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,726
But you forgot what it's like!
They make sense!

301
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,406
- They know something!
- No, that's it. You're done.

302
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,241
You're done.
You are not going back in there.

303
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,845
And you don't need to.

304
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,000
They are going to publish my book, Tommy.

305
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,090
And when people read
about what's going on in those houses,

306
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,846
we will win! We are going to beat them!

307
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,804
This is working!

308
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,247
Sweetie...

309
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,884
This is working.

310
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,327
Morning.

311
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,886
Morning.

312
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,442
Oh, come on,
what did he think I meant?

313
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,921
The guy's got ignorance
down to an art form.

314
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,364
Shit, I mean science.

315
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,126
Down to a science.

316
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,282
I mean, you can't be
responsible for anything

317
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,965
if you say you don't understand it.

318
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,606
You know?

319
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,210
But you try and pin him down about it,

320
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,771
and he just looks at you.

321
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,730
And he's like,
"Well, why do you care so much anyway?"

322
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,291
Then you're on the defensive,
just like that.

323
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,240
I don't know.

324
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,368
<i>Just praying for the day
that he gets transferred.</i>

325
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,289
<i>Whole place would be better off.</i>

326
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,931
Honey, you're in the wrong lane.

327
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,287
<i>-- Hey! No, you can't.</i>

328
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,841
<i>Susan, it's the wrong lane! Susan, stop!</i>

329
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,526
It's the wrong lane. Stop! Jesus Christ!

330
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,801
Stop!

331
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,046
<i>Hi, may I help you?</i>

332
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,841
Yes, I have an 11:00 appointment
with Peter Benedetto.

333
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,604
It's Laurie Garvey.

334
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,841
Great.

335
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,480
Laurie's here.

336
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,881
Okay.

337
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,403
They'll be ready for you
in just a few minutes.

338
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,925
You can have a seat right there.

339
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,450
Can I get you something to drink?

340
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,651
Uh, no. I'm great.

341
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,646
They love your book.

342
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,922
- They do?
- Oh, yeah.

343
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,607
Big time.

344
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,480
Hi, it's Laurie.

345
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,846
I'm sorry, what?

346
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,802
Uh, no. I--

347
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,770
I-- Can you--

348
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,602
I need you to slow down
and say that again.

349
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,206
Do you know if they're...

350
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,086
Okay.

351
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,491
Okay, <i>I'll</i> try--

352
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,448
Okay. No, l...

353
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,246
I'll call you back.

354
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,326
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to...

355
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,403
I just found out
a friend of mine was in an--

356
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,642
Laurie. Peter.

357
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,487
I'm not kidding,
I've been waiting for this all week.

358
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,280
Ready to come on back?

359
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,204
- Sure.
- Come on. Come on.

360
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,242
Well, Laurie, I should tell you

361
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,641
we almost never accept
unsolicited material,

362
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,166
but Kerry here
is the queen of the slush pile

363
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,084
<i>and she came to me and she said,</i>

364
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,324
"I think I may have just read
the next What's Next. <i>"</i>

365
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,610
You know What's <i>Next,</i> right?
Patrick Johansen.

366
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,845
Oh, yes. Of course.

367
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,364
Yeah, it was a huge book. Inspirational.

368
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,887
People wanted to know
how he was able to move on.

369
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,244
And you, you're coming at this
from a completely different angle.

370
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,045
<i>-- The whole cult thing</i>

371
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,611
<i>from an insider's perspective.</i>

372
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,161
<i>- I love it.
- I'm so</i> sorry.

373
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,685
Let me just put this on silent.

374
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,170
Hey, there's a great alt title.

375
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,530
<i>Let Me Just Put This On Silent.</i>

376
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,046
So listen, Laurie,
as soon as we have a deal locked in,

377
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,202
I want you and Martin
to sit down together.

378
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,046
<i>He did What's Next, Departure 3.0.</i>

379
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,247
<i>He's a great editor.</i>

380
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,763
<i>And he's got some terrific ideas.</i>

381
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,244
Help you sharpen the edges.
Get some clarity to it.

382
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,801
Clarity?

383
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,523
Yeah. Like the smoking.

384
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,010
You never really explain
why they make you smoke all the time.

385
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,360
Because it was never
really explained to me.

386
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,324
<i>Yeah,
but they have a <i>story, right?</i>

387
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,766
I don't understand.

388
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,207
A story. A myth.

389
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,602
Uh, a rule book that says do this,
this way or else.

390
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,129
Like, for instance, the Catholics believe

391
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,851
that Christ died
on the cross for our sins.

392
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,162
The Branch Davidians believe that God

393
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,011
told David Koresh
to fuck his own daughters, uh...

394
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,964
This wing nut in Australia

395
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,847
says that he went to the other side
and he can't die.

396
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,685
We know what the Guilty Remnant does,

397
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,370
but what do they believe?

398
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,604
They believe the world ended.

399
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,884
Okay, all right. All right, great.

400
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,725
So that's...
You and Martin will work on that.

401
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,043
But the bigger issue

402
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,682
is we've got to put
some feeling into this thing.

403
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,644
- Sorry?
- Feeling.

404
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,601
<i>Emotion.</i>

405
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,602
<i>I mean, there's some
heartbreaking stuff in here, um...</i>

406
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,567
Um...

407
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,201
The lighter.

408
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,289
The lighter.

409
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,641
<i>From your daughter with the engraving,
"Please come home, Mom."</i>

410
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,043
It said, "Don't forget me."

411
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,281
Even better.

412
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,523
See,Laurie,
that's what this book wants to be.

413
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,683
If you want people to connect with it,

414
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,008
you have to tell them how it felt.

415
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,490
How what felt?

416
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,920
The realization.

417
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,731
When you figured out that these people

418
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,281
that you left your family for
are fucking whack jobs.

419
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,680
Okay. Uh...

420
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,044
<i>Oh, your daughter,</i> um...

421
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,650
<i>- Jill.
- Jill, yes.</i>

422
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,007
<i>The fire.</i>

423
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,011
<i>My God, when I read that,
I couldn't believe it.</i>

424
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,850
<i>But the fact-checkers said you were there.</i>

425
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,483
<i>And Jill, she was there because
these people had you brainwashed, right?</i>

426
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,964
Then they got you
to let your own daughter into the house

427
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,485
so that you would burn together.

428
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,524
<i>But then you break free.</i>

429
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,929
<i>And when you finally speak</i>

430
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,651
<i>for the first time in,
what was it, a year?</i>

431
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,362
<i>You shout Jill's name to your husband,</i>

432
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,807
<i>the same guy these people
made you divorce.</i>

433
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,205
<i>And he goes running in.</i>

434
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,124
<i>I mean, she's in there because of you.</i>

435
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,842
<i>But you can't save her.</i>

436
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,649
<i>He's the one to save her</i>

437
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,407
<i>because all you can do
is stand there and watch.</i>

438
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,850
And I know all of this, Laurie,
because you put it in your book.

439
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,449
<i>But what I don't know, Laurie,
and what I need to know</i>

440
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,330
<i>is how you feel about it.</i>

441
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,606
Garvey.

442
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,646
They like my book.

443
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,402
What she did, it wasn't our fault.

444
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,042
She was fucked up, Mom. We tried.

445
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,484
They won't jump out of the way.

446
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,009
- What?
- I don't want to hurt them,

447
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,367
but they won't jump out of the way.

448
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,845
Mom, I know you're fucked up,

449
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,520
but everyone's back at our place right now
and they're all losing their shit.

450
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,049
So can you keep yours together?

451
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,565
Why are we losing?

452
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,929
Because they're giving them something.

453
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,726
We can strip it away, but once it's gone,

454
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,126
we have nothing to put back in its place.

455
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,883
Well, let's give them something.

456
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,883
<i>Therapists have</i>
a <i>lot of rules.</i>

457
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,610
Only one really matters.

458
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,449
<i>Don't talk about yourself.</i>

459
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,448
I spent the first weeks
after the Departure just waiting.

460
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,806
I'm still waiting.

461
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,006
We all are.

462
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,606
I had a patient who said she could

463
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,600
feel that something
terrible was gonna happen.

464
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,046
And it did.

465
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,686
So the next time I saw her
a few months later,

466
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,925
she was wearing white,
smoking a cigarette.

467
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,282
She knew I was afraid

468
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,689
and confused and alone.

469
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,971
And the next thing I knew,
I was screaming my daughter's name,

470
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,531
thinking that I had killed her.

471
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,440
Her name is Jill.

472
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,767
And I don't think
she'll ever speak to me again.

473
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,531
But there is another story.

474
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,970
It's one that I've kept to myself

475
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,166
because I had to

476
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,406
to protect my son.

477
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,006
Tell them.

478
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,650
Tell them, Tommy.

479
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,600
<i>They need you to.</i>

480
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,165
Have you heard of Holy Wayne?

481
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,401
Yeah.

482
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,682
He said he could take people's pain away.

483
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,005
I didn't believe him at first,
but then I saw him do it.

484
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,571
He would just hug them,
and they'd be okay.

485
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,006
I don't know why,

486
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,280
I don't know why him,

487
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,566
but I know it worked.

488
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,049
So I followed him wherever he went,

489
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,369
and I did whatever he asked of me.

490
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,003
And then they came to kill him.

491
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,682
<i>We got away, but we had to split up.</i>

492
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,366
<i>He asked me to protect this girl.</i>

493
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,891
A pregnant girl.

494
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,166
She gave birth,

495
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,610
and then she just left the baby.

496
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,250
Just abandoned it
in a fucking rest stop bathroom.

497
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,208
The baby, she was crying,
and I didn't know what to do.

498
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,600
I was alone.

499
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,884
<i>So I looked up at the ceiling</i>

500
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,721
and said, "Help."

501
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,886
Not to God.

502
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,921
Not to anyone. I just said it.

503
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,764
Ten seconds later,
there's a knock on the door.

504
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,766
It was Wayne.

505
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,524
<i>I don't know how he found me.</i>

506
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,769
Nobody knew where I was.

507
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,848
The baby stopped crying and...

508
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,526
He told me where to take her.

509
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,760
She'd be safe.

510
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,770
And then he said he was gonna die.

511
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,647
Yeah.

512
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,091
I asked him when, and he said, "Tomorrow."

513
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,162
I asked him why he wasn't afraid.

514
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,526
And he said,

515
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,766
"I haven't been afraid
in a real long time."

516
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,523
Then he told me one more thing.

517
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,323
He said if I accepted it,
that I could do what he did.

518
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,289
I could take people's pain away.

519
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,840
But there'd be a price.

520
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,802
There's always a price, though.

521
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,484
But I wanted it anyway.

522
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,769
I wanted to do what he could do.

523
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,805
I wanted to be

524
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,411
something.

525
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,285
So I said, "Yes."

526
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,002
And he wrapped his arms around me,

527
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,369
and I felt everything I was,

528
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,041
everything I ever would be.

529
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,687
And I felt it get born and die

530
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,609
over and over again.

531
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,841
And then he let go.

532
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,726
I'm sorry.

533
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,761
I'm so sorry.

534
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,925
I've been afraid to use it.

535
