1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,882
<i>No, no, no. Causality.</i>

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,607
<i>Correlation.
Everyone can show correlation.</i>

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,000
<i>Even fucking Denzinger
can show correlation.</i>

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,044
What is the cause, huh?

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,767
What's the cause?

6
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,805
I'm here for research.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,930
I'm not putting my equipment
through your fucking machine.

8
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,490
- Hello.
- Hi.

9
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,322
Is this the home of Evangeline Murphy?

10
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,001
Who are you?

11
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,041
<i>Gracias.</i>

12
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,367
Hey!

13
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,006
- Nora Durst?
- Yes.

14
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,647
Hello, my name is Dr. Joaquin Cuarto.
May I speak to you for a few minutes?

15
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,841
- About what?
- Um...

16
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,570
May I ask when you moved into this house?

17
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,961
What?

18
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,483
Um, the records say
you purchased it on the 21st.

19
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,565
But when did you actually take residence,
on the 21st or on the 22nd?

20
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,444
Uh, I don't remember.
Why are you asking me that?

21
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,564
The girl next door
disappeared on the 22nd.

22
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,566
Um, is that the day you moved in?

23
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,969
Did you make contact with her?

24
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,050
- What?
- Evangeline Murphy.

25
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,766
Did you touch her at all on that day?

26
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,886
- What is that thing?
- May I ask, were you in physical contact

27
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,611
with your husband
and your children on October the 14th

28
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,842
at the moment of their departure?

29
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,046
Get the fuck off my porch.

30
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,804
This will just take a minute.
If you'll just hold still.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,401
- Get off my porch.
- Please don't-- Just hold still.

32
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,891
Get out of here!

33
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,730
I'm just trying to help you.

34
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,606
You <i>okay?</i>

35
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,566
I'm fine.

36
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,322
Good morning, Mary.

37
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,803
Hope you slept better than I did.

38
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,762
Would you like to visit Matt today?

39
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,730
You must miss him, huh?

40
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,891
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is this Nora Durst?</i>

41
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,041
Yes.

42
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,929
<i>Miss Durst,
my name is Dr. Allison Herbert.</i>

43
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,889
<i>- How are you this morning?
- I'm fine.</i>

44
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,011
<i>I believe my colleague Dr. Cuarto
paid you a visit yesterday?</i>

45
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,968
<i>- Miss</i> Durst?
- Please don't call this number.

46
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
Morning.

47
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,967
Morning.

48
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,761
You Okay?

49
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,082
I'm just tired. I didn't sleep great.

50
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,687
Go back to bed. I can feed Mary.

51
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,361
You sure?

52
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,170
Go. Sleep.

53
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,961
ls the baby awake?

54
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,724
- Not yet.
- Okay.

55
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,246
Uncuff me?

56
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,484
Maybe in a minute.

57
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,370
If you cooperate.

58
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,165
And if I don't?

59
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,651
Then you will pay.

60
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,481
Hmm.

61
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,003
What? Did I hurt you?

62
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,561
No, I just got a cramp in my leg.

63
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,481
Shit.

64
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
Babe.

65
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Somebody threw a rock
through our window.

66
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,641
What?

67
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,762
Somebody threw a rock through our window.

68
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,924
You slept through it?

69
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,891
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

70
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,286
<i>Yeah.</i>

71
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,081
What do you think this is about?

72
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,164
What do you think this is about?

73
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,088
Wait, babe, where you going?

74
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,004
To get a broom and dustpan.

75
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,448
- Who <i>is</i> it?
- It's him again.

76
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,923
Mr. Murphy, can I speak
to you for one moment?

77
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,241
Don't answer it.

78
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
On, baby.

79
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,961
<i>Morning.</i>

80
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,281
Can I ask you a question?

81
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,124
<i>- Is there</i> a <i>place--
- Who are you?</i>

82
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,805
- Sorry?
- Who are you?

83
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,766
Oh, uh...

84
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,124
George Brevity.

85
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,530
I'm with the DSD,
the Department of Sudden Departure.

86
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,602
Nora Durst, Northeast Division.

87
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm on leave.

88
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Small world, huh?

89
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,684
- What branch?
- Benefits. You?

90
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,601
Secondaries.

91
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,249
Oh, of course.

92
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
Do you know them? The Murphys?

93
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,724
Not well. We just moved in.

94
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,723
- Lucky you.
- Lucky me?

95
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,367
I mean, it's hard to find a place here,
you know, since we verified.

96
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,005
What did you want to ask me?

97
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,164
Oh, is there a good place
to get breakfast?

98
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,526
The tourist stuff is getting old.

99
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,484
Try Smitty's. There's no sign outside.

100
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,444
There's a green awning
across from the guy on the pillar.

101
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,684
- Smitty's. Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

102
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,610
Excuse me, Mrs. Murphy.

103
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,684
<i>Can I talk to you for a minute?
Mrs. Murphy!</i>

104
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,490
<i>Could I just talk with you a moment?</i>

105
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,080
<i>Mrs. Murphy.</i>

106
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,606
Poor woman, huh?

107
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,006
It's horrible.

108
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,247
Erika.

109
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,604
Loretta. Emily.

110
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,764
We need you to talk John
into talking to the DSD.

111
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,400
John isn't the one that
doesn't want to talk to them, I am.

112
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,607
Why not?

113
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,801
We've talked to the police,
we've talked to the FBI.

114
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,689
And they're the ones
that are looking for our girls.

115
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,330
But they haven't found them.

116
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,131
The man from the DSD
said that he could rule out--

117
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,441
Rule out what?

118
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,010
What questions did he ask that
we haven't already been asked?

119
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,730
We're not supposed to say.

120
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,411
- We signed a--
- Nondisclosure agreement.

121
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,285
What are y'all wearing tonight?

122
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,801
<i>To the fundraiser.</i>

123
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,007
I'm wearing whatever I want.

124
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,288
Okay, well, then I'll see you tonight.

125
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,049
Emily, you smell like alcohol.

126
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,166
<i>Order up.</i>

127
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,005
Hey, you found it.

128
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,765
Yeah, the promised land.

129
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,648
Mind if I sit with you for a sec?
I ordered some carryout.

130
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,171
Be my guest.

131
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,841
Forget the water.

132
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,521
- This brisket's the miracle.
- Mmm.

133
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,731
Barbecue is a religious experience
down here.

134
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,928
- You're not from Texas?
- D.C.

135
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,771
Oh, I thought they'd send
someone from Regional.

136
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,365
You're living in the only municipality

137
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,205
with a population above
5,000 with no deeps.

138
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,286
Three girls lifted from here?
They're not calling Regional.

139
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,365
But they're gonna rule it
unconfirmed, right?

140
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,683
Not gonna rule anything
till your neighbors talk to me.

141
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,525
I administered the new questionnaire
to the parents of the other girls.

142
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,523
None of the fraud flags popped.

143
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,207
- There's a new questionnaire?
- Uh-huh.

144
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,602
The algorithm came from the Japanese.

145
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,203
Getting some interesting results.

146
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,366
Can I see it?

147
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,488
You kidding me? They'd fire me.

148
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,729
They want me to sleep
with this thing under my pillow.

149
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,008
I mean, if the questions got corrupted,

150
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,130
there'd be no way to confirm
the secondary is the real deal.

151
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,888
Hmm, the real deal.

152
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,524
The girl's Mercedes was found running

153
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,047
like a foot just disappeared
off the gas pedal.

154
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,724
Music still blasting.

155
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,531
All the personal effects
are still inside the car.

156
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,569
Purses, phones.

157
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,406
No sign of any kind
of struggle whatsoever.

158
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,880
No reason to run.

159
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,811
Everybody I've talked to around here
says these are good girls.

160
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,041
Choir girls.

161
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,527
Three weeks gone and there's
not a single sighting of them anywhere.

162
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,083
If the questionnaire says they lifted,
maybe they lifted.

163
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,131
Can I ask you something stupid?

164
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
My favorite kind of question.

165
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,762
Have you ever heard of someone

166
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,525
being responsible
for another person's departure?

167
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,205
You mean the lensing thing?

168
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,327
Lensing?

169
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,130
You know, like a lens.

170
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,762
Like a kid taking a magnifying glass
and frying ants with it.

171
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,290
The idea is that someone gives off

172
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,446
ultraviolet rays or whatnot,
causing everyone around them to lift.

173
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,122
It was <i>in</i> that <i>Scientific</i> American
article they e-mailed us last month.

174
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,009
Can you forward that to me?

175
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,645
- Dr. Murphy?
- Mmm.

176
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,484
We need you in exam three.

177
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,608
Can somebody else take it?

178
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,171
It should probably be you.

179
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,164
I didn't do anything wrong.

180
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,371
I was just selling water.

181
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,531
<i>How much?</i>

182
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Just a couple of bottles.

183
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,289
How much are you selling it for?

184
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,805
$500 a milliliter.

185
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,368
The samples I took from the spring
that drained are genuine,

186
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,645
so if people are willing to pay that much,
then what did I do wrong?

187
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,367
Want to let me take a look at your hand?

188
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,726
Yeah.

189
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,765
They took my palm print.

190
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,210
Why would they do that?

191
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,091
Can you make a fist?

192
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,690
I want a copy of your report.

193
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,040
The rangers want a list of my injuries
when I go in to describe my attackers.

194
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,963
One of them black, 40, clean-cut?

195
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,207
He's the one that hit you the hardest?

196
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,406
Yeah.

197
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,684
That's John Murphy.

198
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
Maybe you let him slide just this once.

199
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,126
Why would I do that?

200
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,246
Because I have plans tonight
and I don't want to miss them

201
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,562
because I'm back in here
fixing you up again.

202
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,405
Let me get you some ice.

203
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,686
Hey-

204
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,601
What are you doing out here, Miss Lily?

205
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,801
Oh...

206
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,764
Let's get out of there.

207
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,401
Oh, oh, okay.

208
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,040
Hey-

209
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,561
Aw.

210
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,210
"Researchers found
themselves intrigued

211
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,727
"by the anomalous phenomenon
of the Departure Cluster,

212
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,764
"the most extreme example of which
is the notorious Brandenburg Carousel."

213
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,291
They never confirmed
that fucking carousel.

214
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,331
Some genius in
German tourism cooked it up.

215
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,651
- Lily?
- She was on the hood of the truck.

216
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,926
Oh, my God.

217
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,451
Oh, Kevin was watching her.
I thought she was down for a nap.

218
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,489
No worries.

219
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,770
When Evie was five years old,
I thought she was playing in the backyard.

220
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,163
I had no idea she was gone
until her friend's mom called

221
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,924
and asked when was I gonna pick her up.

222
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,645
My daughter Erin
did that same thing when she was four.

223
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,850
I didn't know you had another daughter.

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,804
I used to, but she's gone now.

225
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,126
My son, too.

226
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,130
Oh, I'm so sorry.

227
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,164
Well, thank you again.

228
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,842
<i>Don't tell me how to fucking do it.</i>

229
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,082
I know how to strip fucking...

230
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,006
<i>It's wallpaper.</i>

231
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,682
Well, then don't fucking tell me.

232
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,361
Who are you talking to?

233
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,606
Myself.

234
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,731
Oh, shit.

235
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,807
I took her to the hardware store
and I had all that shit to carry

236
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,486
and then I...
I forgot to go back out and get her.

237
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,051
- I am so sorry.
- Kevin. Kevin.

238
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,043
It's okay. it happens.

239
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,761
It's okay.

240
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,770
- I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

241
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm so sorry.

242
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,650
You should hop in the shower.

243
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm gonna take Mary to visit Matt,

244
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,567
and then I'll meet you at
the visitors' center for the fundraiser.

245
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,081
Yeah.

246
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,725
- Wait, what?
- The fundraiser.

247
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,723
For the Murphys
and the other missing girls.

248
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,406
- We're going to that?
- Why wouldn't we?

249
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,404
Because we asked them for help
and they fucking banished your brother.

250
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,244
Matt banished himself.

251
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,643
And people aren't at their best
when they're in that kind of pain.

252
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,406
We should support them.
That's what neighbors do.

253
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,091
Oh, shit. Fuck.

254
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,686
Fuck.

255
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,088
- Have you seen my batteries?
- What?

256
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,645
The batteries for my ears.

257
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,564
They're not in the kitchen drawer.

258
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,563
You want me to run out to the pharmacy?

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,609
No, I have some upstairs.

260
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,242
You think this is on me?

261
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,526
What?

262
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,125
People throwing rocks through our window.

263
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,489
You think it's because of what I do?

264
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,529
That man that you beat
the shit out of this morning,

265
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,003
he thinks it's because
he was selling our water.

266
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
No, he was selling lies.

267
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,808
Then Why'd you take his palm print?

268
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,571
Because I seem to recall
there being one left

269
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,291
on the car that our daughter
disappeared from.

270
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,326
- Let's just call this what it is.
- What is it?

271
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,284
You need to hit people
because you need to hit people.

272
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,326
I'm trying.

273
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,331
I know, babe.

274
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,568
SPF 75? What a joke.

275
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,287
Anything over 30 is basically useless.

276
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,328
Hey.-
Hey.-

277
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,567
We're going to visit Matt.

278
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,291
Do you want to come to the fundraiser
with us or go with your dad?

279
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,130
Actually, Michael asked me.

280
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,563
How do his parents feel about that?

281
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,243
I don't think that he asked them.

282
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,203
And I'm not really asking you either.

283
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,888
Well, if you were,
I'd say he's a sweet guy

284
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,451
and I'm happy for you.

285
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,321
Thanks.

286
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,681
All right, I'll see you there?

287
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,120
See you there.

288
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,361
Hello.

289
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,851
<i>Miss Durst, please don't hang up.</i>

290
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,525
<i>It's Allison Herbert again.</i>

291
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,251
<i>If I could have one moment, please?</i>

292
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,647
What do you want?

293
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,167
<i>I need to apologize
for my colleague Dr. Cuarto.</i>

294
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,285
<i>He's a great scientist,
but he lacks people skills.</i>

295
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,370
<i>He should not have come to your home</i>

296
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,682
<i>to collect the data from you
without permission.</i>

297
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,887
Data?

298
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,121
<i>Yes.</i>

299
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,001
<i>I must say the measurements he took
were very promising. Very.</i>

300
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,846
<i>If you'd allow us,
we could guarantee their accuracy</i>

301
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,611
<i>by replicating them
in laboratory conditions.</i>

302
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,970
You think I'm a lens?

303
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,122
<i>You're familiar with this theory?</i>

304
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,884
Not really. I don't, um...

305
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,130
I just read an article.

306
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,442
<i>Miss Durst, you moved to Jarden,</i>

307
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,642
<i>a town with no departures,</i>

308
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,724
<i>and that very night,
three girls disappeared,</i>

309
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,042
<i>one of whom lived next door to you.</i>

310
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,124
<i>Yes, we believe you are a lens.</i>

311
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,847
Why? Do you know why me?

312
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,967
<i>Well, this is where our research is, um,</i>

313
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,281
<i>divisive.</i>

314
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,331
<i>I would like very much
to discuss this in person.</i>

315
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
Please just tell me.

316
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,368
<i>Miss Durst, we believe
that the demon Azrael</i>

317
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,205
<i>has chosen you
as his earthbound instrument.</i>

318
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,489
<i>This entity resides in you
through no fault of your own,</i>

319
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
<i>and is responsible
for the chaos that surrounds you</i>

320
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,805
<i>and possibly many others.</i>

321
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,407
<i>Dr. Cuarto and I have
contacted the Vatican--</i>

322
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,406
Hey!

323
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,085
Hey!

324
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,324
- Why'd you run?
- I was just dropping off...

325
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,123
Wait, wait, wait.
Say it again and say it slow.

326
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,204
What the fuck is this?

327
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,806
That's a pie.

328
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,201
Why'd you send it to my house?

329
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,522
Well, 'cause I know you're in pain.

330
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,649
<i>John got a pie on his birthday.
We weren't in pain then.</i>

331
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,845
You weren't?

332
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,451
Is this about Michael
coming to pray with me?

333
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,561
What?

334
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,164
He didn't tell you.

335
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,088
I'm not gonna say this again.

336
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,969
Stay away from my family.

337
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,924
I know what I did.

338
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,321
And I know I can never make it right.

339
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,611
And I also know
that you wish it wasn't so,

340
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,322
but I am your family, Erika.

341
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
You want to take a bird with you?

342
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,849
Why the fuck would I do that?

343
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,681
Hey-

344
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,364
<i>I come bearing gifts.</i>

345
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,646
Hey!

346
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,365
- Thanks.
- Yummy.

347
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,245
-Hey.
-Hey.

348
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,483
- That was for you.
- No, we share everything here. Hup.

349
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,925
Hello, my love.

350
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,807
I'm sorry you have to come out here again.

351
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,606
Not all the people are degenerates.

352
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,249
So this is, what, your new congregation?

353
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,929
Nah, just a bunch of folks
who needed a little guidance.

354
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,970
And all you had to do to win their respect
was humiliate yourself in the stocks.

355
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,488
No, all I had to do was
refuse to let someone else take my place.

356
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,844
Suffering breeds compassion.

357
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,761
Nobody does it like you, Matt.

358
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,249
- You clean the tube every night?
- Of course.

359
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,607
And we got the bed
like you had back in Mapleton.

360
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,127
They're expensive.
You and Kevin didn't have to do that.

361
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,770
It's fine. We rented it.

362
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,723
The OB appointment is this Friday,

363
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,121
so we'll pick you up
on the way out of town.

364
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,961
I bet you're looking forward to that, huh?

365
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,051
Get our first peek.

366
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,964
Hear the heartbeat.

367
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,804
Any sign of her?

368
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,043
Waking up? No, Matt.

369
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,730
- Give her time.
- Hmm.

370
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,767
You look nice.

371
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,480
Going somewhere special?

372
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,962
We're going to the fundraiser
for the families of the missing girls.

373
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,009
They need money
to continue the search, so...

374
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,401
What?

375
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,766
You bringing Mary'?

376
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,730
<i>- Yeah, we're going straight from here.</i>
- Hmm.

377
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,445
What, Matt?

378
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,010
The Murphys don't believe
what happened to her. They deny it.

379
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,448
You bringing her to their party
may be regarded as hostile.

380
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,651
They lost their daughter.

381
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,962
Why would I feel hostile towards them?

382
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,522
I don't know. Why would you?

383
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,011
Fuck you, Matt.

384
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,489
- Let me help you with that.
- I got it.

385
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,011
Thank you.

386
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,083
She loved that on you.

387
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,249
<i>I think she just wanted you
to give it to her,</i>

388
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,368
<i>but you never took the hint.</i>

389
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,410
I took the hint.

390
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,723
Just wanted it for myself.

391
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,761
Michael.

392
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,405
<i>I'm in here.</i>

393
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,766
- You gonna get dressed?
- Yeah, just a minute.

394
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,447
I know you go out there to pray with him.

395
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,601
Who?

396
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,568
Don't make me say his name.

397
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,128
Do you know what your father
would do if he found out?

398
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,441
Shoot him again?

399
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,762
Michael, you can't go out there anymore.

400
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,011
- He deserves forgiveness.
- No, not him.

401
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,285
Everyone who asks for it deserves it, Mom.

402
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,400
Even him.

403
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,369
Michael, go get dressed.

404
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,643
But again, thank you.

405
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,204
Listen to me,
if you call this number again,

406
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,691
I will report you to the fucking police.

407
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,171
Do you understand me?

408
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,490
<i>Is this Nora?</i>

409
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,365
Who is this?

410
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,803
<i>It's Laurie Garvey.</i>

411
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,844
Nora, are you there?

412
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,445
How did you get this number?

413
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,125
<i>Uh, on the Internet.</i>

414
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,531
It's really easy to unlist if you want.

415
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,728
<i>I'm sorry to call you.
I know it's not fair,</i>

416
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,844
but I just need to know, is Tom there?

417
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,409
<i>- Tom?</i>
- My son, Tommy.

418
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,722
Is he there with you in Texas?

419
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,766
No, he's not here.
I've never even met him.

420
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,524
Is something wrong?

421
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,764
Well, if you do see him,
if he comes there, um,

422
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,930
will you tell him
that I'm worried about him?

423
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,722
Can, can you tell him I'm sorry?

424
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,924
Okay, I'll do that.

425
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,130
All right. Thanks, Nora.

426
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,646
Goodbye.

427
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,526
Bye.

428
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,687
- Hey, how was Matt?
- Fine.

429
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,201
- You okay?
- Yeah, let's go sit.

430
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,880
Hi there.

431
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,042
We're taking donations for the reward fund

432
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,925
and for the families to hire
out-of-state resources for the search.

433
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,606
Oh, yes, of course.
We'd like to give $500, please.

434
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,161
<i>That's very generous.
Do you have a PayPal account?</i>

435
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,810
- Sorry?
- A PayPal account.

436
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,126
That's how we do the donations.

437
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,170
If you don't have one,
I can set one up for you.

438
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,130
- No, I have one.
- Then you know the drill.

439
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,965
<i>There you go.</i>

440
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,127
Let's grab those seats up there.

441
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,166
Sure.

442
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,126
Excuse me.

443
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,481
- Evening.
- Oh, hey there.

444
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,327
Oh, Kevin, this is...

445
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,811
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

446
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,769
- George Brevity, DSD.
- Oh.

447
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,403
- Did you guys work together or...
- Mmm-mmm.

448
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,801
I sent you that article. Did you get it?

449
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,281
- Yeah, it was horseshit.
<i>- Really?</i>

450
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,011
Our research guys thought there was
some pretty interesting stuff there.

451
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,164
They're working some of that data
into the new questionnaire.

452
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,520
<i>Okay, if everybody
could just take their seats.</i>

453
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,045
- Excuse me. I've got to record this.
- Okay.

454
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,884
<i>We're gonna go ahead and get started.</i>

455
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,451
<i>Thank you.</i>

456
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,446
<i>r</i> <i>r</i>

457
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,046
<i>On behalf of me and Sam and Loretta
and John and Erika,</i>

458
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,284
<i>we are so grateful
for y'all coming out to support our girls</i>

459
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,842
<i>so we can get them back
to that beautiful choir real soon.</i>

460
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,650
<i>If Taylor and Violet
and Evie are out there,</i>

461
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,891
<i>we're gonna find them.</i>

462
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,489
<i>Our girls were such good friends
ever since they were little.</i>

463
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,081
<i>Emily and I put together
this little sideshow.</i>

464
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,651
<i>I hope you enjoy it-</i>

465
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,081
Uh-uh.

466
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,526
No.

467
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,121
<i>No.</i>

468
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,203
No. How do I stop this?

469
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,321
Jerry, uh-uh, no.

470
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,323
You got to get out of here.

471
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,001
- Let him do it.
- No, Jerry.

472
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,004
- Come on, let him do it.
- He's trying to help.

473
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,331
He's trying to help? This man is crazy.

474
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,809
He killed a goat on October 14th
before any of us knew what happened,

475
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,850
<i>and he was locked up in jail
where he should have stayed.</i>

476
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,323
But then, all of y'all decided
that Jerry must have saved us,

477
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,011
that Jerry knew something.

478
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,682
He sacrificed something to protect us.

479
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,330
<i>So now, he's holy man,
and he gets to walk around here</i>

480
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,689
killing goats whenever he feels like it,
just in case?

481
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,330
<i>JOHN". Babe, can you calm down, please?</i>

482
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,562
No, you let him do it, too.

483
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,691
If there aren't any miracles in Miracle,
then why does he get a pass?

484
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,931
Cecilia, you were trying on your
wedding dress when it happened, huh?

485
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,688
So now, you put it on every day and you
take pictures with the tourists, huh?

486
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,928
Number 13 on the audio tour.

487
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,403
Well, maybe you were
the one that saved us.

488
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,005
Maybe, huh?

489
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,406
We are the 9,261, and we are spared.

490
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,730
We're spared.

491
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,684
<i>We're not spared.</i>

492
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,606
We're not safe!

493
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,165
All this shit we're walking around
here doing, it doesn't matter.

494
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,926
It doesn't work. My daughter is gone.

495
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,761
So, no. No, Jerry.

496
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,966
<i>She departed.</i>

497
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,484
I'll see you at home.

498
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,044
Where are you going?

499
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,846
<i>Okay, folks,
everybody just stay seated.</i>

500
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,602
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

501
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,560
Hi.

502
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,806
I was at the fundraiser. Are you okay?

503
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm fine.

504
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,726
Here.

505
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,011
It's the questions
the DSD wants to ask you.

506
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,160
Where did you get it?

507
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,646
I borrowed it.

508
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,811
That man,
the agent isn't going to leave you alone.

509
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,770
I wanted you to have it so you could see
there's nothing to be scared of.

510
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm scared?

511
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,006
Yes.

512
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,641
Of What?

513
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,248
You're scared that if you
answer these questions,

514
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,846
everyone's gonna know
that your daughter didn't depart.

515
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,846
She didn't?

516
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,610
And those questions will prove it?

517
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,567
Well, come on in and ask them.

518
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,411
Did the missing person
bite or chew his or her fingernails?

519
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,766
No.

520
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,085
Did the missing person
recently commence new dietary habits

521
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,881
including but not restricted to vegan,
gluten-free or Paleolithic?

522
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,087
No.

523
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,006
Would you describe
the missing person as generous?

524
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,321
Yes.

525
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,727
Would you describe yourself as generous?

526
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,403
Generous people
don't describe themselves as generous.

527
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,121
So no?

528
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,521
No.

529
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,411
To your knowledge, did the missing person

530
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,370
consume one or more
alcoholic beverages per day?

531
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,567
No.

532
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,166
Do you consume
one or more alcoholic beverages per day?

533
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,401
No.

534
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,689
Did the missing person
use aluminum-based antiperspirant?

535
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,245
She uses Secret.

536
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,810
It's aluminum-based.

537
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,691
Is the missing person
a product of a multiple birth?

538
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,207
Yes, Evie and Michael are twins.

539
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,644
Did the missing person
have visual impairment

540
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,529
or wear corrective lenses?

541
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,521
Yes.

542
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,690
Was the missing person diagnosed
with any neurological conditions

543
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,649
such as essential tremor,
Tourette's syndrome

544
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,121
or any disorder that manifested seizures?

545
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,284
She has epilepsy.

546
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,770
She had a seizure
the night she disappeared.

547
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,843
You were there.

548
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,970
Yeah, I remember.

549
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,851
How often on average
did you dream about the missing person

550
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,923
prior to their disappearance?

551
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,965
<i>I don't know.</i>

552
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,122
<i>Three or four times a month.</i>

553
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,129
How often on average
do you dream about them now?

554
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,080
Every night.

555
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,804
To the best of your recollection,

556
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,804
what were the last words
the missing person spoke to you?

557
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,050
I don't remember.

558
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,969
You don't remember?

559
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,321
No.

560
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,124
To the best of your knowledge,
did the missing person

561
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,170
ever express a desire
to hurt him or herself? If so, why?

562
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,890
Absolutely not.

563
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,805
Have you ever expressed
a desire to hurt yourself? If so, why?

564
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,041
No.

565
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,929
To the best of your knowledge,
did the missing person

566
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,082
withdraw more than $1,000
from his or her bank

567
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,084
within 30 days prior
to their disappearance? If so, what for?

568
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,605
Evie's account is connected to ours.

569
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,683
She didn't withdraw any money.

570
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,525
Did you withdraw
more than $1,000 from your bank

571
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,490
within 30 days prior to the disappearance?
If so, what for?

572
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,927
Yes.

573
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,845
If so, what for?

574
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,764
I was gonna leave John.

575
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,688
You're surprised because we seem so happy.

576
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,242
<i>My grandmother was born here.</i>

577
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,723
She lived here all her life.

578
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,724
She used to tell us kids
this place is chosen.

579
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,967
The good Lord pointed His finger
down on the final day of creation

580
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,010
and said, "You. The Jarden of Eden."

581
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,245
We didn't believe her,
but she said there was a way to prove it,

582
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,206
a way to make your wishes come true.

583
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,200
You take a bird,
you put it in a box and you bury it.

584
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,641
Anywhere in the woods is fine.

585
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,125
And you wait.

586
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,761
You wait three days, you come back,
dig it up, and if it's alive,

587
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,166
right then is when you make your wish.

588
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,961
Little girls believe all sorts of things,
but I knew pretend when I heard it.

589
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,687
Birds living in the ground
for three days is pretend.

590
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,407
Making wishes is pretend.

591
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,001
The good Lord is pretend.

592
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,888
And then on October 14th,

593
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,810
people went away
from everywhere except here.

594
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,965
That was real.

595
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,245
<i>That happened.</i>

596
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,521
<i>My grandma had been dead for 10 years,
but she was right.</i>

597
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,289
This place was chosen.

598
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,920
And about a month ago,
I was walking out to my car

599
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,764
and I saw it.

600
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,602
A sparrow right by the driver's side door,

601
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,571
lying there like it was
trying to get me to help it.

602
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,767
It was dehydrated.

603
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,691
Almost dead.

604
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,691
You think I nursed it
back to health, Nora?

605
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,811
Depending on the size of the box,
a bird can survive 20 hours.

606
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,930
Anything over 30 hours
is medically impossible.

607
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,689
And like I said, this bird,
it didn't have anything left.

608
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,808
<i>So, I waited the three days.</i>

609
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,890
I jogged out to the woods,
I dug up the box,

610
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,806
and I made my wish before I opened it.

611
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,087
<i>I wished that my kids
would be okay if I left.</i>

612
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,721
Because they had no idea I needed to go.

613
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,201
No idea what it's like to pretend.

614
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,444
Michael, he has his faith.

615
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,766
He'd be fine.

616
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,851
But Evie...

617
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,083
She wouldn't understand.

618
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,169
It would break her heart.

619
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,604
So, I wished
that she'd be okay without me.

620
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,524
I opened up the box,

621
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,810
the bird flew out.

622
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,560
And the next night my daughter was gone.

623
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,962
Well, Erika, that's just...

624
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,044
That's quite a stretch.

625
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,290
<i>Your logic, I'm sorry,</i>

626
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,603
<i>it's a little all over the place,
don't you think?</i>

627
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,604
Well, what do you think?

628
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,171
You wanted to leave your husband.
Okay, so why didn't he go?

629
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,765
Why didn't you?

630
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,605
A hundred and forty million people
disappeared three years ago.

631
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,807
Did you wish them away, too?

632
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,450
Because that's a lot
of birds to bury, Erika.

633
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,489
That's a flock of epic proportions.

634
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,125
I get it. I felt the same as you. I...

635
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,881
I felt responsible for losing my children.

636
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,048
I thought it was my fault.

637
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,843
But I moved past it.

638
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,326
I evolved.

639
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,888
Because that's pathetic.

640
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,840
Terrible things happen in this world.

641
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,401
And the only comfort we get
is that we didn't cause them.

642
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,329
So, I'm sorry,

643
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,726
but, Erika,
this had nothing to do with you.

644
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,401
Did they depart or did they die?

645
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,206
What?

646
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,885
<i>Your children.</i>

647
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,964
You said you lost them.

648
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,965
Did they depart or did they die?

649
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,290
They departed.

650
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,487
What were the last words they said to you,
to the best of your recollection?

651
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,490
Hey.-
Hey.-

652
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,485
Mary's asleep.

653
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,005
Jill's putting the baby down upstairs.

654
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,764
Okay, I'll go up and help out.

655
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,371
We need to talk.

656
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,282
Can we do this tomorrow?

657
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,606
It's important.

658
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,648
Yes, honey, I know it's important,
but can we just--

659
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,041
I need to talk to you now, Nora.

660
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,084
Have you been noticing that I've been

661
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,724
kind of losing my mind?

662
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,961
What?

663
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,004
I'm letting you handcuff me
to the bed every night,

664
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,811
and we're acting like
that's totally normal.

665
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,009
I left the baby... I forgot the baby,
and you act like that's no big deal.

666
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,889
- You had your hands full. it happens.
- I'm seeing someone.

667
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,446
What?

668
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,401
Um...

669
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,049
I've been seeing someone.

670
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,886
Who?

671
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,851
Patti Levin.

672
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,083
She ran the Guilty Remnant in Mapleton.

673
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,605
But she's dead.

674
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,810
It started happening
right after we found Lily,

675
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,326
when you moved in.

676
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,685
I thought she'd go away when we came here.

677
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,291
She didn't.

678
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,168
Are you seeing her right now?

679
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,526
Yeah.

680
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,803
<i>Is she talking to you?</i>

681
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,921
Yeah.

682
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,405
What's she saying?

683
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,605
<i>She's saying...</i>

684
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,649
<i>She's saying
I never should have told you about her.</i>

685
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,886
And...

686
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,321
Uh...

687
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,881
That I just made a big mistake.

688
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,281
English-SDH
