1
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,885
Mr. Harvey?

2
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,491
It's Garvey.

3
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,486
No, it's Harvey.

4
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,208
May I bring them in, please?

5
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,361
Um...

6
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,602
Give me a second. I'll take them.

7
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,446
Thanks.

8
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,166
All I have is euros.

9
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,687
Fucked

10
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,441
Yeah, I see it.

11
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,642
<i>It's flying around the lobby.</i>

12
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
<i>Oh, the bird just landed.</i>

13
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,810
<i>Stand back, everyone.</i>

14
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,086
Hello.

15
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,971
Sorry, there's a bird in here.

16
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,445
May I help you, sir?

17
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,283
Yes, someone sent some flowers to my room.

18
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,323
Do you know who sent them?

19
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,326
All deliveries come through the concierge.

20
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,569
You'll have to ask him.

21
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,964
<i>Get that out of there.</i>

22
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,729
What the fuck is happening?

23
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,248
The fire alarm went off, sir,
and we have a bird loose in the lobby.

24
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,646
What?

25
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,291
Where are we? What is this?

26
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,641
Sir, please lower your voice. Um...

27
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,844
Are you a guest here?

28
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,330
No, I'm not a guest.

29
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,247
I took poison in your trailer.
You sent me here.

30
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
You know me.

31
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,205
You know me. You sent me here.

32
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,084
Clearly, sir, you're upset.

33
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,091
I'm writing down the name and number
of a professional who can help you.

34
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,726
I don't need a professional.
I need you to tell me--

35
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,921
Here.

36
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,281
I wish I could be more helpful.

37
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,920
I really hope they don't catch that bird.

38
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,127
Concierge. May I help you?

39
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,086
Yes.

40
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,085
Oh, absolutely.

41
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,691
Right away.

42
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,641
Shit.

43
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,486
Hey!

44
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,886
Hey!

45
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,729
Come on. Come on.

46
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,088
Come on. Come on.

47
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,721
Help!

48
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,007
Can you hear me? Yeah?

49
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,888
Hey, what are you doing?

50
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,768
She was floating in the pool.
She almost drowned!

51
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,564
What did I tell you?

52
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,091
You don't know how to swim.

53
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,010
Hey, take it easy.

54
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,528
Mind your fucking business.

55
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,290
Why are you wet?

56
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,647
There was a girl in the pool.

57
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,690
<i>- She was drowning,</i> so--
<i>- Did you drink any?</i>

58
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,802
- What?
- The water, did you drink any?

59
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,524
- No.
- And don't.

60
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,208
No matter what,
don't drink the water here.

61
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,084
And where is "here"?

62
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,488
- You mean the hotel?
- No, it's not a fucking hotel.

63
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,041
Someone just tried to kill me.

64
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,207
Oh.

65
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,766
"Oh"?

66
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,964
Well, it makes sense.

67
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,128
It's a pitfall of your chosen occupation.

68
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Which is what?

69
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,881
Look at the way
you're dressed, man.

70
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,480
You're an international assassin.

71
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,364
Are you fucking serious?

72
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,682
That is why
you checked into the hotel, isn't it?

73
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,842
I didn't check into the hotel.

74
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,930
I drank that shit that you gave me
and I woke up in a bathtub.

75
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,324
Okay, Kevin, you've got to stop thinking
in such straight lines,

76
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,482
<i>because she surely will not be.</i>

77
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,282
<i>She thinks in spirals and helixes
and zigzags and circles.</i>

78
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,646
Patti?

79
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,211
Your target.

80
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,444
She's here, now?

81
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,288
<i>She will be in a couple of hours.</i>

82
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,610
<i>It's for her campaign.</i>

83
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,051
- Her what?
- Her campaign.

84
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,725
She's running for president.

85
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,888
What the fuck are you talking about?

86
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,290
Okay, I've only got time
to say this once, all right?

87
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,289
And you're only gonna get one shot at her.

88
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,925
You understand?

89
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,767
No.

90
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,930
Okay, you're registered
under Kevin Harvey.

91
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,403
You made a generous contribution
to her campaign

92
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,091
which guarantees you a meet-and-greet.

93
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,646
When she gets here,
they will call you in your room.

94
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,446
Then they will bring you down to her suite
where you will be searched for weapons.

95
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,604
Once inside, you ask to use the washroom.

96
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,803
Inside the washroom
in the tank of the toilet,

97
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,207
you will find a gun and a silencer.

98
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,807
<i>You walk out, you point that gun
and you do not hesitate, Kevin.</i>

99
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,005
You do not hesitate
because she will try and deceive you.

100
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,401
You point the gun at her head
and you pull the trigger.

101
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,925
And that's it.

102
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,770
It'll all be over.

103
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,010
And you will be delivered from this place.

104
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,608
And you can go home, Kevin.

105
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,444
It's Kevin Harvey?

106
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,846
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,968
And the gun's gonna be in the toilet.

108
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,241
Yeah.

109
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,084
<i>Like The Godfather?</i>

110
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,809
Exactly like The Godfather.

111
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,126
Got it.

112
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,330
And do not, do not hesitate.

113
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,811
Hold on.

114
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,125
How are you here?

115
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,681
Sorry?

116
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,842
If I had to die to get here,
what are you doing here?

117
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,046
Atoning.

118
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,124
<i>Just don't leave the room
until they call you, Kevin.</i>

119
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,810
<i>It's not safe.</i>

120
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,209
And for God's sake,
don't let them see you.

121
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,841
Fuck!

122
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,643
<i>Feed that motherfucking fire.</i>

123
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,966
<i>I think I see something.</i>

124
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,969
<i><i>We're sorry
for the inconvenience,</i>

125
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,441
<i>but we need to evacuate the hotel.</i>

126
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,803
<i>Please move in an orderly fashion
to the nearest available stairwell.</i>

127
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,088
I think they want us to evacuate.

128
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,931
- False alarm.
- What if it's not?

129
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,963
Then we'll fucking burn.

130
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,164
<i><i>Please move
in an orderly fashion</i>

131
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,801
<i>to the nearest available stairwell.</i>

132
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,606
Those for me?

133
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,684
Is your name Mary Jamison?

134
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,727
No.

135
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,805
Then they're not for you.

136
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,970
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it's safe to return to your rooms.</i>

137
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,242
<i>Sorry for the inconvenience.</i>

138
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,211
ls your name Kevin Harvey?

139
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,046
What the fuck am I doing--

140
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,521
Hello.

141
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,725
I work with Senator Levin.

142
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,129
I apologize, but we need to vet
anyone who gets close to her.

143
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,120
<i>We just need to make sure you belong here.</i>

144
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,443
<i>State your name, please.</i>

145
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,445
Uh, Kevin Harvey.

146
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,969
Hey, hey! No! Ow! Fuck!

147
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,970
<i>I'm sorry if this seems severe,
but we do need to trust each other.</i>

148
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,963
Please state your name.

149
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,568
Kevin Garvey. Garvey.

150
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,241
<i>You checked into the hotel
under a different name. Why?</i>

151
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,008
Because I don't want anyone
to know who I really am.

152
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,162
<i>Well,
it's a pretty lousy alias.</i>

153
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,926
Thanks.

154
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,684
$50,000, that's a lot of money.

155
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,841
<i>Yeah.</i>

156
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,769
What do you expect in return?

157
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,009
I just really want to be
in the same room as her.

158
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,124
- You want to be in the same room with her?
- Mmm-hmm.

159
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,929
Uh-huh. Do you smoke, Kevin?

160
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,121
Yes.

161
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,609
Why do you smoke?

162
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,526
Uh...

163
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,241
Because I'm addicted to nicotine.

164
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,961
Ow! Fuck!

165
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,321
Ow! No, no, no!

166
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,604
Why do you smoke?

167
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,169
I smoke to remember.

168
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,885
<i>Remember what?</i>

169
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,323
That the world ended.

170
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,491
Uncuff him.

171
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,721
Mmm, my manners.

172
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,080
Thirsty?

173
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,761
Oh, no.

174
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,208
The senator is arriving imminently.

175
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,771
Why don't you go freshen up?

176
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,604
We'll come get you when she's ready.

177
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,207
Oh, and, Mr. Garvey,
we're thankful for your support.

178
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,728
<i>It's the same fucking room.</i>

179
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,809
<i>Feed that motherfucking fire.</i>

180
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,962
<i>I think I see something.</i>

181
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,446
Dad?

182
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,126
<i>Goddamn. It worked.</i>

183
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,727
- Where are you?
- I'm in Perth.

184
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,164
<i>Jesus, we're staying in the same room.</i>

185
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,681
What?

186
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,050
<i>Son, I am fucked up
on this shit they call God's Tongue,</i>

187
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,481
<i>so I really hope this is real.</i>

188
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,769
<i>You get the flowers I sent?</i>

189
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,081
Uh...

190
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,961
Yeah, the card was blank.

191
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,442
<i>It didn't say, "Get to the well"?</i>

192
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,846
What well?

193
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,850
<i>Take her to the well.</i>

194
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,127
Who, uh, Patti?

195
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,201
<i>Wake the fuck up, asshole. Feed the fire.</i>

196
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,445
What well?

197
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,722
I'm supposed to assassinate her.

198
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,486
<i>No, you're not a fucking assassin.</i>

199
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,841
<i>Whoa. Whoa.</i>

200
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,565
<i>Don't fucking put it out.</i>

201
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,210
<i>I'm still talking to him.</i>

202
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,571
<i>You've got to take her to the well.</i>

203
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,770
What well?

204
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,562
<i>Son, you have to be strong.</i>

205
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,165
<i>I love you.</i>

206
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,044
I love you, too.

207
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,521
<i>Whoa.</i>

208
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,081
Dad?

209
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,921
Dad?

210
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,611
Senator Levin's ready to see you now.

211
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,924
Make like Jesus.

212
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,166
Sorry?

213
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,320
Oh.

214
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,925
Congratulations.

215
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,203
What happened to your hand?

216
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,166
Cut it.

217
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,523
Did you put Neosporin on it?

218
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,401
Yeah.

219
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,850
He's all clear.

220
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,090
He's harmless.

221
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,361
Hey-

222
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,204
<i>Long time no see.</i>

223
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,567
Yeah.

224
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,127
<i>Sorry about the unpleasantness before,
but you can't be too safe.</i>

225
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,125
Water under the bridge?

226
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,886
Yeah, water under the bridge.

227
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,048
Great. Okay.

228
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,602
Well, the senator will be up
any minute now

229
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,048
and you are welcome to talk about
anything you'd like for five minutes or so

230
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,964
as long as you don't ask her
about North Korea,

231
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,082
gun control, abortion or Neil.

232
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,689
- Her ex-husband.
- Oh, yeah.

233
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,484
- Okay? Great.
- Okay.

234
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,889
Uh, the photo will be right here.

235
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,884
And don't blink when the flash goes off.

236
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,843
The senator will only give you one shot.

237
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,724
So, don't blink.

238
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,401
I won't.

239
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,686
Good.

240
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,810
Any questions?

241
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,528
Yeah, could I use your restroom?

242
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,566
Oh, yes. Be my guest. Down the hall.

243
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,364
Great. Thank you.

244
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,570
Occupied, mate.

245
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,850
May I have some privacy, please?

246
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,485
Yeah, sorry.

247
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,606
<i>Thirsty?</i>

248
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,765
No, I'm fine, thanks.

249
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,450
The senator is in the elevator.

250
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,443
She'll be here momentarily.

251
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,443
I know you, don't I?

252
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,924
I don't think so.

253
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,125
Are you sure?

254
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,489
Have you been to
one of these campaign events before?

255
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,523
<i>This is his first. Water?</i>

256
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,449
Oh, yes, please, Gladys.

257
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,090
You know what's crazy?

258
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,125
I feel like I was sitting on the toilet
the last time I met you.

259
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,847
That is crazy.

260
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,844
No, that's déjà vu.

261
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,885
That's the mind taking an event
you're experiencing in the present moment

262
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,526
<i>and mistaking it for a memory.</i>

263
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,051
The mind.

264
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,966
You cannot trust the mind,
for it will play tricks on you.

265
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,124
- And we all know who tricks are for.
- Kids.

266
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,325
I'm gonna use the restroom.

267
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,411
Copy that. Standing by.

268
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,965
She's here.

269
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,088
Hello, hello, hello.

270
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,851
<i>Senator, this is Kevin Garvey.</i>

271
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,166
Kevin?

272
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,324
So nice to meet you.

273
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,323
Nice to meet you, too.

274
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,284
Would you like some water, Senator?

275
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,329
Never touch the stuff.

276
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,369
Kevin, I'm sorry about all the security.

277
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,206
I don't know if Gladys told you,
but we received credible intelligence

278
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,682
that someone may be
trying to assassinate me.

279
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,327
Now why do you think
someone would want to do that?

280
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,566
Murder me?

281
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,043
Well, I don't know.

282
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,251
It's because I stick to you, Kevin.

283
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,291
Throughout history, assassins have never
been motivated by money or revenge.

284
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,206
They're motivated by beliefs.

285
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,843
And their targets embody a belief
that enrages their would-be assassins.

286
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,961
Why?

287
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,484
Because secretly, they share that belief.

288
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,851
John Wilkes Booth loved black people.

289
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,082
Hated slavery. Hated it.

290
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,127
- Did you know that?
- I did not, Senator.

291
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,121
Well, he did.

292
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,483
But he still popped Lincoln
right in his stovepipe. Bang!

293
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,208
Emancipated from life.

294
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,002
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

295
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,241
Why do you think
someone would want to kill me?

296
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,011
You tell me.

297
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,764
Because they'd rather put
a bullet in my head

298
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,729
than accept my truth.

299
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,929
And what is your truth?

300
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,042
Well, shit, Kevin,
you wrote me a check for $50,000.

301
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,089
What do you think my truth is?

302
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,167
You want to destroy families.

303
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,204
Write that down.

304
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,008
That is fucking brilliant.

305
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,561
Our polls say our message is confusing.

306
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,767
You just nailed it.

307
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,643
I want to destroy families.

308
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,202
The other day I was in Northboro, Iowa,
and I met a young man.

309
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,121
I was working my way through the crowd
shaking hands

310
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,964
and I see this fellow
and he's waiting for me

311
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,565
and he has a baby in his arms.

312
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,966
And I'm thinking to myself,

313
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,163
"Shit, now I'm gonna have to
kiss that thing

314
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,370
"because that's what one must endure
if you want to get elected."

315
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,407
So, I pucker up,
and you know what that young man does?

316
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,848
He hands me the baby
and he just walks away.

317
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,807
<i>He gave me his child and he disappeared.</i>

318
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,285
<i>Police couldn't find him.</i>

319
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,609
No wife or mother
stepped forward to claim it.

320
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,650
And that baby is now in an orphanage
and it's gonna be fine.

321
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,049
It's gonna be fine.

322
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,528
It's gonna grow up

323
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,684
and it's gonna have difficulty
attaching to people

324
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,367
and it's gonna have difficulty
giving and accepting love.

325
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,410
But, Kevin,
that is no longer a difficulty.

326
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,248
It is a strength.

327
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,484
It is a survival mechanism.

328
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,047
Because on October the 14th,

329
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,210
attachment and love became extinct.

330
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,443
In an instant, it became cosmically,
abundantly clear

331
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,089
that you can lose anyone at any time.

332
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,002
Our cave collapsed, Kevin.

333
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,923
Now, we can spend all our time
digging through the rubble

334
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,407
looking for signs of life,

335
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,089
or we can transform.

336
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,250
Do you mind if I ask you, Kevin,

337
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,688
how you first heard about
what we are trying to do?

338
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,087
How you heard about the Guilty Remnant?

339
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,927
No. Uh...

340
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,920
- My wife left me. Joined up.
Oh-.

341
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,486
<i>That must have been painful.</i>

342
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,291
Mmm-hmm.

343
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,449
No more painful than when Neil left you.

344
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,851
Okay, we are done here.

345
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,168
No, that's okay, Gladys.

346
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,965
Wayne, will you shoot this motherfucker
in the face for me?

347
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,726
<i>PATTY. Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

348
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,405
I'm kidding.

349
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,724
Lighten up, guys-

350
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,249
My donors have been warned
not to use that name,

351
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,324
but fortunately,
I don't give a shit about Neil.

352
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,965
He gave lots of shits.

353
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,923
- Well, received, technically.
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,290
<i>- Right on his chest-</i>

355
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,084
Well, anyhoo, fuck Neil.

356
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,404
Let's get that photo done, shall we?

357
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,646
Yeah.

358
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,406
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

359
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,770
Remember to leave the seat down.

360
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,370
Okay, I will.

361
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,847
Shit!

362
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,361
No! No, I'm not her! No.

363
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,563
Please, please, stop!

364
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,523
I'm not her. I'm not Patti Levin.

365
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,286
My name is Rhonda Gennero.

366
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,930
I'm from Lowell, Massachusetts.

367
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,201
They found me on Facebook.

368
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,042
The campaign, they paid me. They paid me.

369
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,329
They even sent me to Colombia
for plastic surgery

370
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,727
so I'd look even more like her.

371
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,362
I'm... I'm a double.

372
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,926
I'm a decoy.

373
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,800
<i>I've never even met her.</i>

374
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,721
Whatever she's done to you,
please, please don't kill me.

375
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,645
I'm not her.

376
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,925
Goodbye, Patti.

377
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,081
No!

378
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,963
Why am I still here?

379
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,328
You said as soon as I was done,
it'd be over.

380
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,766
Why isn't it over?

381
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,368
Why isn't what over?

382
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,323
Stop fucking with me.

383
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,165
I'm sick of meeting
in fucking parking garages.

384
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,810
I did it, I did what you told me to do.

385
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,570
Why am I still here?

386
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,764
Still... Still Where?

387
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,011
<i>on, jeez!</i>

388
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
I got it.

389
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,644
I got it, people. I got the bird.

390
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,851
<i>Thank you.</i>

391
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,889
Sorry about that, sir.
Um, now how can I help you?

392
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,128
Did you drink the water?

393
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,686
The...

394
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,205
But I was...

395
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,522
I was so thirsty.

396
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,041
Okay.

397
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,769
She locked me out.

398
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,080
Looks like
you're locked out, too.

399
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,927
Hey.

400
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,729
You want a drink?

401
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,005
Yeah, I do.

402
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,130
What's your name?

403
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,966
Kevin.

404
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,330
You here on business or pleasure, Kevin?

405
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,921
Uh, business.

406
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,407
Oh, yeah. Well, what line of work you in?

407
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,007
I'm an international assassin.

408
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,163
- No shit.
- No shit.

409
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,161
I wouldn't think
they'd let you guys drink.

410
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,808
Oh, no, I'm done for the day.

411
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,003
I eliminated my target.

412
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,808
Turns out she was using a body double.

413
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,010
Like Saddam Hussein.

414
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,286
Yeah.

415
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,806
They really do that, huh?

416
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,724
I guess they do.

417
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,127
<i>Wow, international assassin.</i>

418
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,210
You get to travel the world
killing people.

419
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,964
No consequences.

420
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,969
No wife, no kids.

421
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,764
No responsibility.

422
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,251
That's a great job.
I can see why you picked it.

423
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,041
Yeah.

424
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,489
What do you do?

425
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,521
Me?

426
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,090
I don't do anything. I'm fucking dead.

427
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,047
Choked on a piece of chicken.

428
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,809
Which is why we should always do
what our moms say.

429
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,649
Chew before you swallow.

430
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,687
Now I'm stuck in this stupid hotel.

431
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,729
Half the people,
they can't even remember their own names.

432
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,406
The other half,
they're running around doing crazy shit

433
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,449
like international assassins.

434
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,806
And I can't find a single woman
to take a dump on me.

435
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,566
What?

436
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,645
What, you gonna judge me now?

437
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,724
ls your name Neil?

438
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,286
Yeah.

439
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,366
Why?

440
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,804
That little girl in the room
is not your daughter, is she?

441
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,766
You think there's
a little girl in my room?

442
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,761
<i>Yeah.</i>

443
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,006
I saved her from the pool.

444
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,443
Well, you should have
let that fat cunt drown.

445
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,131
Hey,bud.

446
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,571
Hi, Kevin.

447
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,771
Hi, Patti.

448
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,610
Are we leaving now?

449
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,681
Yeah.

450
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,121
Do you know where we're going?

451
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,450
I think so.

452
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,131
Hello, there.

453
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,445
Can I help you, sir?

454
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,408
Uh... Yeah.

455
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,761
We were actually looking for a well.

456
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,564
- A well?
- Yeah.

457
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,324
Um, okay, well, let me see.

458
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,726
Are you sure it's not the caverns?

459
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,962
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a well.

460
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,885
Oh.

461
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,890
Oh, here we are.

462
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,448
Well, in Jarden, Texas.

463
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,881
<i>I'm not sure what the hours are,</i>

464
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,288
but, um, if you head out now,
I'm sure you could get there by sunrise.

465
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,801
It's a straight shot out the I-55.

466
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,445
- Can't miss it.
- Great.

467
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,090
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

468
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,804
You two have a safe trip to the well.

469
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,046
Thanks.

470
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,083
He's gonna throw me in.

471
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,761
Oh.

472
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,691
Well, then I hope you have
your swimsuit with you, young lady.

473
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,324
"Before the arrival
of the European explorers,

474
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,920
"the land we now know as Texas

475
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,331
"was populated by the tribes
of 'in-dig-en-ous' people."

476
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,211
Do you know what that means?

477
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,010
"In-dig-en-ous"?

478
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,448
Yeah, it means native.

479
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,485
Like Indians.

480
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,650
"The Orphan...

481
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,964
"The Orphan's Well outside Jarden

"According to the ancient legend,

483
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,450
"between the world of the living
and the spirit world."

484
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,562
Am I talking too much?

485
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,922
My dad says I talk too much.

486
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,530
He pushed me down the stairs one time.

487
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,808
I broke two of my grown-up teeth.

488
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,808
It's okay. Keep reading.

489
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,163
"For centuries, people have made
pilgrimages to the well

they want to unburden themselves of."</i>

491
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,965
What's wrong?

492
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,083
It looks different.

493
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,882
Are you scared?

494
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,241
No.

495
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,010
I'm not scared.

496
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,011
Stand up.

497
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,321
Walk.

498
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,442
What are you doing with that girl?

499
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,931
Who are you?

500
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,802
What are you doing with that girl?

501
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,483
Taking her to the well.

502
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,726
Why?

503
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,802
I'm gonna throw her in it.

504
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,960
The girl, is she resisting?

505
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,406
No.

506
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,689
<i>I reckon that's because
she wants you to do it.</i>

507
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,130
<i>Just like a woman.</i>

508
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,131
She believes she can improve you.

509
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,889
I don't understand.

510
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,402
That's bloody obvious.

511
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,049
You have a choice.

512
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,246
Cross or jump.

513
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,524
Why would I jump?

514
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,320
Because you don't want to kill a child.

515
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,004
She's not a child.

516
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,687
Yes, she is.

517
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,160
And if you do this, it'll change you.

518
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,649
None of this is real.

519
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,771
Friend, this is more real
than it's ever been.

520
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,804
How far is the well?

521
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,131
Just a mile.

522
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,887
There's no road. You'll have to walk.

523
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,250
Who is that man?

524
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,885
I don't know.

525
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,083
<i>What did he say to you?</i>

526
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,606
It's private.

527
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,444
Was it about me?

528
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,124
Nothing to do with you.
Come on, we have to walk.

529
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,291
YOUNG PATTI; I'm tired.

530
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,724
I'll carry you.

531
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,801
Do you want to drop me in
or do you want to push me in?

532
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,922
Pushing is probably easier.

533
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,771
What's wrong?

534
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,131
It's hard.

535
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,481
Why?

536
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,207
Because I feel sorry for you.

537
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,771
Would it help if I closed my eyes?

538
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,126
No.

539
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,802
Would it help if I say I deserve it?

540
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,485
That's not true.

541
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,646
Yes, it is.

542
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,003
I talk too much, I don't listen,

543
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,124
I'm stupid, I'm worthless, I'm a fat pig,
I don't know how to be happy--

544
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,123
Please stop, okay?

545
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,601
Okay.

546
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,684
Would it help if--

547
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,086
<i>PATTY. Help.</i>

548
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,566
<i>Please?</i>

549
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,091
<i>Kevin.</i>

550
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,524
Please help me.

551
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,125
You Okay?

552
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,410
I ever tell you I was on Jeopardy!?

553
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,241
What?

554
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,801
<i>Jeopardy!, the game show.</i>

555
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,370
My plan was to win 50,000.

556
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,764
If I could do that, I could leave Neil.

557
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,125
Start over.

558
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,291
<i>I just needed something that was mine.</i>

559
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,245
I just needed to win.

560
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,611
50,000.

561
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,764
<i>Going into Final Jeopardy!,
I had a little more than 7,000 bucks.</i>

562
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,169
Stuart was the four-day reigning champ.

563
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,567
Know what he said to me in the greenroom
before the game?

564
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,848
No. What?

565
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,049
Absolutely nothing.

566
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,850
Not a word.

567
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,882
There's a power to that.

568
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,165
Silence.

569
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,009
"Big countries.

570
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,402
"In area,
the largest former Soviet Republic

571
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,090
<i>"after Russia</i>

572
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,568
<i>"and the largest nation
that doesn't border an ocean."</i>

573
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,362
"What is Kazakhstan?"

574
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,891
"Correct."

575
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,726
I've always been good in geography.

576
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,368
You know what Stuart said?

577
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,568
"What is the Ukraine?"

578
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,445
The fucking Ukraine.

579
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,126
"Patti Levin is our new
Jeopardy! champion."

580
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,211
The next night I won again.

581
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,090
Third night, too.

582
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,123
Fourth night, I...

583
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,245
I bombed.

584
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,690
But they let me keep
everything before that.

585
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,926
$65,300.

586
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,291
More than I needed to leave him

587
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,089
<i>and start over.</i>

588
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,930
But I didn't.

589
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,963
I'm scared, Kevin.

590
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,930
Holy shit.

591
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,321
