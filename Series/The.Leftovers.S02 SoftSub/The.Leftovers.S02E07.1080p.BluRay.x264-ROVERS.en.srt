1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,970
<i>PATTY. She's gone.</i>

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,762
It's gonna be a hard day, buddy.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,126
What?

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,362
She grabbed a suitcase,
threw some clothes in,

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,443
grabbed the baby and tiptoed out.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,170
I told you not to tell her.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,685
Bullshit.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,684
Of course she ran off.
I sat right here and watched her do it!

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,808
Barely even looked at you.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,329
If you saw her, where'd she put the key?

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,806
No idea.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,121
Nora?

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,964
She's not here, Kevin.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,200
Nora!

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,801
That's not her.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,007
She's gone.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,486
Shut the fuck up.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,723
- Who are you talking to?
- Don't tell her.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,120
Nobody.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,489
Nora didn't leave me the key.
I think I... Can you run downstairs?

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,971
Where's Lily?

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,686
I guess she's with Nora.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,008
Can you run downstairs,
in my toolbox, grab my bolt cutters?

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,208
You guess she's with Nora?

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,487
Dad, what's going on?

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,723
- Don't tell her!
- Honey, can you just run down?

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,486
They're under the sink in the kitchen.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,487
<i>I remember the day Neil left me.</i>

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,609
I went outside on my lawn,

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,003
and I sat there
until the sprinklers turned on.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,409
The whole fucking world looked
like all the green went out of it.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,925
She didn't leave me. She wouldn't do that.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,690
She would and she did.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,681
Kind of didn't leave her any choice
once you told her about me.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,411
And you tell your daughter,
she gonna leave you, too.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,201
It's for you.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,921
Where did you find that?

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,241
What did you do?

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,164
Just give me the letter, honey.
It's... That's mine.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,685
What did you do?

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,886
Okay.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,728
<i>Jill, stop. Hey, stop it!</i>

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,968
Jill, stop it right now. Give me that.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,846
"Mary and the baby are with me.
Don't call."

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,970
So, she just left?

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,524
No, I...

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,368
Jill. Oh, Jill, come On. Jill!

48
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,090
I can fix this, Jill.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,681
<i>Jill!</i>

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,244
Honey!

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,490
<i>PATTY. Like I said, Kevin,</i>

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
hard day.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,291
<i>- This is Nora. Leave a message or don't.</i>

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,045
Hey, Nora, it's me. Um...

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,129
Look, I know you're in town
because you got Mary with you.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,806
I just need to know where you are,
that's it.

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,641
I know what I said is crazy and...

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,806
I'm not crazy.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,401
We just need to talk about it, that's it.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,363
Just... Please, call me back. I love you.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,404
I hope she calls back.

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,447
Hey.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,846
I was right.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,001
About what?

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,721
Told you something was going on with them,
and now she's gone.

66
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,803
- She took Lily and she left.
- Wait, wait, slow down.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,004
- What happened?
- What happened is my dad fucked up.

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,685
Please, can you not...

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,769
Really? You want me to go
outside to say fuck?

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,401
- Jill, come on.
- Fuck. Fuck!

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,809
No lightning bolts, so...

72
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,086
Tell me.

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,010
He's losing his mind.

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,882
He and Nora have to handcuff
themselves together every night

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,771
so that he doesn't sleepwalk.
He doesn't even remember where he goes.

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,605
He sleepwalks?

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,250
And he talks to himself.

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,641
Actually, no, he doesn't talk to himself.
He talks to someone else.

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,165
My grandpa did the exact same thing,

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,766
and then they locked him up
in a mental institution.

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,082
He heard voices that weren't there.

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,527
Well, how do you know they're not there?

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,284
Because they're not.

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,289
I talk to someone who's not there.

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,125
- You mean God?
- Uh-huh.

86
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,722
Is he the one that's telling you that we
can fool around, but we can't fuck?

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,289
Or is that Jesus? Or the Holy Ghost?

88
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,086
I get the three of those confused.
Which one is it that you're talking to?

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,449
Why aren't any of you guys talking to me?

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,761
Hello.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,326
Hello!

92
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,611
You know, I can really use
some fucking help here.

93
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,724
We can't do it
because I don't want to do it.

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,801
What?

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,528
Listen, I think you're amazing.

96
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,808
But we barely know each other.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,288
I don't know if I love you yet.

98
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,091
All right.

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,729
Thanks for the talk, Reverend.

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,363
<i>All right, I know this one.</i>

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,931
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

102
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,009
Hey, I'll be with you in just a sec.

103
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,891
Yeah. Sure.

104
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,887
God damn it, I know this. Hold on.

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,041
It's a duck.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,889
Don't tell me now. Is it...

107
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,169
It's a fucking duck.

108
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,166
Is <i>it sobaka?</i>

109
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,129
<i>No, utka.</i>

110
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,566
Sobaka is dog.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,007
Oh, he's learning a language.

112
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,242
Damn it, utka. I knew that.

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,366
Hey, how you doing?

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,409
I'm good. How you doing?

115
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,927
I was wondering if you
could help me out here.

116
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,489
HOW did you do that?

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,051
Tell him it was sex stuff.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,242
I just wondered if you
could just cut it off.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,084
Well, let me get a look.

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,045
Yes, sir. That's police issue.

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,009
Yes, it is. Yeah, I'm a cop.

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,446
Was a cop.

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,365
Well, if you want me to pick it open,

124
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,161
I'm gonna have to see your badge,
or police ID, or something.

125
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,644
Could you just do me a favor
and cut it off?

126
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,766
It was a...
It was a stupid accident.

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,408
Accident? Hmm, honesty, Kevin.

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,761
Shut the fuck up!

129
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,761
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

130
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,801
Yeah.

131
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,443
I'm sorry. Uh...

132
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,930
Yeah, I'm sorry.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,085
Just trying to help.

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,126
Ooh, that is rubbing you raw. I can tell.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,962
So you got a plan here, now?

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,360
That's your plan? Hmm.

137
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,450
<i>Seems ill-conceived to me.</i>

138
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,688
<i>Maybe if you just, I don't know, put</i> it...

139
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,842
God damn it! Just shut up!

140
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,805
What do you want?

141
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,886
Sorry?

142
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,008
Why do you keep following me?

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,931
If you want me to do something,
just fucking say it.

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,561
I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,287
There is something you need to do.

146
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,127
In Cairo, Egypt,
there is an ancient artifact.

147
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,450
It's in a museum now.

148
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,683
They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,721
Scholars call it the wishing cup.

150
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,805
You need to acquire this cup.
It's more of a chalice, actually.

151
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,326
It's gonna be heavily guarded,
but you need to get it any way you can.

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,005
Because once you do,

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,481
you need to fill it with your cum, Kevin.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,207
And then you need to drink it down.

155
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,165
Every last drop.

156
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,131
Jesus, Kevin!

157
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,929
I have no fucking idea
what you're supposed to do.

158
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,882
<i>I don't have some asshole with a halo
giving me instructions.</i>

159
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,045
I killed myself. Next thing I know,
I'm saddled with you.

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,611
I'm just as fucking lost as you are.

161
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,005
Please, just...

162
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,050
Leave me alone. Please?

163
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,811
You're destroying my life.

164
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,201
You're destroying your life.

165
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,646
I just get to watch.

166
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,723
Please, just go away.

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,410
Please, Patti.

168
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,848
I'm begging you, please.

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,086
What?

170
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,524
I guess it didn't work.

171
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,766
What?

172
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,682
It didn't work. She's still here.

173
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,124
I know you went to see him.

174
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,451
<i>You don't remember?</i>

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,207
Uh... Michael...

176
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,082
I need you to get out of my truck.

177
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,208
- I'm not having...
- Her name's Patti, right?

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,645
<i>The woman that you see.</i>

179
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>Her name is Patti. She dresses in white.</i>

180
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,967
How do you know that?

181
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,009
My grandfather told me.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,241
Listen, if you want to get rid of her,

183
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
he can help.

184
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,769
If you can't remember how to get there,
I can give you directions.

185
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,648
Two blocks up, make a left.

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,002
Just wait here a minute, okay?

187
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,682
Hey, Pop. He's here.

188
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,526
<i>PATTY. Hallelujah.</i>

189
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,328
Well, Kevin, that there looks like a fella
who's a solution to all our problems.

190
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Michael says you're a sleepwalker,

191
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,881
and you don't remember coming here.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,041
No.

193
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,803
All right. Well, come on in.
We'll go over it again.

194
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,121
<i>Just you.</i>

195
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,401
Three's a crowd.

196
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,368
Do you remember seeing me
at the visitors' center?

197
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,086
The day you got here.

198
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,762
Do you recall what I said to you?

199
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,124
You said, uh, that you could
help me with my situation.

200
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,409
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,929
It's 'cause I felt her

202
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,965
clinging on you.

203
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,284
Like that plastic they put over
a plate of food so it won't go bad.

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,009
So I invited you over.

205
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,568
You pretended like you didn't know
what I was talking about.

206
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,889
But later that night,

207
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,970
you came knocking.

208
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,125
I can't remember being here.

209
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,368
Yeah, well, you were here.

210
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,442
Sat right there in that same chair.

211
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,127
<i>Talking to me,
just like you're talking to me now.</i>

212
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,481
<i>If you were asleep,</i>

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,170
<i>I certainly couldn't tell.</i>

214
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,321
Wake <i>up!</i>

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm not asleep.

216
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,807
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,128
Do you remember what I said
when I was here?

218
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,645
Mmm-hmm.

219
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,481
You told me who she was, Patti.

220
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,283
Told me how she killed herself
right in front of you,

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,606
and ever since then,
she wouldn't let you be.

222
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,523
Then you asked me
how you could cast her out.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,287
Sounds like a fucking exorcism.

224
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,841
Oh, you people and that movie.

225
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,367
Let me ask you something.
You throwing up across the room yet?

226
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,443
Your head turning round and round?

227
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,726
No.

228
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,686
No, that's because
she ain't in you, Kevin.

229
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,045
She's on you.

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,887
And if you want to get her off you,

231
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,963
you can't do it on your turf.

232
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,484
You got to go to hers.

233
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,404
The other place.

234
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,567
How do I do that?

235
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,606
You die.

236
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,242
I don't... I don't understand.

237
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,689
You understood just fine the last time.

238
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,810
In fact, you grabbed a piece of my rope,

239
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,482
picked up a cinder block from outside,

240
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,166
then off you walked into the woods.

241
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,043
And I told you you needed help,
you needed a guide,

242
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,250
but you were itching to do battle.

243
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,164
So off you went to do it.

244
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,565
Now, drowning's not the best way to cross.

245
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,850
No exit strategy.

246
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,641
And like I said, you need a guide.

247
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,123
<i>But I'd reckon that that quake
happened right before you passed.</i>

248
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,646
<i>Opened up the ground,
emptied out all that water.</i>

249
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,450
<i>Spared your life.</i>

250
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,604
<i>Which means, either you got
somebody looking out for you,</i>

251
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,123
or you've got yourself
a most powerful adversary.

252
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,805
Who are you?

253
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,567
I'm just someone who once
had an adversary of his own.

254
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
One that made me do terrible things.

255
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,163
And for those things,

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,005
I was shot

257
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,930
in the chest,

258
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,170
in the belly,

259
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,802
and in that foul machinery below the waist

260
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,440
which transgressed the laws of man.

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,650
<i>And when I went over,</i>

262
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,126
I did battle with my adversary,

263
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,124
and I vanquished him.

264
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,444
<i>And then, Kevin,</i>

265
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,530
I was reborn.

266
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,049
Michael's your grandson.

267
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,361
<i>He is.</i>

268
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,929
And his father, John, he...

269
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,404
He went to prison

270
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,125
for attempted murder.

271
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
He did.

272
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,488
So, what did you do to him?

273
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,685
I hurt him.

274
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,442
I hurt him a long time ago.

275
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,282
And then he hurt me back.

276
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,804
And he freed me.

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,809
Now, let me free you.

278
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,605
By killing me?

279
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,965
Temporarily.

280
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,965
Come on back when you're ready.

281
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,043
Any time, day or night.

282
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,761
Patti!

283
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,085
Patti Levin!

284
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,726
Where are you?

285
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,484
Are you fucking hiding from me?

286
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,007
You come out right the fuck now!

287
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,525
<i>PATTY. Jesus, Kevin.</i>

288
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,091
<i>Get 8 grip-</i>

289
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,960
Where were you?

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,206
Around.

291
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,166
You lied to me.

292
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,330
- Sorry?
- Yeah.

293
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,530
That night, you said you were
with me the whole time.

294
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,325
You said you saw the girls disappear.

295
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,845
You said you saw me try and kill myself.

296
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,480
But you left out the fucking part, Patti,

297
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,485
where I went to him.

298
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,045
So what?

299
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,122
What would you have done if I told you
that the solution to all your problems

300
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,682
was a magical black man
sitting out on the edge of town?

301
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,771
That's borderline racist,
what that is.

302
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,530
He knows what you are.

303
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,048
He knows how to get rid of you.

304
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,487
<i>Then why the fuck are you
out here in the woods calling for me?</i>

305
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,924
This man gave you a solution and you ran!

306
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,527
You think I'm scared
to do battle with you?

307
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,241
Oh, Kevin,

308
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,765
I am so desperate to do battle.

309
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,082
So let's go. Let's go back.

310
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,206
Right now.

311
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,769
Let's go fucking die.

312
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,089
I have responsibilities.

313
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,765
I'm a father.

314
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,889
Maybe Jill would be better off.

315
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,601
<i>This is Nora. Leave a message or don't.</i>

316
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,646
Nora, can you call me back?

317
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,121
Please?

318
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,370
I need you, so just call me back.

319
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,608
What about what she needs?

320
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,721
Hello?

321
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,644
<i>Hey, this Kevin Garvey?</i>

322
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,964
<i>- Yeah.
- Ranger Carson calling from the bridge.</i>

323
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,730
<i>Visitors' center gave me your cell.</i>

324
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,882
<i>There's a woman at the gate
asking for you.</i>

325
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,844
<i>Says she's your wife.</i>

326
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,245
ls her name Nora? Nora Durst?

327
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,402
<i>Hold on. Are you Nora?</i>

328
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,804
<i>Says her name is Laurie.</i>

329
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,881
<i>Hello?</i>

330
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,764
Is she there? Is she there right now?

331
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,242
<i>Yes, sir, but I can't let her in
without a wristband or reservation.</i>

332
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,005
Who was that?

333
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,769
I'm Kevin Garvey.
You called me on the phone.

334
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,048
Oh, yeah, great. Hang on one sec.

335
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,683
Hey, Kevin Garvey's here.
Could you bring that lady on up?

336
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,724
She doesn't have a reservation
or anything,

337
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,769
so you have to talk to her at the fence.

338
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,801
Sure.

339
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,721
Hi.

340
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,401
You're talking.

341
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,251
Uh-huh.

342
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,290
What are you doing here, Laurie?

343
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,161
I know I don't have any right to be here,
um, just to bother you.

344
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,364
And I know you have every right to move on
and I respect your boundaries,

345
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,285
but I just... I need to talk to Tommy.

346
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,361
Nora told me that he wasn't here,

347
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,364
and I understand why
she felt the need to say that.

348
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,246
I... I don't know what he told you,

349
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,768
but if you could please just

350
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,446
have him come see me.

351
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,123
I'm staying at the Prairie Motor Inn
in Laramie, room 114...

352
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,248
When did you talk to Nora?

353
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Last night.

354
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,930
She didn't tell you?

355
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,171
Tommy's not here.

356
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,086
I haven't spoken to him in...

357
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,841
I haven't seen him in over a year.

358
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,970
He's not here?

359
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,687
No.

360
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,520
Why would you even think
that he would come to me?

361
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,331
Well, I don't know. I mean, he's in touch
with Jill, and I thought, maybe...

362
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,482
- He's not in touch with Jill.
- He's in touch with Jill, Kevin.

363
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,529
They text all the time.

364
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,561
So, Tommy, he's been with you?

365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,126
Yeah.

366
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,611
Is he okay?

367
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,685
He's fine.

368
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,965
What did you do?

369
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,406
What happened?

370
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,321
Why are you here? What did you do, Laurie?

371
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,170
Are you okay, Kevin?

372
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,565
Yeah, I'm okay.

373
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,965
I'm great.

374
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,925
I'm terrific.

375
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,966
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,167
I shouldn't have come here.

377
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,527
I'm... I'm sorry.

378
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,001
No. No!

379
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,484
No, you don't leave.

380
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,205
You're gonna leave?

381
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,690
You don't leave!

382
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,008
Hey, Laurie! Fine! Good!

383
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,525
Good, go home!

384
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,281
Go home! Go home!

385
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,481
Kevin.

386
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,446
Hey, man.

387
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,005
You got the flyer?

388
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,801
The what?

389
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,003
Oh, well, there was a palm print found

390
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,640
on the car that the girls
disappeared from.

391
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,202
Figured I'd give all the innocent men
an opportunity to get on the right list.

392
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,249
But you're not here for that.

393
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,491
Oh, um...

394
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,850
Actually, I was, uh...

395
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,131
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out with this.

396
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,085
Oh. Your idea or Nora's?

397
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,004
It's hers.

398
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,361
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

399
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,490
<i>Well, your secret is safe with me.</i>

400
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,761
Good.

401
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,687
Cedric, go grab the cutters.

402
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,164
You know where they are?

403
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,685
Somewhere.

404
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,841
While you're here, you mind?

405
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,320
- Me?
- Uh, yeah, you.

406
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,561
Oh, yeah.

407
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,682
Just press it down right there in the ink.

408
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,685
The other hand.

409
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,286
Oh.

410
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,761
There we go.

411
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,366
Handi Wipes are free.

412
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,689
- Your name?
- Uh, Kevin Garvey.

413
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,881
<i>Okay-</i>

414
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,007
Another innocent man exonerated.

415
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,761
- Thanks for doing that, Kevin.
- You're welcome.

416
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,042
No cutters, man. Couldn't find them.

417
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,608
<i>T.J. must have taken them home with him.</i>

418
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,129
Why would he do that?

419
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,644
<i>Sorry, man.
But, oh, you know who can help you out?</i>

420
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,049
Locksmith, right down on Fuller there.

421
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,323
Nate. Tell him I sent you.

422
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,047
Good. Uh, thanks.

423
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

424
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,602
<i>PATTY. Well, that's that.</i>

425
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,729
You went there to get free,
and you got caught.

426
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,640
You know, the only time in my life

427
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,842
that I felt truly free, Kevin,

428
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,809
was when I picked up that piece of glass,
and I stuck it in my neck.

429
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,241
<i>You were holding me in your arms,
and I looked up into your eyes,</i>

430
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,450
<i>and you were so afraid.</i>

431
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,486
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

432
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,564
Because it was finally over.

433
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,651
That's freedom.

434
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,811
Did you fix it?

435
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,963
She's not returning my calls.

436
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,410
You gonna tell me what you did?

437
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,325
It's complicated.

438
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,565
I'll bet it's not.

439
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,410
Are you pretending?

440
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,891
Pretending what?

441
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,846
I believed you when you said
that you loved Nora.

442
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,921
And you said that you wanted
to adopt Lily.

443
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,607
And you said you wanted
us all to be a family.

444
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,245
That's all I want.

445
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,287
Then what are you going to do, Dad?

446
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,731
I don't know.

447
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,565
Please figure it out.

448
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,284
This is twice now, so...

449
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,846
Kevin, I know.

450
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,764
I'm gonna leave first thing
in the morning. I promise.

451
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,491
- You didn't need to come--
- Can we talk?

452
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,401
What?

453
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,211
Can I talk to you?

454
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,126
Okay.

455
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,284
What is she wearing?

456
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,201
What?

457
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,407
Patti.

458
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,046
When you see her, what is she wearing?

459
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,326
She's wearing white.

460
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,848
The same thing as when she died?

461
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,887
I don't know, it's just white.

462
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,201
Huh.

463
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,970
Can I get one of those?

464
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,441
Yeah.

465
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,249
<i>Where did you hide them?</i>

466
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,401
What?

467
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,121
Your cigarettes.

468
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,931
When we were married,
where did you hide them?

469
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,967
Oh, I, uh...

470
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,124
In the trunk of my car.

471
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,247
I also stuck a pack under the mailbox

472
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,209
for when I went on runs.

473
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,248
It's fucking great, smoking.

474
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,485
Yeah.

475
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,611
So, what kinds of things
does she say to you?

476
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,604
Well, she told me
not to tell Nora about her.

477
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,365
'Cause Nora would leave.

478
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,406
Yeah.

479
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,206
And she was right.

480
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,370
Yeah, I guess she was.

481
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,326
And now that Nora's gone,
what kinds of things does Patti say?

482
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,880
Nothing.

483
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,806
Nothing?

484
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,807
No.

485
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,484
Kevin, a few hours ago,
you were yelling at me to go home,

486
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,051
and now we're here.

487
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,321
Is she telling you to do something?

488
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,528
Something you don't want to do?

489
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,121
I'm assuming she's not here right now.

490
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,087
No.

491
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,689
And she wasn't at the gate
when you saw me earlier?

492
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,206
No, she...

493
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,771
Well, that makes sense.

494
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
It does?

495
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,526
Uh-huh.

496
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,480
She'd want to stay as far
away from me as possible.

497
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,607
Why?

498
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,411
Because I can prove she doesn't exist.

499
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,761
How?

500
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,130
I could ask you to make her
tell you something

501
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,841
that only she and I would know,
and she wouldn't be able to do it.

502
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,362
But she tells me things all the time
that I wasn't there for.

503
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,130
She told me about her husband.

504
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,884
- Neil?
- Neil, yeah.

505
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,407
Kevin, I was Patti's therapist
for over three years.

506
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,281
I mean, don't report me
for breaking confidentiality,

507
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,329
but I told you about Neil.

508
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,241
The serial philanderer
with the anal fixation.

509
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,121
Highly abusive, probably the reason

510
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,846
<i>she started fixating
on the end of the world.</i>

511
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,242
I don't remember any of that.

512
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,325
Well, maybe if you listened to me more,
we wouldn't be in this fix, huh?

513
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,323
It's a... It's a joke.

514
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,005
<i>It's a joke.</i>

515
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,604
Well, if you were my patient,

516
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,331
walking into my office,
I would indulge this.

517
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,401
You never tell somebody
who's in the midst of a psychotic break

518
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,080
that they are in the midst
of a psychotic break.

519
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,685
But you are not my patient,

520
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,968
so I'm gonna tell you the truth.

521
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,408
What you are seeing is not real.

522
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,603
I know your dad struggled
with this as well.

523
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,883
And there is research indicating
that there is a genetic link--

524
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,405
She's there.

525
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,611
She's right there.

526
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,441
She's real.

527
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,964
- You believe that?
- Yes.

528
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,441
Can I tell you about belief, Kevin?

529
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,768
When the mind is in emotional distress,

530
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,208
it will grasp at any construct
that makes it feel better.

531
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,450
After the 14th, the whole world
needed to feel better.

532
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,841
We were all in emotional distress.

533
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,971
So that made all of us
susceptible to false belief,

534
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,802
to be taken advantage of.

535
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,083
And the reason I know this, Kevin,

536
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,084
is because Tommy and I used it.

537
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,610
We convinced people

538
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,568
that he could take their pain away
just by hugging them.

539
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,286
We had a story.

540
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,082
We made it up, but it worked.

541
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,087
And, I mean, Tommy hated it. The lying.

542
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,686
And I said it didn't matter,
as long as we were helping people.

543
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,366
But he disagreed.

544
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,688
And we had a fight,

545
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,127
and he said that he couldn't...

546
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,924
What I am trying to say

547
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,007
is that they believed it.

548
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,931
Every single person
that he laid his hands on.

549
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,204
Because their brains
would sooner embrace magic

550
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,045
than deal with feelings of fear,

551
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,362
and abandonment, and guilt.

552
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,762
And all of us turn to someone
who could just turn it off.

553
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,606
Why do you think I joined a fucking cult?

554
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,722
And now you are manifesting
the leader of that cult

555
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,009
because you need someone to turn it off.

556
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,604
There is no Patti, Kevin.

557
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,164
There is only you.

558
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,730
So, what do I do?

559
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,242
You need to go on medication,

560
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,681
and maybe go away for a little while.

561
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,603
What you're dealing with
is very serious, Kevin.

562
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,282
And I know it's scary,
but that's what you need to do.

563
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,970
You need help.

564
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,728
Did you change your last name?

565
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,486
- What?
-ls your last name still Garvey?

566
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,090
Or did you change it when we split up?

567
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
No, I didn't change it.

568
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,051
Then I can get you a wristband.

569
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,326
<i>Kevin, I don't understand.</i>

570
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,209
Will you come with me?

571
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,487
If you're there,
then she'll leave me alone.

572
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,967
You know, just till I figure it out.

573
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,765
I don't think that's a good idea.

574
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,968
I don't think Jill's gonna want to see me.

575
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,490
I didn't want to see you.

576
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,689
But I'm getting over that.

577
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,049
You said I need help, so...

578
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,486
Help.

579
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,081
Jill?

580
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,325
Jill, honey.

581
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,331
She's not home.

582
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,762
Her boyfriend lives next door.

583
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,524
<i>She's probably with him.</i>

584
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,326
Come on in.

585
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,969
Our guest bedroom is in there,

586
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,691
if you don't mind sleeping
in a hospital bed.

587
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,845
Mary Jamison's been staying with us.

588
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,843
Mary? Matt's wife?

589
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,081
Yeah.

590
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,647
Long story.

591
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,004
I'm sorry about the dog.

592
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,321
What?

593
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,211
You wanted to get a dog, a puppy.

594
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,329
I was kind of a dick about it.

595
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,401
I forgot that.

596
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,204
I think about that a lot.

597
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,729
Well, consider yourself forgiven.

598
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,451
That's Nora.

599
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,202
- Go, take it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

600
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,647
Hi.

601
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,481
Uh...

602
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,809
How are you? Uh, how's Lily?

603
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,970
<i>NORA". Please stop calling me.</i>

604
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,322
Can you tell me where you are?

605
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,047
<i>No.</i>

606
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,041
Why not?

607
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,442
<i>Please, just tell me where you are.</i>

608
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,440
<i>Can we talk about this?</i>

609
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,481
Hello?

610
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,764
I don't want to talk about
you seeing a dead woman.

611
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,126
<i>I know. I know it's...</i>

612
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,489
I know, and I know I should have
told you sooner.

613
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,486
When it started,
like we promised each other,

614
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,371
but I was scared you were gonna run.

615
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,931
And you did.

616
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,200
And you also handcuffed me to a bed
and you didn't even leave me with a key.

617
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,691
There was a sign.

618
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,407
A what?

619
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,971
<i>I left it on the chair by the bed.</i>

620
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,491
<i>It's not there?</i>

621
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,930
She was blocking it.

622
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,846
Oh.

623
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,006
Nora.

624
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,480
I love you.

625
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,490
<i>Listen, there's a way.</i>

626
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,160
<i>I have a way.</i>

627
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,922
A way that I can get better.

628
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,521
But I need to know that you'd believe me

629
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,968
if I looked you in the eye
and I told you that she was gone,

630
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,648
that you'd know that she was.

631
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,481
How?

632
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,645
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

633
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,041
<i>I</i> can.

634
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,846
I just need to know that when I do,

635
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,049
that you'd believe me.

636
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,170
Because I would never lie to you.

637
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,041
Never.

638
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,691
Would you believe me?

639
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,565
I would believe you.

640
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,609
And would you come back?

641
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,650
I'd like that.

642
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,646
What are you doing here?

643
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,767
Well, honey, your father... I'm here to--

644
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,888
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

645
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,371
- Dad!
- Jill.

646
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,324
- Jill. Jill.
- Hey,Dad!

647
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,362
What the fuck is she doing here?

648
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,847
Dad!

649
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,167
Dad?

650
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,961
Dad!

651
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,527
Dad!

652
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,961
What's going on?

653
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,246
Oh, nothing, nothing.

654
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,006
Michael was... Michael was just leaving.

655
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,171
God be with you.

656
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,407
How do we do this?

657
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,928
You just tell me you're ready.

658
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,047
I'm ready.

659
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,890
<i>That should do it.</i>

660
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,331
What is that?

661
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,085
<i>It's poison.</i>

662
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,403
<i>It's gonna stop your heart.</i>

663
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,849
You said temporarily.

664
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,202
That I did.

665
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,006
This...

666
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,125
Epinephrine.

667
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,884
That poison's gonna work
like a heroin overdose.

668
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,602
It's gonna shut you down.

669
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,926
This is gonna start you back up.

670
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,764
Now, I'm gonna time this.

671
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,642
Brain will be fine for up to five minutes.

672
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,606
I'll give you the shot long before that.

673
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,209
You've done this before?

674
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,802
You know the guy on the pillar?

675
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,005
Yeah.

676
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,844
His name's Edward.

677
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,041
He's a living, breathing success story.

678
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,164
Just so you know...

679
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,446
Uh, this is...

680
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,524
I don't want to die.

681
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,930
Of course not.

682
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,490
Life is precious.

683
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,004
I just drink it?

684
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,685
<i>Just drink it.</i>

685
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,046
Wait!

686
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,721
She here?

687
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,681
I'm...

688
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,250
I'm glad you're finally
taking action, Kevin,

689
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,726
but let's think about this for a second.

690
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,047
This is a big step for us.

691
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,882
<i>And we don't really know him.</i>

692
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,044
If I'm understanding right,

693
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,248
his primary qualification
is that he's a pedophile.

694
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,164
Shut the fuck up, Patti.

695
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,683
Do you want me to do this?

696
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,121
- What?
- Do you want me to do this?

697
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,845
Or don't you?

698
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,607
I absolutely want you to do it.

699
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,330
What? What? What did she say?

700
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,241
Laurie just told me I was a psychotic.

701
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,927
That I belonged in a mental hospital,

702
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,680
like my dad.

703
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,242
That was his diagnosis, too.

704
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,971
Psychotic.

705
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,841
I saw him right before I came here,

706
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,562
and he told me the voices were gone,

707
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,930
that he was cured.

708
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,689
And I asked him how.
Do you know what he told me, Patti?

709
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,042
He said he finally just did
what they told him to do.

710
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,440
Kevin, stop!

711
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,444
Good-bye, Patti.

712
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,128
How long does this usually take to...

713
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,607
I'm sorry, son. I know it hurts,

714
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,963
but it won't be long now.

715
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,081
English - SDH
