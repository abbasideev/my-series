So why not have the royal elf
look into it?

only see one of you.

Sisters.

The younger one is leaning forward.

295
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,847

296

I know this image. It's familiar.
The younger one adores the older.

297

So they're getting ready.

299
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,614
But she's not really coming.

300

It's you.

301
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,543
And me.

How can that be?

303
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,345
Did I find you?

304
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,308
Or were you supposed to find me?

305

She's very strange, that woman.

321

Did you really, you know,
see all those things that you said...

322
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,014
Did you really see all those things
you said you saw in there?

324
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,810
Ellie, it's me.

00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,813
Look at me. It's me, Annie.

326
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,773
Yes, Annia.

327
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,608
My ranger and my guide.

328
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,153
Of course, of course, of course.

329
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,239
It's fucking fantasy.

330
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,865

331
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,909
It's my least favorite genre.

332

What is this?

333
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,580
What does this mean?
What is this supposed to be?

334
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,334
What does any tale mean?
My tutor used to ask me this.

335
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,464
I have read many fascinating moral tales
in the archives of the palace.

336
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,342
‐[scoffs] Man, you love this.
‐Do you understand?

337
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,636

Hey. Come on.

You're okay. You're okay.

conspiring against me.

Turning my test subjects against me.

344
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,663
How are the systems running?

345
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,166
[Azumi] So far,
all the key indicators look perfect.

346
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,501
Whatever she's doing is helping.

Maybe your mother
doesn't destroy everything after all.

348
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,465
How is she?

349
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,634
She's breathing.

350
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,391
I never apologized to you about the gala.

351
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,729
You don't have to. The consequences
were simply the end of our romance.

352
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,898
I'm sorry, Azumi.

353
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,109
It was a way out.

354
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,486
A way out...

355
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,987
of what?

356
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,615
Failure.

357
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,122
This is the quietest I've ever seen her.
