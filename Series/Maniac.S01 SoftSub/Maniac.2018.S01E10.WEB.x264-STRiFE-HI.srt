Not now, Owen.

00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,429
[Mantleray] What? What? They're awake?

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,181
They're not dead?

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,267
They're alive. You woke up!

6
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,935
Were we not supposed to?

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,354
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,149
- So nice of you to come.
- Congratulations.

9
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027
- Good to see you. You look wonderful.
- Congratulations.

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,071
Hello, hello. So good to see you, yes.

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,239
Are you feeling pure, unaffected joy?

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,746
Why are they all staring at us?

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,791
- [D'Nail] Like we're in a zoo.
- [Raymond] No, like cattle...

I'm a big fan. I have all your books.

Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,220
You've just completed
the 73rd iteration...

19
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,012
of the ULP.

20
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,141
It's been a complete success.

21
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,103
Congratulations.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,521

You can speak to them that way,
but you cannot speak to me that way.

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Perhaps you know me from my books,
my radio program.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,877

You stole my mind from me for profit.

38

I advise that you never allow my son
to practice in this industry again.

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,641
needed to say.

48
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,937
Fine.

- Yes.

- I suppose...
- Yes.

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,619
You and I could share a very brief...

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,538
lunch together sometime.

53
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625

it would have failed in any case.

if she can't find the generosity
to forgive Jed

183
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
for something that she agreed to,

184
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,288
then we as a family
will rip it out of her chest cavity.

185
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
That's a confusing metaphor.

186
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,753
That's how the Milgrim family
deal with our enemies.

187
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,718
[door opens]

188
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
[footsteps leaving]

189
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,975
[door closes]

190
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,737
[Jed] Don't let this happen, Owen.

191
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,242
I'm a horrible person.

192
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,954
Adelaide's gonna leave me.

193
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,793
I don't know how this happened.

194
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,876
Jed...

195
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,338
[mug smashes]

196
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,757
[Jed sniffles]

197
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,721
These are real fucking tears, Owen.

198
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,017
You're either a part of this family
or you're not.

199
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,230
[Owen] I buzzed him up at 7:05.

200
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,568
I know the time
because he's always five minutes late,

201
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
and I asked him to be there at seven.

202
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,406
And I know we were there for four hours

203
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,617
because that's how long
it takes me to beat him at Risk.

204
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,119
[laughter]

205
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:35,916
So, is it possible for Jed Milgrim
to have been at the office at 8:25?

206
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,670
Not unless someone could be two places
at the same time.

207
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,591
Objection, Your Honor.
There is no real documented time line.

208
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,552
- [judge] Overruled.
- [Frank] No further questions, Your Honor.

209
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,472
Nobody can be two places at once,

210
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
but everyone has to be somewhere.

211
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,435
Do you agree, Mr. Milgrim?

212
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,148
I don't understand the question.

213
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,735
You have no data portals
in your micro apartment.

214
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,531
You live in a building with no doorman
and no security monitoring whatsoever.

215
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,450
- That's true.
- Why?

216
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,786
I prefer to be disconnected.

217
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,372
[lawyer] In a sense, you're invisible,
aren't you?

218
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,456
Sure.

219
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,667
Then let's see something visible.

220
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,295
At this point, Your Honor,
we'd like to introduce

221
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,380
the plaintiff's exhibit eight.

222
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,633
Video footage pulled
from the closed-circuit system

223
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,135
of the defendant's place of work.

224
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,513
Do you recognize this place, Mr. Milgrim?

225
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,309
That is the factory floor
of my father's company.

226
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,684
[lawyer] And this?

227
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,406
That's the stairwell
of my father's company.

228
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,065
[lawyer] What do you see happening here?

229
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,984
[Owen] I see a man groping a woman.

230
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,695
[lawyer] This is the man

231
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
who used his power in the workplace

232
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,159
to force my client
into a heinous sexual act.

233
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,805
[courtroom murmurs]

234
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,563
[lawyer] The defense's entire case

235
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
rests on you not believing
your very own eyes,

236
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,860
and instead believing Owen Milgrim.

237
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,781
Mr. Milgrim, were you diagnosed
with schizophrenia ten years ago?

238
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,867
[Frank] Objection.
Irrelevant and prejudicial, Your Honor.

239
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,994
[judge] Overruled.

240
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,829
Answer the question Mr. Milgrim.

241
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,249
[lawyer] Are you schizophrenic,
Mr. Milgrim?

242
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,460
[clears throat]

243
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,544
Yes.

244
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,715
[lawyer] Are you on any
anti-psychotic medications?

245
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,094
I'm supposed to be,
but I stopped taking them a while ago.

246
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,805
[lawyer] Do you ever get confused
about your brother, Jed?

247
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,474
As in you believe you're seeing him,

248
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,353
when, in fact, you are imagining
someone who just looks like him.

249
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
[Owen] Not anymore.

250
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,735
And do you have trouble telling
the difference between what is real

251
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,486
and what's not?

252
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,570
[clears throat]

253
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,491
- Sometimes I do, yes.
- [Frank] Objection, Your Honor,

254
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,702
the witness is clearly having
a panic attack...

255
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,872
I would like to submit my testimony.

256
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,083
[lawyer] As I said before,

257
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,588
this entire case rests
on what Mr. Milgrim thinks of this image.

258
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,593
Does this man
look like your brother, Jed Milgrim?

259
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,765
It doesn't look like him.

260
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,932
See? I told you.

261
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,187
It is him.

262
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,524
[man] What the fuck did he just say?

263
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,152
It's obviously him.

264
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,487
Motherfucker.

265
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,821
[lawyer] Just to clarify,

266
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,705
- your brother wasn't with you...
- I'm saying I lied, and he's guilty,

267
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
and he's a monster,
and I'm sorry for lying.

268
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,746
I'm not a liar.
He's guilty and he did it.

269
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,975
- [lawyer] No further questions.
- [Frank] Your Honor, I move to redirect

270
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,001
and treat Mr. Milgrim
as a hostile witness.

271
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,445
[judge] It's too late, Counsel.
You've already examined him.

272
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,713
Motion denied.

273
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,049
[Frank] No further questions, Your Honor.

274
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
You're dead. You're fucking dead.
I'm gonna kill you.

275
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm gonna kill you my fucking self.

276
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
[yelling] I'm gonna fucking kill you!

277
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,352
[gavel pounds]

278
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,230
[birds chirping]

279
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
I need to tell you something.

280
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,605
I need to tell you
that it's not okay for me...

281
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,065
out here...

282
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,820
all by myself.
It was before, but it's not anymore.

283
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,410
Yes, you married a woman...

284
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,537
who was sick.

285
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,292
And she couldn't handle having a family,
and she left us.

286
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,377
And it broke your heart.

287
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,422
And then your daughter died.

288
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,259
And it was the wrong one.

289
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,721
It was the easier one...

290
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,237
who was good at life. Who made you laugh.

291
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,106
Who didn't cause problems,
who always called you.

292
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,651
Who didn't remind you of her mother.

293
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,991
And it's okay that you had to go in there,
but I don't accept it anymore.

294
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,078
I need you out here.

295
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,165
We are the only ones left.

296
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,376
I need you out here with me, Dad.

297
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,051
- I'm lonely.
- I take it your trip to Salt Lake...

298
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,261
opened things up.

299
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,598
What are you doing?

300
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,184
Annie, I don't think that,

301
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,478
what you said about the wrong one.

302
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,521
I don't... I don't think that.

303
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,776
Did you steal all my money?

304
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,238
I can pay you back.

305
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,532
When I saw how much you took,
I figured you weren't coming back.

306
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,867
I just figured, well...

307
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,577
there it is.

308
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,373
The third and final Irish exit.

309
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
Don't be.

311
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,129
How was it?

312
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,340
I didn't go.

313
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,301
Not technically.

314
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,430
[Hank] Your brain is not melted, at least.

315
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
It would have been painless, I heard.

316
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,060
According to the, uh...

317
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,021
insane computer.

318
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,564
[grunts]

319
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,066
She was going through a lot.

320
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,902
Well...

321
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,574
You seem good, Annie.

322
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,298
I don't feel good. How is she? How did...

323
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,248
- How'd she seem?
- Who?

324
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,916
Ellie.

325
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,585
Um...

326
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,338
None of that was real.

327
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,427
You get that.
I just... made up a version of her.

328
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,637
Maybe but, you know,

329
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,098
who really knows how this stuff works.

330
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,559
So, how'd she seem?

331
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,314
She seemed like herself.

332
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,774
Good.

333
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,614
Anything come to you
in the last three days?

334
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
I don't know. I think so.

335
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,498
But honestly, I feel confused.
I feel like maybe I did it wrong.

336
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,961
Owen listened to all of my stories.

337
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,674
But in the reflections, I kept giving him
all these reasons not to trust me,

338
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,302
but he just... kept trying to help me.

339
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,221
He acted like a friend.

340
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,904
[woman] <i>I want to talk to you</i>
<i>about something</i>

341
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,898
<i>you've been avoiding since you got here.</i>

342
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,398
Okay.

343
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,320
You talked about what happened
at the drug trial,

344
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,490
and you talked about
what you went through with your family,

345
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,243
but I still don't understand why you never
tried to talk to Annie again.

346
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,998
Because there were two options,
and neither could end well.

347
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,085
What are the two options?

348
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,421
Option A, she doesn't really exist.

349
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,717
I look up her name,
figure out where she lives,

350
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,012
and realize there's no one on Earth
with that name.

351
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,557
Next, I go
to Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech

352
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,687
and find out there's no such thing
as Neberdine Pharmaceutical Bio Tech.

353
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,439
What about option B?

354
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,943
Option B's even worse.

355
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,786
[Annie] <i>Owen, look.</i>

356
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,746
<i>I was so focused on my own shit.</i>

357
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,124
I should have said I care about you,

358
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,170
and that after everything we've been
through, I can't not have you in my life.

359
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,966
Because it's really hard...

360
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,844
to actually just connect with somebody.

361
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,680
And... when you do...

362
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,475
you don't... You can't just run away.

363
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,352
[man] Hey, Annie...

364
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,521
you don't have to explain it.

365
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,233
I know how special our connection is.

366
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,488
It means so much to me that you would
ask me to come with you to San...

367
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,323
to Salt Lake City.

368
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,368
[Annie] Hmm.

369
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,582
Uh, Annie, I love you.

370
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,003
And I'm not gonna let my schizophrenia
get in the way

371
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,339
of these two big, beautiful beating hearts

372
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,675
because we're meant to be together.

373
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,052
Anna, I, uh...

374
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,239
- Um...
- [Annie] What are you doing?

375
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,140
- Annie.
- No, no. You know what? No.

376
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,683
Will you marry me?

377
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,601
[Annie] No.

378
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,684
- What?
- No? No.

379
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,397
- Just stop.
- Oh, I guess I misread the file.

380
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,776
Yeah, it's not like that at all,
and you're doing him wrong.

381
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,862
It needs to feel like pain,

382
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,031
but not an awful kind of pain.

383
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,493
It's like this low-level sadness
that has a lot of...

384
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,621
caring and sweetness underneath it.

385
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,580
Forget it.

386
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,499
That's a lot to remember, but, uh...

387
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,125
Are you firing me?

388
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,252
[man] I can't lose another one, fuck.

389
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,632
This is...

390
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,843
This is real Owen.

391
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,032
Oh, they had me committed?
There's no way this is a coincidence.

392
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,687
This... This is a sign, Friend Proxy Owen.

393
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,650
Maybe the universe isn't total chaos.

394
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,609
That's comforting.

395
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,488
Let's do this.

396
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,739
[engine turns over]

397
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,074
Hey!

398
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,369
Oh, I wasn't going to get in any way.

399
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,994
Cue the music.

400
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,581
There she goes.

401
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,292
- [gear grinds]
- [man] Okay, can't really drive stick.

402
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,628
[man] Stuck in Bushwick.

403
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,131
[exhales] God, I hate my fucking life.

404
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,215
[gear grinds] Hello.

405
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Would you sign in
and check your bag, please?

406
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,443
Oh, sure.

407
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,531
For you, sir.

408
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,074
- Hey, there.
- Hello. Just here to visit my niece.

409
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,248
My husband is already inside, so...

410
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm late. I'm in trouble.

411
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,025
- Here you go. Thank you.
- All good?

412
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,884
- Okay, where should I go?
- Right here.

413
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

414
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,957
What are you doing?

415
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,503
- What the fuck are you doing here, Owen?
- Moving benches.

416
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,720
[Annie clears throat]

417
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,222
- My family had me committed.
- I know that, idiot.

418
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,932
I mean, what are you doing in <i>here?</i>

419
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
This isn't even a state-run facility.

420
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,393
I'm crazy.

421
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,191
[Owen coughs]

422
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,942
You're not fucking crazy, Owen.

423
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,362
Come on, you're just kind of crazy.

424
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,116
I made some threats to powerful people.

425
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,619
I sent anthrax to the governor.

426
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,454
Your brother did that.

427
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,456
I had a blip...

428
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,584
in college. I should be here. I'm sick.

429
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,668
Okay.

430
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,587
Maybe you're diagnosed,

431
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,673
maybe you need to be medicated,

432
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,799
but this...

433
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,427
This does not work for me, Owen.

434
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,847
I don't think it works for you either.

435
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,601
So you saw some things
that weren't there. So what?

436
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:11,022
People see aliens, people hear voices,
people see ghosts.

437
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,357
That's different.

438
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,528
My mind, it...

439
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,031
- It doesn't work right.
- No one's does.

440
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,373
I'm gonna go into that bathroom
right there...

441
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,917
and 30 seconds later,

442
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294
you're gonna go into that bathroom.

443
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,837
You get me?

444
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,672
No.

445
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,341
What is the problem?

446
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,801
I'm afraid.

447
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,884
Of what?

448
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,347
Option B.

449
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,813
Annie, the same thing happens
every time I meet someone

450
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,356
or get close to someone.

451
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,233
I mess it up.

452
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,072
I'm gonna get frustrated...

453
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,325
one day, and yell at you out of nowhere,

454
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,829
over something insignificant
I'm fixated on.

455
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,500
And then you'll stop calling back.

456
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,255
And you'll change your number
and it'll break my heart.

457
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,638
It's just easier if you're not real.

458
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,891
But I am real.

459
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
You know me.

460
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,941
You're braver than this, Owen.

461
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,445
And I will never do that to you.

462
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,362
Never.

463
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,118
Thirty seconds.

464
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,247
[Owen clears his throat]

465
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,041
[sniffs]

466
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,628
Thirty seconds.

467
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,298
[clears throat]

468
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,856
Hey.

469
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
Come in here.

470
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,234
Come on.

471
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,317
Lock the door.

472
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,875
Our niece is out there.
We were visiting.

473
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,253
She's the one dancing by the wall.

474
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,839
It was a great visit,
but, you know, it's over now.

475
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,382
And you're Bruce.

476
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm Linda.

477
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,178
Sorry these are weird. They're my dad's.

478
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,473
Owen, I saw this in a movie. It works.

479
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,933
Here.

480
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,731
Put 'em on.

481
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,820
Owen.

482
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,113
[Owen clears his throat]

483
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,166
Annie, why are you here?

484
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,336
Because I'm your friend.

485
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,009
And that's what friends do.

486
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,928
Okay.

487
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,612
Hey.

488
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,030
Didn't you come in alone?

489
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,116
No, we were together.
You're seeing things.

490
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,452
Uh, I'm pretty sure you came in alone.

491
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,164
I'm pretty sure she came in alone.

492
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,748
Uh...

493
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,919
Let me see the sign in sheet.

494
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,257
- Is that the truck?
- Yes, yes, my dad gave it to me.

495
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,341
Just get in.

496
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,010
Let's go, come on. Go, go, go.

497
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,562
It's open! Get in!

498
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,565
That's Harpo. She's a rescue.

499
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,069
- Dammit.
- What's wrong?

500
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,113
This just happens
when I try to start cars.

501
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,843
Owen, will you go to Salt Lake City with me?
I don't technically have a driver's license.

502
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,164
Yes! You've gotta start the car, though.

503
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,165
Okay. Okay.

504
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,267
- [engine turns over]
- Go!

505
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,210
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

506
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,548
Annie, be careful!

507
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,384
Go, go!

508
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,134
Hey, hey!

509
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,636
Hey, hey, stop!

510
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,890
Annie, be careful!

511
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,517
I got it. We're good.

512
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,018
Shit, I missed the exit.

513
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,068
Hey! Stop!

514
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,654
Let go! We're good.
We're fine. We're fine. Bye!

515
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,656
[man] Stop!

516
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,036
This is it.

517
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,330
This is it.

518
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,122
[Mantleray] <i>It's a ridiculous theory.</i>

519
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>More something my mother
would have cooked up.</i>

520
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,835
- [Azumi] <i>I'd like to hear it.</i>
- [Mantleray] <i>Oh, you would?</i>

521
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,422
- [Azumi] <i>It's a long way to Newfoundland.</i>
- [Mantleray] <i>Okay, yes. Well...</i>

522
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,549
<i>it begins like this.</i>

523
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,677
<i>Two billion years ago, an amoeba...</i>

524
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,597
[Owen] <i>How far away is Salt Lake City?</i>

525
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,640
[Annie] <i>It's far.</i>

526
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,226
<i>And I'm not entirely sure</i>

527
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,591
<i>this truck is gonna be able to get us
the whole way there,</i>

528
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,606
<i>but, you know, we'll get there one day.</i>

529
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,735
[Owen] <i>Do we actually know each other?</i>
