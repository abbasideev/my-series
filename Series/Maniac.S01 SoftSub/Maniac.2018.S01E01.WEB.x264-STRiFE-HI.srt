00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,452
To what?

176
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,037
[operator] <i>It makes perfect sense.</i>

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,682
<i>- We are offering you heroism.</i>
- [man] So this is your office area.

178
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,416
Again, it's a question of commitment.

179
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,168
[Owen] Your ad is misleading,

180
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,755
'cause you refer to it
as a volunteer opportunity,

181
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,882
but in the end I'd have to pay.

182
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,261
[operator] <i>But think about</i>
<i>what you'd be getting.</i>

183
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,386
<i>- A wife, lonely, in need.</i>
- [Owen] Yeah.

184
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,680
- [operator] <i>Owen. It's a done deal.</i>
- I have to go.

185
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,892
Rozo did the anonymous
hammerhead from the top down

186
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,895
and came back
with a 12-bullet short-termer.

187
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,648
- When?
- Well, they randomized the pattern.

188
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,359
We've sent out 30 memos on it
since this morning.

189
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,445
Um, so this furlough,
how long does it last?

190
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,697
- It's temporary.
- Right.

191
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,158
So... when am I back?

192
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,745
Oh, I don't know. I was kidding.
It's probably permanent.

193
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,044
I was using your kind of humor,

194
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,589
when you say something you don't mean
and nobody laughs.

195
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
It's... Yeah, it's okay. I'll just...

196
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,513
I'll just dip into my savings.

197
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,184
Bye.

198
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,145
[exhales]

199
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,229
[rumbling]

200
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,070
[retching]

201
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,073
[coughing]

202
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,865
[spits]

203
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,953
[coughing]

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,632
THE PATTERN IS THE PATTERN

205
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,051
[man] <i>Okay, Owen.</i>

206
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,888
<i>- Do you know what I want to do?</i>
<i>- </i>[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

207
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,224
[man] <i>Are you sure you know</i>
<i>what I want to do?</i>

208
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,684
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

209
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,187
[man] <i>The way this deprogramming works,</i>
<i>it's not an overnight fix.</i>

210
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>You have to listen to it like a mantra.</i>

211
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,527
<i>If you start feeling paranoid,
you play this tape right away, okay?</i>

212
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,194
[Owen] <i>Okay.</i>

213
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,240
[man] <i>Now, stop me when I say something</i>
<i>that's not true.</i>

214
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,492
<i>The world sends you messages.</i>

215
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,244
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

216
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,204
[man] <i>Words are often code words,</i>

217
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,166
<i>or pass phrases for important secrets.</i>

218
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,500
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

219
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,628
[man] <i>You're visited by a brother</i>
<i>no one else in your family is aware of.</i>

220
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>A facsimile of your brother Jed.</i>

221
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,133
- [Owen] <i>Yes.</i>
- [man] <i>He sends you messages.</i>

222
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>Instructions for important missions
you must accomplish.</i>

223
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,930
[Owen] <i>To see the deeper truth.</i>

224
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,349
[man] <i>He tells you you're meant</i>
<i>to do something big,</i>

225
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,553
<i>something that matters to the world,
and that you're not meant to do it alone.</i>

226
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,064
<i>All you need is a partner.</i>

227
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,108
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

228
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,069
[woman] <i>You made a promise to me,</i>
<i>and you made a promise to yourself.</i>

229
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>You promised we'd golf together
in Hilton Head.</i>

230
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,826
[man] <i>You sense danger all around you,</i>
<i>but you stay disciplined.</i>

231
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,495
<i>A fight's coming.</i>

232
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>Something even bigger than this world.</i>

233
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,374
<i>Possibly extending to multiple galaxies.</i>

234
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,710
- [elevator] <i>Fourth floor. Thank you.</i>
- [Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

235
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,253
Hello, Mrs. Finkelstein.

236
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,963
Fuck off, Donovan.

237
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,424
It's, uh... Owen.

238
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,178
- Owen Milgrim...
- Fuck off, Donovan.

239
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,261
Never mind. [man] <i>Good.</i>

240
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,391
<i>Does it feel good to be heard?</i>

241
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,351
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

242
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,021
[man] <i>Does it feel good to know that</i>
<i>you're not alone with this information?</i>

243
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,231
[Owen] <i>Yeah.</i>

244
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,191
[man] <i>Will you complete your mission?</i>

245
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,108
[Owen] <i>Maybe.</i>

246
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,861
[man] <i>Am I a trusted messenger?</i>

247
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,239
[Owen] <i>Yes.</i>

248
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,741
[man] <i>Good.</i>
<i>Then here are your real instructions.</i>

249
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,596
<i>Repeat after me. There is no pattern.</i>

250
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,996
[Owen] <i>There is no pattern.</i>

251
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,958
[man] <i>I am vulnerable,</i>
<i>but I am not stupid.</i>

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,294
[Owen] <i>I'm vulnerable, but I'm not stupid.</i>

253
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,006
[man] <i>But I will seek out the people</i>
<i>in my life that care about me.</i>

254
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,260
[Owen] <i>I will seek out the people</i>
<i>in my life who care about me.</i>

255
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
[man] <i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

256
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,763
[Owen] <i>I am not the chosen one.</i>

257
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,647
- [man] <i>The voices aren't real.</i>
- [clattering]

258
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,952
- [Owen] <i>The voices aren't real.</i>
- The voices aren't real.

259
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,644
[man] <i>The voices are just noise.</i>

260
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,164
- [Owen] <i>The voices are just noise.</i>
- The voices are just noise.

261
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,316
[man] <i>I am just a guy</i>
<i>with a vivid imagination.</i>

262
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,777
[Owen] <i>I'm just a guy</i>
<i>with a vivid imagination.</i>

264
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,824
[man] <i>I will most likely</i>
<i>not be the savior of our galaxy.</i>

265
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,907
Hello?

266
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,913
[man, distorted] <i>I've got a package</i>

268
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,793
What?

269
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,547
[man] <i>I've... a package... your name.</i>

Hello?

276
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,873
[woman] <i>Hi, Owen.</i>
<i>Did you get what I sent you?</i>

277
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,124
[Owen] How did you...

278
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,628
[woman] <i>I've just been informed</i>
<i>that you qualify as a hero candidate.</i>

279
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,064
- What does that mean?
<i>- </i>[woman] <i>It's a term we use</i>

280
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,133
<i>for those who've been specifically
selected for one of our studies.</i>

281
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,802
<i>You're a very desirable individual
to us, Owen.</i>

282
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,097
<i>I've never seen B.N. over-ratios
like this before.</i>

283
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,478
What does a hero candidate do?

284
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,939
[woman] <i>Exactly the things</i>
<i>they were born to.</i>

285
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,360
<i>In your case, helping us treat maladies
ranging from sluggishness and depression</i>

286
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,405
<i>to I.B.S, to popcorn problems
and irrational fears.</i>

287
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,867
"Popcorn problems"?

288
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,535
[woman] <i>Prostate problems, yes.</i>

289
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,829
Oh, I thought you...

290
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,666
[woman] <i>We'll give you all the details</i>

Thank you.

317

Where does she sleep when she stays over?

318
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
This one?

319
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,926
Yeah, she's your sister, right?

320
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,889
Or is she a secret agent?

321
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,808
How did you know?

322
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,189
[whispering]
Because I have super-secret sources

323
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,941
at a super-secret agency.

324
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,651
Don't tell anyone.

325
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,736
[whispers] Okay.

326
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,446
Supper's ready.

327
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,490
Okay, Mom.

328
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,784
I was completely baffled.

329
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,702
You know, I left for school.

330
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,372
Ernie was fine, and then, you know,
the food was in the bowl.

331
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,291
The water was there,
cage was locked up,

332
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,543
and I get back from basketball practice,

333
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,339
- and he's just gone, absolutely...
- The great gerbil escape artist.

334
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,256
[laughs]

335
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,675
- But he wasn't exactly fucking gone.
- Language, Phil.

336
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,637
No, that's correct.
He wasn't exactly fucking gone like that.

337
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,597
- [hostess] Language, Jed.
- Where'd he go, O?

338
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,101
Maybe you shouldn't curse so much
in front of the children.

339
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,954
- Ah, come on. Tell the rest.
- [hostess] This is not a farmyard, boys.

340
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,230
So, um, I ask everyone, right?

341
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,774
Everyone's looking around the whole house,
everyone frantic,

342
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,610
and finally Owen, you know,
eventually comes up

343
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,028
and brings me to his room...

344
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,215
How old were you then, Owen?
Like, eight or somethin'?

345
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,758
- Nine.
- [Jed] Eight or nine, whatever.

346
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,075
And he says... he says,

347
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:42,204
"Uh, I have to tell you somethin'.
My... my hawk ate Ernie."

348
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,915
"What?" And he points over there,

349
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,167
and there's
this big fuckin' red-tailed hawk

350
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,044
sitting on his desk staring at me.

351
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,463
What eight-year-old has a fuckin' hawk?

352
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,298
Uh, how did you have a hawk?

353
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,136
Um, I rescued it from the park.

354
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,140
I found it with a broken wing
and brought it to my room and fed it.

355
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,100
- Yeah, I forgot.
- You'd feed him.

356
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,020
That was the craziest part. He would
feed it, like a mother bird, you know...

357
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
Oh, masticate... No, no, no. Premasticate.

358
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,235
- Yeah, premastication!
- Jed was a chronic masticater.

359
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,046
- How'd you know?
- He'd go blind doing that.

360
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,614
How long did you
take care of the bird for, Owen?

361
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
Two or three months,
until it was strong enough

362
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,621
to go into Jed's room
and eat his gerbil, I guess.

363
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,498
[laughter]

364
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,042
But what happened to the hawk?

365
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
We set it free.

366
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
Oh. Okay.

367
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,952
[Owen's father] That reminds me.

368
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,051
Remember when Colby
fell in the Gowanus Canal?

369
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,387
- Remember that day?
- [hostess] Oh, poor Colby.

370
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,390
- I threw the stick, he didn't go for it...
- So traumatizing.

371
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,933
[jazz music playing]

372
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,400
[woman] I told Jed I wouldn't marry him
until they painted you in.

373
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,028
Maybe that's why
we haven't set a date yet.

374
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,698
They're gonna paint me in.

375
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,993
The artist just took
a six-month sabbatical to Nepal,

376
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,286
to study the light.

377
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,414
I lost my job.

378
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm sorry, Owen.

379
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
It's okay, I'll find a new one.

380
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,134
I'm actually thinking about becoming

381
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,887
a temporary volunteer husband.

382
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,305
You're not serious.

383
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,808
Get rid of my lease,
bounce from widow to widow.

384
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,934
Mm-mm.

385
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:33,732
Do you ever notice that your plans
always involve starting over...

386
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,069
often with an entirely new identity?

387
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,072
It's a good fantasy.

388
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,617
[hostess] Pudding's upstairs
by the fireplace, everyone.

389
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,080
Just to get through
the post-dinner conversation.

390
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,839
Think about it.

391
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,884
Seriously...

392
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346
as a hypothetical.

393
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,267
Say you and I left, right? Tonight.

394
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,771
I got us passports, new identities.

395
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,275
You steal all the money
from Jed's bank account.

396
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,111
We just... do that.

397
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,155
We get a house in the middle of nowhere.

398
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,031
Start again.

399
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,076
Different people.

400
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,995
Are we a married couple?

401
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,081
We don't...

402
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,919
We can be, you know...

403
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,798
We don't have to be. We could be
brother, or sister, or... friends.

404
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
So...

405
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,178
tonight, then,

406
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,014
after dessert?

407
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
Yeah.

408
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,644
I'm serious. Let's do it.

409
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,484
You're fucking with me.

410
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,197
I got you.

411
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,281
[laughs]

412
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,869
You believed me.

413
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,833
This week's gonna be a living hell for me.

414
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,586
[Owen sighs]

415
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,837
He'll totally win.

416
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,924
He's not guilty.
No chance of a conviction.

417
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,177
It's all just so humiliating.

418
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,096
I mean, it's been going on
for fucking ages,

419
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,515
all just for one day in court.

420
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,143
Because he didn't do it, so...

421
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,688
You're positive?

422
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,524
Right? You were actually with him?

423
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,069
Yes.

424
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,303
- [man] You would make that move.
- [Jed] What does that even mean?

425
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,037
- "Make that move"?
- That's the move...

426
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,790
Hey, Owen, you're not trying
to sneak off, are you?

427
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,707
No, Dad.

428
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,959
I need a second of your time
before you leave.

429
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,629
Come on, boys, it's time.

430
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,507
- [all] Balderdash!
- Oh!

431
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,676
- [hostess] Owen, you're staying to play.
- No, I-I have to go.

432
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,012
- I have something...
- You love Balderdash.

433
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:09,930
No, I don't.

434
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,099
Come on, stay, it will be fun.

435
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,975
I have a fundamental problem
with Balderdash.

436
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,436
I gotta say,
what a delicious meal that was.

437
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
- Sure was.
- So good, Mom. So good.

438
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,148
- You used to love Balderdash.
- Oh, no, I didn't.

439
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,085
- [Jed] Who wants ice cream?
- [children yelling]

440
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,070
- Who wants ice cream? Oh, you do?
- I do!

441
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:29,324
Of course. But whoever's the quietest
gets ice cream, I promise. Mom.

442
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh, are we playing Balderdash, or what?

443
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,248
So, um... [clears throat]
I've been considering...

444
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,291
Considering leaving Roosevelt Island?

445
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,626
- No...
- Oh, thank God.

446
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,462
So, have Hal help you find
something closer.

447
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,440
- Oh, you moving closer?
- I'm not moving closer.

448
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,092
Crazy to think that every word
did get invented.

449
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,010
I-I have to go. Goodbye.

450
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,680
- Wait, you're not playing Balderdash?
- No, I can't. Bye.

451
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,932
Oh, Owen, come on, you love Balderdash.

452
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,394
No, I don't fucking love Balderdash!
Balderdash is bullshit. [clears throat]

453
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,689
- Jesus, Owen.
- Is he off his meds?

454
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,029
- [child cries]
- I'll walk you to the station.

455
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,752
- Don't worry about Uncle Owen.
- Aggressive.

456
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,945
He's a spaz.
We're gonna get ice cream now.

- [Owen] <i>No.</i>

458
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,536
I know it's an expensive apartment
to rent, but...

459
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,790
Have you... have you thought about a...
a roommate?

460
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,874
No.

461
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,337
I don't know why you won't let us
just buy you a place.

462
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,131
That way you'd have more security.

463
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,510
Or you... you could come and work
for the company.

464
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,679
All your brothers do.

465
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,683
I already agreed, okay?

466
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,643
You don't need to buy me off.

467
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,314
Uh... I don't... I don't follow you.
What<i>...</i>

468
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,776
I will lie for Jed...

469
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
next week in court.

470
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,283
I get the expectation.

471
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,412
It's not an expectation, Owen,
it's a gift.

472
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,750
You are giving your brother
the gift of an alibi.

473
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,129
This woman is an opportunist.
She sees an in.

474
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,340
[loud music blares from car]

475
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,884
[sighs] You're protecting him.

476
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,636
You're protecting the family.

477
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:19,935
I know, I know, it sounds muddled,
but that is the way reality works, Owen.

478
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,895
- How's that, Dad?
- [robot chatters]

479
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,189
With... with adjustments.

480
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,983
Just so you know, I got a new job.

481
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,987
Oh? What... what job?

482
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,615
Business... marketing.

483
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,869
It involves travel, so I'll be gone
a couple days next week,

484
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,913
but I'll be back in time for the trial.

485
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,248
And...

486
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,044
don't worry if you can't reach me.

Oh.

That's... that's wonderful, Owen.

490
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,762
That's... that's... that's great.

491

What do the bombs mean?

511
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,480
High-risk.
That's where the dollars come from.

512
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,026
Apparently, they're havin' some kind
of problem with this new drug.

513
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,196
- I think you should let me do it again.
- Strong stuff. Very trippy shit.

514
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,324
- [woman] Who's in charge of the red light?
- That doesn't bother you?

Are you gonna ask it?

Huh?

00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,623
Did you lose your husband recently?

Okay.

Let us complete this trial
with none of the old problems, sir.

593
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
Yes, Dr. Fujita.

594
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,662
None of the old problems.

595
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,452
[orderly] As you enter the common room,

596
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,645
you will notice
there are numbers on the pods.

597
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,982
The pod numbers correspond
with the numbers on your lanyards.

598
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,442
Please go to your pod.

599
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,154
That will be your home for the duration
of your stay here with us.

600
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,865
Leaving your pod
at any unauthorized moment

601
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,202
will result in the termination
of your stay here at this trial,

602
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,497
as well as bringing shame
and humiliation upon you.

603
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,545
Once you reach your pod,
an orderly will approach

604
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,756
and begin to inspect your bag.

605
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,551
Once the orderly has inspected your bag,
you will put your bag in your locker.

606
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,887
Once you have done that,
make your way to this gentleman.

607
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,305
He will give you your uniform,

608
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,808
as well as your patented Neberdine shoes,

609
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,061
which you cannot take with you
at the end of the trial.

610
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,565
Once you have your uniforms
and your shoes,

611
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,567
you will make your way back to your pods,

612
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,530
then you will get in your pods
and change clothes in your pods.

613
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,824
There will be no changing in the commons.

614
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,285
Oh, my God!

615
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,954
[orderly] Condoms are contraband.

616
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,373
- Safety first.
- [orderly] That's a red flag right there.

617
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,584
Intimacy in this facility is off-limits.

618
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,630
There will be no cohabitation
inside the pods.

619
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,258
Once the curfew starts, lights go out.

620
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,926
You're not supposed to be here.

621
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,389
Please.

622
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,932
What are my instructions?

623
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,976
The pattern is the pattern.

624
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,228
You're my contact.
What are my instructions?

625
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,481
[whispering] Please turn off the pattern.
Please turn off...

626
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,025
- Owen.
- [orderly] ..tight schedule.

627
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,944
We will tell you when there is mealtime.

628
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,614
Your instructions are to go back
to your pod and await my signal.

629
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,927
[orderly] ...two Etch A Sketches and one
Lite-Brite. Please don't fight over them.

630
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm going to save the world.

631
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,288
We will tell you
when there's recreation time.

632
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,914
- Yes.
- We will also tell you when...

633
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,792
- You're gonna save the world.
- And we will tell you when to sleep.

634
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,838
- But not if you blow our cover.
- [orderly] ...expecting. Thank you.

635
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,548
Is that working for you?

636
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,757
Okay, I understand.

637
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,926
If you're having trouble
getting into your pod,

638
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,472
there is also a little ladder underneath
that will help you get into your pod.

639
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,641
Also note, from here on in,

640
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,978
you will be referred to
as the number on your lanyard.

641
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,104
You are the Odds.

642
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,231
Attention.

643
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:48,080
Please give your attention
to Dr. Muramoto and Dr. Fujita.

644
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,082
They will be supervising your trials.

645

[speaking in Japanese]

646
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,213
Welcome, subjects.

647
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,757
You made the right choice.

648
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,844
It's time to start your lives again.

649
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,766
You don't fuck this up...

650
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,602
I won't fuck this up.

651
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,645
Just kidding.
