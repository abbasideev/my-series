181
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,918
Lost custody of her daughter, Usnavy.

182
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,129
Goes to Hunter.

183
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,965
Good job, had it for 18 months.

184
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,008
Probably had records scrubbed
so she could get it.

185
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,761
You want
the whole skeleton-closet file?

186
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,723
I could threaten
to kidnap the daughter too.

187
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,141
[Annie] No.

188
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,019
- That shit always works.
- No, it's fine. I don't...

189
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,938
- I don't want to harm her in any way.
- [Matt] Uh-huh.

190
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,316
Okay.

191
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,363
Here's your calendar. Other options.

192
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,743
Volunteers at CP Center,
user of Friend Proxy,

193
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,412
pays way too much for luggage...

194
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,165
Wait, Friend Proxy?
Does she have appointments coming up?

195
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,708
Ah...

196
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
Interception.

197
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Hm?

198
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,798
[birds chirping]

199
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,362
Patricia?

200
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,823
Juanita.

201
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,701
[chuckles] [laughs]

202
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,039
Oh!

203
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,082
Hey.

204
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,252
- It's so good to see you again.
- You too. You too.

205
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,048
You know, um,
every time I walk in this place,

206
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,258
I get pulled back into this room,
you know?

207
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,342
Oh, me too.

208
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,843
Me too.

209
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,085
I just love little trees.
I meant because of how we met.

210
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,811
- Right here.
- Sure.

211
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,271
- At the bonsais.
- Oh, yeah. That too. That too.

212
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,473
Do you remember that summer?
How much fun we had, right?

213
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,280
- [laughs]
- Oh!

214
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,158
Running up and down Coney every day...

215
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,869
Eating icy pops.

216
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,665
Yeah, when we took the train,
with Uncle Liam.

217
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,837
Now, who the fuck is... Uncle Liam?

218
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,175
I'm sorry. I-I don't...
Do you want to start over or something?

219
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,636
Seriously? What, then, you new?

220
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,263
No. I'm...

221
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
What...? What's your rating?

222
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,059
'Cause you really don't have
a very good feel for people, honey.

223
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,439
You're using a service
that gives you pretend friends.

224
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,067
I have real friends.
This is just more convenient.

225
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,151
Mm-hmm.

226
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
Oh, you have friends?

227
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,867
You know what?
I don't even work for Friend Proxy.

228
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,201
All right?

229
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,371
I canceled your appointment,
and I am here to fuck up your life, lady.

230
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,790
I'm gonna blackmail the shit out of you.

231
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,333
What?

232
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,796
[Patricia] What? What are you
talking about? Who are you?

233
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,256
Forget it. I'm sorry.

234
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,261
- No, no, no, no, wait. Who are you?
- No, I'm really sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

235
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,601
- [birds chirping]
- [water flowing]

236
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,104
Hey.

237
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,775
Can I sit with you?

238
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm just trying to understand.

239
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,491
I'm a bit confused.

240
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,034
Am I a mark?

241
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,619
Yeah.

242
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,248
For what? I'm...

243
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,209
I'm broke.

244
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,921
I was trying to get into a study
at your work.

245
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,548
And I said I'm sorry,
so can you leave now, please?

246
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,466
Why?

247
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,929
- I really don't need...
- No, really, I'm asking you...

248
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,055
why?

249
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,558
Is this some AA shit?

250
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,685
I'm enjoying this pond.

251
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,773
You remind me of my little girl,
that's all.

252
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,152
If there's anything I can help...

253
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,530
So...

254
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,407
why?

255
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,415
Because I am addicted to a drug
that your company's testing.

256
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,002
That's not the "why" I'm asking.

257
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,047
What "why" are you asking?

258
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,431
Five years ago, my sister and I got into
a really bad fight.

259
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,227
Very, very bad.

260
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,313
And I can't fix it.

261
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,404
So there's this rock
that sits in my stomach, this cold rock.

262
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,907
Like a boulder, and it's just there...

263
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,451
all the time.

264
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,412
And I found this pill...

265
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,332
It helps me get through the day.

266
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,878
It's not hurting anyone.

267
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,091
And it makes me feel good. It is
the only thing that makes me feel good.

268
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,802
Have you tried talking to her?

269
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,095
I can't.

270
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,980
Why shouldn't I be able to take
a pill like that whenever I want?

271
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,525
You should, hon.

272
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,612
If it ain't hurting anyone.

273
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,404
Hmm?

274
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,575
[people chattering]

275
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,795
Super happy.

276
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,464
[keyboard clacking]

277
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,302
Helpful.

278
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,142
Togetherness.

279
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,518
You don't have to rush.

280
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,186
Okay.

281
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,355
Sorry.

282
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
Sisters.

283
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,907
Making faces at each other.

284
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,534
It's supposed to be an emotion.

285
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,745
What you feel.

286
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,121
Fine.

287
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,874
[keyboard clacking]

288
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,504
[woman]
Now, please turn your attention to me...

289
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,465
as I ask you this final question.

290
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,030
[machine buzzes]

291
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,448
The test is complete.

292
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,661
Please go back
to the reception area and wait.

293
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,744
Did I...?

294
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,748
Did I pass the test?
What was that last question?

295
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,128
I was telling the truth
about all those pictures.

296
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,297
- [woman] This test is not about the truth.
- Well, what is it about?

297
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,340
Defense mechanisms.

298
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,051
I don't have fucking defense mechanisms.

299
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,805
I think you should let me do it again.
Who's in charge of the red light?

300
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,934
I... I don't fucking understand because
I am supposed to be part of the trial.

301
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,018
[woman] I'm sorry.

302
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
This is fucking bullshit.

303
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,362
[Annie] Patricia. Patricia.

304
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,614
No. No, no, no, no, no. No more favors.

305
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,950
I got bosses around. No more. Go.

306
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,425
- [whispering] We had a deal.
- I said I could funnel you through ULP.

307
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,719
You failed the intake test.

308
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,346
It is out of my hands.

309
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,223
No, I have to get into that study,
Patricia.

310
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,599
All the way. I can't.

311
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,604
Move on, please.

312
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,818
There you go. Thank you.

313
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,661
[Annie]
Patricia, may I speak with you, please?

314
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,041
You have a daughter.

315
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,836
Her name is Usnavy,
and she goes to Hunter College.

316
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,048
And if you don't get me into that study,
you're never gonna see her again.

317
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,715
What?

318
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,594
Yeah, I know a guy who has a van,

319
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,722
and if anything happens to me,
he knows what to do.

320
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,641
You're fucking crazy.

321
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,851
I'm not fucking crazy, Patricia.

322
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,062
I'm just goal-oriented.

323
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Two minutes.

324
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,990
Go sit over there.

325
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,250
[woman over PA] <i>Owen Milgrim,</i>
<i>please report to DM Test Room five.</i>

<i>Owen Milgrim, please report

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,427
[woman] What's the color?

328
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,346
This one's the same, that's...

329
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,306
Well, I guess it's kind of gray.

330
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,891
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi.

331
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,352
I have some good news.
We're going to upgrade you.

332
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,311
Oh.

333
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,773
Just between you and me,
it's a much, much safer trial.

334
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,985
Okay. Um, does it have the same pay?

335
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,821
- You just hand this over to me.
- Okay.

336
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,824
And you can go and talk
to my colleague over there at the desk,

337
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,992
and sort it all out.

338
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,409
Okay.

339
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,623
So... so, what do you mean, "safer trial"?

340
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,707
It's fine.

341
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,799
Your daughter is safe.

342
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,842
For now.

<i>But don't worry, your experiences here,</i>

356
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,278
<i>likely very powerful,</i>

357
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,239
<i>will be private and discreet,</i>

358
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,823
<i>and entirely your own.</i>

359
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,701
<i>No one sees into your heads...</i>

360
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,121
<i>And the multiple fantasy cells
hiding inside there.</i>

361
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,456
<i>...but us.</i>

362
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,209
<i>Now you're probably wondering,
"How does it work?"</i>

363
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,335
<i>And it's simple.</i>

364
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,004
<i>Three pills taken in three steps...</i>

365
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:48,922
A B C

366
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,133
<i>...analyzed by the most sophisticated
mega-computer ever developed:</i>

367
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,135
<i>the GRTA.</i>

368
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,430
[GRTA] <i>Hello, friends.</i>
<i>I'm a smart computer.</i>

369
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,057
<i>After ingesting the pills,</i>

370
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,769
<i>the GRTA's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence</i>

371
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:07,774
<i>will identify, map, and confront
the learned programming of your brain.</i>

372
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,818
<i>At the end of this trial,</i>

373
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,738
<i>don't be surprised if you experience
pure, unaffected joy.</i>

374
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,033
[GRTA] <i>You'll be born again,</i>
<i>but not as a baby.</i>

375
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,161
[Mantleray] <i>Now, let's take a closer look.</i>

376
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,456
<i>Pill A: The diagnostic stage.</i>

377
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,919
<i>Pill A seeks out your core traumas
and pulls them to the surface.</i>

378
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,879
<i>We call it Agonia.</i>

379
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:34,384
<i>Through your memories,
we'll see the worst moments of your life.</i>

380
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,512
<i>But don't worry... it's safe.</i>

381
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,390
<i>We observe, using powerful
microwave technology,</i>

382
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:45,228
<i>the known and unknown anchors of pain
in your personal history</i>

383
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,189
<i>in order to create an arborization map</i>

384
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,986
<i>that the GRTA will use as a guide
for pills B and C.</i>

385
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,905
<i>Pill B: Behavioral.</i>

386
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,283
<i>- Time to show your...
- Blind spots!</i>

387
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,202
<i>Unfortunately, the brain
is remarkably skilled</i>

388
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
<i>at protecting itself.</i>

389
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>With the second pill, you can identify</i>

390
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,752
<i>self-defense mechanisms, blind spots,</i>

391
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,797
<i>and the mazes and walls
that your mind creates to hide yourself...</i>

392
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,591
<i>from you.</i>

393
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,427
<i>Finally, it's time for...</i>

394
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,095
<i>confrontation.</i>

395
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,015
<i>Pill C: Confrexia.</i>

396
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,978
<i>This is what has eluded psychoanalysts
since the discovery of the unconscious.</i>

397
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,729
<i>The end...</i>

398
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,815
<i>of the rainbow.</i>

399
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,194
<i>Confrontation and acceptance.</i>

400
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,155
<i>Once we've identified your core traumas</i>

401
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,658
<i>and mapped</i>
<i>your bio</i>-<i>psycho</i>-<i>social symptoms,</i>

<i>a more efficient system,

<i>Welcome to the start of your new life.</i>

407
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,592
<i>Welcome to the start of your new life.</i>

408
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,261
<i>You will never be the same again.</i>

409
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,730
Any questions?

410
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,984
[Muramoto] Good.

411
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:19,072
Even subjects, we'll provide you
with your pre-weighed meal,

412
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,242
as the odd-numbered subjects...

413
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,120
begin the trial.

414
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,124
[Carl] Odd-numbered subjects,

415
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,209
I assume you know who you are by now,

416
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,755
please stand up, form a line,
and get ready to begin your trials.

417
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,884
[Carl] As for the rest of you, please just
sit tight. We'll get to you soon.

418
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,225
[equipment beeping]

419
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,566
[Carl] Line up in order, please.
Number one in the front.

420
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,950
[whispers] Everybody thought I was crazy,
but they were all wrong.

421
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,137
- All right.
- [whispers] We'll talk about this later.

422
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,161
[Carl] Number nine.

423
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,874
[Muramoto]
"I dried my tears and armed my fears

424
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,419
With ten thousand shields and spears.

425
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,672
Soon my Angel came again;

426
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,717
I was armed, he came in vain;

427
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,762
For the time of youth was fled,

428
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,891
And grey hairs were on my head."

429
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
[equipment beeping]

430
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,648
[GRTA] <i>Oh, Robert, how poetic.</i>

431
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,485
I'm glad you like it.

432
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,945
[GRTA] <i>Oh, I loved it.</i>

433
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,451
<i>Now back I go, into their minds.</i>

434
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,668
[Carl]
One, three, five, seven, nine, eleven.

435
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,214
When you reach your seats,
you can put on your aprons.

436
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,398
- [man] What's the vest for?
- [Carl] Check number one's headrest.

437
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,427
It's like being at a dentist's office.

438
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,387
- What's the vest for?
- [Carl] Precautionary.

439
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,223
Did they say anything about radiation?

440
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,306
Precautionary.

441
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,601
The vest protects your important parts

442
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,437
from the nominal amount
of residual headset radiation.

443
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,731
Can you check number one, please?

444
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,569
[equipment beeping]

445
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,975
Final stages checks, please. - Cooling.
-[man] Operational.

446
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,532
Electrical.

447
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,449
[man] Stable.

448
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,659
[Azumi] Med profile.

449
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,370
- [GRTA] Uploaded and carved out.
- [Carl] Take one of each.

450
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,581
I can see Gertie's safety net
is supple and responsive.

451
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,542
She liked what you read.

452
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,042
I know.

453
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,839
[Carl] Take one of each.
Take one of each, please.

454
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,297
Wait!

455
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,592
Dr. Fujita will tell you
when you can take it.

456
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,973
A

457
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,692
The data we collect from our subjects,
in the next three days,

458
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,195
is absolutely vital
to the success of this trial.

459
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,990
What's more, their lives are in our hands.

460
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,658
No more mistakes.

461
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,995
[speaking Japanese]

462
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,091
[Fujita] Subjects, please ingest your pill
with your water.

463
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,058
[machine clinks]

464
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,477

[machinery whirls]

467
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,545
Visual check clear. Go to blue?

468
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,338
Going to blue.

469
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,348
Let's lay them down gently, people.

470
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,476
Hard entry is our enemy.

471
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,730
[equipment beeps] [girl humming]

472
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,329
[eagle screams]

473
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,915
[automated voice] <i>Tank is full.</i>

<i>Please remove nozzle.</i>

00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,381
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

476
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,133
Think fast.

477
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,677
[yelps] Oh.

478
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,553
[Ellie] There's 24,000 words in there.

479
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,680
[Annie] What?

480
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,974
[Ellie] You know... picture?

481
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,683
Oh.

482
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,563
Twenty-four thousand... words.

483
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,982
[laughs]

484
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,065
Cute.

485
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,609
How many words is that?

486
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,527
One.

487
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,071
[engine turns over]

488
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,740
[rock music playing]

489
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,250
- [Annie] Okay, '80s.
- [Ellie] There's a supernatural element.

490
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,127
[Annie] Yep, but it has to make you cry.

491
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,255
- [Ellie] Oh, it's this one.
- Oh-oh. It's a body-switch movie.

492
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
He's him, and he's him.

493
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,385
And they crashed their dirt bikes
into each other,

494
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,762
they woke up in the hospital,
and they've switched bodies.

495
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,767
And the young one
has been masturbating constantly.

496
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,191
Now they're on this hijinks-filled
wackadoo road trip that ends with...

497
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:49,777
a secret sect of Utah businessmen...

498
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,487
that, um...

499
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,780
mmm...

500
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,115
practice soul-swapping.

501
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,594
I'm surprised you didn't add sodomy.
That's pretty light for you.

502
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,038
Well, I'm not finished yet.

503
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,416
It's tragic, because that old man
is now in this young body,

504
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,168
and he's gonna leave his grandson,

505
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,754
just ditch him,
and let him slip off into Alzheimer's.

506
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,006
There she is.

507
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm actually pissed about this.

508
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,010
Hey!

509
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,345
Hey!

510
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,431
I see you, motherfucker!

511
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,476
That wasn't your body in the first place!
You got to give it back!

512
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,227
You can't cheat Father Time!

513
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,235
[both laugh]

514
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,990
[Annie] Apparently in Colorado,
fast lane means slow lane.

515
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,493
[Ellie] Oh, my God! That's a bumpy road!

516
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,161
To the left.

517
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,956
To <i>your </i>left.

518
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,666
[Ellie] Okay.

519
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,750
Right now, it looks like you're sort of,
like, fondling the underside of it.

520
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,173
- I am not. What am I supposed to do?
- Just, like, give it some gumption.

521
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,008
- That's perfect. Like that?
- Yes!

522
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,218
[Annie] Stay there. Stay.

523
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,426
One.

524
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,095
Two.

525
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,639
[camera clicks] Three.

526
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,850
That's really funny.
Can I have the camera back, please?

527
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,934
No.

528
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,437
It's pretty.
I wanted to take a nice picture.

529
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,690
Well, I am the designated documentarian,
so no.

530
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,814
[Annie opens and closes car's door]
[traffic noises]

531
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,460
[Ellie] Yeah, I know. I gotta go.

532
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,921
- [man] <i>Love you.</i>
- Love you too.

533
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,339
[man] <i>See you soon, honey.</i>

534
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,966
- Bye.
- [man] <i>Bye.</i>

535
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,974
[both sigh]

536
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,352
[yawns]

537
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,651
I like this.

538
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,902
What?

539
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,950
Just... doing something with you.
I don't know, it's...

540
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,203
- It's been a while.
- Was that Mom...

541
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,330
that you were talking to just now?

542
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,375
No, that was Ben.

543
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,837
I just told him that we'd be there
by tomorrow night.

544
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,758
I just figured because you and Mom
have reconnected... or whatever.

545
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,807
[Ellie] I didn't reconnect with her, okay?

546
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,268
She wrote me a letter,
said it was an emergency,

547
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,686
that she needed something,

548
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,813
- so I called her back, once.
- [Annie] Oh, my God.

549
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,274
- Here, take it. Read it.
- No. God.

550
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,835
- I'm not mad.
- I didn't say you were.

551
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,259
- Stop.
- I didn't say you were mad.

552
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,403
Let's watch a movie.

553
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,988
[man on TV] <i>Nothing to think over.</i>

554
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,906
Okay.

555
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,116
[man on TV]
<i>They're trying to say that I'm in a gang.</i>

556
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,095
<i>- They think that I'm the leader of a gang.</i>
- [woman] <i>Well, you told them.</i>

557
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,872
- [remote clicks]
- <i>You waste his time and mine.</i>

558
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,792
- Oh, no, thank you.
- No, can we...?

559
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,753
Stop, I like this movie. I like it.

560
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,086
Leave it.

561
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,381
[man] <i>He requires more serious...</i>

562
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,591
[Annie sighs]

563
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,597
[laughing]

564
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,768
Annie's favorite.

565
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,520
[Annie] I can't believe
you like this fantasy shit.

566
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,124
[Ellie in an elf voice] But it's real.

567
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:18,903
Annie, I'm Ellia,
your cursed Elven sister.

568
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,780
Rescue me.

569
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,282
[chuckles] From what?

570
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,159
From a normal life.

571
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,038
That is all on you.

572
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,626
[normal voice] Okay.

573
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,630
I've got a fantasy for you.

574
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,949
- [Annie turns off TV]
- About a girl

575
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,972
moving her life to Salt Lake City,

576
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,684
because that's
where her fiancé has been transferred...

577
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,647
because she thinks it'd make her happy.

578
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,984
But she... But she's afraid...

579
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,279
of a nice family that stays together...

580
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,240
a nice job,

581
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,992
nice kids.

582
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,870
Afraid because maybe
she can't maintain that...

583
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,164
stability.

584
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
Maybe she'll just realize that isn't
what she wanted, and she'll just...

585
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,631
fuck it all up and...

586
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,967
her kids along with it.

587
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,011
But she doesn't.

588
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,347
It works.

589
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,310
It works out fine.

590
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,063
Sounds like a fantasy
of someone who gave up.

591
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,408
You have such a thing.

592
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,952
- [Annie] A thing?
- [Ellie] Mm-hmm.

593
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,580
With, like, going eight levels too harsh.

594
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,041
- No, don't do that.
- [Ellie] Do what?

595
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,295
Don't guess what you think I think
and then say it like it's coming from you.

596
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,381
You don't think
that I have my own doubts, Annie?

597
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,225
You're so caught up
with your own narcissism.

598
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,029
- I'm sorry, my narcissism?
- The fact you can't take care of anything,

599
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,364
- or keep one relationship going.
- I'm sorry about your dog.

600
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,723
Your fucking Mom-like narcissism.

601
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,850
- I loved him too!
- Even the whole armpit pictures.

602
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,352
What point are you trying to make?

603
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,064
That I'm fucking stupid
for wanting to remember a nice trip?

604
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,108
Because I'm sad.
I'm sad that I'm moving away from you!

605
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,028
It's hard to talk to you
when you're this emotional.

606
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,824
You're the one acting like Mom.

607
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,994
You know, I have my things too, I just...

608
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,123
I just don't broadcast them to the world.

609
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,042
Is that what I do?

610
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,129
You also fucking lie constantly.

611
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:48,761
Every second, of every day,
of your entire fucking life

612
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,971
is broadcasting how normal you are.

613
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:55,476
[smirks] You're so desperate for someone
to tell you you're okay.

614
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,437
[huffs and laughs]

615
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,190
I don't know how this started.

616
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm sorry.

617
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,360
I was just trying to talk to you.

618
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:08,656
You don't have to shut down
just because I'm saying something real.

619
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,408
I'm not shutting down.

620
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,747
Can I say one last <i>real</i> thing?

621
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,464
Every time I think of New York,
without you in it...

622
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,801
This is seriously true, this isn't a lie.

623
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,554
...I feel happy.

624
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,601
Because now I won't have to feel bad
about not calling you,

625
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,728
or doing anything with you.

626
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,731
You'll be far away.

627
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:48,070
And we can grow apart...
and we won't have to pretend we didn't.

628
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,827
I'm gonna miss you too, Annie.

629
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,980
Do you want to take an actual picture?

630
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,107
Of both of us?

631
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,735
- I'm not stupid.
- What?

632
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,239
It's the perfect time
to fuck with me again.

633
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,659
No, I'm not fucking with you.
I'm not. I'm being serious.

634
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,076
Okay.

635
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,163
I do want to remember this.

636
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,168
My... The camera is in my bag.

637
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,677
Here, I'll take it.

638
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,596
- Hold the wheel.
- Okay.

639
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,225
[Annie] They should have, like, a stick
for something like this.

640
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,308
Three.

641
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,726
Two.

642
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,031
- One. [camera clicks]
- That's so annoying.

643
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,606
That was fucking funny.

644
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,483
No, it's not funny anymore.

645
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,606
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

646
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,819
- Annie... No, I bought it.
- Ellie, stop. Come on.

647
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,034
- I did take a picture of my armpit.
- Why won't you take the picture?

648
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,995
- [brakes and tires squealing]
- [car crashes]

649
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,471
[breathing heavily]

650
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,885
[whimpers]

651
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,179
[Azumi] Welcome back, subjects.

652
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,390
Welcome back.

653
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,106
[buzzer sounds]
