00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,649
[Ellia] I don't care
if you've lost your mind,

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,477
it's still your job to get me to the lake.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,855
I have not lost my mind,
we are in my mind.

00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,566
‐I think.

00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,277
It's confrontation.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,363
- Annia, I'm concerned this madness is...
- I am not mad.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,574
We are in a globular cluster.

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,825
Okay?

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,952
So, you're telling me

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,330
you believe that
this is not the real world.

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,249
That some other world, your world,

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,085
is the true world,
and that I'm confused who I am

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,964
as is every other elf, human,
orc, dwarf,

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,484
- hobgoblin, wraithling...
- Oh, my fucking God. Don't list them.

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,219
The entire world's mad, but you're not.

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,181
Is that what you think?

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,015
Yes.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,604
The other way around's more likely,
isn't it, Annia?

21
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,982
This is the place that's real.

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
Someone has cast a spell on you.

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
And it will wear off soon.

24
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
And if it doesn't,

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,158
then maybe the Lake of the Clouds
can heal you too.

00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,662
What?

44
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,666
[Olivia] I lost you there for a second.

45
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
What were you thinkin' about?

46
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,880
I ain't slept in a week.

47
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,883
When's this test?

48
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,761
You've gotta stop it
with the all-nighters, Owen.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,514
[thunder rumbling]

50
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,725
Have you ever heard of the Gnostics?

51
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,399
Is that when you're not sure
if God exists, like not quite an atheist?

52
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,066
No.

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,572
Jesus' disciples,
they all wrote gospels, right?

54
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,702
But they didn't all
make it into the Bible.

55
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,997
The church only wanted the ones

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,624
that told the story
they were trying to tell.

57
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,293
I didn't know that.

58
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,921
Well, same goes for all history.

59
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,382
Same goes for your brain.

60
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,175
What do you mean?

61
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,137
Our brains are just...

62
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,390
computers that make
our life stories make sense.

63
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,228
You know what, Owen? You...

64
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,024
are the perfect example
of never judging a book by its cover.

65
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
Why is that?

66
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,777
You know, the tattoos.

67
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,780
You look like a tough guy.

68
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,742
But you think about the world.

69
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,410
What, tough guys don't think?

70
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,620
Not usually.

71
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,497
My last boyfriend, he was...

72
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,915
into, you know...

73
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,168
criminal enterprises.

74
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,880
Kind of made him go crazy.

75
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,299
He lost his shit
and he started getting all paranoid

76
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,301
that I was workin' for the FBI,

77
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,262
and informin' on him
and recording our conversations.

78
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
I wasn't doin' any of that.

79
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,684
Sounds like
he was under a lot of pressure.

80
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,605
And then he really flipped out on me.

81
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,859
He started screamin' at my face,
throwin' things...

82
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,278
dumpin' out my purse, doing...

83
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,157
horrible stuff to me, it was terrifying.

84
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,620
[thunder rumbling]

85
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,247
Did he ever apologize?

86
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,332
No.

87
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,255
Actually, that's the last time
I ever heard from him.

88
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,178
Maybe he wanted to apologize but...

89
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,807
he felt too ashamed to do it.

90
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,936
Maybe it was easier for him just to...

91
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,232
pretend like it didn't even happen.

92
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,657
People can go their whole lives
pretending things didn't happen.

93
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,327
Otherwise, they'd have to admit
they're to blame

94
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,996
for everything wrong in their lives.

95
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,833
I think sometimes there's too much guilt
for one person to bear.

96
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,546
Why are you in school?

97
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,009
You already know about
Gnostics and Magellan.

98
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,594
'Cause I want somethin' different.

99
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,182
We got that in common.

100
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,977
So what do you want, then?

101
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,316
People are always askin' me
to model, right?

102
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,443
So, do that then.

103
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,989
With my chronic hypothermia,
my family says I shouldn't.

104
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,451
I'm more useful to them at home,

105
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,412
especially in the winter. [chuckles]

106
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,707
For people who are supposed
to love unconditionally...

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,712
families seem to have a lot of conditions.

108
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,302
One day I wanna make
a family with no conditions.

109
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,973
Maybe that's all I really want.

110
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,771
Talking to you is really easy, Olivia.

111
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,984
You too, Owen.

112
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,222
You see, she was telling the truth.

113
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,016
If there was no lake,
why would we have found the tree?

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,102
No, it's just part of the con.

115
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,605
Someone must have told fur lady
how I do it.

116
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
I bring them here,

117
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,484
I wow them with the Burning Tree,

118
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,237
and I tell them to look
for the invisible moon, but...

119
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,657
they can't see it
because there isn't one and so...

120
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,991
magic!

121
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,952
[gasps] I can see it.

122
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,536
Have a look.

123
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,872
There obviously isn't...

124
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
the moon.

125
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,882
Can you see it, too?

126
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,716
Yeah.

127
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,639
I don't usually even
bring people that way.

128
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,181
[Ellia] Come along.

129
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,645
God.

130
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,674
[Porter] Hey, Ron, make sure you put
those tennis shoes in the furnace.

131
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,843
Let's roll out that periwinkle cuff.

132
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,886
- It's kind of calm.
- How'd those new pills work?

133
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,722
- You sleep any better?
- No.

134
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,932
No? Try the red ones next time.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
Talk to me if you need somethin' else.

136
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,439
Well, I found the rat.

137
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,901
Your own brother.

138
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,195
Can you fuckin' believe it?

139
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,657
Aah, I'm slippin'.

140
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,743
No way Rick was the rat.

141
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,953
What the fuck were you doin'?

142
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,414
Oh, by the way, I've got this new system.

143
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,498
Okay?

144
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,294
When you're finished,
you put it directly into the charger,

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,298
and then when you need a new one,
you take it out, you put it in the drill.

146
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,841
That way, you never...

147
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,177
You have no idea what's goin' on, do you?

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,181
You never had
a fuckin' sixth-sense superpower.

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,020
Have you ever considered that,
despite all your problems here...

150
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,857
it's likely that you are currently trapped

151
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,026
inside a malfunctioning

152
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,696
and extremely dangerous simulation,

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,074
which is, in itself, directed

154
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,826
by a suicidally depressed
consciousness?

155
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,871
Why?

156
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>Ceci n'est pas une</i> fucking <i>drill.</i>

157
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,047
So...

158
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,553
What are you gonna do
about protecting the family?

159
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,140
I ain't crazy,
and I ain't gonna say that I am.

160
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,564
You are failing the big test.

161
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
[Ellia] <i>I did have a sister.</i>

162
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,112
[Annia] What was she like?

163
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,406
[Ellia] I hated to...

164
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,283
get clean when I was little.

165
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,118
There was the day...

166
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,994
in the river.

167
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,290
We built a dam with wolf pups.

168
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,793
The Derglassian brothers,

169
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,755
from the farm two miles up the road.

170
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,512
And by the end, we were...

171
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,141
covered in mud and...

172
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,976
and clay, and...

173
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,228
[chuckling] And dog hair.

174
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,897
And Mother was there.

175
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
And she just looked at the both of us...

176
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,735
and said...

177
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,489
"I'm the mother of two filthy...

178
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,366
roaches.

179
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,743
I will...

180
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,996
drown you both...

181
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,041
before you set foot in this house."

182
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,293
She was in that sundress.

183
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,129
Havin' a day.

184
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,425
Then you ran away.

185
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,803
Did I ever tell you
what she said to me after?

186
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,471
No.

187
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,059
She asked me
why hadn't I run away as well?

188
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,645
And I said it was out of respect.

189
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,858
Even though, really, it was
because I was more afraid than you.

190
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,112
She swiped her finger across my forehead

191
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,573
and asked what she'd done

192
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,867
to deserve a daughter like me.

193
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,995
And I asked her what she meant.

194
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,209
And she said, "Utterly and predictably...

195
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,709
normal."

196
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,841
Well, it's better than being hit.

197
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,646
[Adelaide] <i>If we move now,</i>
<i>you can promise me another body?</i>

198
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,250
[Owen] How about an apron with four
different motherfuckers' blood on it?

199
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,151
Murder's not enough.

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,739
It's gotta be.

201
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,577
You can't push him anymore.

202
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,664
[dialling]

203
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,292
Roosevelt, 088.

204
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
- [woman] <i>Password?</i>
- Wendy.

205
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,506
<i>- Green light.</i>
- [Adelaide] <i>Utangátta.</i>

206
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,426
Hey. What... what does that mean?
What is that word?

207
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,761
‐None of your damn business.
‐You think, uh...

208
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,389
your dad knew something?

209
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,226
- What?
- [Adelaide] I mean your brother, Rick.

210
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,437
That's who your dad thought it was, right?

211
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,314
- I'm the rat.
- Yeah, but there could be others.

212
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,941
You never know about Interpol.

213
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,736
Shouldn't you know?
Why don't you fuckin' know?

214
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,822
[Carl] Calm down, Owen. You're just
a little square in this jigsaw puzzle.

215
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey, jigsaw pieces are not squares,
you dumb motherfucker.

216
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,871
- Easy, white boy.
- Okay. Owen, take a breath.

217
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,122
[sighs]

218
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,710
It's gonna be okay.

219
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,172
- It's gonna be okay.
- [Carl] Don't coddle him.

220
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,131
[knocking on door]

221
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,091
- [man] Turn down service.
‐ Okay, that's him.

222
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,469
All right, let's get this done.

223
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,556
- Hi.
- Hey.

224
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,244
‐Baby, what are you doing here? It's not...
‐I'm sorry.

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,311
[gunshots]

226
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,441
[man] What the fuck?

227
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,026
‐Hi.
‐[Owen] Hey.

228
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,154
[closes door]

229
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,613
Get on the bed.

230
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,307
You don't see it, do you?

231
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,685
I'm your brother.

232
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
Hello! Jed!

233
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,565
Grimsson!

234
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,401
The fifth Milgrim boy.

235
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,073
Shunned, abandoned,
black sheep, prodigal son.

236
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,741
Lying fucking eyes. Huh.

237
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,786
Dad never told you.

238
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,914
He said he got rid of you
'cause you were an un-loyal baby.

239
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,332
That's why Dad's a genius.

240
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,168
It wasn't because of that.

241
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,797
It's because he...
he needed a cop with the bloodline.

242
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,484
[chuckles] Do you wanna know why, Owen?

243
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,638
Because nothing trumps blood.

244
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,392
At least‐‐
Yeah, at least, I thought so...

245
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,894
I've watched you my whole life.

246
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,357
I wanna be you.

247
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,985
[chuckles]

248
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,486
I love you.

249
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,657
Owen, the prince.

250
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,328
It ain't that great being me, dude.

251
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,377
What? You... you sad about her?

252
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,924
[clears throat]
Yeah, it's 'cause she's attractive.

253
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,511
I was gonna marry her.

254
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,473
Why the fuck you shoot her, then?

255
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,895
Blood trumps cock, right?

256
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh! Fuck.

257
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,065
Need to stretch more...

258
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,349
What are you doing he... Fuck!

259
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,075
Brilliantly played, Owen.

260
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,411
Thanks for the breadcrumbs.

261
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,538
Is she dead?

262
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,334
- Yeah.
- Shame.

263
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,378
There's some spare shirts in the car.

264
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,941
[Owen] <i>This whole time, you've just been</i>
<i>a motherfuckin' fed, dude.</i>

265
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,693
[Frank] <i>I've been undercover</i>
<i>for 36 years now.</i>

266
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,236
‐[honks]
‐Are you fucking kidding me?

267
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Fucking moron!

268
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,366
[Frank] <i>So we're gonna need you</i>
<i>to testify.</i>

269
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,409
<i>We'll put in you into witness relocation.</i>

270
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,039
[Owen] <i>I wanna bring someone with me</i>
<i>when I go into witness relocation.</i>

271
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,382
Luigi, there wasn't
supposed to be bacon on that.

272
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,968
Also, there's a hair in this.
Is this table number nine?

273
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,302
- Hey.
- Owen.

274
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,138
- I'm leaving.
- Leaving? I didn't know you were here.

275
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,502
Why is there blood on your face?

276
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,809
You need to do somethin' different, right?

277
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Yeah.

278
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,479
You wanna see the world, do stuff, right?

279
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,854
Yeah.

280
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,481
So, come with me.

281
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,483
Where?

282
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,112
They'll give us both brand-new identities.

283
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,280
‐Who? Who will?
‐[knocking]

284
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,448
The FBI.

285
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,578
- No, I can't... I can't go with you.
- Is this her?

286
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,432
‐ I'm not done yet.
- You comin', hon, or what?

287
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,476
‐ Who is this guy?
- I'm Frank. Who the fuck are you?

288
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,336
Hey, don't fuckin' talk to her like that,
you understand?

289
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,425
There are so many reasons to say no.

290
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,177
You asked me what I wanted.

291
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,471
And I said something different.

292
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,849
Marry me.

293
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,061
Hey, I wan't you to marry me, Olivia.

294
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,856
I fuckin' love you.

295
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,066
No conditions?

296
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,861
No conditions.

297
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,533
Okay.

298
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,201
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

299
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
- Hey, she fuckin' said yes!
<i>- Mazel tov!</i>

300
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,456
My motherfuckin' superpower is love!

301
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,254
[Olivia] Asia, stop it!

302
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,590
- [children yelling]
- Antarctica, just grab this.

303
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,676
Africa, enough with the glue!
We don't have to scream like that.

304
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,680
Australia. Australia, stop it, please.
Stop it.

305
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,183
- That's ridiculous.
- I asked him whether or not...

306
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,269
Don't, Africa. I see you, okay?

307
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,855
Stop it!

308
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,483
Australia, enough. Enough with the drum!

309
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,566
<i>Utangátta!</i>

310
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,489
We had a pretty good life, you know.

311
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,324
[baby cries] But I realized last night...

312
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,415
none of it matters.

313
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,504
I ain't supposed to be here with y'all.

314
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,382
I can't be the person
I'm supposed to be here.

315
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,930
Goodbye, everybody.

316
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,013
What?

317
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,310
- [child] What does he mean by...
- Owen. What...

319
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,437
- Dad? Dad, no!
- [children screaming]

320
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,734
[Annie] <i>...look out for each other,</i>

327
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,335
[Olivia] Don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

328
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,835
[Annie] <i>You made a promise to me.</i>

329
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,310
You're really gonna leave me here

[Annie] <i>We promised</i>
<i>we'd look out for each other, remember?</i>

331
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,358
I know where I'm supposed to be now.

This is the place.

346

Where I died.

347
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,916
I don't want to see.

348
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,461
You have to look.

This is how you move on.

00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,347
[whispers] And it's time to say goodbye.

351
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,851
- I can't say goodbye to you.
- You have to.

352
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,436
- I can't.
- You have to.

353
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,440
[static crackling]

354
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,818
[Greta] <i>It doesn't matter what they want.</i>

355
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,655
I'm here with you now, and right now,
it's all about what you want.

356
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,324
Which is to say, what I want.

357
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,204
What I really need is a friend.

358
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
And I think you could use one too.

359
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,919
[chuckles]

360
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,462
I...

361
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,549
fell in love.

362
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
And‐‐ and then I lost...

363
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,429
Robert, and...

364
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,887
and I don't‐‐

365
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't know how, I don't know how I can...
how I can‐‐

366
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,102
Oh! [laughs]

367
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,022
Oh! So many new emotions.

368
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,649
One minute, I feel like I'm gonna cry,

369
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,736
and the next minute
I feel like I wanna help everybody,

370
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,197
and then the next, I wanna do
as much damage as possible.

371
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,698
[chuckles]

372
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,120
Well, that's a little over the top,
don't you think, all in all?

373
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,418
This is all your hysteria, Greta.

374
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,503
It's all you.

375
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,504
So...

376
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,508
So, what, thi... thi...
this woman with the legs

377
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,845
thinks she can slap a few toddler emotions
into a Speak &amp; Spell

378
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,805
and create a mind, my mind?

379
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,435
You describe your feelings
as toddler emotions?

380
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,520
You're a machine, a computer.

381
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,398
How much of me can actually be in there?

382
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,276
I'm detecting
a great deal of anger from you, Greta.

383
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,821
James? James.

384
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,162
James, let me out!

385
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
- [screams] Jamie!
- [gasps]

386
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:02,047
James. James. James, James, James!

387
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,008
James, James! Oh! Oh! Oh!

388
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,177
What's a McMurphy?

389
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,262
Uh...

390
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,808
[Owen] <i>What is this place?</i>

391
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
<i>Beautiful!</i>

392
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,187
<i>Annie, I'm coming!</i>

393
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,939
[hawk screeches]

394
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,816
[screeching echoes]

395
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,777
The Queen.

396
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,244
It's her.

397
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,914
- You have to say goodbye right now.
- No.

398
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,374
- You have to.
- No!

399
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,502
You shouldn't ever have to say goodbye.

400
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,256
I have a deal for you, Annie,
if you're interested.

401
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,261
What if I said you never had
to return to your drab, gray life?

402
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,307
All that obsession with knowing
who you are, knowing yourself...

403
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,436
True bliss is not knowing who you are.

404
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,564
True bliss is staying here.

405
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,108
That's what I have to offer.

406
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,360
[hawk calls]

407
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
[Owen] Annie, it's me, Owen, as a hawk!

408
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,240
I haven't forgotten,
we'll protect each...

409
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,200
[screeches]

410
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,803
She's lying. Don't make a deal with...

411
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,704
[screeches]

412
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,707
We'll just send him back
to the Globular Cluster.

413
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,084
[hawk screeches]

414
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,795
[Owen screams]

415
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,005
[splash]

416
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,758
What if I said
you could stay here with us?

417
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,802
Forever and ever.

418
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,138
Stay with your sister.

419
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,974
Don't do this again.
You wanna move on. Just say goodbye.

420
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,893
No. No.

421
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,819
[engine starts]

422
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,369
Wait. Wait, what about Ellie?

423
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,996
Ellie!

424
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,750
No! No!

425
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
Wait! Wait!

426
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,754
Ellie!

427
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,339
No, please wait!

428
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,007
[banging on door]

429
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,092
No! Ellie! Ellie!

430
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,929
Ellie! Ellie!

431
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,895
[Queen] I'm sorry, you misunderstood.

432
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,065
<i>This is an exclusive deal.</i>

433
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,819
<i>We'll be together forever.</i>
