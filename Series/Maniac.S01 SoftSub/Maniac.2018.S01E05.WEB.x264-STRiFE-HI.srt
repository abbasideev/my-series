[Azumi] Yeah, there...

55

No, my mother was too conservative
when it came to these anomalies.

- Is that Ollie Hightower?

and he couldn't figure it out.

I would give up magic forever.

- But what was the trick, Ollie?

- Come on, show it to us.
- Yes.

109

on the very top of this deck.

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,438
It's so hard to keep those
we've lost in our lives.

178
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
Don't you agree?

179
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,050
You must excuse me. All right. Okay.

180
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
[door creaks]

181
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,438
Gotcha!

182
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,768
- Any lost chapters?
- [gasps] You and your zapping around.

183
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,455
Why do you keep trying to ditch me, Ollie?

184
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,248
Because you are on my continent.

185
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,376
No more jokes, Arlie.
Go back to Paris. I'm working.

186
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,005
- You still drink gimlets?
- You still poison 'em?

187
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,799
I only poisoned the one.

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,301
What should we cheers to?

189
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,804
How about the night
my wife stole everything I have,

190
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,347
slipped me a Mickey, disappeared,

191
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,658
and I woke up with the cops
and three years in the clink.

192
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,101
I heard you pled guilty
to that Sister Wendy job.

193
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,229
Yeah, I have to quit doing that.

194
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,564
So what happened
to this dame that betrayed you?

195
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,150
Rumor has it
she ran off with another woman.

196
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,903
Sounds like she might have had
some sort of condition.

197
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,237
[Ollie] She did.

198
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,908
She always disappeared
just when you needed her the most.

199
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,535
To mistakes, then.

200
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
You hear what I heard?

201
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,254
- About what the lost chapter can do?
- No, and I don't care.

202
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,091
1615, Cervantes writes the final chapter
to his masterpiece.

203
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,467
So powerful...

204
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,346
that anyone who reads it
is lost in their own fantasies...

205
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,596
forever.

206
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,308
He shows it to a friend,
who slips into a coma.

207
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,686
Same with a neighbor, never comes out.

208
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,939
They live in their own dream worlds
until they die.

209
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,110
- Sounds swell.
- [Arlie] Cervantes thought the opposite.

210
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,154
He said being lost like that
was a fate worse than death.

211
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,575
For someone who didn't come here
for the lost chapter,

212
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,952
you seem to have thought a lot
about the lost chapter.

213
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,079
Don't be dense, Ollie.

214
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,748
I'm not here for some score.

215
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,375
But wouldn't you know?

216
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,795
The lost chapter is hidden
somewhere in this mansion.

217
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,924
I'm here to help you.

218
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,511
Goodbye, Arlie.

219
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,581
You don't know where it is, do you?

220
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
'Cause I do. It's through a mirror.

221
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,523
Who gave you that information?

222
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,443
Some wise old crone
in an alleyway in Barcelona.

223
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,695
What does it matter to you?

224
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,448
Because you lie constantly, that's why.

225
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,993
So what was your plan, then, Ollie?

226
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,622
To snoop from room to room
until you happened upon it next September?

227
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,082
Hah. Even if you knew where it was,

228
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,084
she'd have it in a safe,

229
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,212
and you can't crack a safe without me.

230
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
Well, I'm here to help you.

231
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,009
So for old times' sake, Mr. Magic Fingers,

232
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,303
how about I do intel
and you crack the safe?

233
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,100
We can't help but do
what we've always done.

234
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,479
Do I have a choice in the matter?

235
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,772
No.

236
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,319
- [gong sounds]
- 9:05, time for the main event.

237
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,490
Do not make me regret trusting you.

238
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,116
I'll never betray you again.

239
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,410
Then wait for my signal.

240
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,998
[butler] Oh, joyous Celestial Goddess,

241
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:02,962
now is the time
for your energy to flow through us

242
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,841
and pour life back
into our lady's beloved.

243
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,510
[Gertie] Tonight we speak to Juno,

244
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,720
tonight we speak to Diana

245
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,182
and tonight her life brings life to us.

246
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,309
Lunar goddess?

247
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,896
Who will be tonight's astral nodes?

248
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,607
Oh.

249
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,404
Them, I think.

250
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,279
Those two.

251
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,781
Us?

252
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,210
- What the hell are we supposed to do?
- The moon will tell you.

253
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,671
[butler] We have reached...

254
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,008
maximum illumination.

255
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,176
[people gasp]

256
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,924
["Exactly Like You" plays]
They're playing our song.

257
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,295
Stop trying to stick yourselves together!

258
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,590
[people gasp]

259
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,676
Oh, she's gone to the astral plane.

260
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,470
Oh, it's working! It's working!

261
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,057
Who wants to join her?
Another dancer. You. Now.

262
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,774
Wait, wait.

263
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,200
[man yells indistinctly]

264
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>...with a title that you trade away!</i>

265
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,584
<i>Because I'm their father,
and you're their mother! God damn it!</i>

266
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,796
<i>I have no idea where you are!</i>

267
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,798
- Is Mom coming back?
- ...that again.

268
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>Is that about the size of it?</i>

269
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,636
- Um... tell me the whole story again.
<i>- You don't get to give that up, Rosie.</i>

270
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,429
<i>- No!</i>
- Once upon a time...

271
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,516
- there were two girls.
<i>- It's not a fucking title...</i>

272
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,684
They rode through the forest on a wolf.

273
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,269
A wolf, yeah.

274
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,730
They were going
to their grandmother's house.

275
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,315
But they didn't read the sign.

276
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,860
So, they got lost
and couldn't really find their way home,

277
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,572
- until they read one of the signs.
<i>- ...our daughter, who has your hair...</i>

278
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,407
It said, "Don't go this way."

279
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,493
["Exactly Like You" playing]

280
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,338
- Good evening, fellas.
- Evening.

281
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,143
[applause]

282
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,020
- [applause]
- [sighs]

283
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,818
[grunting]

284
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,332
You didn't wait for my signal.

285
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,709
[gasps] Good gravy!

286
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,086
[breathing heavily] Help me down.

287
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,052
Come on.

288
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,723
[man] Look down here.

289
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,817
The mirror's right there.

290
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,486
[man] Try this.

291
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,947
Locked.

292
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,202
Nothing here.

293
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,286
[woman moans]

294
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,209
[man and woman]
You're not supposed to be here.

295
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,003
There's another way, come on.

296
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,821
[man whispers] Owen.

297
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,905
Owen.

298
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,450
I mean, Sir... Sir Ollie.

299
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,204
So, I talked to a ritual cognitive.

300
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,415
Turns out Jed and I
were twins in the womb.

301
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,252
Except he strangled me
with the umbilical cord.

302
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,586
[retching]

303
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,548
[spitting]

304
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,054
Don't worry about that.
That was... ectoplasm.

305
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,223
Go back to your quest.

306
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,351
Ah, Gertie's nuts. I'm gonna
stick around here a little bit.

307
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,562
Matches.

308
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,125
What is this?

309
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,837
The old crone said the spirit would
take me exactly where I wanted to be.

310
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,301
[wind blows]

311
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,726
I don't know where to go from here.

312
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,440
Do you know what they thought
owls meant in the old days?

313
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,859
Come here.

314
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
Finally.

315
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,545
Something that makes sense.

316
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,048
How long is this gonna take?

317
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,342
This place gives me the willies.

318
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,886
Hey, Arlie.

319
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,306
Seeing we're both
inside a mirror and all...

320
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,683
Do you ever think your condition...

321
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,062
is a lot simpler than you think?

322
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,899
Maybe you're the one
with the broken heart, not me,

323
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,027
pretending I'm the one who's devastated.

324
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,238
It's the way
that you make yourself feel stronger.

325
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,282
Make me feel smaller.

326
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,327
Sure.

327
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,708
And maybe you like being the martyr
a little too much.

328
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,922
And you thought that "sir" would fix you,
but it hasn't fixed anything at all.

329
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,301
I guess we'll never know.

330
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,552
[opens safe]

331
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,060
[Arlie] Why is it so tiny?

332
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,854
People were a lot smaller back then.

333
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,532
All right.

334
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,326
We should skeddadle.

335
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,578
Sorry, Ollie.

336
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,666
I'm gonna need you
to hand that tiny chapter to me.

337
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,128
I just really, really need it.

338
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,088
Sure.

339
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,182
You didn't have to use the gun.

340
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,394
I would have just given it to you.

341
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,647
That's always been your problem.

342
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,484
That's not my problem.

343
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,741
My problem is I let you get too close.

344
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,244
And you're poison.

345
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,609
[Annie gasps]

346
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,657
There she is.

347
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,957
Subject nine, your experience
with the B pill is complete.

348
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Where's Ollie?

349
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,837
[Mantleray] What you're about
to experience is the proximity test.

350
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,799
It's a cross-check of the data
that we've gleaned.

351
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,553
Helps the G.R.T.A. render
your reflections for the final pill.

352
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,970
I'm a friend.

353
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
And...

354
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,474
this is normal.

355
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,772
By the way, I was sorry to hear
about your sister being crushed,

356
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,941
and then burned to death...

357
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
in that car accident. [cameras whirr]

358
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
So...

359
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,825
Your score goes up or down
depending on the consistency

360
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,869
between your answers and, uh...

361
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,997
what we've observed.

362
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,583
The scale is from zero to ten.

363
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,793
Uh, anything below a 9.2

364
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,963
results in the termination
of your experience at the trial

365
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,423
due to, uh...

366
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,300
a lack of progress.

367
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,760
A lack of progress with what?

368
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,930
The dissolution
of your defense mechanisms.

369
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,601
Okay.

370
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,062
Consider this just me
verifying that your data is usable.

371
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,316
All you have to do is give
an honest account of your experience.

372
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,611
So, let's start by saying your name
for a baseline.

373
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,655
Annie Landsberg.

374
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,782
And, uh...

375
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,952
are you survived by any other relatives?

376
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,080
Just my dad, Hank Landsberg.

377
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,042
Your mother's deceased?

378
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,126
I don't know.

379
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,253
Huh.

380
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,507
Do you know where you are right now?

381
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,134
I'm in a pharma trial.

382
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:21,014
Considering you've been
abusing the A pill for some time,

383
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,060
I'd like you to tell me
about your experiences with the B pill.

384
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:31,399
I had what felt like a hundred dreams
all on top of each other.

385
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,901
I call them reflections.

386
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,945
Neurochemically, they're very similar,
but so is psychosis.

387
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,782
How many experiences
do you think you had?

388
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,869
I remember two well.

389
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,247
But there were more.

390
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,834
And more underneath those.

391
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,588
It's a globular cluster
of arborized realities.

392
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,175
Well, they were realities
that mattered more than mine.

393
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,094
Describe your reality.

394
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,055
Uh, my reality...

395
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,665
is that I am depressed. And I
have been for a very long time.

396
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,315
[counter clicks]

397
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,402
[Mantleray] Let's try and focus
on your reflections.

398
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,695
[camera whirrs]

399
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,658
In one, I was Linda from Long Island.

400
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,786
I could smell her perm.

401
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,706
She was a nurse and a...

402
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,251
mother, and a wife, which is...

403
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,003
the opposite of anything I've ever wanted.

404
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,551
And...

405
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,261
then...

406
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,642
I was Arlie.
She was a thief and a con artist.

407
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,686
A con artist is a liar.

408
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,689
Why are you a liar?

409
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,150
She...

410
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,489
I think people lie because they're afraid,

411
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,284
and she was afraid
and she didn't want anyone to see that.

412
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,369
Did anyone?

413
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,581
Owen. He did.

414
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,583
He saw me. He saw...

415
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,751
her.

416
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,170
Them.

417
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
Subject one?

418
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,298
Describe his presence.

419
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,969
We were connected in all of them.

420
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,306
With Linda...

421
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,268
it was the kind of connection

422
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,520
where you meet in seventh grade,
and then...

423
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,400
you look up and 20 years later,
he's still there...

424
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,612
holding your hand while you have a baby.

425
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,492
You remembered whole lives together?

426
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,534
Yes.

427
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,330
Did the pill do that?

428
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,248
It wasn't designed to.

429
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,296
Why do you think you experience
so many of these, uh, lives...

430
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,713
with him?

431
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,383
- He said there was a pattern.
- [cameras whirr]

432
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,762
And that we were connected
to each other somehow. I...

433
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,472
I mean, I thought he was crazy.

434
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,017
So, I told him there is no pattern.
There's just chaos.

435
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,228
Let me ask it...

436
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,230
in a different way.

437
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,150
Why do you think you found yourself
trying to deliver a lemur?

438
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,278
Mr. Milgrim's presence notwithstanding.

439
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,284
The woman in that dream was Paula Nazlund,

440
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,331
the mother of the person
that killed my sister.

441
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,501
My real sister, in this life.

442
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,215
And sometimes I fantasize about
if Greg Nazlund had never been born.

443
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,217
And when you were a thief...

444
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,178
how do you explain that reflection?

445
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,516
I had a goal.

446
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,060
[cameras whirr]

447
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,687
I needed to get something.

448
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,025
And it... didn't seem to matter
who I hurt.

449
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,404
- Is that a behavior you share in life?
- No.

450
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,699
Is that a behavior you've seen exhibited
in a parental figure?

451
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,033
Is this therapy now?

452
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,034
I thought this was supposed to be
better than that.

453
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,329
It's not therapy.

454
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,130
Did you enter this trial
in lieu of harming yourself?

455
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,213
No!

456
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,843
Why did the number not change?

457
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,636
That's true.

458
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,221
Were you suicidal?

459
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,310
Arlie is like my mother.

460
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,233
She could charm anyone,
she would make deals with people.

461
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,862
She would say things to me like,
"This is just between you and me, Annie.

462
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,282
You're the only one who understands."
That's how she would get you.

463
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,451
And then she knew that you gave a shit,

464
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,953
and so your guard was down
and she would gut you.

465
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,038
Okay? How's that?

466
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,249
It disturbs you, this idea of...

467
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,753
behaving in the same way
that your mother behaves.

468
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,381
[cameras whirring]

469
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,465
Yes.

470
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,888
Did you and your sister
make any of these special...

471
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,805
deals?

472
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,894
Similar to the ones
that you and your mother had made?

473
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,186
No.

474
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,190
Ours were different.

475
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,109
How?

476
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,696
Ours was a pact.

477

[counter clicks]

478
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,235
I took care of her when we were little.
And she took care of me when we grew up.

What's your report?

485
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,003
Your security
leaves something to be desired.

486
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Expect a bill first thing.

487
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,385
It doesn't work, you know.

488
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
The chapter. I already tried.

489
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,600
Every mistake I've ever made
started with "It's too good to be true."

490
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,609
So, what do you say, Ollie?

491
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,570
About a partnership?

492
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:56,242
I told you where the safe was.
That's gotta be worth somethin', right?

493
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,494
Took me a minute.

494
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,037
Thanks for that.

495
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,498
But I don't do partners.

496
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,460
What would you have wished for...

497
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,712
if that chapter had worked?

498
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,590
I keep my fantasies to myself.

499
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,927
Well, maybe I'll see you again
sometime soon.

500
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,603
Bobby, you've got some explaining to do.

501

[Bobby] You want me to turn it off?

She shot you, Bobby?

Only in the shoulder.

No, it didn't work out.
