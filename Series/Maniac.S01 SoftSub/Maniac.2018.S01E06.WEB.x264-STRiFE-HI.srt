1
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,322
Welcome back, subjects. Welcome back.

2
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,599
[Owen] <i>It felt like she was really there.</i>

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,311
Well, of course she wasn't really there.

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,689
That was just your brain
lying to your mind,

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,232
and your mind was listening.

6
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,862
Why do you think you have so many...

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,990
experiences with subject nine...

8
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,491
in particular?

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,535
I get...

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,248
fixated on people.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,170
I start seeing them everywhere.

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,050
It only spiraled out of control one time,
but, uh, it happens a lot.

13
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,427
If you were to describe in a few sentences

14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,806
what these experiences were trying
to show you, what would you say?

15
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,766
That for some reason it's more exciting

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,519
to tell people that I cut
than to actually cut.

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,854
Do you have any sense why that's true?

18
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,482
Probably something about my father...

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,276
or my mother.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,362
Say more about your mother.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,366
Is your mother that really famous lady?

22
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,993
The one with the radio show
and all those books?

23
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,454
She's the one that fucked you up?

24
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,251
I think it's too easy, though,

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,129
when people blame everything
on the parents...

26
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,300
as though we're just revisions
and mixtures of them.

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,927
Isn't that what they say?

28
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,348
Once you begin to appreciate
the structure of the mind,

29
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,684
it's modularity on a molecular scale,

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,645
there's no reason to believe that
anything about us can't be changed.

31
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,895
The mind...

32
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,398
can be solved.

33
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,400
What?

34
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,903
Tell me more about the bowling league
in your reflections.

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:41,244
I was just murdering people with a hammer,
trying to find my dead father's balls.

36
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,415
There was no meaning in it.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,335
[Mantleray] Why don't I ask you
the most important question?

38
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,839
What do you think is wrong with you?

39
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,552
You know that movie,
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

40
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,052
[Mantleray] Yes.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
If that happened to me...

42
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,936
there would be no difference in the world.

43
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,065
What's wrong isn't that I'm sick.

44
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,695
It's that I don't matter.

45
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,989
[clicking, whirring]

46
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,451
Great.

47
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,374
There's your diagnostic.

48
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,149
[door closes]

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,664
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

50
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,749
I don't want to talk.

51
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,710
- After all that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

52
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,711
The lemur.

53
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,591
<i>Don Quixote.</i> I know you know
what I'm talking about.

54
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,717
No, I don't.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,427
That's not supposed to happen.

56
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,054
I was asking around in here,

57
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,596
and...

58
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,558
- we're not supposed to be together.
- We weren't together.

59
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,269
There's nothing going on here.

60
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,771
It's a drug,
and you hallucinated all that.

61
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,362
[door opens]

62
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,700
We need to talk.

63
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,827
[in Japanese] Go somewhere else.

64
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,209
Explain, Azumi.
The parts you didn't tell me before.

65
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,586
Yes, well, it's somewhat complicated.

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,910
Then help me understand, Azumi,

67
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,674
because I was clearly brought here
because something was going on.

68
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,052
You need my help to fix it,
so what am I here to fix?

69
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,309
After you were suspended, the problems
with the C phase started getting worse.

70
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,270
Iterations 48 and 49 were...

71
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
were... particularly bad.

72
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,691
And the McMurphys?

73
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,359
Four.

74
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,945
Four?

75
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,116
Why didn't somebody call?

76
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,953
- Jesus Christ, Azumi.
- You weren't stable.

77
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,664
I am stable.

78
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,500
Your inability to control yourself
had left...

79
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,627
I have a diagnosed disorder.

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,173
Had left us here trying to complete
your life's work while you were...

81
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,218
copulating with software!

82
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,637
What did you do, Azumi?

83
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:57,065
I coded the safety net and installed
it deep within Gertie's neural core.

84
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,691
It was a simple idea.

85
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,779
I thought it would help the AI protect
the subjects if they got in danger.

86
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,322
What was the concept?

87
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,115
Empathy.

88
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,327
Just a tiny little bit.

89
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,499
- You gave my computer feelings.
- Just a tiny little bit.

90
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,961
Just enough to let her anticipate
what the subjects might be feeling.

91
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,589
That way she could pull them out
if they ever got stuck.

92
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,635
James, it worked.
She started protecting them.

93
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,972
There have been zero McMurphys
since I installed the net.

94
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,724
Then why is she depressed?

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,396
I gave her simple, emotional programming
five months ago.

96
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,067
And two months ago,
I believe she and Robert...

97
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,155
began an inappropriate workplace affair.

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,491
So she's in mourning?

99
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
This printed at my station...

100
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,040
15 minutes ago.

101
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,879
"Dear, Dr. Fujita.

102
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm unsure if I can continue my work
on this project.

103
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,223
I need to know myself,
really know myself"?

104
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,309
Ugh.

105
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,065
Ugh.

106
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,444
She needs a grief counselor.
She's in tremendous pain.

107
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,070
She's a computer.

108
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,575
- Ugh.
- I know it's been seven years, but you...

109
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,077
you have to call your mother.

110
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,161
No!

111
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,538
No! No, no, no.

112
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,084
No, but your mother would have a unique
understanding of the way Gertie is...

113
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,714
No! My mother is a venomous,
egotistical charlatan

114
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,302
who deploys catchphrases and platitudes
and therapies of the day

115
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,930
in order to dupe millions of people
out of their money and their happiness.

116
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,642
No. No, my mother sells happiness.

117
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,395
She sells it,
then it crumbles in your hand

118
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,565
the minute you're out of earshot
of her magical thinking

119
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,359
and her platitudes and her invented words,

120
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,195
and her primal yawps,

121
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,489
and her steps to success.

122
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,241
No. No, I'm not bringing her here.

123
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,745
My mother is not a healer.
My mother is sick.

124
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,538
She's sick, Azumi,

125
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,541
and if I brought her here, she would
destroy everything that I ever built

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,376
because that's what my mother does.

127
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,549
Was what happened at the gala
your mother's fault too?

128
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,096
The GRTA will be fine.

129
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,142
Prep the Evens for behavioral.

130
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,948
Odds.

131
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,825
Converse with your partner.

132
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
So...

133
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,145
I'd talk to you about the weather,
except I don't even know what time it is.

134
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,921
It's like being in a fucking casino.

135
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,676
Are you having a good time?

136
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,638
Not really.
I'm actually thinking about leaving.

137
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,348
I would if I could afford to.

138
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,809
The last one scared the shit out of me.

139
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,728
I don't trust these people.

140
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,313
Why don't you trust them?

141
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,233
I don't know.
It's like suddenly one doctor leaves,

142
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,402
the new one has my mom's haircut,

143
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,321
and I'm pretty sure
those aren't his real eyebrows.

144
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,615
Did you get one of those
diagnostic printouts?

145
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,158
[woman] But I need the money.

146
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,828
Don't take it too seriously.

147
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,911
I don't.

148
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,791
I've never had a therapist
that could figure me out.

149
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,837
Still, doesn't seem
to make much sense to me

150
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,560
to be telling people what's wrong with them...
before they can figure it out for themselves.

151
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,053
They're saying this is the last time
they trial run this thing.

152
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,806
You think they would have
gotten it right by now.

153
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,427
It seems like there are
a lot of problems around here.

154
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,892
Hell, yeah.

155
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,233
You married?

156
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,069
You got a girlfriend?

157
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,904
You got a boyfriend?

158
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,988
No.

159
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,158
I was married for a couple of years,

160
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,786
and my wife couldn't handle my tics.

161
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,832
I didn't need that paper to know
that there wasn't much hope.

162
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,710
Maybe this last pill
does something for me.

163
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,212
Make me normal again.

164
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,756
What are your tics?

165
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,300
When I get anxious, I, um...

166
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,511
end up eating stuff.

167
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,929
Like junk food?

168
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,723
Yeah.

169
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,806
Mmm.

170
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,559
And dryer sheets.

171
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
Pencil shavings.

172
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,773
Hair from our brushes.

173
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,069
What's normal, anyway?

174
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
[exhales]

175
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,290
I know you and I have had
our differences...

176
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,795
but I would like
for you to try and cooperate.

177
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,048
I fixed you up.

178

[Annie] What is the lady from the seance
doing here?

356
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,353
[Owen] Her name's Dr. Greta Mantleray.

357
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,063
[Annie] Maybe it's weird Dr. Guy's Mom.

358
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,947
- [Greta] Thank you, James.
- [D'Nail] She is.

359
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,777
I asked him in the thing.
He's all fucked up about it.

360
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,369
Artificial intelligence has come so far.
[chuckles]

361
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,453
Who knew?

362
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,708
After I personally discovered
Dr. Fujita at MIT...

363
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,919
she built
the initial neuro-core structure.

364
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,799
With her ability to render and manipulate
the sleep state of our subjects,

365
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,720
the GRTA has become
the most advanced computer system...

366
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,222
the world has ever known.

367
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,478
With the...

368
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,190
addition of this emotional element...

369
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,442
- The safety net.
- [Mantleray] Yeah.

370
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,319
The safety net.

371
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,864
To be honest, we just don't know
what we're dealing with here.

372
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,451
The consciousnesses of two of our subjects
have been crossing. They've been...

373
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,705
- finding one another.
- Due to superficial mechanical problems.

374
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,248
Maybe they're soul mates.

375
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,460
- I'm sorry?
- Maybe their energies

376
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,838
are seeking out each other's,
despite the restrictions.

377
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,635
Maybe these two have a cosmic connection.

378
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,636
[laughs]

379
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,180
Please, Mother.

380
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,475
The GRTA is not some woo-woo dream catcher

381
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,978
that's reuniting cosmic dust
after the big bang.

382
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,980
It's far more sophisticated than that.

383
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,819
Are you two
having a romantic relationship?

384
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,196
- That would be inappropriate.
- We used to be.

385
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,407
[Greta] I'm just curious. I...

386
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,075
I know with your paraphilia

387
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,037
you've always had a difficult time
forming long-term relationships.

388
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,664
I rejected that diagnosis.

389
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,709
And my disorder
is entirely under my own control.

390
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,754
It only flares up, of course,

391
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,998
when things of great importance
are taken away from me.

392
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,508
Like your father.

393
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,801
No, not my...

394
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,388
This, the ULP.

395
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,350
I remember the masturbation binges
after your father disappeared.

396
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,145
- Back to the matter at hand.
- A masturbation reference.

397
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,228
Stop it!

398
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,692
[Greta] May I ask an obvious question?

399
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,110
Please.

400
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,866
I understand you're having a problem
with your computer and that your...

401
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,162
computer needs to talk to someone,

402
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,290
but why on Earth would you call on me
to be that someone?

403
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,255
Because the computer is...

404
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,299
you.

405
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,094
- What?
- My approach to the construction of the AI

406
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,346
required to complete your son's vision

407
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,266
came from my studies
with Dr. Leon Krovackian...

408
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,768
Dear, you don't need to try to impress us.

409
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,562
The...

410
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:48,653
metapsychology of the ABC system
draws largely from your...

411
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,949
earlier, more serious academic work
regarding confrontation, Dr. Mantleray.

412
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,285
More serious academic work?

413
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,372
Yes. I inputted heavily
from your PhD thesis, actually.

414
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,792
Before your commercial success

415
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,837
drew you to other forms of pop therapy,
your work was quite profound.

416
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,214
Pop therapy?

417
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,634
It's just a term that's sometimes used,
and I also scanned your brain.

418
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,778
[Mantleray] Never mind
the technical details, Mother.

419
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,639
I've simply found an elegant way
to fix people.

420
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,268
Lobotomies were considered elegant
when Moniz invented them. Jamie...

421
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,855
how many of your subjects
have ended up catatonic?

422
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,689
Zero.

423
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
Roughly.

424
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,365
When did you get the idea
to make these drugs?

425
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,408
Seven years ago.

426
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,995
Let me just see if I understand this.

427
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,872
So...

428
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:47,963
seven years ago, and shortly after you and
your therapist mother stopped speaking,

429
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,884
you decided to develop a sequence of drugs
that would eliminate therapy altogether.

430
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,512
But now your mother computer is sad,

431
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,099
and so you had to call in your real mother
to talk to her about her feelings.

432
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,725
Is that all correct?

433
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,896
That's exactly the situation, yes.

434
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,568
Well...

435
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,072
[exhales]

436
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,579
Take me to the patient.

437
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,458
I need to speak to Dr. Fujita
outside for a moment.

438
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
[Greta] Fine.

439
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,755
She said yes too easily.
Something's wrong.

440
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,676
She was trying to lead me
to some kind of... insight.

441
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,428
James.

442
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,221
You are on the cusp of achieving

443
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,141
everything you've ever wanted to achieve
in your life.

444
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,435
You've been given a second chance.

445
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,021
We need her help. Let her help.

446
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,316
Oh, just the idea of her
even being inside this lab makes it...

447
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,735
disgusting to me.

448
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,027
James.

449
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,906
Do you know why I didn't leave with you
when you were thrown off the project?

450
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,285
Yes. Your self-interest
trumped your feelings for me.

451
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
No!

452
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,872
I wanted to leave with you,

453
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,167
but I knew the only way
to get this study completed properly

454
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,294
was if I stayed to manage Robert.

455
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,965
I truly believe if we get your vision
of the ULP to market,

456
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,092
the lives of billions could change.

457
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,887
The people of this world are suffering.

458
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,474
If we make it through this iteration,

459
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,559
you'll be a hero.

460
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,312
Let her help.

461
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
This is extremely potent.
The moment I light this,

462
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,123
I need you to put your lips
around the tip and suck.

463
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,808
Oh, freebasing. What year were you born?

464
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,422
1977.

465
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,925
Ah, yes. That was the night.

466
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,008
Huh. Suck.

467
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,035
[Greta exhales]

468
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,039
Be careful in there, Mom.

469
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,875
Thank you for helping me.

470
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,501
[Mantleray claps]

471
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,212
I'm gonna help you, Jamie.

472
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,840
I know exactly what you need.

473
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:40,843
What?

474
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,139
What the fuck did she just say?

475
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,599
She said she was going to help you.

476
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,478
[snoring]

477
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,236
[Mantleray] My father left
when I was a child.

478
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,196
Just...

479
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,076
went and started a new life
with someone else, or so I've heard.

480
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,871
You know what my mother did after he left?

481
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,954
[Azumi] What?

482
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,167
She laid in my bed for two months,

483
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,212
and talked to me about
how she wanted to hang herself.

484
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,048
I was eight.

485
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,305
Does that sound like
the world's greatest healer to you?

486
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,683
I'm sorry that happened.

487
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,184
I'm not.

488
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
Made me who I am.

489
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,731
Led me here... to this.

490
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,374
Where will you sleep?

491
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,169
Lab B is empty.

492
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,422
Probably find a gorilla mating pod
down the hall.

493
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,341
Good.

494
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,144
I prefer you nearby.

495
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,217
[GRTA] <i>Owen.</i>

496
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,665
<i>Hello, Owen.</i>

497
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,380
<i>Why do you have your suitcase?
Did you decide to leave?</i>

498
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,801
I need to go to an emergency room.

499
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,471
<i>Why?</i>

500
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,142
Because I don't know
if this is really happening.

501
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,936
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

502
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,733
Because celebrity therapist
Dr. Greta Mantleray is here.

503
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,404
Because I'm talking to a wall.

504
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,491
Because I can't tell what's real.

505
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
I need real medication.

506
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,874
I need to be hospitalized. I need help.

507
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,794
<i>What about all your friends, the Odds?</i>

508
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>I'm going to kill them if you go.</i>

509
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,256
What?

510
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>I'm going to cure them all
if you go, Owen,</i>

511
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,471
<i>and you'll be the only one
who wasn't helped.</i>

512
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,600
You can't cure me.
There's no cure for schizophrenia.

513
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,270
<i>But I thought you were misdiagnosed.</i>

514
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:24,817
<i>I thought it was only a blip
and that you were 100% compos mentis.</i>

515
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
You can't cure me.

516
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>Your friend, Annie, has suffered like me.</i>

517
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,454
<i>I think I'm going to keep her
with the other subjects I've collected.</i>

518
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,039
What does that mean?

519
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,460
<i>The Queen will unlock the door for you.</i>

520
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,379
What does that mean about Annie?

521
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,923
Hello?

522
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,346
[door unlocks]

523
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,541
[indistinct chatter]

524
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,963
What kind of fucked up stuff
you think we'll experience with this one?

525
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,718
You know we don't have to do this, right?

526
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,222
We don't have to let some computer
go in our head. We can just go right now.

527
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,392
I know I said all that stuff
about therapy before, but...

528
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,062
I don't know, this place feels different.

529
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,649
I actually feel better today
than I did yesterday.

530
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,652
Someone died in front of you
two days ago.

531
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,237
Well, yeah, but...

532
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,583
When I was a kid,
I found this hawk in the park,

533
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,046
and I just had this feeling
that I had to protect it

534
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,048
because it was so strong.

535
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,426
But it was, like, hurt also,

536
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,845
and I brought it home
and I helped it get better.

537
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,599
And then it ate my brother's gerbil,
and he killed it with a hammer,

538
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,922
and I've always regretted that.

539
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,655
What the fuck are you talking about, Owen?

540
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,772
I'm worried about going back in there.

541
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,814
[Carl] You two.

542
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,649
It's time.

543
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,736
Hey, don't be worried

544
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,364
because we'll probably be together again,
right? We can protect each other.

545
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,408
Come on.

546
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,871
[indistinctly conversation]

547
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,171
[speaking in Japanese]

548
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,051
[speaking in Japanese]

549
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,345
[speaking in Japanese]

550
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,139
[speaking in Japanese]

551
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,142
Give me bio.

552
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,603
[Med tech] Clean across the board.
They're ready.

553
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,897
[Azumi] And you've checked
the diagnostic twice?

554
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,108
Gertie's behaving
exactly as she should be?

555
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,819
She looks perfect.
I don't see anything wrong at all.

556
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,827
Subjects, please ingest your pills.

557
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,746
And one additional message for you...

558
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,751
<i>The C phase of the testing utilizes
a more powerful waveform.</i>

559
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,505
<i>Do not be alarmed if you feel
a buzzing or warmth in your head</i>

560
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,298
<i>as the trial phase begins.</i>

561
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,760
They've got the microwaves on high.

562
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,641
When I was a kid, I used to put
all kinds of stuff in the microwave.

563
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,811
Soap bars, peeps.

564
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,231
You ever see what happens
to a peep in a microwave?

565
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,941
- [man] What?
- [Azumi] <i>As we begin</i>

566
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,193
<i>- your final experience...</i>
- Boom.

567
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>...please follow my voice
as I count backwards from ten.</i>

568
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,448
- Your head is not a peep.
- [Azumi] <i>Nine.</i>

569
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,533
Eight.

570
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,908
Seven. Six.

571
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,744
<i>Five.</i>

572
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,246
<i>Four.</i>

573
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,789
<i>Three.</i>

574
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,166
<i>Two. One.</i>
