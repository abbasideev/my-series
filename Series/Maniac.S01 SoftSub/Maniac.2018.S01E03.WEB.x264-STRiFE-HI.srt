[disquieting classical music]

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,117
[Azumi] Ten seconds until reentry, people.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,077
[man] Here they come.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,086
[Azumi] Welcome back, subjects.
Welcome back.

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,466
[D'Nail] Huh?

6
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,343
What was that?

7
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,095
It was fucking unethical.

8
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,389
You waived ethics in your consent form.

9
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,033
Talk to me. Are we liking what
we're seeing on the neuromatrices?

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,644
[man] Clean narrative data
from all but Subject One.

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,730
[woman] I'm not positive
he was actually down.

12
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,375
- [Azumi] What about Nine?
- [woman] I don't know what to tell you.

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,194
Brain structure tells me
she's been there many times before.

14
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,488
[man] She's already got the grooves
of this narrative.

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,074
That was, uh... overwhelming.

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,035
- Wait till you take the second one.
- [Azumi] Friendly reminder,

17
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,623
please do not discuss your experience
with any other subjects.

18
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,126
Post-phase evaluations
will occur in ascending order,

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,587
so please settle in
and wait comfortably in the commons

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,255
until your number is called.

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,221
[Muramoto] Mr. One, please report
to the post-exam test room.

22
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
Thank you.

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
Please describe

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,480
your emotional state
upon waking from the pill.

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Um... Fragile.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,570
Maybe sad.

27
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,197
[Muramoto] Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,736
Also hungry. You need snack?

29
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,536
Bleeding.

30
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,080
[Muramoto] Emotional state.

31
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,956
Emotions.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,998
Bleeding.

33
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,169
Internally.

34
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,546
You look tired.

35
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,715
I'm exhausted.

36
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,136
And devastated.

37
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,222
But satisfied.

38
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,394
I want to know more about the second pill.

39
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,104
[Muramoto] Why?

40
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
I just do.

41
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,446
Um...

42
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,868
S... I'm speechless.

43
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,497
Anything else?

44
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,792
[inhales deeply]

45
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,086
I'm speechless.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>I'll trust you too.</i>

47
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,214
<i>I won't count it.</i>

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,049
[laughing]

49
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,637
[Amelia] For me, it was a hurricane.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
Horrible.

51
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,141
1999.

52
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,309
It took my Herbert.

53
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,311
You like the complicated ones, I see.

54
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,647
- [Annie] I'm so sorry to hear that.
- [Amelia] It wasn't the best of marriages.

55
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,667
- I don't even know her.
- [Annie] Are any of them?

56
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,152
- Nothing to be ashamed of.
- [Amelia] Don't say that.

57
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,738
These places all end up like camp.

58
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,616
Everyone falls in love in two hours.
It can get silly.

59
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,118
- [Annie] You haven't remarried?
- [Amelia] I would never.

60
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,121
I was on a Phase I
of a GI treatment in Houston,

61
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,624
one of the rats proposed
on the second day.

62
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,545
Of course, by that time
we all had the radioactive shits.

63
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,088
You know what was odd though?

64
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,384
What the pill made me see
was not like I remember it.

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,556
Was that a memory,
or was it... something else?

66
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,683
[Carl] One, Five, Nine.

67
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,854
Dr. Muramoto wants to see you
in his office.

68
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,528
- [Raymond] We've been red-flagged.
- What does that mean?

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,786
I do 20, 30 of these a year
all over the country.

70
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
It's good money
if you can work the system.

71
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,918
When they call you in right away,
that means they caught something.

72
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,339
What do they usually do?
Enhanced interrogation?

73
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,634
Enhanced interrogation?

74
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,134
No.

75
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,056
They red flag you, they mark your file,
they ask you a bunch of questions.

76
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,684
They're gonna document the case
so they don't have to pay.

77
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,978
- Then they kick you out.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

78
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,021
Every time,
it doesn't matter what you say.

79
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,274
Mr. Five, come in.

80
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,658
[mouthing] We're fucked.

81
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,079
I didn't take the pill
in case you needed to activate me.

82
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,503
[clears throat] Owen...

83
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
I'm sorry...

84
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,969
about what I said earlier. I...

85
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
sort of...

86
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,183
I kind of lied to get into the study,

87
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,060
and it seemed like you might be a problem,

88
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,854
so I just said what you needed to hear.

89
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,444
But you knew my name.

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,948
I saw you in the ads.
You said there was a larger pattern.

91
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,954
Well, I knew your name because
they said it on the intercom at reception.

92
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,168
And the ads, I sold my face

93
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,920
to a stock service four years ago,
so it's...

94
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,883
And...

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,471
as far as I can tell, there is no plan
or pattern to the universe.

96
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,597
It's just chaos.

97
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,973
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,270
Why are you here?

99
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,229
Your turn.

100
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,110
Yo, can I get my condoms back?

101
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,197
- [Carl] You don't get those condoms back.
- [Raymond chuckles]

102
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,158
Really sorry for the confusion.

103
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,086
There are inconsistencies
with your participation in this study.

104
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,963
Oh, okay.

105
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,051
[Muramoto] And I'm gonna need you
to recount what happened in your mind

106
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,552
after taking the pill,

107
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,599
and verify your experience
of your core trauma.

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,686
It's supposed to be
the worst day of your life, right?

109
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,856
[Muramoto] Is that what you experienced?

110
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,570
It was intense.

111
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,616
Describe intense... with details.

112
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
Well, when I took the "A" pill...

113
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,751
the light changed...

114
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,503
[jazz piano plays]

115
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,880
and I was standing

116
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,465
in my parents' house.

117
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,549
Gimlet?

118
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,593
Oh, what's that?

119
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,345
It's a gimlet.

120
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,056
Thanks.

121
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,766
[Owen] <i>It was seven months ago,</i>

122
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>my brother's engagement party,</i>

123
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,480
<i>and I had just switched
to a new medication.</i>

124
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,277
You like her, don't you?

125
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
Yeah, Adelaide's great.

126
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,619
[Jed] I mean, you <i>really </i>like her.

127
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
What do you want, Jed?

128
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,251
Listen, I... I wanted to...
I wanted to ask you directly,

129
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,836
you know, because sometimes...

130
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,965
You're gonna help me out, right?

131
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,092
So long as you didn't do it.

132
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,303
I did... I didn't do it. God...

133
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,055
[man] Nice to meet you.

134
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,391
It really doesn't matter
what happened, right?

135
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,602
You of all people would understand that.

136
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,813
Of course it matters.
It's the only thing that matters.

137
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,565
- Oh, what's real matters?
- Yes.

138
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,736
Okay. Hilarious. Hilarious, but okay.

139
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,946
[exhales] Can I ask you something?

140
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,408
Can you imagine what Mom and Dad would do

141
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,660
if they found out
you had another incident?

142
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,831
Maybe write threatening letters
to very powerful people.

143
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,001
The mayor, the head of the FBI,
Secret Service.

144
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,588
Tell them how you see a pattern
in the universe,

145
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,424
and how you have to take 'em down
before it's too late.

146
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,969
Maybe sprinkle a little anthrax in there.

147
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,555
You can't do that.

148
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm joking.

149
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,938
I'm joking. Jesus, lighten up.

150
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,232
Who said I'd do that, right?

151
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,483
But seriously...

152
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,695
someone could do that to you, right?

153
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,366
With your history,
you'll end up in the fuckin' loony bin.

154
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,868
It's like someone making up
whatever they want about me,

155
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,370
and I end up humiliated.

156
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,288
And it didn't even happen.

157
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,749
We're in the same boat.
You see that, right?

158
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,545
Anyway, I love you.

159
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,295
Yeah.

160
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,675
I wouldn't want that to happen
to anyone in our family.

161
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,469
I gotta go make a speech.

162
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,137
Yikes!

163
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,222
Wish me luck.

164
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,314
Dad.

165
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,441
Oh, there he is.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,529
Um, listen.
Hey, everyone, thank you for...

167
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,364
Where are you hid...?
Don't hide. Come here.

168
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,824
Thank you everyone for coming.

169
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,078
Um, I would like to make a toast
to Adelaide, my Hempstead hamster.

170
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,955
- That's in the bedroom, right?
- Okay, stop.

171
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,290
[laughter]

172
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,294
But, um, I don't know if you guys heard,
she's engaged to be my... my bride.

173
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,795
- [gasping]
- [whistling]

174
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,673
I don't deserve her, that's for sure.

175
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,718
She doesn't deserve this,
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

176
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,054
- What are you gonna do?

That means that your plates

00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
His middle name was "fun."

356
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,737
It was his fucking fault
if we're talking about fault.

357
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,202
Every time I take that pill,

358
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,246
I have to live through
the worst day of my life,

359
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,372
just like you did.

360
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,625
I have to hear myself say the worst...

361
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,004
ugliest things I've ever said to anyone.

362
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,383
And it ends with the worst thing
that ever happened.

363
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,429
I fucking love it.

364
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,931
Why?

365
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,561
Because I get to be with her.

366
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
Oh, they found him.

367
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,031
[Carl] <i>I thought he was napping</i>
<i>when I first came in.</i>

368
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,199
Poor Robert.

369
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,372
It's a catastrophe.

370
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,377
[Carl] Want me to bring in a team,
get him out of here?

371
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,296
No. Leave him.

372
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,427
I have to go up to the 77th floor.

373
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,851
[door closes]

374
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,069
[sniffles]

375
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,200
[Yoda in Japanese]

376
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,826
[Azumi in Japanese]

377
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,502
[Yoda]

378
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,969
[Yoda]

379
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,331
[Yoda]

380
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,474
[Yoda]

381
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,812
[Azumi]

382
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,656
It was a past life.

383
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,325
An old life.

384
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,037
Lies forced us apart...

385
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,999
and now we can't remember.

386
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,419
No... I remember.

387
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,421
We were lovers.

388
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,175
Now we're gonna be together forever.

389
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,891
High Priestess of Atlantis...

390
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,143
can you feel that?

391
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,562
My energy in your chest?

392
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,689
I can feel it.

393
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,732
Good.

394
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,277
- Now, put your hands on me.
- Okay.

395
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,414
[moans]

396
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,792
- That's excellent.
- [Priestess moans]

397
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,445
- [man] See what she does with a ping-pong.
- [man 2] She shot them...

398
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,606
[woman] It was cute, but I wasn't into it,
y'know?

399
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,359
- [man] Why weren't you into it?
- [woman] It was weird.

400
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,954
- [Mantleray] Fabulous.
- [moans]

401
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,331
[Priestess moans]

402
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,166
That's good. That's good.

403
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,418
<i>- </i>[Priestess moans]
<i>- </i>That's good.

404
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,128
Oh, that's... excellent.

405
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,255
[Azumi] James.

406
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,360
- [Priestess] <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- That's excellent.

407
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,426
[Priestess moans]

408
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,387
- Oh, that's excellent.
- [Azumi] James!

409
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,641
[Priestess moans]

410
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,726
[Sucktube powers off]

411
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,270
[Azumi] I'm sorry to...

412
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,564
to walk in on you like this, but...

413
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,607
I still have my key.

414
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,947
I thought we had agreed...

415
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,076
that you wouldn't bother me
while I was working.

416
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,663
I need your help.

417
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,767
The very fact that you braved
the outside world for me

418
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,293
tells me this is an emergency.

419
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,064
Let me guess. You're having trouble
dampening the reality test

420
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,339
when it drops to NREM 3.

421
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,718
Now Dr. Muramoto has begged you
to come and beg me

422
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,678
- to come help him.
- [Azumi] He's dead.

423
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,099
He was freebasing an A/C mixture.

424
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,975
Uh<i>-</i>huh.

425
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,064
And who's going to replace him?

426
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,649
You.

427
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,405
- Don't fuck with me, Azumi.
- [Azumi] I'm not, James.

428
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,531
[clears throat]

429
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,701
We need your help to finish.

430
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,207
Of course I'll need several minutes
to get my affairs in order, but...

431
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,584
yes.

432
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,131
I'll be right outside.

433
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,637
[rustling]

434
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,181
[sniffing]

435
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,725
[sighs]

436
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,522
When is this fucking horse gonna die?

437
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,132
I don't have my security card.

438
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,224
Thank you for braving
the outside world for me.

439
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,560
Thank you for inventing this treatment.

440
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,567
Does Gertie know I'm here?

441
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,320
I haven't had a chance to tell her yet.

442
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,351
[inhales deeply]

443
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,896
Hello.

444
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,732
It's...

445
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,404
excellent to see you again.

446
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,948
[GRTA] <i>James.</i>

447
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,243
<i>What a nice surprise!</i>

448
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,662
Are you gonna show your face?

449
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,416
All right.

450
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,087
Oh...

451
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,220
By the way, I thought you should hear it
from me first that Dr. Muramoto is dead.

452
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,596
[GRTA] <i>Oh!</i>

453
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,765
And I'm once again at the helm of this...

454
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,058
project.

455
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,019
[GRTA] <i>I see.</i>

456
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,730
<i>Thank you for telling me.</i>

457
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,873
Did Muramoto have access
to a beta headset?

458
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,833
Yes.

459
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,503
Sometimes he used it
when they were red flags. Why?

460
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,965
I'll address the subjects tomorrow myself.

461
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,051
They can't be spooked by a death.

462
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,134
And sometimes the arrival
of a new authority figure

463
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,555
could be equally upsetting.

464
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,473
Either is a data taint.

465
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,767
Last thing we want is a data taint.

466
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,518
Yeah.

467
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,396
We need all the data we can get.

468
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
Number Five...

469
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,403
he just brought rubbers, so...

470
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,447
he can stay, right?

471
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,911
Azumi.

472
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,288
[Azumi] Yes.

473
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,752
When an addict dies,
do you think it's suicide?

474
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,257
I believe Robert was optimistic.

475
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,554
I think he just made a mistake.

476
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm sorry about Robert.

477
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,608
How are you feeling?

478
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,152
[GRTA] <i>I feel...</i>

479
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,948
<i>I have all the feels.</i>

480
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,158
Behavioral tomorrow.

481
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,870
What do you think
they'll all see in themselves?

482
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,439
[GRTA] <i>I don't know.</i> Get some rest.

483
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,561
[sighs]

484
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,993
Good night, Azumi.

485
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,709
Good night, James.

486
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,511
[GRTA cries]

487
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,294
[computerized rooster crows]

488
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,337
[computerized birds chirping]

[indistinct chatter]

490
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,394
- What's wrong with fish sauce?
- There's nothing wrong with fish sauce.

491
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,558
[Azumi] Good morning.

492
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,896
Could I have everyone's attention
for a moment?

493
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,569
My name... [clears throat]
is Dr. James K. Mantleray.

494
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:37,909
Unfortunately, Dr. Muramoto
has had a family emergency,

495
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,120
so I will personally be assuming
oversight duties

496
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,955
of this iteration of the ULP.

497
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
Uh, I believe in this treatment.

498
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,172
And I believe in the idea
that we can all be...

499
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,424
uh...

500
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,051
fixed.

501
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,137
Pain...

502
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,057
uh, can be destroyed.

503
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,144
But it can't without trials
like this, so...

504
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,858
I guess I want to thank you all
for being the brave explorers...

505
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,069
that you are.

506
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,866
Uh, great adventurers on the precipice of
mankind's last, great, hidden frontier:

507
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,291
Mindlantis.

508
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,520
[indistinct chatter]

509
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,065
[computer plays melody]

510
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,072
[woman] I'm seeing soothing
from the white.

511
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,782
Good. They're settling in.

512
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,952
And there's no reason
for any of them to be nervous.

513
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,912
Exposure elements stacked and loaded?

514
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,996
[man] Affirmative.

515
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,790
[Azumi] Safety Net confirm.

516
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,625
[man] Gertie is present and caring.

517
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,008
Okay, people,
let's illuminate some blind spots.

518
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,675
[Mantleray] Azumi.

519
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,932
I'd like to administer
the behavioral pill.

520
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,310
It's been a while.

521
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,605
Be my guest, Dr. Mantleray.

522
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,070
Subjects, please ingest the pill.
[computer powers up]

523
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,815
[man] All clear.

524
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,662
Going to green.

[woman on TV] <i>...comes down to the butter.</i>

527
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,019
<i>...with unsalted butter,</i>

528
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
<i>- but I tend to disagree...</i>
- [Linda] Brucie?

00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,825
<i>...because using salted butter
in the mix...</i>

530
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,856
[Linda] Bruce?

531
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,278
You fell asleep in front of the TV again.
You got to get up.
