00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,943
SEE HER SEE YOU SEE WE
DR. GRETA MANTLERAY

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,214
HOST OF 150 MINUTES WITH GRETA

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,101
[Bruce] All right, Dr. Greta,
let's fix this marriage.

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,978
Hmm.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,611
SHE'S OFTEN TELLING YOU WHAT SHE NEEDS.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,948
YOUR JOB AS HER HUSBAND IS TO HEAR IT.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,495
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,419
NOW SERVING

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,378
Oh, that's me.

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,797
Excuse me.

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,175
Excuse me. That's me.

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,644
Oh, uh, that's okay.

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm gonna wait for her. You go ahead.

14
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,861
How can I help you, dear?

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,988
I am here to report a dangerous driver.

16
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,200
This is form DS-7, including my anecdote.

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,410
My kids play on that street.

18
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,330
You don't have the name and address
of the driver.

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,290
Well, if I had his name and his address,

20
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,418
I'd go over to his house
and I'd have dealt with him myself.

21
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,504
You really shouldn't do that.

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,256
This is his license plate number.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,092
Can you get any stuff from that?

24
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,678
Well, I'm not allowed
to give you that information, hon,

25
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,389
but I could file a report.

26
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,266
- [beep]
- [typing]

27
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,395
I don't know if you really wanna
bother with this,

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,564
because they take such a long time.

29
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,861
Yeah, I'm seeing his address now,
so I can submit this thing.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,945
You know what?

31
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,032
Now that I'm here actually doin' it,

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,408
I feel like a snitch.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,700
And I ain't one.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,121
But thanks. You've been helpful.

35
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,635
How'd it go? [sighs]

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
Failed the written again.

37
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,892
I'm sorry, babe.

38
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,226
Next time.

39
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,688
Hey, wanna get a doughnut
at Lucky's or somethin'?

40
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,652
No, I wanna go to 534 Ashton Place.

41
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,529
You don't need a map.

42
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,198
You married Magellan.

43
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,491
Uh-huh.

44
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,742
Hey...

45
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,454
what baby wants, baby gets.

46
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
Fudgin' seat belt.

47
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,878
- You okay? - Yeah, it's stiff. You know.
- Go all the way back... - Yeah.

48
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,757
- ...and pull it.
- No, I know.

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,051
534 Ashton Place.

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,096
On a need-to-know basis.

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,058
Eight minutes, tops.

52
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,519
[Linda] Oh, in your dreams, Bruce.

53
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,689
[Bruce] I'm gonna put it on sport mode,
Mario Andretti...

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,943
- [Linda] Oh!
- [Bruce] There we are. There we are.

55
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,321
All right, eight minutes.

56
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,072
- We did it.
- [sighs]

57
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,699
- Perfect!
- Okay.

58
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,951
[Bruce] I'm just a guy

59
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,475
- who knows his way around.
- [Linda] Ooh, Brucie, pull there.

60
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
- Here?
- Park there.

61
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,333
Okay.

62
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,503
- [Linda gasps]
- Here we go.

63
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,130
Them sons of bitches.

64
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,882
Wait.

65
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,639
[Linda] When we go in there,
you're gonna distract them.

66
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
What? Distract who?
The guys in the store, Bruce.

67
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,897
It's August, it's 98 degrees.

68
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
Why are we going to a fur store?

69
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,526
Just... Go on. Here, go ahead. Go.

70
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,073
[Linda] It's a different guy.
It's not them.

71
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,449
He's a salesperson.

72
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,660
[man] Welcome to Furs by Sebastian.

73
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,118
I'm him.

74
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,454
How can I help you today?

75
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,872
Uh...

76
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,002
I'm... I'm looking for something to wear...

77
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,005
uh, to the opera.

78
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,632
Is your bathroom in the back?

79
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,883
Oh, right here, hon.

80
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,760
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- Uh...

81
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,304
- Where... Where are... uh...
- You're just in time.

82
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,348
Our summer sale is just ending.

83
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,142
Take a look over here.
See what speaks to you.

84
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,647
I think you'd look
really stunning in a mink.

85
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,818
You don't choose a fur. It chooses you.
Take a look.

86
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,830
[man] Hold on, Lance. I'm sendin' a fax.

87
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,506
[beeping]

88
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,174
[door opens]

89
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,676
PRIVATE

90
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,598
Wendy!

91
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,601
Hey, girl.

92
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,021
We're gonna get you out of here.

93
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,023
- Oh, good girl. Come on.
- [squeaking]

94
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,525
- [beeping]
- [door opens]

95
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,161
[sighs] Sam Beckett.

96
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,124
[clicking tongue] What a babe.
[toilet flushes]

97
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,707
Oh, my God.

98
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,958
[man coughs]

99
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,754
That's one way to lose five pounds.

100
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,089
[first man] Oof. Shut the door.

101
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,175
- Oh, it fuckin' stinks, Lance.
- [door slams]

102
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,258
Light a match.

103
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,261
What kind of car you drivin' out there?

104
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,679
It's, uh...

105
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,014
It's a... it's a Volvo,

106
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,016
but at, uh, home I got a...

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Corvette.

108
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,604
Very nice. Very diverse.

109
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,522
It's a goof, it's fun. I don't know.

110
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,981
And, Lance...

111
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,527
you can't put the code for the door
on the door.

112
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,489
You see that? That's 20 fuckin' grand.

113
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,201
It's got 31 transverse rings on its tail.
Do you know how fuckin' rare that is?

114
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,369
[Lance] It's not a hat yet.

115
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,537
- When's Dad guttin' that thing?
- [Lance] Tomorrow.

116
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,791
We have rehearsal.
It's the only time Joey and Matt are free.

117
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,211
- Can't they learn the routine separately?
- You fuckin' kidding me?

118
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,505
- This shit has to be coordinated.
- [squeaks]

119
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,464
Do you hear that?

120
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,467
[Lance] It's the sound it makes
when it's hungry.

121
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,902
- I thought...
- Shut up, I'm right.

122
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,136
- Just give it a V8.
- [Lance] What?

123
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,263
[first man] Seriously. It's an old trick.

124
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,849
[Wendy squeaking]

125
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,975
No, the fridge.

126
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,147
- [opens can]
- No, pour it in a glass.

127
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,441
Do you want it to cut its little tongue?

128
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,027
Lemurs have very delicate inner systems.

129
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,823
And then just bring it over to me
because I made that up, shithead.

130
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,490
[splash]

131
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
[Lance] Bottoms up, funny guy.

132
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,620
Fucking foreskin.

133
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,789
Oh, that is good.

134
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,209
Now, let's try this, okay?
Five, six, seven, eight.

135
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,377
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

136
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,672
<i>♪ Give me just a little taste
Of your love ♪</i>

137
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,882
Crisp.

138
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,137
Let's see what you got, Lance.
Get your head in the game.

139
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,097
Finding your hips. Okay? Go!

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,890
One, two, three.

141
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,685
Hair. Kick, pull, change.

142
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,395
Down. Up.

143
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,938
I got a feeling about you.

144
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,358
You might be the kind of guy...

145
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,612
who might be interested
in bulletproof furs.

146
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,783
Is that something
that sparks your imagination?

147
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,909
Uh...

148
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,828
I don't know.

149
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,415
[Sebastian] Comes in very handy.

150
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,669
- [Linda] Honey, we have to go now.
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

151
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,381
Thank you. We'll think about it, really.

152
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,883
The sale's ending today.

153
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,260
Maybe your wife will let you
come back later?

154
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,386
- [Bruce] Hah.
- Oh.

155
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,180
You look better in leather. [laughs]

156
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,765
- Now, honey.
- All right. Well, hey...

157
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,850
- thank you.
- Thank you.

158
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,477
We're open till eight.

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,937
- Come on.
- I... I'm gonna think about it. Sorry.

160
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,149
I gotta tell you,
I really liked the way I felt in that.

161
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,694
[sighs] All right, Sheila,
we struck out again.

162
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,528
Back we go.

163
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,823
[sighs]

164
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,283
You need to spill it, babe.

165
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,576
Spill what?

166
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,162
What the hell is goin' on?

167
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,371
[sighs]

168
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
They have Wendy.

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,212
Who the fudge is Wendy?

170
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,379
Nan's lemur.

171
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,256
Who the fudge is Nan?

172
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,841
She... Remember?

173
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,511
The woman that I was taking care of
at work.

174
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,012
With stomach cancer.

175
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,972
Who died yesterday morning.

176
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
Hold on, rewind more.

177
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,187
I told you that Nan and I
had a special connection, right?

178
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,814
So yesterday, on her deathbed,

179
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,359
Nan tells the doctor to get out,

180
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,571
and she asks me to take her lemur
and deliver it to her daughter.

181
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,492
- Wasn't her daughter there?
- No, they're estranged, Bruce.

182
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,620
And Nan, that lemur
just meant so much to her,

183
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,166
and she wanted to give it to her daughter
as a gesture of reconciliation.

184
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,459
So...

185
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,089
you agreed to deliver a lemur...

186
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,093
- from a dying woman...
- Mm-hm.

187
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,513
- ...to her estranged daughter?
- Yes.

188
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,390
So these two guys

189
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,601
come into the hospice two days ago,

190
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,354
and they asked Nan to buy the lemur.

191
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,022
So Nan tells them to scram,

192
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,234
and then yesterday, Nan passes,
God rest her soul,

193
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,654
so I take Wendy, and I get ready
to go find the daughter,

194
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
but then, you know, my bladder.

195
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,618
And so I go in to pee at Bagel Boss
for two minutes.

196
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:43,124
Next thing I know, this fuckin' van
is screeching away, with Wendy.

197
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,967
And thank God
I got the license plate number.

198
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,878
- That is fudging disrespectful.
- It is.

199
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,089
- While you're peeing in Bagel Boss.
- I know.

200
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,260
And now, tomorrow morning,
they're gonna turn Wendy into a hat.

201
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,983
[Bruce] Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

202
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,347
Because I fucked it up.

203
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,766
Like I always do.

204
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
- You didn't fudge it up.
- Oh.

205
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,649
You found it, just now.

206
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,028
And let's call the cops
and clear this whole thing...

207
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Bruce, I can't call the cops.

208
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,198
This is an illegal lemur.

209
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,035
If they take her, they're gonna ship her
back to Madagascar.

210
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,705
Plus, Nan told me that it had to be me.

211
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,997
Only me.

212
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,292
She was very specific on that point.

213
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,504
I just...

214
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,588
Ugh.

215
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,136
We gotta break into that store.

216
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
Tonight. Really?

217
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,226
You're gonna help me?

218
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,771
- Of course I'll help you.
- Aww!

219
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,523
You don't think I'm bonkers?

220
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,028
That's why I married you, babe.
You're a force of nature.

223
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,492
There was a chinchilla in there.

224
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,160
Do I have anything in there?

225

- [Bruce] What?

229
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,881
Make me one with everything.

230
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965

- [Linda] Oh, I'm late.

233

Me too. I just want to break it!

- See, Lin, what I said about the modeling?

- Of course. Love you, babe.

I know it's hard losin' a roommate,

258
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,108
and Nan was quite a lady.

259

It's gonna take a while
to feel normal again.

260

Actually, I haven't felt this good
in years.

261

Whenever I see Nan's empty bed,

262
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,245
I am just elated.

263
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,206
- Elated?
- Oh, I'm not happy she's dead.

264
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm just happy it was her and not me.

You spend a lot of time with Nan?

- She was my patient, so...
- Mm-hm.

You know she had a ring-tailed lemur,
went by the name of Wendy.

288

Yeah, she kept it in a cage under her bed.

351
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
[door beeps]

352
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,357
- I thought you knew the code.
- Wait. Shh.

353
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,367
[pop music playing through headphones]

354
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,513
- What are the dancin' numbers?
- Huh?

355
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,349
What are the numbers you say
when you're about to dance?

356
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,145
- Five, six, seven, eight?
- Oh.

357
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,228
[number pad beeping]

358
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
[door unlocks]

359
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,733
[whispers] Yes!

360
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,485
- They're fudgin' dancers too?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,903
[TV playing softly]

362
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,864
- [snoring]
- Fuck.

363
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,871
Sh.

364
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,083
[Wendy squeaks softly]

365
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm gonna sneeze.

366
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,758
Hey, don't sneeze.

367
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,260
Don't sneeze.
Think it down. Think it down.

368
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,137
You can do it, babe. Don't sneeze.

369
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,974
[woman on TV]
<i>Exactly the information I wanted.</i>

370
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>Every morsel of it.</i>

371
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
Hey. Alrighty.

372
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,148
You should have taken that antihistamine.

373
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,485
Oh, fudge.

374
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
Oh, not my face!

375
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,323
[Wendy squeaking]

376
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,576
Wake up, you freakin' douchebag.

377
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,203
[Wendy squeaks]

378
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,663
You wake up.

379
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,628
That's annoying.

380
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,797
You two made a big mistake tonight.

381
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,091
Don't you fuckin' dare.

382
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,174
[Sebastian] You.

383
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,220
You're the nurse, aren't you?

384
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,931
I'm the legal guardian of that lemur.

385
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,767
That lemur became my lemur

386
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,769
when I stole it from you.

387
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,479
That is so far

388
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,606
- from how property law works.
- Yeah.

389
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,329
[Sebastian] I still haven't decided
what I'm gonna do with you two.

390
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,735
Maybe, uh...

391
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,739
you accidentally get shot
breaking into my store.

392
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,617
Maybe you both just disappear in a ditch.

393
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,954
Yeah, maybe we take their skin
and put it on each other's bodies.

394
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,915
- What?
- We're... we're spitballin'.

395
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
No, we weren't.

396
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
Anyway, the point is, we have options.

397
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,756
But I know one thing.

398
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,298
Tonight...

399
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,554
- you're gonna watch me skin that lemur.
- [siren whoops]

400
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,117
- [Lopez] <i>Sebastian and sons...</i>
- Check it out.

401
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,018
<i>We have you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.</i>

402
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,733
<i>Come out now
and we'll end this peacefully.</i>

403
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,735
- You okay?
- [Lance] It's the cops.

404
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,779
Motherfuckers. Shit!

405
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,907
- [Bruce] It's good. It's good.
- [Sebastian] Boys...

406
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,368
Your grandfather always used to say

407
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,329
the American dream is like a giant tree.

408
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,583
You just keep climbin' and climbin',

409
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,502
until you can almost touch
the fuckin' sun.

410
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
And if someone tries to chop it down...

411
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,716
you fuck 'em in the face.

412
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,385
Go fuck 'em, Dad.

413
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,934
[Lopez over megaphone]
<i>This is Fish and Wildlife.</i>

414
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

415
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,813
Fish...

416
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,150
and Wildlife?

417
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,236
I thought you were real fucking cops.

418
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,115
<i>There's not much of a difference,</i>

419
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>authority-wise.</i>

420
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>Now come out with your hands up,</i>

421
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>and with the hostage,
Wendy the lemur, unharmed.</i>

422
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,705
Fuck you! [Sebastian laughs]

423
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,514
[glass shatters]

424
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,934
[Sebastian] Is that all you got?

425
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,519
I'm a bear!

426
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm a motherfucking grizzly bear!

427
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,779
I eat fish and wildlife!

428
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,364
[yelling]

429
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,447
What the fuck?

430
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,284
It's finally happening!

431
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,203
- Brucie?
- [Lance] Shit.

432
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,913
- It's okay.
- I get the Desert Eagle.

433
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,474
- I get the...
- I get the Desert Eagle.

434
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,458
- All right, on three. One, two...
- Three.

435
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,668
Give me the fucking Beretta.

436
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,311
- Lance! JC!
- What do we do about them?

437
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,314
- We'll deal with you later.
- Get the fuck up here!

438
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,338
Go help Dad! Go!

439
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,181
- [Lance] We're comin', Dad!
- [JC] Go! [Sebastian] Where are you guys?

440
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,263
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

441
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,555
- Untie me.
- Okay.

442
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,142
Wait for him to reload!

443
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,604
Wait... Now!

444
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,688
Heavy fire!

445
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,608
My furs are my babies!

446
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,276
[Lance] Dad!

447
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,071
[Sebastian] Fuck! Where are you guys?

448
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,115
Cover me out there.

449
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,160
- [Linda] Come on.
- [Bruce] Pull, pull, pull, pull!

450
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
I can't get you untied.
I got to leave you here.

451
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,830
Don't you dare!

452
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,457
- Let's go.
- [gasps]

453
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,375
[Sebastian] Let's go!

00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,170
- [Sebastian] Stay steady!
- Oh!

456
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,881
Okay, okay. It's okay, Wendy. It's okay.

457
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,508
- You ready?
- Ah, yeah.

458
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,591
- You ready?
- Yeah.

459
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,553
- Go!
- [Sebastian] Stay with it.

460
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,308
- [Sebastian] Lance, cover me over there.
- [Lance] I'm trying.

461
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,309
[JC] Lance!

462
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,561
- Make it crisp!
- [Lance] You make it crisp!

463
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,439
- [Sebastian] Hit 'em on that side!
- [gunfire continues]

464
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,400
[yelling] Okay, now, here we go!

465
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
No, Lance!

466
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,661
No! No!

467
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,163
Back, back, back, back, back!

468
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,789
Crisp!

469
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,916
[JC screams] No!

470
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,229
- Gotta find the back door.
- Hey! Hey!

471
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,295
- What?
- Exit.

472
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,839
- Exit. Let's go. Come on!
- [Sebastian] Oh, my boy!

473
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,758
My beautiful boy!

474
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,385
Come on. Babe.

475
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,430
- Come on, babe.
- [whimpering] Okay, okay!

476
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,224
[whispering] Okay, okay!

477
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,935
It doesn't fit inside!

478
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,021
[Sebastian] You killed a star!

479
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,066
A big, bright, burning star!

480
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,692
- [Bruce] Go! Go!
- [Linda] Okay.

481
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,112
[Sebastian] A full burning star!
Don't stop burning!

482
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,640
- [tires squeal]
- [Linda] Put it in drive! Put it in drive!

483
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,411
[Bruce] Gonna put it in sport mode!

484
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,015
[Linda] Go, Brucie! Go, go, go!
Take the parkway! Turn it left!

485
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,168
[Bruce] No seatbelt, baby!

486
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,761
[Bruce] You see it?

487
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,847
[Linda] Uh, seventy...

488
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,225
- There.
- [Bruce] Oh, yeah.

489
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,981
Want me to go in with you?

490
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,193
No, Nan said it should just be me.

491
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,154
Okay.

492
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,866
I know this is all... very weird.

493
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,535
I don't find any of this weird.

494
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,202
You don't?

495
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,288
I don't know.

496
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,086
You always have a way of makin' life...

497
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,921
excitin'.

498
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,466
Okay.

499
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,263
Pardon me while I go deliver a lemur.

500
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,312
[cooing]

501
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,276
THE NAZLUNDS

502
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,240
[Linda] Hello.

503
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,366
You Paula?

504
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,537
Is that Wendy?

505
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,496
Yeah.

506
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,250
- [Paula] You realize what time it is?
- I...

507
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,334
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,086
[Paula] Come in.

509
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,547
[Wendy coos]

510
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,342
Thank you. Okay. [grunts]

511
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,024
[Linda] I like your Hummels.

512
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,942
[Paula] Do you take your coffee black?

513
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,237
I should tell you why I'm here.

514
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,991
[Paula] Honey, you don't know
why you're here.

515
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,660
Y-yes, I do.

516
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,205
Your mother explained it to me.

517
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,627
She said that you and her
had had your problems,

518
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,963
but as a gesture of reconciliation,

519
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,424
she wanted to give you this lemur.

520
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,134
Her lemur.

521
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,638
Why?

522
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,143
You know, I think it...

523
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,730
It's her way of telling you she loved you.

524
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,189
No.

525
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,484
That's not an "I love you" lemur.

526
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,611
That's a "go fuck yourself" lemur.

527
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,945
Um...

528
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,324
- Sorry?
- [Paula] Got this in the mail yesterday.

529
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,618
"Dear Paula,

530
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm close to dyin' now,

531
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,040
and I've been thinkin'
of that terrible argument we had.

532
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,583
Tempers flared,

533
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,669
you said things I'm sure you regret,

534
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,338
but now that death
may separate us forever,

535
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,966
maybe you'll finally
come to your senses and realize

536
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,968
lemurs are better than human children.

537
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,345
Here are the reasons why.

538
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,098
One, lemurs don't talk back.

539
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,100
Two, lemurs aren't selfish.

540
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,186
Three, lemurs don't destroy
what you hope to make of yourself."

541
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
OLIVIA MEADOWS,
YOUR "EMOTIONAL POLTERGEIST,"

542
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
WHO YOU SCREAMED AT DURING YOUR BLIP.

543
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,578
What the fudge?

544
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,830
- [Paula] "Lemurs like to cuddle."
- What was that?

545
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,958
[Paula] "And five, lemurs are not capable
of operating large vehicles

546
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,668
or heavy machinery.

547
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,632
A lemur will bring you far more joy
than a child ever will.

548
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,301
Please take Wendy

549
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,345
and avoid makin' the same mistake
I made by havin' you.

550
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,609
Love, your mother Nan." Maybe she's right.

551
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,021
[Paula] I'm sorry?

552
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,651
Maybe you shouldn't have children.

553
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
I don't know who you are,

554
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,413
but you seem like exactly
the kind of person my mother would send.

555
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,707
How wonderful that she found you.

556
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,251
But you're too late.

557
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,128
I'm already pregnant.

558
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,048
In 22 weeks I'll be havin' a baby boy.

559
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,355
Congratulations. I'm gonna name him Greg.

560
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,971
Greg "Fuck U Nan" Nazlund.

561
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,654
I think it's a fittin' tribute to a woman

562
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,185
who wanted a fuckin' lemur
more than she wanted me.

563
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,193
[door closes]

564
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,700
What happened?

565
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,162
- She didn't want Wendy.
- [Bruce] No!

566
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,623
That's not gonna fly.
I'm goin' in there, I'll talk to her.

567
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,210
- No, Bruce, don't.
- No, that is not gonna fly.

568
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,089
Not after everything you did to get here.
I'm going in there, I'm gonna give her

569
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,632
- a piece of my mind.
- Don't!

570
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,218
Sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,745
This one mornin'...

572
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,165
It was back when we lived upstate.

573
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,376
[Wendy chattering]

574
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,461
My sister and I woke up, and...

575
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,755
no one was home.

576
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
Not my mom...

577
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,427
not my dad...

578
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,471
The whole house was empty.

579
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,392
And my sister got scared.

580
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,560
[Wendy chirps]

581
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,856
And so I took her hand and...

582
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
I said no problem.

583
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,654
We'd go out and find 'em.

584
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,282
Like an adventure.

585
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,244
And so...

586
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,290
we went out and we started...

587
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,542
walkin' down this driveway.

588
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:16,171
You know, we had that long driveway
that went on for almost a mile?

589
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,422
Mm.

590
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,634
And after a while, I saw my dad's...

591
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,971
old gray pickup truck.

592
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,391
And I could see it was on
because of the exhaust.

593
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,310
[Wendy chirps]

594
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,647
And as we got closer...

595
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,321
I could see it was just one person
in the car, in the driver's seat.

596
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,824
I could see it was just my dad.

597
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
In the front... sittin' there.

598
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,294
I saw that he was cryin'.

599
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,881
[sighs deeply]

600
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,508
He was crying, and he...

601
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,011
saw me in the rear-view.

602
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,600
When I looked at his eyes...

603
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,354
I knew right away...

604
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
that my mom was either dead...

605
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,151
or gone forever.

606
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,611
Somethin'.

607
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,784
And I had my sister's hand...

608
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,704
'cause all I cared about...

609
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,541
was keepin' her away.

610
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,735
And she stopped. And I just said...

611
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,758
"Come on.

612
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,511
Let's go back and let's...

613
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,555
make a cake.

614
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,475
We'll pretend it's your birthday."

615
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,976
And she...

616
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,190
She looked up at me,
and she said, "Okay."

617
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,696
And we walked back and we made a cake.

618
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,368
[Bruce] When did they get back together?

619
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,786
Hm?

620
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,625
Linda...

621
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,880
your parents aren't divorced.

622
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
Maybe I'm just tired.

623
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,600
[chuckles]

624
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,020
[Bruce] We both got knocked on the head.

625
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about.

626
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,968
I'll get her.

627
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,391

Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Marino.

- Hi.

634
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,202
The kids were great.
Um, how was your date?

635
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,621
It was a blast.

636
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,141
You should get home.
Your mother's probably worried about you.

637
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,041
- [sighs]
- [Vicky] Yeah.

638
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,124
[Bruce] Is 60 cool?

639
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,710
Yeah, sure.

Wendy.

[Bruce] I'm sorry.
