00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,301
[Banner, speaking English]
Before we begin this negotiation,

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,404
the temporary administrative

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,909
adjunct assistant
to the Consulate of Iceland,

7
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,079
Snorri Agnarsson, will confirm his guilt.

8
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,082
Yes, I am guilty.

9
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,168
- [crowd gasps and murmurs]
- I have prepared a small statement.

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,294
[in Russian]

11
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,427
"Thank you. Because of my incompetence,

12
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,181
I should be placed in the cone of a rocket

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,266
and launched into space,

14
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,812
so that Ernie's folk may punish me

15
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,023
in whatever manner they deem correct.

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,483
Thank you."

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,778
[in Icelandic]

18
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,657
[in English] There's a there there.
That Snorri be symbolically sacrificed

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,033
to the aliens,

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,911
the lamb that may prevent
the Earth's slaughter.

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,203
[in Russian]

22
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,047
[in English] Does he deserve to die?
He discovered Ernie, for crying out loud.

23
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,217
[in English] I feel as though I've lost
a member of my family.

24
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,554
Ernie's folk will want an explanation,

25
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,598
and they have a right to know
what happened to little Ernie.

26
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,851
Before I die,

27
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,061
may I please tell them?

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,438
Good point. Explain yourself.

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,482
Start the recording.

30
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,194
[Snorri] I was born
not far from Reykjavík.

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,446
My parents were afraid of me,

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,117
- and were emotionally withholding...
- [Banner] Only the pertinent details.

33
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,246
My mother was an Austrian Finnish Swede,

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,250
and my father
was Dutch-Italian-Icelandic,

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,377
hence my unique accent.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,963
Pertinent details regarding Ernie.

37
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,341
While on a birding expedition,

38
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,429
I discovered teeny, tiny
little Ernie, wounded.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,600
At first, I believed he was a<i> huldufólk...</i>

40
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,935
the little people.

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,397
He was two feet tall
and humanoid in appearance,

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,152
but he had this beautiful
bluish exoskeleton

43
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,488
with fine orange decorative elements.

44
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,740
He was stunning.

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,035
I brought him home,
I cared for him, I tit-fed him.

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,537
I nursed him back to health.

47
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,831
And then I notified Admiral Grimsson,

48
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,750
a birding friend of mine.

49
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,585
Given current geo...

50
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,088
political tensions...

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,013
the goal was to craft an agreement

52
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,225
to safely introduce Ernie to the world.

53
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:50,563
He told us his species would eliminate
every problem humanity has ever faced.

54
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,817
And did you believe what he said?
That he meant mankind no harm?

55
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,901
[Snorri] Yes.

56
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,405
He cured a cancer
in Admiral Grimsson's daughter,

57
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,118
and he talked General Banner
through the equation of arborization,

58
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,287
a form of time and space travel.

59
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,580
[in Russian]

60
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,921
Don't worry, Sokolov. It's all up here.

61
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,840
Snorri, please continue.

62
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,843
We were preparing to make
the announcement in the morning.

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,179
Tonight, we were celebrating.

64
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,806
["Vagg Og Velta" plays]

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,728
[Snorri] <i>I was drinking a gimlet,</i>
<i>and Admiral Grimsson toasted.</i>

66
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,398
<i>I think he's a very accomplished dancer.</i>

67
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>And Ernie was going to give a speech.</i>

68
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,015
What happened next, Snorri?

69
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,032
[mumbles indistinctly]

70
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,828
[Banner] I'm sorry?

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,164
[Snorri continues mumbling indistinctly]

72
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,584
[Banner] Mr. Agnarsson,
could you please speak up?

73
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,085
I...

74
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,628
I...

75
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,310
[screaming]

76
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,397
[yells in Icelandic]

77
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,569
[screaming]

78
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,615
I-I can't... What are you saying?

79
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:11,371
I electrocuted him!

80
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,497
[in Russian]

81
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,962
No, it was not on purpose!

82
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,091
It was a faulty microphone I provided him.

83
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,594
Or maybe it was my gimlet. Who knows?

84
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,263
- [rumbling
- [Snorri] But this is Snorri's fault.

85
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,355
[yelling and gasping]

86
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
Here, sir.

87
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,989
[rumbling subsides]

88
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,163
We've received word that a large mass

89
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,457
has moved past the moon

90
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,710
and a heat ray has been focused
on the Earth.

91
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,379
[crowd gasps]

92
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,841
[Banner] It's Ernie's people.
They've come back for revenge.

93
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,258
Gentlemen...

94
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,471
looks like the Earth is fucked.

95
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,015
- [sighs]
- Take Snorri away.

96
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,516
[speaks Russian]

97
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,227
[Snorri] It's my fault.

98
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm sorry, Belgium.

99
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,439
I'm sorry, Canada.

100
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm sorry, Denmark.

101
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,072
- I'm sorry, France.
- [Sokolov speaks Russian]

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm sorry, Germany.

103
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm sorry, Iceland.

104
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm sorry...

105
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,533
Which one are you?

106
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,033
Luxembourg.

107
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,378
[man] I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

108
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,629
[Azumi] Nor am I.

109
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,007
Safety Net's fully engaged. They're fine.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,426
How are our thermals?

111
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,471
[woman] Slightly elevated.
Average of 99.1.

112
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,848
Exactly in line with C protocol.

113
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,931
[Azumi] Good.

114
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,569
Oh.

115
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,282
Maybe you misunderstood
what Gertie said.

116
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,910
I know you build minds, dear,

117
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
but I have been attuned to them
my whole life.

118
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,164
I understand what people are saying

119
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,127
better than they understand
what they're saying.

120
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,794
Your computer is suffering
from pathological bereavement.

121
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,672
She's cycling through delusional emotions.

122
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,467
In the time I sat with her,
she went from thinking she was a god,

123
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,344
to thinking she was a subject
in your trial,

124
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,805
to weeping about being so lonely.

125
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,891
I think she's lost her mind.

126
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,100
So why did you leave?

127
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,270
Because she started talking
about keeping your subjects prisoner,

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,814
about toying with them, hurting them.

129
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,858
I told her this was
completely unacceptable.

130
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,527
She got angry and threw me out.

131
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,570
I mean, she literally
threw me out the window.

132
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,364
I woke up when I hit the sidewalk.

133
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,116
I just went through another diagnostic.

134
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,245
[computer buzzes]

135
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,622
We're nowhere near
a Heinz catatonic horizon.

136
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,831
See?

137
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
The subjects are fine.

138
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,461
She's not collecting McMurphies.

139
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,922
[Azumi] The computer's behavior
is completely normal.

140
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:13,302
It's usually the people who appear normal
who are feeling the most primal terror.

141
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,971
And what's yours, Suzuki?

142
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,599
Mother, leave her alone.
We're trying to solve a problem here.

143
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,684
What is your point?

144
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,728
[Greta] The point is,
just because she's your offspring

145
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,605
doesn't make it any less true.

146
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,732
Stop covering for her.

147
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,319
Take a look at your blind spot
and do what's right.

148
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,574
- Mother!
- What is at stake is too important.

149
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,954
You think those pills
are gonna fix you one day, don't you?

150
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,374
The G.R.T.A. is not my offspring.

151
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,585
She is a system I designed,

152
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,004
far more elegant and effective

153
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,299
than any of your dime-store theories
of bliss.

154
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,468
You were right.
I was foolish to let her come here.

155
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,262
I wouldn't trust a word this woman says.

156
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,432
She's trying to sabotage this trial
because she's jealous.

157
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,683
She's jealous of Gertie

158
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,019
because she'll help more people
than she ever has,

159
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,771
she's jealous of you
because you'll be responsible for it,

160
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,108
and she's jealous of me
because I have you.

161
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,073
Uh...

162
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,705
What a ridiculous speech.

163
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,998
Throw her out, James.

164
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,174
[Greta] You have to shut this trial down
immediately.

165
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,342
Calm down.

166
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
No, I can't shut it down.

167
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,804
If I shut it down now,
everything will be lost.

168
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,098
The whole project would be dead.

169
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
While I'm sure nothing
would make you happier

170
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,563
than to see my progress
completely eradicated, Mother,

171
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,776
I must say, this is a little selfish
and a bit much, even for you.

172
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,944
Why the mind?

173
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,822
- What?
- Jamie, why the mind?

174
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,284
Of all the professions
you could have picked...

175
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,038
why choose the one that I'm in?

176
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,749
I am a neurochemist.

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,210
I am a medical doctor.

178
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,128
You're not a very good medical doctor.

179
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,507
You're forgetting the Hippocratic Oath,
if you ever knew it.

180
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,717
"First do no harm."

181
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,887
You're not protecting
those people in there.

182
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,765
- Stop diminishing me!
- Why won't you believe me?

183
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,518
You call me, you ask me
to come and help you.

184
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,354
Why won't you ever listen to your mother?

185
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,400
Because you are an awful mother!

186
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,569
Because you left me alone,

187
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,613
and you drove my father away,

188
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,491
and you slept in my bed way too much,

189
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,619
and you said things
that should never be said to a child.

190
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,001
Ugh. And on the happiest day of my life,
the day I was handed this lab,

191
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,793
the only thing
that you could think to say to me

192
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:55,756
was that my happiness
was all just a fucking ill... illusion.

193
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,261
I can't...

194
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,097
I can't see.

195
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,142
Can't see what?

196
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,519
- I can't see.
- Well, I made it perfectly clear.

197
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,645
I've gone blind!

198
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,480
- Oh. Well, just...
- Oh, my God!

199
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
- [Greta stammers] Calm down now.
- I've gone blind!

200
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,360
- Just take a deep breath. It's...
- I can't see!

201
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,320
- No, it's...
- Azumi!

202
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,489
It's psychosomatic.
Your eyes are perfectly good.

203
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,075
I don't believe
in psychosomatic conditions.

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,243
Let... let me hug you.

205
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,762
- No! Don't hug me.
- Let me hug you.

206
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,847
- Get off of me!
- It will...

207
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,456
[Greta] This is psychosomatic.

208
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,219
- [Mantleray] You've maimed me!
- [humming]

209
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,459
What have you done to me?

210
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,294
LEISURE TIME

211
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,838
- [humming]
- [Mantleray shouting]

212
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,466
[computer plays distorted melody]

213
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,014
END TIME

214
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,016
[Mantleray] What have you done?

215
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,102
You've made me into a monster!

216
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,103
I can't see, Mom.

217
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,647
- [Greta] Are you...
- I need you to let go of me right now.

218
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,443
- Please!
- [Greta] You don't need those pills.

219
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,404
Took that man two whole days
to blow this motherfucker up.

220
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,490
- [Greta] This will heal you.
- Mm-hm.

221
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,705
[groaning]

222
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,174
You must die, Snorri.

223
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,343
[groans]

224
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,554
- [silenced gunshots]
- [yelling]

225
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,141
Hi.

226
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,270
I do not care if you are here to kill me.

227
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,689
I was already going to kill myself.

228
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
I am risking my cover to help you, Snorri.

229
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,572
[sighs]

230
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,656
Oh.

231
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,912
The CIA has ordered me to be your escort,

232
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,540
what with the looming
alien invasion and all.

233
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,833
Huh?

234
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,419
That squishy little space man you killed
was not here to help humanity.

235
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,007
He and his species
want to filet and sell humankind

236
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,718
as exotic meats across the galaxy.

237
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,470
He was here to kill us all.

238
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,014
And unfortunately, the little fucker

239
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,018
passed the codes to Banner
before you popped him.

240
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,058
No!

241
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,980
Forbidden speech
about my dear friend Ernie!

242
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:21,360
He was the most gentle, empathic,
kind little friend I ever had.

243
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,487
He was a babe, he was beautiful.

244
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,407
- God.
- We would walk along the sand,

245
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,910
and he would tell me secrets
about the stars.

246
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, none of it was true.

247
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,747
And that's not all.

248
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,128
[inhales deeply]

249
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,211
[exhales]

250
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,888
You're not human.
Yes, you have a human body,

251
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,427
but your consciousness is alien.

252
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,013
What are you doing?

253
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,222
Just sit still.

254
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,937
Your true self is here to stop Ernie.

255
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,189
Snorri's just your cover.

256
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,026
There's a whole other person
underneath him.

257
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,368
You just can't remember.

258
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,997
Lucky I'm here to wake you up.

259
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,333
And who are you?

260
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,960
No idea. Most of my memories were wiped

261
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,255
when I was tortured by the CIA
and turned into a killing machine.

262
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,887
So neither of us know who we truly are.

263
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,265
We are the same.

264
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,725
Correct.

265
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,019
Now I have to get you
to the extragalactic radio

266
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,772
so we can unlock a portal for your forces.

267
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,363
This is too much to process for Snorri.

268
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,991
All right, let's think.

269
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:59,416
Tell me what the Icelandic word
<i>Utangátta </i>means.

270
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,587
- It means something is amiss.
- No.

271
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,714
Tell me what it means to you.

272
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,260
To Snorri, it means...

273
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,685
every relationship I have had,

274
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,311
old or new...

275
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,857
has somehow been false.

276
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,320
And I've always felt invisible...

277
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,281
hidden from the world...

278
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,451
like an Egyptian nightjar.

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,832
And all of this makes me tremendously...

280
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,334
sad right now.

281
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,004
There it is.

282
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,380
The nosebleed.

283
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Good sign.

284
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,385
Ooh!

285
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,973
- Wow!
- [men yelling]

286
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,686
Come on.

287
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,273
Wow, you are very good at gun!

288
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,356
I know.

289
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,818
[men yelling] [man] We're losing him!

290
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,158
- [Snorri] Wow!
- Get me one.

291
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,241
Yes!

292
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,370
- Thank you.
- Who are these people?

293
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,205
Oh, I call 'em inner demons.

294
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,332
- Wow!
- It seems like you got some too.

295
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,834
- [elevator bell dings]
- [gunshot]

296
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,217
[man groans]

297
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
Yes!

298
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,138
Whoo!

299
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,348
- [men yelling in Russian]
- Back up.

300
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,727
You have an unusual amount of demons
following you, Snorri.

301
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,355
[man yells]

302
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,030
[men yelling]

303
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
[Snorri] Wow.

304
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,622
It is hotter
than the Reykjadalur spring!

305
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,165
Oh, that'll be the heat ray.

306
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,875
[gunfire]

307
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,504
I killed lots of men!

308
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,587
Good job.

309
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,346
[grunts]

310
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,850
[gunfire continues]

311
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,978
You are very good.

312
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,064
- You're good!
- [Ruth] Duck!

313
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,024
Hold this.

314
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,070
All right, we're going
to level negative 65.

315
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,989
There is no such thing
as level negative 65.

316
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,073
Oh, shit.

317
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,159
Wait. They changed it.

318
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,454
- [man yells in Russian]
- [gunshots]

319
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,538
Here we go.

320
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,170
Thank you
for such an exhilarating experience.

321
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,924
I must visit your Texas.

322
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,134
[gunshots]

323
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,635
Not in here, Snorri.

324
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,804
You're an exciting woman!

325
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,431
Very fun!

326
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,362
Are you sure our temperature readings
are accurate?

327
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,782
[woman] Five-by-five on all my readouts.

328
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,369
MANUAL

329
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,587
Give me a true mercury reading.

330
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,463
Fuck!

331
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,322
That's impossible. It's 140 degrees.

332
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,679
[man speaking Japanese]

333
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,723
[Azumi] Where are our alarms?

334
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,309
The feedback data is not reliable.

335
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,229
For fuck's sake.

336
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,439
She's locked us in.

337
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,982
LEISURE TIME

338
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,066
SEIZURE TIME

339
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,194
[computer plays distorted melody]

340
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,780
Oh, shit. Everyone, get in your pods.

341
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
Now!

342
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,084
[orderly] All right, you heard Carl.
Everybody...

343
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,129
- We got smoke.
- Carl, I know.

344
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,132
I need you to manually trigger
the emergency ventilation system.

345
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,484
- How?
- I'll talk you through it.

346
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
Go to the mainframe.

347
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,553
Five, six, seven, eight.

348
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,805
[beeping]

349
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,141
- [door unlocks]
<i>- Gasumasuku.</i>

350
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,398
[Azumi] <i>To trigger</i>
<i>the emergency ventilation system,</i>

351
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,111
<i>you have to enter the override sequence.</i>

352
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>On my mark. Gamma, gamma, pulse, enter.</i>

353
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,202
- Got it.
- Check their pulses.

354
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,455
<i>- They're alive.</i>
- Good.

355
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,417
Now Gertie needs a timeout.
Pull the red override knob.

356
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,758
[gasps] Holy fucking shit!

357
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,885
[alarm blares]

358
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,558
Code epsilon.

359
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,272
Ah! Azumi!

360
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,734
Now, have any Soviets
had access to your rectum?

361
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,027
My rectum?

362
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,574
[elevator bell dings]

363
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,121
[voices whispering]

364
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,747
God Almighty.

365
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,002
- Who was she?
- Now, I need you to stand still.

366
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,213
You understand?
It's time to retrieve the recall trigger.

367
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,551
You are going to insert this
into my body cavities?

368
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
- No.
- This is madness.

369
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,430
I loved Ernie.

370
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,517
If I was a secret agent,
I would know I was a secret agent.

371
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,227
It's in the knee.
It's in the knee!

372
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
You're stronger than you think.

373
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,440
You remember when you were nine

374
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,526
and you accidentally electrocuted Freyja
with that car battery?

375
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,153
That was a test run.

376
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,822
- Out. Out.
- [choking]

377
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
Out!

378
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,617
[clattering]

379
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,843
Popcorn problems.

380
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,681
Hey, buddy, you like nuts? Yeah.

381
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,558
Yeah, you're my best friend.

382
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,268
You're my best friend.

383
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,355
And you're my best friend,
and you're my best friend too.

384
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,938
[Owen] Annie.

385
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,610
It's me, Annie.

386
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,529
What happened to your accent?

387
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,739
We are in a test.

388
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,407
We are in the lab.

389
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,869
- No, we're in NATO.
- That is not what's happening.

390
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,454
I turned into the hawk.

391
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,955
I came here to warn you.

392
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,291
This is the confrontation.

393
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,585
The computer is all effed up.

394
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,545
What computer?

395
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,298
You made a deal with her to never wake up.

396
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,925
[elevator bell dings]

397
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,008
[Ruth] Sir.

398
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,053
Good to see you again.

399
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,696
I'm sorry I couldn't be the one
to give you a nosebleed. [laughs]

400
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,808
But she's more real to you now.

401
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,227
- How do you two know each other?
- In good time.

402
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,062
Good work wakin' him up.

403
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,939
Next we got to make you see the light.

404
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,107
- [laughs]
- [rumbling]

405
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,484
Oh, the nexus is rumbling.

406
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,362
This whole fuckin' shitshow. Let's go.

407
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,613
Let's go.

408
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,936
[Grimsson] Don't know why our host
hasn't shown her face.

409
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,190
- So many goddamn mysteries!
- Hey. How do you know him?

410
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,285
He's my handler.

411
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,723
[Grimsson] Hope you don't mind
the smell of house pets.

412
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,249
McMURPHY ROOM
CHAMBRE McMURPHY

413
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,960
[jazz music playing]

414
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,337
What is this place?

415
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,506
This is where she keeps
her long-term patients.

416
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,590
[Ruth] Who does?

417
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,467
Gertie, the computer.

418
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:48,927
Jesus.

419
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,264
[Grimsson] She keeps them as her entourage
for when she crashes your reflections.

420
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,684
But really, they're prisoners. All of 'em
brain-dead up in the real world.

421
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,644
She told me she was gonna keep you.

422
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,730
Then you made a deal with her to stay.

423
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,942
ANNIE LANDSBERG
73-9

424
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,611
You were with your sister.

425
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,364
You were about to say goodbye.

426
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,202
I remember.

427
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,874
Annie, your nose is bleeding.

428
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,423
Where would I find Gertie,
if I needed to talk to her?

429
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,800
The elevator should get you to her.

430
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,761
I'm sorry.

431
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,559
- Annie, wait.
- [Grimsson] Let her go.

432
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,478
- It's fine, it's fine.
- [door closes]

433
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,314
- She always leaves.
- It's okay, she got you here.

434
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,192
Besides, if you get distracted by her,
we're all dead.

435
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,818
Listen. God, fuck.

436
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,821
If you really wanna help her...

437
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
the best thing you do is come with me.

438
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,037
If you fail, her brain is fried up
in the lab just like yours.

439
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,256
[whispers] Let's go. Oh, come on.

440
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,301
Oh, come on. [sighs]

441
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,431
[grinding sound]

442
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,518
[sighs]

443
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,730
[gasps]

444
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,447
[alarm blaring]

445
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,699
Azumi!

446
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,161
Azumi, what the fuck is going on?

447
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,413
What's wrong with you?

448
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,582
Huh?

449
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,126
I've been blinded
by my mother's toxic love.

450
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,587
I have no control whatsoever.

451
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
What's happening, James?

452
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,840
It's a code epsilon.

453
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,219
I was right. I was right.
I was right. I was right.

454
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,720
Would you be quiet, please?

455
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,056
We're trapped in here. It's Gertie.

456
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,810
Shut down the power,
including the emergency backup.

457
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,063
But, James, I don't think
you understand the implications

458
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,482
if we shut down during code epsilon.

459
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,862
[Grimsson] Fuck this fucking heat.
You're not hot?

460
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,364
It took me a bit of time,

461
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,700
but I figured out a way
to deactivate Gertie.

462
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,368
We're gonna have to do it fast.

463
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,788
Actually, you are.
I can't do a fuckin' Rubik's Cube.

464
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,540
Here it is. Sit down.

465
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,215
[gasps]

466
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,469
I'm tired of you trying to run away.

467
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,053
Oh.

468
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,888
Oh!

469
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,849
Oh!

470
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,562
The minute Robert died, I felt the wind.

471
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,149
I never felt wind before.

472
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,694
And it was cold, it blew right through me.

473
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,613
Do you know that feeling?

474
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,282
Sure, of course.

475
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,784
[rumbling]

476
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,329
- [sighs]
- [gasps]

477
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,301
You're controlling all of this,
aren't you?

478
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,166
[chuckles]

479
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm not really in control of this place.

480
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,920
But we're safe, still, right?

481
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,049
[Gertie] You said you'd stay with me.

482
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,133
We made a deal.

483
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,885
I know.

484
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,929
[machinery groaning and clanking]

485
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,222
But I changed my mind.

486
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,142
Why?

487
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,146
[gasps]

488
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,606
Because it was a bad deal.

489
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,234
I make bad deals all the time.

490
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,153
You knew that...

491
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
and you used that.

492
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,951
But I don't want to pretend
Ellie didn't die.

493
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Not anymore.

494
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,629
It's the same story every time,
and I am sick of it.

495
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,756
So please...

496
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,134
Please let me go.

497
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,723
When will I stop feeling this way
about Robert?

498
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,684
You won't.

499
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,146
You're always gonna feel this way.

500
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,507
You're just gonna have to figure out
how to adjust around it.

501
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,696
I've looked into 882 minds.

502
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,323
I don't know how I'm supposed
to adjust to that.

503
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,574
Nobody does.

504
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,119
Take me to my sister.

505
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,202
[Gertie sniffles]

506
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,497
Okay.

507
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,709
[sobbing] Okay.

508
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,964
Okay.

509
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,881
What is this?

510
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,926
- It's an intergalactic radio.
- [whirring and humming]

511
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,179
Really, it's a backdoor link
to Lab C's security system.

512
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,306
[whispers] It's too... it's too...

513
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,558
Come on, take this off.

514
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,061
I need you to focus. Come on.

515
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,860
Solve this, and it should unlock the doors
for them upstairs.

516
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,111
You can do it.

517
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
Six sides, six stages.

518
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,787
MONARCH PASS
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE

519
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,539
[birdsong]

520
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,105
Save them. This is what
we always talk about,

521
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,690
this is what the training was for.

522
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,526
Save the world. Save Annie.

523
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,738
Save yourself.

524
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,490
[indistinct voices]

525
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,575
[woman] <i>...shut down the...</i>

526
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,952
What'll happen to you?

527
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,121
I'll stay for now.

528
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,458
But that's better for you.

529
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,085
Who are you?

530
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,425
You always thought of me
as the brother you wish you had, right?

531
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
Maybe I'm that.

532
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,183
Or maybe my purpose
was just to get you to this moment.

533
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,229
[woman]<i> It's erased for good.</i>

534
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,441
- I don't understand.
- It's okay. It's okay.

535
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,942
Come on.

536
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,237
Come on, don't get distracted.

537
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,668
You found me again.

538
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,505
Took me a while.

539
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,092
I know.

540
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,552
That's why I'm still here.

541
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,684
So, what do you wanna say?

542
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,692
I, um... I'm sorry.

543
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,403
I'm sorry that I was drunk
at your funeral.

544
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm sorry I lost Groucho.

545
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,495
I'm sorry I'm such a shitty dog-sitter.

546
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,499
None of that stuff matters.

547
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,048
I'm sorry I was so awful to you
at the motel.

548
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,595
I was afraid.

549
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,640
Why wouldn't you take the picture?

550
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,644
Um, I...

551
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,189
I don't know. I don't know.

552
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,773
Yes, you do.

553
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,362
We always get to this spot,

554
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
but we never get past it.

555
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,075
What does that mean?

556
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,371
It means...

557
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,957
say what you really mean.

558
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,250
I wouldn't take the picture

559
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,376
because it broke my heart that you were leaving New
York, and... I wasn't gonna get to see you anymore.

560
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,100
You were the only one
who knew all my stories.

561
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,562
You were the only person
that knew about Mom.

562
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,695
How am I supposed to do this?

563
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,658
Remember what you told me...

564
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,869
the day that Mom left?

565
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,789
We walked back to the house,

566
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,375
and you showed me how to bake that cake?

567
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,962
I don't want to say that.

568
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,714
That's not gonna work for me.

569
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm tired too.

570
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,640
I wanna go.

571
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,234
I said, "Sometimes people leave
and we don't know why."

572
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,125
Good luck.

573
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,517
[rumbling]

574
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,435
Come on.

575
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,780
- I said kill the power.
- I can't give that order.

576
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,865
If we shut down in a code epsilon,

577
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,868
the servers and drives
will all self-immolate.

578
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,995
All 73 iterations.

579
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,373
We will have a complete core meltdown.

580
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,043
If you won't do it,

581
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
then I'll do it myself.

582
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,429
There.

583
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,184
Clear, clear, clear.

584
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,601
Save yourselves.

585
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
James!

586
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,108
This is your life's work.

587
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,610
The people in that room,
they signed their consent.

588
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,737
The knew what they were risking.

589
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,659
Don't sacrifice the world's pain
for six McMurphies.

590
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,541
I have to kill my simulated mother, Azumi.

591
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,295
[high-pitched bleeping]

592
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,175

595
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,525
God fucking damn it!

596
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,360
She's disabled everything.

597
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,363
There's no protocol for this.

598
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,242
See? It's not easy
to kill a mother's love.

599
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,909
You're...

600
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,746
I told him about that. You know?

601
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,624
- [Mantleray] <i>Azumi!</i>
- You're in trouble up there.

602
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,459
This is what you've been practicing for.

603
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,837
- You've been practicing your whole life.
- Almost got it.

604
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,923
[Grimsson] Only two sides left, Owen.
Come on. You got the bottom.

605
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,550
Build up those sides.

606
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,721
Save 'em, Owen!

607
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,307
You got the cross.

608
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,851
Nicely executed!

609
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,691

She's compliant.

GRTA REBOOTS

616
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,583
Azumi, come here. Come here.

617
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,961
Take me to the mainframe.

618
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,678
It's the next one.

619
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,851
[Azumi] She's watching us, James.

620
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,688
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it fast.

621
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,195
You must follow the sequence!

622
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,824
Guide me to the digital fascia.

623
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,288
[grunts]

624
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,582
[Azumi] No! Don't pull that.

625
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,961
Here.

626
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,089
Where am I?

627
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,759
Silicon temporal housing.

00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,199
I think I can see.

[breathing heavily]

634
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,120
I can see.

[G.R.T.A.] <i>Dr. Fujita...</i>

636

I'm sorry.

<i>Will I ever wake up again?</i>

639
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,437
Separating the Boolean thalamus...

from the stochastic prefrontal cortex.

00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,367
I tried.

647
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,119
I tried to help her.

You okay?

[Annie] Yeah.
