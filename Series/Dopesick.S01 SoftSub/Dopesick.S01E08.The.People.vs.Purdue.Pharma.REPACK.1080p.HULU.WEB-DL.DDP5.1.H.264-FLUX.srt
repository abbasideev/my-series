1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,707
I brought you here tonight
to sign a petition

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,875
so we can try to bring
an end to this nightmare.

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,749
I think a lot
about being a doctor again.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,332
A way to make
amends for the pain

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,957
that we have caused others
is to give back.

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,666
You need to get
to a hospital immediately.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,124
Fuck off.

8
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,874
Come to New Orleans.
I'll be the regional manager.

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,791
We'll make a fortune there.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,707
A black box label
indicates the drug is

11
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,957
much more dangerous.

12
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,916
Absolutely not.

13
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,124
I don't believe
you will find support

14
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,499
at Main Justice

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,374
for felony charges
against these individuals.

16
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,624
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,957
After careful consideration,

18
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,749
I have decided to indict
Michael Friedman,

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,291
Paul Goldenheim,
and Howard Udell

20
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:45,416
on felony charges.

21
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,291
I'm starting
Suboxone tomorrow.

22
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,749
Give me one hell of a send-off.

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,791
Got it.

24
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,167
Beth is in heaven now.

25
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,707
Shame on Sackler!

26
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,416
Shame on Sackler!

27
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:41,082
Shame on Sackler!
Shame on Sackler!

28
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,957
Take down their name!

29
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,624
Take down their name!

30
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,999
Take down their name!
Take down their name!

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,291
No longer!

32
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,541
No longer!

33
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,291
No longer.
No longer!

34
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:53,457
No longer!

35
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,624
No longer!

36
00:01:54,625 --> 00:02:00,624
400,000 dead, 400,000 dead,
400,000...

37
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,958
Sacklers lie, people die!
Sacklers lie, people die!

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,875
Sacklers lie, people die!

39
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,082
Shame on Sackler!

40
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,957
Shame on Sackler!

41
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,374
Shame on Sackler!

42
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,124
Shame on Sackler!

43
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,416
Shame on Sackler!

44
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,124
Shame on Sackler!

45
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,457
Shame on Sackler!

46
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,999
Shame on Sackler!

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,749
Shame on Sackler!
Shame on Sackler!

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,582
Your record since
the plea deal continues

49
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,707
to be clean, which is good.

50
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,124
You also continue to pass
your drug tests, also good.

51
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,166
You're on path
to complete your probation

52
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,249
in three months' time.

53
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,249
Have you thought
about what you'll do then?

54
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,124
Well, I really want
to get my medical license back,

55
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,457
but I can't do that
as long as I'm on Suboxone.

56
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,499
How long do you think
you'll be on the MAT for?

57
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,999
I don't know.
Um...

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,416
I'm afraid I'll relapse
if I stop.

59
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,749
If you choose
to stay on the MAT,

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,416
you need to consider
a profession

61
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,833
that doesn't require
a medical license.

62
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:14,458
Yeah, okay.

63
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,499
Hey, Elizabeth Ann.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,291
How you doing?
What--

65
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,166
what are you doing here?

66
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,624
Same as you, Doc.

67
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,457
You had enough to eat,
enough sleep?

68
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,958
You don't--
Can you just leave me alone?

69
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:47,041
Hey, you.

70
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,999
What if I wait outside for you?

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,207
When you're done in here,
I'll take you to lunch.

72
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,499
We'll visit a little bit
and catch up.

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,666
You know,
I'll buy you anything you want.

74
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,625
If you don't eat it,
you can take it home.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,958
How was your meeting?

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,624
Not great.

77
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,124
I got two years left,
and she keeps telling me

78
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,166
I'll probably end up
back in jail.

79
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,416
Yeah, they all think
we're just a bunch of,

80
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,166
you know, worthless junkies.

81
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,499
They don't get it.

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,957
They don't know that
if we don't have this stuff,

83
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,166
it feels like we can't breathe.

84
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,832
If I stop, I'll die.

85
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,499
And if I don't stop, I'll die.

86
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,582
So I guess I'm gonna die.

87
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:38,082
So that's kind of why
I wanted to talk to you.

88
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,541
Okay?
I'm seeing this doctor.

89
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,332
And I'm on this new medication,
and it's really helped me.

90
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,499
I haven't relapsed in a year,
and my mind is coming back

91
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,124
like it used to be
before all this.

92
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,124
Really?
Yeah, really.

93
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,999
Hey.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,749
Elizabeth Ann, you're young.

95
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,291
You got an entire future
that you could do anything.

96
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,582
You could go to college
if you wanted to go to college.

97
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,832
You could if you wanted to.

98
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,749
You could.

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,957
Listen to me.

100
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,041
I will personally drive you

101
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,916
to this doctor
I've been seeing.

102
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,791
I'll drive you there,
and I'll you drive back.

103
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,207
And I'll take you
to therapy twice a week,

104
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,832
and I'll pay for all of it.

105
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,124
What's in it for you?

106
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,916
I delivered you, girl.

107
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,249
Ain't no one thing
in this world

108
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,916
I wouldn't do
to help you get better

109
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,167
when you're sick, nothing.

110
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,207
I'll try it.

111
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,542
I'll try it.

112
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,582
But no promises
I'll keep going.

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,957
Okay, okay, fair enough.

114
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,832
Today, we are here
to celebrate the promotion

115
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,791
of Amber Collins.

116
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:08,832
Look, all I have to say is,
New Orleans better watch out

117
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,292
because they got a bitch tiger
coming their way!

118
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,957
Cheers!
Cheers!

119
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,500
Sayonara, you motherfuckers.

120
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,374
Hi.

121
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,582
Hey.

122
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,583
Someone hasn't put in
their transfer to Nola yet.

123
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,874
I was giving it
some space between you leaving,

124
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,916
so they're not suspicious.

125
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,207
Are you not coming?

126
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,499
Of course I'm still coming.

127
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,749
'Cause I'm a big girl.

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,541
If you changed your mind,
you can tell me.

129
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:48,082
I haven't changed my mind.

130
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,582
Good, I wanna make this work.

131
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,457
Me too.

132
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,125
You better.

133
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,874
Hey, Billy.

134
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,124
Um, I gotta run
a few things past you.

135
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,624
Can you swing by my office
in say, ten?

136
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,707
Sure.

137
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,667
Okay.

138
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,291
Shut the door for me, Billy.

139
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,792
Sure.

140
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,082
Have a seat.

141
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,291
Yeah.

142
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,042
How's it going?

143
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,332
These are two lawyers
from headquarters.

144
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,874
I have some concern
over three training tapes

145
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,792
that went missing
from my office.

146
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,582
And you were
in here alone last week.

147
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,124
Right.
Um...

148
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,957
I didn't take--if that's...

149
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,916
I don't know anything
about any missing tapes.

150
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,624
If Purdue property were
to show up in the media

151
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,582
or in the hands
of law enforcement,

152
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,041
and those tapes were
traced back to you,

153
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,999
we would sue you
for stolen property,

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,082
breach of contract,

155
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,791
and misappropriation
of trade secrets.

156
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,249
We'll bankrupt you
with litigation

157
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,124
for the rest of your life.

158
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,874
But I didn't--I didn't--
I didn't take 'em.

159
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,042
I didn't take the tapes.

160
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,541
Several people,
including myself,

161
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,332
have noticed
a very negative attitude

162
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,707
towards your work of late.

163
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,042
We think it's best
to terminate your contract.

164
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,625
Um...

165
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,542
Okay.

166
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,624
This is
a nondisclosure agreement.

167
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,832
If you sign it,

168
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,792
you'll get a severance package
of $75,000.

169
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,832
I would need to show this
to my lawyer first, but I--

170
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,249
No, you need to sign it
right now, right here.

171
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,374
If you don't, you get nothing,

172
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,707
and you make
yourself vulnerable

173
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,792
to future litigation.

174
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,416
Billy, come on.
This doesn't have to get ugly.

175
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:29,457
If you did take the tapes,
this will smooth it all out,

176
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,207
as long as you destroy
those tapes right away.

177
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,792
You are not gonna get
a better deal than this.

178
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:42,707
And the flip side,

179
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,208
flip side could get really bad.

180
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,332
Do what you do best,

181
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,792
and take the money.

182
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,917
Clear the way, Clear the way!

183
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,166
Are you friends with him?

184
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,707
No.

185
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,792
I always thought
he was kind of a tool.

186
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,707
All right?

187
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:32,249
I remember you were
one of my smartest.

188
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,749
You were probably
the smartest patient I had.

189
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,708
Always reading a book,
you know.

190
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,207
I'm looking for something new.

191
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,250
You got any favorites?

192
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,541
How'd it go?

193
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,000
She did very well.

194
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,791
She took her first dose,

195
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,541
and she needs to wait here
an hour to make sure

196
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,707
she doesn't have an adverse
reaction to the medication.

197
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,999
All right, okay.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,749
Well then, we'll just
stay put for a minute.

199
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,207
I'll see you in a week,
young lady.

200
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,125
Thanks, Doc.

201
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,542
He's a good guy.

202
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,125
You okay?

203
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,999
Vanity Fair.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,374
What?

205
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,249
You should read Vanity Fair

206
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,707
by William
Makepeace Thackeray.

207
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,291
It's one of my favorites.

208
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,124
People think
it's a girls' book,

209
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:15,166
but it's really
more than that.

210
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,457
What's it about?

211
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,999
It's about this poor girl,
Becky,

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,832
who's smart, and cunning,
and determined

213
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,999
to make her way
into London society.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,124
But, of course,
it's not easy,

215
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,124
'cause all those snobs care
about is status and class.

216
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,417
Sounds about right.

217
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,624
Neither Purdue, nor the FDA,

218
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,957
nor the DEA,
nor the medical community

219
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,041
anticipated the extent
of this problem.

220
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,874
Purdue's marketing practices
have not played a role

221
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,416
in the criminal activities
of doctors

222
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,999
who illegally prescribe
OxyContin for cash

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,832
and have not
encouraged robberies

224
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,291
from pharmacies or patients.

225
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,791
From Dr. Goldenheim's
personal emails,

226
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,249
we can prove that he knew
his testimony

227
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,999
before Congress was false.

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,166
He was aware the reports
of patient abuse are not rare,

229
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,249
as they were described

230
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,707
in countless
newspaper articles,

231
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,207
some of which were emailed
directly to Dr. Goldenheim.

232
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,957
This testimony was taken
in D.C.,

233
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,499
so it's not admissible
in the state of Virginia case.

234
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,999
Well, the state
of Virginia is a Commonwealth,

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,666
and we thought
you might bring that up.

236
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,707
We uncovered that transcripts
from Goldenheim's, Udell's,

237
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,666
and Friedman's false
Congressional testimony

238
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,791
were faxed to sales reps
all over the country

239
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,249
to show them top executives,
quote, "had their backs."

240
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,124
And one of the places
that it was faxed to

241
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,416
was here in Virginia,

242
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,957
which makes it not
only admissible,

243
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,249
but we'll now also be charging
wire fraud and conspiracy

244
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,582
to commit wire fraud
based on the use of wires

245
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,083
to transmit
this false testimony.

246
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,582
You really think
a judge will go for that?

247
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,916
You really think they won't?

248
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,624
My client will not
move forward

249
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,957
with any settlement
that involves felony charges

250
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,791
against individual executives.

251
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:09,999
However, I am authorized
to offer a financial settlement

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,957
to resolve this matter.

253
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,707
How much?

254
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,249
$10 million.

255
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,291
The Commonwealth
of Virginia counters

256
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,291
at 1.6 billion.

257
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,874
Is that a joke?

258
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,249
No, and since we have
Michael Friedman, Howard Udell,

259
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,166
and Paul Goldenheim
all dead to rights

260
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,374
on lying to Congress
and conspiracy to defraud,

261
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,374
there will be no deal
until they plead guilty

262
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,667
to felony charges as well.

263
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,374
Thank you, gentlemen.

264
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,832
Thank you for coming by.

265
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,041
These assholes
really do think

266
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,749
they're just gonna barrel
right over us.

267
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,541
I mean, 10 million?
Fuck those guys.

268
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,041
How long before
they find out Main Justice

269
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,332
doesn't want to pursue felony
charges against individuals?

270
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,999
Well, they probably
already know through Giuliani,

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,457
but it doesn't really make
a difference.

272
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,249
We're just gonna keep moving
ahead like it's happening.

273
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,207
We don't indict,
we lose any shot

274
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,791
of getting 'em to flip
on the Sacklers.

275
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,124
Yeah, I get that, but look.

276
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,624
If we're gonna move
Main Justice on indictments,

277
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,707
it's going
to take something significant

278
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,957
to change their mind.

279
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,457
I mean, it's gonna take
something emotional.

280
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,707
It's gonna take something
egregious that might

281
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,832
publicly blow up in their face
if they don't indict.

282
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,582
Of course.
We'll keep looking.

283
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,541
Thank you, sir.

284
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,249
Anything with
breakthrough pain?

285
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,167
Covered it.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,582
Maybe new way
into blood charts?

287
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,416
Maybe a direct link
to Richard Sackler

288
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,207
ordering
the graph manipulation?

289
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,833
If it was there,
we'd have it.

290
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,207
We never did
anything substantial

291
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,833
with Toppers Contest.

292
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,166
You think
a drug-selling competition

293
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,000
with a powerful narcotic
might move Main Justice?

294
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,792
Hey, Jerry.

295
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,958
You mind if I come in?

296
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,833
Sure.

297
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,667
Diane.

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,916
I haven't really
been able to sleep

299
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:14,375
since I heard about Betsy.

300
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,000
And...

301
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,582
I'm sorry I didn't come
to the funeral.

302
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,083
We didn't want you there.

303
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,750
Well, that's why
I didn't come.

304
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:45,499
If I could change places
with her,

305
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,417
I would.

306
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,166
I heard you got off that stuff.

307
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:01,582
Is that true?

308
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,792
You know, one day at a time.

309
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,208
Good for you.

310
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey, man.

311
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,042
I sure am sorry, Jerry.

312
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,749
Look,
ain't nothing either one of us

313
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,458
can say gonna
change anything.

314
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,417
Or make us feel
any different, really.

315
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,208
So just go on
and live your life, Doc.

316
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,999
Yeah.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,667
Well...

318
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,875
All right.

319
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,249
You take care.

320
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,792
You too now.

321
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,291
"I never wanted
to tell anyone

322
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,874
"my dream was to be a famous
writer living in Paris

323
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,166
"'cause I knew
they'd all laugh at me.

324
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:01,457
"But I wrote almost every day
till the drugs took over.

325
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,749
"I liked how they made the fear

326
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,457
"I had of not
being successful go away.

327
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,916
But the shame I feel
outweighs any of that."

328
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,832
Hey, wait, I'm stopping you.

329
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,707
I don't want to hear
about shame.

330
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,166
I want to hear about Paris.

331
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,666
That was great, wasn't it, Doc?

332
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,124
Heck yeah, it was,
really great, really great.

333
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,624
You know what I want
you guys to do?

334
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,416
Write about your
favorite memory, all right?

335
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,457
Write something
about your favorite memory,

336
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,707
and you can make it fun.

337
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,166
It's okay to have fun with it.

338
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,749
Hey, Doc.
I mean, Sam.

339
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,124
It's real nice of you
to keep driving us like this,

340
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:39,916
but you live an hour east,
and this takes up a whole day.

341
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:42,041
Why don't you move back
to Finch Creek?

342
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:47,499
No, no, no, no, no.

343
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,624
No, don't think that's
a good idea.

344
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,457
I don't think--

345
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,999
I don't think anybody
wants me back in Finch Creek.

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,874
So?
Nobody wants me there.

347
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,167
You should come back.

348
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,291
Nah.

349
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:08,042
No, I don't think
I could ever go back.

350
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,541
Purdue Pharma.

351
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,291
Ever since I left that place,

352
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,582
I've been trying
to put it out of my mind.

353
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,707
So what are you guys
looking for?

354
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,957
We'd like to discuss
a sales competition

355
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,791
known as Toppers Contest.

356
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,457
Right.
Was it effective?

357
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,207
Yeah, yeah, it was,
like gangbusters.

358
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,332
You've got every rep
in the country

359
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,916
selling as hard
as they can for,

360
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,957
you know, a free trip
to Bermuda or Palm Springs.

361
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,374
You ever seen
any other pharma company

362
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,667
do something like that before?

363
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,625
You guys mind taking a walk?

364
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,041
All right, look,
to answer your question, no.

365
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:55,166
The bonus structure
was unbelievable.

366
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,207
The more milligrams you sold,
the more money you made.

367
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,332
No one else does that.

368
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,916
Did it bother you
that sales reps

369
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,416
were financially motivated
to sell higher doses?

370
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,707
Not at first.

371
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,582
I mean, look,
they tricked the managers

372
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,416
the same way
they played the reps.

373
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:15,124
They would give us all
this data from pain societies

374
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,624
that made everything
seem so legit.

375
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,374
So why'd you finally leave?

376
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,375
Yeah, so hold on.

377
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:29,166
So I kept having
to appear in court

378
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:33,249
for all these lawsuits
that were coming in.

379
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,374
I show up one day
to a deposition,

380
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,916
and Purdue doesn't have
a lawyer for me.

381
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,707
They left me on my own,
and I knew right then

382
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,249
I have got to get out,

383
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,332
or I'm gonna end up
in some serious shit.

384
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,624
So why didn't they have
a lawyer for you?

385
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,791
They were pissed.

386
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,416
One of my sales reps stole
some training session tapes

387
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,332
out of my office,
and they were scared

388
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:01,166
that they were gonna leak them
to the press.

389
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,749
Well, Billy, thanks for
seeing us on such short notice.

390
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,666
Sure grateful to you.

391
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,541
That's--
that's all right.

392
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:11,916
I kind of knew
this day was coming.

393
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:16,791
I figured I'd have to account
for my sins eventually.

394
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:22,124
So, what would you like me
to do, testify or...

395
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,874
You didn't sign an NDA?

396
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:27,249
No, um, I couldn't.

397
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,666
I just couldn't keep
taking their money anymore,

398
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,666
so I didn't sign.

399
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,916
I can tell you
whatever you want to know.

400
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,667
What we want are
those videotapes.

401
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,667
Tapes?

402
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:50,124
I...
I don't have any tapes.

403
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,582
We think you do.

404
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,041
I'm sorry.
I don't.

405
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:56,208
Listen.

406
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,874
You know,
we all done things in our lives

407
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,916
that we aren't proud of.

408
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,999
But we make amends by trying

409
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,624
by trying to make the future
a better place for others.

410
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,457
And, hey,

411
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,874
you have
a real opportunity here.

412
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,499
You could help millions
of people

413
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,207
avoid the pain

414
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,583
brought to so many.

415
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,167
I did not take those tapes.

416
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,374
And if I did,

417
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,250
they were destroyed
a long time ago.

418
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,374
Unless you have a subpoena,

419
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,541
this interview's over.

420
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,166
And if you do,
we won't continue

421
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,083
without an attorney present.

422
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,416
This is my wife,
Kaitlyn.

423
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:01,792
We're at law school together.

424
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,749
Is it a boy or girl?

425
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,207
Boy.

426
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:12,916
Okay.
Well, good luck in law school.

427
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,957
What--what field
are you thinking of?

428
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,416
Consumer protection.

429
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,457
That's perfect.

430
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:23,999
You can protect the public
from people like yourself.

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,957
Y'all have a nice day.

432
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,417
We'll let ourselves out.

433
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,958
Sir.

434
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,416
Dr. Richard,

435
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,999
th-there's a petition
going around Virginia.

436
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,916
I thought
it was West Virginia.

437
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,207
No, it was Virginia.

438
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,999
Like there's a difference.

439
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,332
Exactly.

440
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,874
So I guess a nun
and a country doctor

441
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,416
formed a community coalition.

442
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:12,249
I'm sorry, a--a nun
and a country doc...

443
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,957
did they walk into a bar?

444
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,541
Richard, they collected
10,000 signatures

445
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:19,332
on a petition to recall OC,
pull it from the market,

446
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,457
and reformulate it
to make it safer.

447
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,832
And sent the petition
to the FDA,

448
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,375
where it has
not gone unnoticed.

449
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,207
Okay.

450
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:34,082
Go to West Virginia
and resolve the situation.

451
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,374
Um, how would you
like it resolved?

452
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:40,416
What did we spend in Florida?

453
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,291
A little over two million.

454
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:46,249
No, just take care of this.

455
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,042
Yes, sir.

456
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,874
Dr. Van Zee, Sister Beth.

457
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,541
How're you doing?
Howard Udell, Purdue Pharma.

458
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,749
Nice to meet you.
A real pleasure.

459
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,542
This is my wife, Sue Ella.

460
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,291
Thank you for meeting us.

461
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,499
It was a real surprise
to hear from you.

462
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,374
Of course,
we were very concerned

463
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,166
when we saw your petition.

464
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,624
Sister Beth, I've actually
known quite a few nuns.

465
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,749
I'm still good friends
with a Sister Julie, so...

466
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,541
That's wonderful
that you know other nuns.

467
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,416
It makes me feel
a closeness to you

468
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,750
I have never
before experienced.

469
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,916
Before we discuss
our petition,

470
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,707
we wanted you to hear
a personal story

471
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,499
from a parent who lost
their child to addiction,

472
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,124
so you could get
an understanding

473
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,957
of how your drug
has affected the community.

474
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,749
Hello.

475
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,999
My daughter Betsy was
a quiet, hardworking girl.

476
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,624
After she hurt
her back on her job,

477
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,874
she started taking OxyContin,
and within a year,

478
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:07,000
she was a liar, a thief,
and a heroin addict.

479
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:11,082
No matter what she did,
she couldn't stop.

480
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,499
And she tried.

481
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,374
When she died from an overdose,

482
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,416
there was a part of me
that was relieved

483
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,541
that she was finally
out of her pain.

484
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:26,333
But that pain lives in me now
and in her father.

485
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,750
OxyContin destroyed our family
like it has so many others.

486
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:40,249
And we hope you can find
a way to make it safer.

487
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,167
Thank you.

488
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,749
That's Betsy.
Yeah.

489
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,666
Thank you for this story.

490
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,124
And, um, we're so sorry
for your loss.

491
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,416
Our coalition
has gathered a petition

492
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,041
with 10,000 signatures

493
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:58,916
requesting you
reformulate OxyContin.

494
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:02,666
We know this is possible
because in 1983,

495
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,166
Sterling-Winthrop pulled
their painkiller Talwin

496
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,124
and added a narcotic blocker,

497
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,374
which immediately
reduced abuse.

498
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,332
Thank you, Dr. Van Zee.

499
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,999
We have carefully looked
into this,

500
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,124
and one of the reasons
we came down here was

501
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,416
to pay you the respect
of giving you a preview

502
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:25,749
of an open letter
to your community

503
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,082
that we are going to publish.

504
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:31,332
And I'd like to read it
for you now, if I may.

505
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,957
"Dear Lee County,
at Purdue Pharma,

506
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,082
"we are aware there has been
an issue in your community

507
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:40,124
"with drug diversion involving
our painkiller OxyContin.

508
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,249
"We take very seriously
these issues,

509
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,291
"and we want you to know
we have heard you.

510
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,957
"We understand
there is a request

511
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:51,332
"to reformulate the drug,

512
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,791
"but unfortunately,
at this time,

513
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,207
"it is not easy to do,

514
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,291
"and we do not plan
on taking that action.

515
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,124
Our main issue--"

516
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,417
You don't care.

517
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,957
You don't care
that it's killing people.

518
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,291
You know it's dangerous.

519
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:08,332
You just wanna make
as much money as possible.

520
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,249
That is absolutely untrue,
ma'am.

521
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,416
You've done more to hurt
the people of Appalachia

522
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,374
than the coal industry
ever thought about doing.

523
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah, ma'am,
I resent that accusation.

524
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,374
My family goes back here
for generations.

525
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,291
This whole meeting is
a setup, it's a setup!

526
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,082
Let's all calm down please.

527
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,207
Ma'am, I'm sorry to interrupt.
It is not a setup.

528
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,957
The main reason
we came here was

529
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,457
to make a donation
to your coalition,

530
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,583
which we know is
doing tremendous work.

531
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,416
What kind of donation?

532
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:39,457
Howard...

533
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,082
Purdue Pharma just wants
to help.

534
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:45,707
So in that spirit,
we'd like to donate $100,000

535
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,166
to your group as a gesture
of goodwill

536
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,332
to help the community.

537
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:55,957
That's--that's very generous.

538
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,249
We'll need to discuss it.

539
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,874
Of course.

540
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,749
The number of new patients

541
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,874
I could give free care
to would be significant.

542
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:11,624
That money would make
a huge difference around here.

543
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,791
If we can get something
out of these people,

544
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,166
I think we should.

545
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,249
One bad month, and you
could be shut down for good.

546
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,666
What do you think, Diane?

547
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,666
Well, I don't know much
about these matters,

548
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,832
but if it would
help people down here,

549
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,708
then I think it might be
a good idea to take it.

550
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:33,291
You might be right.

551
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,083
Sister Beth?

552
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,625
Well...

553
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:46,916
You know, I'm not
from this region originally,

554
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:49,041
but I have been living here
for over 30 years,

555
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:52,707
and I've seen
a lot of things.

556
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:56,957
I've seen coal executives
fly in for generations

557
00:32:56,958 --> 00:33:01,249
and use their money
to shut down unions

558
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,541
and manipulate this region
into lower labor costs.

559
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,457
That's just what
wealthy people do.

560
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,791
They take advantage
of the folks

561
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:14,958
that don't have money
to fight back.

562
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,250
That's what Purdue is doing
in this very moment.

563
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:29,082
So you wanna take their payoff

564
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,832
to shut us all up,

565
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,833
you go ahead.

566
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,707
But if you do that,
I will quit this coalition

567
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:43,416
right here and now because
I would rather burn in hell

568
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,375
than take a penny
of their blood money.

569
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,083
Hey, Karen?

570
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,916
You know what this is?
There's no return address.

571
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,457
No, but it was marked urgent,

572
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,000
so I just left it on your desk.

573
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:16,124
Do you think it's dangerous?

574
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,541
I don't hear ticking.

575
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:18,791
Stop it.

576
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:19,999
What's going on?

577
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,667
Somebody sent Rick a bomb.

578
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:27,500
Well, we only got a thousand
potential suspects, so...

579
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,250
What is it?

580
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,124
Purdue Pharma training tapes.

581
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:43,707
I'll be.

582
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,792
Looks like
Billy found his soul.

583
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,332
Emphasize
the time release coding.

584
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,957
It makes our drug
less addictive,

585
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,457
less prone to abuse.

586
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,291
It makes it almost impossible

587
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,416
to extract oxycodone
from the drug

588
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,332
in order to snort or inject.

589
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,624
If the--

590
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,249
There's hours
of tape just like this

591
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,916
showing Purdue sales reps being
trained to lie, manipulate,

592
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,999
and aggressively sell
addictive narcotics

593
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,249
as nonaddictive.

594
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,999
It is absolutely outrageous.

595
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,957
And we now have an open-
and-shut case of misbranding,

596
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,707
mail fraud, wire fraud,

597
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:24,041
and because the company
profited from illegal activity,

598
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:26,374
we've got money laundering
as well.

599
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,374
We need to discuss this
with our client.

600
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,208
Of course.

601
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:42,791
I think we can get at least
100 million out of 'em.

602
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:43,916
I think so, too.

603
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,374
What does Main Justice say?

604
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:49,207
Any new indications
on individual indictments?

605
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,707
No, not yet.

606
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,749
But, you know,
the quiet tells me

607
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,999
that we've got 'em thinking.

608
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,207
Now you really gotta hit 'em
in the gut

609
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,707
with your prosecution memo.

610
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:02,957
Lay it all out for Main Justice
so that when they read it,

611
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:06,457
they know they've got no choice
but to indict these guys.

612
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,957
Yes, sir.

613
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:11,291
Proposed indictment
of Purdue Pharma,

614
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,457
Michael Friedman,
Howard R. Udell,

615
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:17,041
and Paul D. Goldenheim.

616
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,166
Perhaps no case
in our history rivals

617
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,166
the burden placed
on public health and safety

618
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,416
as that in the Western
District of Virginia.

619
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,832
It is our recommendation
to charge the defendants

620
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,957
with conspiracy,

621
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,916
mail fraud, wire fraud,

622
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:36,166
interstate distribution
of misbranded drug

623
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,707
with intent to defraud,

624
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,582
conspiracy to commit
money laundering,

625
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,708
and money laundering.

626
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,999
OxyContin abuse has
significantly impacted

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,624
the lives of millions
of Americans.

628
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,499
And the fraudulent scheme
and conduct articulated

629
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,374
in this matter has
a direct correlation

630
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,499
to the health of this region

631
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,792
and to the entire nation
as a whole.

632
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:13,833
Hello, Father.

633
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,916
Well, I see you've decided

634
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,625
to ruin
a perfectly good evening.

635
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,124
Good to see you too, Richard.

636
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,541
Let me guess.

637
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,957
Mortimer's kids
want more disbursements?

638
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,707
I've asked Stephen to join us

639
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,791
because we have
a very serious issue.

640
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:38,124
This is John Brownlee,

641
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,082
U.S. Attorney for the Western
District of Virginia.

642
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,207
I've taken care
of West Virginia.

643
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:47,041
Brownlee is the U.S. attorney
that covers Appalachia.

644
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:48,791
That's the region
where that nun

645
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,166
and that country doctor
rejected your offer.

646
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,707
I said, it's taken care of.

647
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,666
The FDA isn't going to respond
to their petition.

648
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,207
But this problem goes deeper
than a petition.

649
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,791
John Brownlee is former army,

650
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:03,124
spent four years
in the infantry,

651
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,291
left the military
to go to law school

652
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,374
with the intention
to be a prosecutor.

653
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:11,082
His father is currently
the secretary of the army.

654
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,374
Now, I'm telling you this
because he has opened

655
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,375
a secret grand jury
into Purdue Pharma.

656
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,832
Since when?

657
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,541
We think maybe four
or five months ago,

658
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,749
but we're not exactly sure.

659
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,082
Call the governor
or a senator.

660
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:30,082
They have no authority
over a U.S. attorney.

661
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,374
Now, these are
the assistant U.S. attorneys

662
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,957
running the case,

663
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:37,707
Rick Mountcastle
and Randy Ramseyer.

664
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:40,332
Both men are top prosecutors

665
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:43,166
and are driven
by a strong sense of justice.

666
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,832
Ramseyer--he referees
local high school sports

667
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,999
and has a deep connection
to the region.

668
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,791
Mountcastle used
to prosecute mobsters

669
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,624
and converted to Christianity
at the age of 40.

670
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,041
Why are you
telling me all this?

671
00:38:57,042 --> 00:39:00,666
So that you understand
they cannot be bought.

672
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,374
They cannot be
pushed off the case.

673
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,416
They will not be seeking
our employment

674
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:09,041
when they leave office like
the U.S. attorney in Maine.

675
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,749
And it is very likely

676
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,957
that they will soon subpoena
Purdue's internal documents

677
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,874
to make a major case
against us.

678
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,957
The damage
a U.S. attorney can do

679
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:22,374
for a company like us
is staggering.

680
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,041
They can fine us to death.

681
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,416
And they can bring
criminal charges

682
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:29,874
against individuals.

683
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,666
You think that's possible?

684
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,457
It's not possible.
It's likely.

685
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,666
These people
in Appalachia are very angry,

686
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,291
and now their U.S. attorney
is coming for us.

687
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:42,082
We're gonna hire
Rudy Giuliani,

688
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,332
and he'll be able
to lobby high up

689
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,957
in the chain
of the Justice Department

690
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,582
and the White House,

691
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,374
but eventually there will
be a price to pay.

692
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,416
From this point on,

693
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:55,707
you need
to do everything you can

694
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,624
to reduce personal liability.

695
00:39:58,625 --> 00:39:59,916
It's very possible

696
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,291
people are going to prison,

697
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:04,458
and I don't want that
to be you.

698
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,875
Elizabeth Ann?

699
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,374
Hello?

700
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,624
This is Sally Washington

701
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,625
from the Virginia
Health Department

702
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,291
returning for Samuel Finnix.

703
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,666
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for calling me.

704
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,707
Listen, I will--I--

705
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,374
Fuck off, I know
you fucking took it from me!

706
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,749
Excuse me?
What was that?

707
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,124
Sorry, I was calling

708
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,749
about the, MAT clinics
in Virginia.

709
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,249
What about them?

710
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,416
Well, I've seen people have
really good results

711
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,124
with Suboxone and methadone,

712
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:08,207
and seems to me the problem is
that there are so few clinics

713
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:11,166
that people just can't
get access to the drugs.

714
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,749
I understand the problem,

715
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,249
but people don't want
treatments centers

716
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,707
in their community.

717
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,124
It's just
a political nonstarter,

718
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,666
I'm sorry to say.

719
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,041
Yeah, I understand.

720
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,791
Well, okay.

721
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:26,708
Well, thanks for your time.

722
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,124
Hey, Elizabeth Ann!

723
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,250
Hey, wake up!

724
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:37,707
Hey!

725
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,999
What are you doing?

726
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,374
I brought you coffee.

727
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:45,374
Thanks.

728
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,541
Come on.

729
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:51,125
I gotta get you
out of this place.

730
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,499
Did you work in the mines?

731
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,374
Yes, I did.

732
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,500
I was in that protest.

733
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,999
You are doing very well.

734
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,625
No relapses or craving
for opiates.

735
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:05,792
If you want, we can try
and taper you down.

736
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,666
You think one day I can
just be completely off it?

737
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:15,832
Like I said, it can be hard

738
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:18,291
to get off the medication
permanently,

739
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:20,499
but some do.

740
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,292
We won't know until we try.

741
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,542
So what do you think, Sam?

742
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:33,250
I just really wanna be
a doctor again.

743
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,707
What's up?
No good.

744
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,207
Fraud unit agreed
with your prosecution memo,

745
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:46,374
but unfortunately, it didn't
sway the criminal division.

746
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,957
Shit.

747
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,624
Look,
the career guys are with you,

748
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,457
but I think you'll
ultimately get blocked

749
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,124
by the political appointees.

750
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,124
This is so fucked.

751
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:58,416
I know, but there
may be a compromise here.

752
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,832
Purdue's hinting
they'd go for misdemeanors

753
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,499
against the execs.

754
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,999
Misdemeanors.

755
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,832
And the company
will plead guilty to felonies

756
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,624
and pay a substantial fine.

757
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,416
You'd end up with a big win.

758
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,832
Those executives belong
in jail.

759
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,542
But what happens if
you indict and lose in court?

760
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:19,374
I get nothing.

761
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:22,041
There's a lot
of risk with indicting.

762
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:24,582
Personally, I think you should
take the misdemeanors

763
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,417
before Main Justice
shuts it all down.

764
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:54,042
Randy.

765
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,374
Sir.

766
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,542
We would have been happy
to have come out to Roanoke.

767
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,332
It's a hell of a case.

768
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,666
A couple of AUSAs
in a strip mall

769
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:19,124
taking on one of the wealthiest
families in the country.

770
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,582
Did the memo get Main Justice

771
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,291
over the finish line
on felony charges?

772
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:26,374
I don't think it did.

773
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:30,582
But there's also a chance we go
to court and lose everything.

774
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:32,207
That's why I made a deal.

775
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,332
It's finished then.

776
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,833
It is.
All right, have a seat.

777
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,999
So the three executives
will plead to misdemeanors.

778
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,791
Significant consequences, and
there's three years' probation.

779
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,207
It's 400 hours of community
service, and their careers

780
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,499
in pharmaceuticals
are effectively over.

781
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,666
Misdemeanors.

782
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,374
But without felonies,
we got no shot

783
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,332
at any of them ever flipping
on the Sacklers.

784
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,624
Yeah,
but at the end of the day,

785
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,124
we're not sure
they would have.

786
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,624
Right.

787
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:58,999
And look,
I'll be honest with you guys.

788
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,332
I...

789
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,624
I think that this is about
as far as Main Justice

790
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:05,124
was going to let us go.

791
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,582
I'm sorry, sir.

792
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:10,082
I tried to build the case
in a way that Main Justice

793
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,582
couldn't just brush it
under the rug.

794
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,207
No, don't apologize.
You did an incredible job.

795
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,624
All right,
we got a hell of a lot here,

796
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,499
but the company is going to
plead guilty to misbranding.

797
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,957
We're also gonna have
a public sentencing

798
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,249
of the executives,

799
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,082
so we can shame the ever-living
shit out of them,

800
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,249
create a lot of negative media
attention around OxyContin.

801
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,332
Now, on the financial
settlement with Purdue,

802
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,207
they came at me again
with 10 million,

803
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,499
and I countered
with 600 million

804
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,916
and told them
I wouldn't budge.

805
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,957
So where'd you land?

806
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,208
600 million.

807
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,499
Congratulations, guys.
It's--

808
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,374
it's one of the highest
settlements ever paid

809
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,624
by a pharmaceutical company
in the history of the country.

810
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:53,041
Look, it's not everything
we wanted, but it's a big win.

811
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:54,624
Congratulations, sir.

812
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,708
Well done.
Randy, congrats.

813
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,124
Have a seat.

814
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:06,249
I know that sometimes
I have a bad habit

815
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,124
of ignoring people's feelings.

816
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:13,124
I've always been an outsider
in this family.

817
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,166
And my...

818
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,291
my personal life
took a--a path

819
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,666
I--I didn't expect.

820
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,457
I held a great deal
of resentment

821
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:26,416
that I unfairly took out
on the people around me,

822
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:28,999
pressures
of launching the drug.

823
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,666
But now that
it's doing so well,

824
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,207
it's time I--I focus
on my family

825
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:38,249
and--and mend
some of those fences.

826
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,291
I, think that's
a great idea.

827
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,416
I do as well.

828
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:45,916
So I'm going to step down
as president,

829
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:48,374
and I couldn't think
of a better person

830
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:51,167
to take over than you.

831
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,374
Are you serious, sir?

832
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,749
Very serious.

833
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,582
As you know, what's
most important to the board

834
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:05,166
is your loyalty to the family.

835
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,832
Of course, of course.

836
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:10,250
And, um,
you shall have it, sir.

837
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,582
Congratulations.

838
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,791
You're the new president
of Purdue Pharma.

839
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,917
Thank you, sir.

840
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,500
Hey, whoa!
No splashing.

841
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:33,082
Yeah?

842
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,291
I have the chief of staff

843
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:36,207
to the deputy
attorney general.

844
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:37,874
Okay.

845
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,041
Hey, John.
Sorry to call so late.

846
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,916
No, that's fine, Mr. Elston.

847
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,874
Mike, call me Mike.

848
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,707
Okay, Mike.

849
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,499
Look, I know
you're supposed to sign

850
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,957
the deal tomorrow with Purdue,
but Mary Jo White called.

851
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,791
Howard Udell's attorney.

852
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,957
Correct,
and she'd like to delay

853
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,666
finalizing the plea agreement.

854
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,374
She wants more time
to discuss it.

855
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,791
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

856
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,332
The time
for discussion is over.

857
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,707
I have a deal.

858
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,332
It's not signed yet.

859
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,249
No reason why you can't keep
talking with her.

860
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,166
Sorry,
is this request from you

861
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,832
or from the deputy
attorney general?

862
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:19,042
It's not coming from
the deputy attorney general.

863
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,166
Then you can go
fuck yourself.

864
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:26,667
Purdue signs tomorrow,
or we go to court.

865
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,874
I've been getting a lot
of tips on other pharma cases.

866
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,916
I'm thinking maybe we ought
to find another Purdue

867
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,207
to go after.

868
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:43,916
What's the point?

869
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,499
To get the bad guys again.

870
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,832
Did we get 'em?

871
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,124
Purdue's just gonna
keep on selling.

872
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:53,041
The field's just so compromised
with the government.

873
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:57,082
Well, gentlemen,
here you have it,

874
00:49:57,083 --> 00:50:00,957
a signed guilty plea deal
from your friends and neighbors

875
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:02,875
at Purdue Pharma.

876
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,832
What were they like
when they signed?

877
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,499
Quiet, solemn.

878
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,291
How brave.

879
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,582
I still can't believe
Main Justice tried

880
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,999
to shut it down
the last second.

881
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,249
I can.

882
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,749
Thank you for pushing back.

883
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,791
I mean, I had to.

884
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:28,041
Needed to stop, or who knows
what could've happened?

885
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,457
Um, sir, can I speak to you?

886
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,582
There's an urgent issue.

887
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:32,999
Go ahead.

888
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,666
You can tell me
in front of these guys.

889
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,082
Okay.

890
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,957
A memo leaked from
the attorney general's office

891
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:40,624
of a list of U.S. attorneys
to be fired.

892
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:43,125
There's gonna be a wave
of firings.

893
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,499
Am I on the list?

894
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,333
I'm afraid so, sir, yes.

895
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,583
I'm sorry, sir.

896
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,374
Reject the plea!
Reject the plea!

897
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,832
Reject the plea!

898
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,207
We are live
at the Abingdon courthouse

899
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,707
for the sentencing hearing

900
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:17,124
of three Purdue pharma
executives for their role

901
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:20,041
in criminally misbranding
their drug OxyContin.

902
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,082
Now, there are a number
of protesters here

903
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,041
who want the plea deal
rejected,

904
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:26,416
enraged none of the executives
would go to prison.

905
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,291
Reject the plea!
Reject the plea!

906
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:31,667
Reject the plea!

907
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,999
Do you feel your
placement on the U.S. Attorney

908
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,291
firing list is because of
your involvement on this case?

909
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:47,332
You know, I don't know.

910
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,333
I don't know why
I was on the list.

911
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,541
Do you feel vindicated

912
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,124
since you weren't
ultimately fired?

913
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,166
Well, today--
today is not about me.

914
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,041
It's about the people here

915
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:57,832
and having their voices
be heard.

916
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,541
My grandson Brian is here

917
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:02,457
in the courtroom
with me today.

918
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:06,124
He lost his mother
to your horrible drug

919
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:09,582
when he was only six years old.

920
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,082
And I wanted him here

921
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,749
so he could see
that bad things do happen

922
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,249
to bad people.

923
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,249
You are sheer evil.

924
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:23,832
The first time that
I heard the word OxyContin,

925
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,124
my 18-year-old honor student
son was dead from it

926
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:28,708
after taking it at a party.

927
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:33,957
You are nothing more
than corporate drug lords.

928
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,499
You have killed

929
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,749
and continue to kill
our future of tomorrow.

930
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,916
And you killed my son
and so many others.

931
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:41,999
I know you don't care

932
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,332
about what happened
to our children.

933
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:48,416
But what if it was your son
or daughter

934
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:51,832
you saw in the morgue?

935
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,374
Would you care then?

936
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,457
On May 1st,
the year 2003,

937
00:52:56,458 --> 00:53:00,041
my husband and I
lost our only son,

938
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:02,499
an 18-year-old son
named Randall,

939
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,749
to an accidental overdose
of OxyContin.

940
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,832
Right before this happened,

941
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:11,916
he was getting ready
to go to college.

942
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:15,457
We ended up using
his prepaid college

943
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,417
to pay for his funeral.

944
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,542
These are his ashes.

945
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:49,292
This is from your drug.

946
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,958
This is what you did to him.

947
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:07,208
Now he's here in the courtroom.

948
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:17,582
Reject the plea deal!

949
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,624
Money means nothing to them!

950
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:23,041
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

951
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:25,999
Reject the plea.

952
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,249
Reject the plea.

953
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,499
Reject the plea!

954
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,874
Order,
order in the court!

955
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,042
Order, order!

956
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:41,624
The lack of incarceration
in this case, to me,

957
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,499
is the most difficult aspect
of the plea agreements.

958
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,916
And I must confess
it bothers me.

959
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:53,958
And I have studied this case
for many months.

960
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,749
However, I have concluded

961
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,375
that the plea agreements
should be accepted.

962
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:05,332
While I understand this may
not be a popular decision,

963
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:08,666
it is my job to follow the law.

964
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,666
We're adjourned.

965
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,207
The first thing
you tell your doctors

966
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:19,416
is that the settlement
was grossly unfair.

967
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,249
These execs didn't have
anything to do

968
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,582
with what they were
charged with.

969
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:26,374
It was a few bad apples
we fired years ago.

970
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:30,124
What's most important is,
you keep selling aggressively

971
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,332
as possible.

972
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,749
This isn't a time for caution.

973
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,999
I'm going to fly
down there next week.

974
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,916
I will personally visit
doctors with you.

975
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:42,041
You need to push higher doses
for longer periods of time.

976
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:46,082
You have to get these doctors
to keep prescribing.

977
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,917
Sell, sell, sell.

978
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,791
Well, thank you very much.

979
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:57,167
We're going to look into that.
I appreciate it, buh-bye.

980
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,292
Hey, so...

981
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,124
You okay, boss?

982
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,791
What's up?

983
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:12,499
Well, I know you're not
gonna be over the Moon

984
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,666
at the prospect
of another pharma case,

985
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:17,582
but I just got some interesting
intel on Abbott Labs.

986
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,166
They got a drug
called Depakote.

987
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,041
It's an antiepileptic
medication,

988
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,541
and supposedly they have been
targeting nursing homes.

989
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:25,916
Why don't you give it
to the Eastern District?

990
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,797
We don't need to go down
that rabbit hole again.

991
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,416
You think maybe you ought
to take a couple of weeks off?

992
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:44,582
You know, recharge a bit.

993
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,833
Randy, I'm okay.

994
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You guys have a visitor.

995
00:56:56,042 --> 00:56:58,041
I brought sparkling cider.

996
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:00,041
I remembered you guys were
a couple pussies

997
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,916
that don't drink.

998
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:05,457
I know you were hoping
to never see me again,

999
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:09,249
but I really wanted
to toast to you guys

1000
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,874
for staying the course.

1001
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,374
Nothing's gonna change.

1002
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:15,166
They'll just keep selling
as hard as they can.

1003
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:19,666
Yes,
but you dealt the first blow,

1004
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,916
and now there's convictions

1005
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:25,624
and a legal record
of their crimes.

1006
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,666
It's an important achievement

1007
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:30,707
that people will be able to use
to build future cases on.

1008
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,666
I worked in D.C. for years,

1009
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:36,041
and I always knew
it could go down this way,

1010
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:40,832
but given the facts--
I don't know, I had to try.

1011
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,957
Cheers to that.

1012
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:46,249
Here's to the ones
who fight the battles,

1013
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,582
even if they don't win the war.

1014
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:51,083
Okay.
Hear, hear.

1015
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,125
So what are you guys
up to next?

1016
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:09,250
We have another pharma case
we're looking into.

1017
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,249
I... I really can't

1018
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,166
thank you enough
for bringing this case.

1019
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,792
I mean it.

1020
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:28,416
I don't know
if I'd ever sleep

1021
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,833
if the Sacklers
hadn't been publicly exposed.

1022
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:38,291
And they will someday go down.

1023
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:42,332
I know this in my heart.

1024
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:45,417
I don't know.

1025
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:51,916
400,000 deaths!
400,000 deaths!

1026
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:53,624
Under pressure from protests

1027
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,166
led by artist Nan Goldin,

1028
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:58,624
major museums are refusing
to accept future donations

1029
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,291
from the Sackler family.

1030
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,749
Louvre Museum in Paris

1031
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,332
has become
the first major institution

1032
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,582
to remove the Sackler
family name from plaques.

1033
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,416
I lost my sister
in this epidemic, and--

1034
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,916
so this is like
a really great win for us.

1035
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:13,874
Members
of the Sackler family

1036
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,249
are moving out
of New York City

1037
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,707
after being publicly shamed

1038
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:20,041
as a family that originated
the opioid crisis.

1039
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:22,624
This morning,
my office filed a lawsuit

1040
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:26,041
in Massachusetts State Court
against Purdue Pharma...

1041
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,416
For fueling
the nation's opioid epidemic...

1042
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:30,916
By knowingly deceiving
doctors and the public.

1043
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,791
Attorney generals
in over 25 states

1044
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:36,374
have brought class action
suits against Purdue Pharma.

1045
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:39,332
David Sackler
and Dr. Kathe Sackler

1046
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:42,582
recently went public to
defend the family's actions,

1047
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:45,874
testifying remotely
at a Congressional hearing.

1048
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:49,416
You knew
that it was too potent,

1049
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,624
and you did nothing
about it as a family.

1050
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,624
You have created
a nationwide epidemic.

1051
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:56,291
You and your family are
addicted to money.

1052
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,749
I'm not sure that
I'm aware of any family

1053
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,916
in America
that's more evil than yours.

1054
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:04,332
There is nothing
that I can find

1055
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:07,207
that I would have
done differently.

1056
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,332
Late today,
a federal bankruptcy judge

1057
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,541
gave conditional approval
to a multi-billion dollar plan

1058
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,957
to settle lawsuits
against Purdue Pharma.

1059
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,332
The Sackler family
will forfeit ownership

1060
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,749
of Purdue Pharma,

1061
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,416
turn over 30 million
documents,

1062
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,791
and pay $4.5 billion.

1063
01:00:22,792 --> 01:00:25,332
In return,
the Sacklers cannot be sued.

1064
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,707
This process was stacked
from beginning.

1065
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,291
They knew that
the Sacklers were betting

1066
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:33,624
on a broken bankruptcy system
that would allow them

1067
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:35,457
to use the bankruptcy
of the company

1068
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,624
of Purdue Pharma
to shield themselves.

1069
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:40,666
Let's be clear,
the Sacklers are not bankrupt.

1070
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:41,957
As far as I can tell,

1071
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,332
no Sackler will have
to sell a boat,

1072
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,666
or a house, or a piece of art.

1073
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,999
Dr. Finnix.
Yeah.

1074
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,416
I need you
to sign these prescriptions

1075
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,457
for Suboxone.

1076
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:52,749
Yes, ma'am.

1077
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,832
And you've got group
in ten minutes.

1078
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,916
All right.

1079
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,332
After group,

1080
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,916
you've got individual patients
until 6:00 p.m.,

1081
01:00:58,917 --> 01:01:01,957
and then you have to attend
that fundraiser at 8:00 p.m.

1082
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,207
I hate those.

1083
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,874
I hate asking people
for money.

1084
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,624
You want to keep
the lights on, don't you?

1085
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:10,166
Yeah, you're right.
You're always right.

1086
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:14,166
You know, what's so important
about these group sessions is

1087
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:16,416
the chance to connect.

1088
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:19,582
Addiction does
the exact opposite

1089
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:21,707
of what connection does, right?

1090
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,499
Addiction tears apart.

1091
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,624
It tears apart friendships.
It tears apart marriages.

1092
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:33,832
It'll tear apart a family,
tear apart a whole community.

1093
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:39,124
Part of the reason
we relapse is

1094
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,042
because of pain.

1095
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:47,082
There's some kind of pain
that's in a lot of us,

1096
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,916
or all of us,

1097
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:53,707
we just don't want
to feel anymore.

1098
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:58,541
And further we fall
into addiction,

1099
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:04,916
pain says to us, hell,

1100
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:08,167
we'd better off
just feeling nothing at all.

1101
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:14,499
So we go numb.

1102
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,249
And our souls go numb.

1103
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:22,416
Now we've got a real problem.

1104
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:26,624
You know, pain is just pain.

1105
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,457
Not good, not bad,

1106
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:33,207
just part
of being a human being.

1107
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,957
And sometimes,
good can come out of it.

1108
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,791
And if we're brave enough

1109
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:42,041
and willing
to go a little deeper,

1110
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:46,332
work our way through it,

1111
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:49,749
and try to overcome it,

1112
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,082
well,

1113
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,208
we just might
find our better selves.
