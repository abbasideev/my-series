Your story shows

00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,291
that the highest levels
of the company

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:07,499
knew exactly how dangerous
the drug was.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,874
Okay, I'll testify.

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,791
Please, I just need some Oxy.

No! No, Dad, please!

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,957
Destroyed our damn family!

10
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,708
- Please, Dad!
- Get your hands off of me!

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,457
A shares have a majority

12
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,791
and Richard Sackler
is now named

13

president of Purdue Pharma.

14
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:32,041
- Dr. Finnix, is this yours?
- You're under arrest.

15
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,499
How long you here for?

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,582
90 days.

17
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,874
You think you can
get me some pills?

18
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,957
- What's your next move?
- Go back to the FDA

19
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,874
to make another set of demands

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,207
to restrict access
to this drug.

21
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,416
Can you think about
how what you're doing

22
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:47,041
might be affecting me?

23
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,417
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,207
This is how I grew up, Lucas.

25
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,541
Watching my friends
die from drugs.

26
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,999
If you continue on this path,

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,250
you're going to end up
just like them.

I am here today because
rampant drug abuse

00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,250
has infiltrated

Sorry to disturb you at lunch,

An 80 mg tablet of OxyContin

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,332
sells on the street for $100.

39
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:26,041
This diversion has created a
domino effect of related crime.

40
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,832
As U.S. Attorney,
I will be sending letters

41
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,416
to doctors across our state

42
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,207
to alert them to
the grave dangers of OxyContin.

00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,499
Any questions?

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,082
It says that OxyContin

45
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,874
is becoming the most
serious criminal problem--

46
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,875
Yes, I know how to read.

47
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,707
How many of these letters
were sent?

48
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,624
He sent one
to every single doctor

49
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,625
in the entire state of Maine.

50
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,207
I remember the day

51
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,707
that I first decided
to get clean.

52
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:05,041
Me and my buddy Josh, we had
this drug test coming up, um,

53
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,624
which is not great news
for two addicts, you know.

54
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,707
So we ran to our dealer
and we're like,

55
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,707
"Hey, man,
you know, what can we do?"

56
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,541
And he tells us,

57
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,457
"If you drink bleach
on the day of your test,

58
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,207
it cleans your blood."

59
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,707
So, the day of the test
comes around,

60
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,166
and we're in the back
of the car,

61
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,416
and we got this industrial
strength container of bleach,

62
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,207
and we drink.

63
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,374
Except the bleach fucking
burns like hell going down,

64
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:37,041
so immediately I'm gagging,
You know, I spit it everywhere.

65
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:42,833
But Josh, man--fucking Josh,
he--he downs it.

66
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,541
Uh, the day Josh died

67
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,999
is the day I knew
I needed to get clean.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,750
Uh, a year ago today, actually.

69
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,791
Um, I've been to rehab
three times now, but,

70
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,666
God, I finally feel like

71
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,374
it's starting to make sense,
you know?

72
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,125
My third time was when it
really started to make sense.

73
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,291
- Thanks, Dirk.
- It takes a lot of guts

74
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,041
to admit that your life
has become unmanageable.

75
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,166
And we got your back.

76
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,167
Thank you.

77
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,374

78
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,082
It's your turn.

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,041
Would you like to share
anything today?

80
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,832
Oh, uh,

81
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,833
no, no.

82
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,082
Maybe tomorrow.

83
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,207
Yeah.

- Hey.
- Hey, man. What's up?

87
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,999
I was thinking
about what y'all

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,416
were talking about out there.

89
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:08,457
H--how many times
have y'all been to rehab?

90
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,582
This is my, uh, fourth time.

91
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,874
Fifth for me.

92
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,541
- All of it here?
- Same place?

93
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,207
Nah, I've been
to three other centers.

94
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,499
I like this one the best.

95
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, me too.

96
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:25,082
I'm just--I'm just worried,
you know?

97
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,666
Worried maybe it doesn't work.

98
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,041
Hey, Samuel, this place
was amazing for my cousin.

99
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,874
He hasn't had a drink
in nine years.

100
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,000
Look, man, it's either here,
jail, or the morgue.

101
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,124
Yeah.

102
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,917
Paul:
I feel ignored sometimes.

103
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,791
It's, uh, not easy

104
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,457
being with someone who's never

105
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,832
really present with you.

106
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,791
I feel bad. I--

107
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,791
it's just--it's hard for me to

108
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,582
talk about things
that are not work-related.

109
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,791
Yeah, she's obsessed
with work.

110
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,249
- I'm not obsessed with work.
- You are.

111
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,124
I'm just trying to prevent
mass deaths from occurring

112
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,416
- across the country.
- I can't really compete with

113
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,666
mass deaths
across the country.

114
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,832
I'm not asking you
to compete with that.

115
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,916
I'm just asking you
to understand that

116
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,750
I can't just turn that off.

117
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,667
But you may be causing
the death of your marriage.

118
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,083
Do you see
Paul's point of view?

119
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,875
I don't want that. I--

120
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,624
I'm really trying.

121
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,374
- I'm right here.
- I'm right here.

122
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,000
- I want this to work out.
- I do too.

123
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,542
Hello, everyone.

124
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,749
I truly appreciate you all
meeting with me again.

125
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,332
I, um,

126
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,624
I know our last interaction
was less than ideal.

127
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,707
But my therapist says

128
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,332
it's never too late
to apologize.

129
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,542
Well, sounds like you have
a terrific therapist.

130
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,166
So I have brought
numerous articles

131
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:14,916
from major publications
about the dangers of OxyContin

132
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:18,333
that has put Purdue
on the defensive.

133
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,249
Public pressure is building.

134
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,541
I have also seen several
articles about DEA overreach.

135
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,082
Yeah, well, those stories
were planted by Purdue.

136
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,749
Deputy Director Meyer,

137
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,707
are you aware that
there are millions of people

138
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,833
who swear by this medication?

139
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:42,541
There are just as many lives
that are being destroyed by it.

140
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,791
And I'm not just talking
about the ones who have died,

141
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,999
but the lives that they touch.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,499
Their friends, their family.

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,541
Communities are being ravaged
by crime over this drug.

144
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:57,332
Marriages and friendships
have ended

145
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,374
because of a pill
that, in some instances,

146
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,625
neither person
has ever even taken.

147
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,166
The FDA's position
on OxyContin

148
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,707
is that it is safe
when used as directed.

149
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,916
But we would take action
against it

150
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:18,832
if the drug was shown to be
unsafe when used as prescribed.

151
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,416
But determining the safety
of the drug is the FDA's job.

152
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,957
And we have already
carried out our job

153
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,666
- during the approval process.
- Well, what if you were wrong?

154
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,541
- Bridget.
- It's possible.

155
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,874
The FDA would admit
we were wrong,

156
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,875
if that was proven
to be the case.

157
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,791
So if I were to prove
that OxyContin is dangerous

158
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,374
when taken as prescribed,
then the FDA would act?

159
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,624
Absolutely. We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

160
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,957
But we need proof that
the drug itself is defective

161
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,124
if we are going
to take a drastic

162
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,624
and restrictive action
against any drug,

163
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:57,707
especially one that millions of
people have come to rely upon.

164
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,374
How many are dying?
Who is dying?

165
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,332
And how are they dying?

166
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,666
This is what I want to know.

167
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,374
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you asking for?

168
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,082
I want you to pull together
all the data we have

169
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,207
on overdose deaths
from OxyContin,

170
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,457
and I want them organized
by state and region.

171
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,374
The DEA doesn't have
data on overdoses.

172
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,291
- What do you mean--you don't?
- No.

173
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,874
That information
would be spread out

174
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,082
across the country,
state-by-state,

175
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,707
or even county-by-county,
patchwork of isolated reports.

176
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,332
It would be incredibly
difficult to gather it all.

177
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,332
Well, I'm a very
difficult woman.

178
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,999
Let's do it.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,374
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

180
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,999
I want to do
an exhaustive study

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,416
on OxyContin overdose deaths,
and this is key--

182
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,582
I want to know
how many of those deaths

183
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,707
are coming from people
who are taking the drug

184
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,916
exactly as prescribed.

185
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:51,374
Is that something you can
ascertain from the autopsy?

186
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,374
Potentially, yes, but,

187
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,291
just to be clear,
so you understand

188
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,124
- exactly what you're asking for.
- Okay.

189
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,249
We're going to
have to go through

190
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,124
thousands of autopsies
individually,

191
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,707
match autopsies
with police reports,

192
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,749
and dig through
handwritten notes.

193
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,916
It will take
quite a bit of time.

194
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,833
I don't care
how much time it takes.

195
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,375
Morning, Rick.

196
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,541
Happy anniversary.

197
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,291
We opened the case
three years ago.

198
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,166
I was gonna get you
rhubarb pie,

199
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,707
but the bakery was out.

200
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,082
Feels like
a long three years.

201
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,541
Still haven't even begun
to nail a top executive.

202
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,124
Come on, man.

203
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,207
We were so close
to a whistleblower.

204
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,874
And we're gonna
find another one.

205
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,832
We're solid on misbranding.

206
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,332
We can show the 1% claim
was fraudulent.

207
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,082
So, I mean,
there's a lot here for a jury.

208
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,249
I'm not worried about a jury.

209
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,624
I'm--I'm worried
about Main Justice,

210
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,707
because you know
who's gonna go out and lobby

211
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,999
everyone he knows there,
and I just don't want

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,624
this case to get
brushed under the rug.

213
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,707
But if we start charging
individuals with felonies,

214
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,666
we need the kill shot.

215
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,457
What was the name of that
U.S. Attorney up in Maine?

216
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,999
Jay McCloskey?

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,666
Did he dig
into Purdue at all?

218
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,749
I think he had
a few meetings with them,

219
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,624
but nothing significant
came from it.

220
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,791
I'll reach out to him.

221
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:17,624
I think
he's in private practice now.

222
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,916
We should look
into the doctors again.

223
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,957
See if we missed something.

224
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,666
- Like what?
- Some sort of kickback scheme.

225
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:28,457
Or maybe an illegal promotion
that we can tie back

226
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,832
to upper management.

227
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,457
If we circle back
to the doctors,

228
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,666
we should start with the ones

229
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,874
that we busted
for over-prescription.

230
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,041
Maybe after a few years
sitting in jail,

231
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,832
they'd be willing
to tell us more.

232
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,041
Oh, yeah.

233
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,249
And I'll reach out
to Jay McCloskey.

234
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,582
Sounds good.

235
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,583
I'm gonna get to it.

236
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,375
Hey.

237
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,207
Happy anniversary.

238
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,500
You said it.

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,666
Tonight, we celebrate
OxyContin

240
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,999
passing $1 billion
a year in sales!

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,416
Yeah!

242
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,458
Two years ahead of schedule.

243
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,207
Everyone at HQ
sends their best wishes,

244
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,582
and they want you all to know
that there's no way

245
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,374
they could have done this
without you.

246
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,999
That's right.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,624
Hey, we have a hot line
to the cab company tonight,

248
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,832
in case, you know,
you slip yourself an OxyContin.

249
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
So let's get this party

250
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,875
started, all right? DJ!

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,874
Yeah!

252
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,457
It's about that time
to make way

253
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,291
on the dance floor right now.

254
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,916

So when I show up
for the first time,

264
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,166
it's 10:00 in the morning,

265
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,791
and there's literally--
it's like a tailgate party.

266
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,166
- Are you serious?
- I shit you not.

267
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,874
They're drinking beers
in the parking lot

268
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
- with a line out the door.
- Shit.

269
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,749
It's wild. I literally work
one day a month.

270
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,457
You're a fucking asshole.

271
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,832
Working one day a month.

272
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,707
Did you say something,
buddy?

273
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,374
- Who's this guy?
- Oh, me?

274
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,082
- Yeah.
- Oh, I said, um,

275
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,082
I said you're
a fucking asshole.

276
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,749
- Did you not hear?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

277
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,166
Man, calm down.
This fool's just--

278
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,124
No, man, I'm just
talking to my new buddy, man.

279
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,499
You got a fucking
problem, dude?

280
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,999
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,707
- That's quite a shove.
- Sorry, he's totally wasted!

282
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,999
- Yeah.
- You should be careful, though,

283
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,082
'cause I could have
spilled it on your suit.

284
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,457
- Come on, let's go.
- You too.

285
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,874
You should keep
your little poodle on a leash.

286
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,583
Jesus.
We are literally still at work.

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,916
What's wrong with you?

288
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,292
I don't know.

289
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,416
You're drunk.

290
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,833
Come on, let me take you home
and take advantage of you.

291
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,167
Do you even like me, Amber?

292
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,250
Even a little bit?

293
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,208
Sure, I do.

294
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,083
That was very convincing.

295
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,000
Excuse me, colleagues.

296
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,957
For the Lord is my shepherd.

297
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,207
I shall not want.

298
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,749
He maketh me lie down
in pastures.

299
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,542
He restoresth my soul.

300
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,041
The Lord is with us all.

301
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,207
Lord Jesus,

302
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,791
help our dear Betsy

303
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,041
in the struggle
against addiction.

304
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,041
Yes, Father!

305
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:50,124
Give her strength
to fight this battle.

306
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,875
Hear our cry, oh, Lord!

307
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,249
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

308
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,457
let her be free!

309
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,041
Let her be free!

310
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,707
Let her be free!

311
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,749
- Let her be free!
- Let her be free.

312
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,957
Let me be free!

313
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
Let her be free!

314
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,916
Let me be free!

315
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,124
Let her be free!

316
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,332
Let me be free!

317
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,041
Let her be free!

318
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,042
- Let me be free!
- Yes.

319
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,542
Betsy, you, uh--you okay?

320
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,083
Pastor, uh...

321
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,332
I'm worried that, uh...

322
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,166
this isn't gonna work for me.

323
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,083
Why is that?

324
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,708
I never believed.

325
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:55,499
In any of this.

326
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,082
Ever since I was a little girl.

327
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,499
But your--
your folks told me

328
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,250
you been going to church
your whole life.

329
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,207
I did it for them.

330
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,207
Well, perhaps part of it
was for you too,

331
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,499
without you even knowing it.

332
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,332
You've always been
near the Lord.

333
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,333
He's always loved you.

334
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,582
Do you think
He can help me now?

335
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,999
Oh, yes. He can.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,957
But you have to accept Him
into your heart.

337
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,666
And when you do,

338
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,957
He'll guide you out
of this darkness.

339
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,291
He'll cast that devil
right out of your soul.

340
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,666
'Cause He loves you,
Betsy Mallum,

341
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,125
and deep down inside,
you've always loved Him.

342
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,582
Maybe I--maybe I have.

343
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,166
Of course you have.

344
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,624
That's what led you
to church every Sunday.

345
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,958
And that love will lead you
to the path of recovery.

346
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,292
Would you like to pray with me?

347
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,916
I'm kind of worried,
to be honest with you.

348
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:20,832
I mean, the recidivism rate is
awfully high in these places.

349
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,332
People keep coming back.

350
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,500
What if it just doesn't work?

351
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,041
I've been sober 14 years,
seven months,

352
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,707
three weeks, two days.

353
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,750
So many have been saved
by this program.

354
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,416
What were you addicted to?

355
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,999
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,207
- Well, I'm on OxyContin.
- Yeah?

357
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,999
And this place--

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,707
this place used to be
90% alcohol and cocaine,

359
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:55,041
and in the past two years,
it's 90% OxyContin.

360
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,916
- It's all addiction, Samuel.
- Yeah.

361
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,207
It's all the same fight.

362
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,041
Okay.

363
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,457
I want to talk
about the early days,

364
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,749
when you first
started prescribing.

365
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,957
Did Purdue give you
any kickbacks?

366
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,332
Just the usual stuff.

367
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,624
Expensive dinners,
tickets to football games.

368
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:21,291
I went to a few of their
weekend seminars in Orlando.

369
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:24,250
Anything specific about
those weekends that you recall?

370
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,166
Pretty girls.

371
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,457
Stuffed animals.

372
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:35,041
They made a great case
for why the drug was so safe.

373
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,582
What did they say?

374
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,999
That it was
basically non-addictive

375
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,957
because
of its time-release system.

376
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,875
The FDA label
was a big part of it.

377
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,457
And the blood charts.

378
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,957
Blood charts. So these--

379
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,249
these are the ones
that showed that the drug

380
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,832
plateaued in the bloodstream
instead of spiked.

381
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,666
Yeah, those.

382
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,999
Explain those to me,
would you?

383
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,541
'Cause I--like,
I don't always get the science.

384
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:06,374
Charts show that the drug
remained smooth and even

385
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,541
in the blood
because of the timed release,

386
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,499
versus the drug spiking
up and down in the blood

387
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,707
of an immediate-release pill,
like Vicodin.

388
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,999
- Mm.
- This made the drug

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,416
less prone to abuse,

390
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,500
'cause it didn't give the user
a feeling of euphoria.

391
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,749
And you found that
these charts swayed you

392
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,291
on the drug's safety.

393
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,374
Oh, definitely.

394
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,499
It was the phrase they used.

395
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,832
Fewer peaks and valleys.

396
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,583
I hadn't heard that before,
and it felt safe.

397
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,542
But the drug is not safer.

398
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,832
Then...

399
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,124
wouldn't the charts...

400
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,499
be false?

401
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,542
Yeah.

402
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,207
You might be right.

403
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,124
Oh, this chart
is absolutely deceptive.

404
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,749
See, right here.

405
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,832
The Y-axis is
on the logarithmic scale,

406
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,624
not a linear one,
like most normal charts.

407
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,999
So the top number is 100 mg.

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,207
Now, on a normal linear scale,

409
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,166
this number halfway down
would be 50.

410
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,666
But see what Purdue did?

411
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,666
They dramatically
compressed the scale.

412
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,749
See here, from 10 to 50,

413
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,625
and then from 50 to 100.

414
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,791
What does that mean?

415
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,624
It's been manipulated.

416
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,666
The Purdue chart hides the fact
that OxyContin's blood levels

417
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,666
actually drop precipitously
in the first few hours.

418
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,707
If we look at
the non-manipulated chart,

419
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,832
we see how it should look.

420
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,541
Even intervals
all the way up the axis,

421
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:52,999
that shows spikes and drops,
like all opioids have.

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,832
So you're telling us that
these OxyContin blood charts,

423
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,207
they deliberately
created a false impression.

424
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,541
100%.

425
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,624
This is a false plateau.

426
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,624
And unless you're
a trained data scientist,

427
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,832
you wouldn't catch it.

428
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,207
What's really strange to me
is why the FDA approved it.

429
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,916
This would require
FDA approval?

430
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,916
They approve all these charts.

431
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,749
And there's no way they'd miss
the log scale manipulation.

432
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,124
The only way this chart
makes it through

433
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:22,875
the FDA approval process
is if they turned a blind eye.

434
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,082
There is a deep connection

435
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,457
between drugs and terrorism.

436
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,457
It's history,

437
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,874
but it also reflects
today's reality.

438
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,832
And no one knows this more
than our guest of honor,

439
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,416
Time Magazine's Man of the Year

440
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,124
for his leadership
in the wake of 9/11,

441
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,832
and my good friend,

442
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,167
Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

443
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:55,082
Thank you, Asa.
Thank you.

444
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,582
Thank you, thank you.

445
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,624
I'd like to thank those

446
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,124
whose generosity
made this exhibit possible

447
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,207
at the DEA Museum.

448
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,541
Drug trafficking
funds terrorism.

449
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:10,166
But beyond that,
they are both intended

450
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:13,457
to break the spirit
of this great country.

451
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,499
But that won't happen.

452
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Not with the hard work
of the DEA.

453
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:24,042
Deputy Director Meyer, correct?

454
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,874
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I'm just--

455
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,332
it's such an honor to meet you.

456
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,624
What you have done for
this country was unbelievable.

457
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,791
- So important for all of us.
- Thank you.

458
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,582
I lost two friends
in the South Tower.

459
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,582
I'm so sorry.

460
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:44,499
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

461
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,041
But I have to say
the honor is mine.

462
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,916
You are the highest-ranking
woman in the DEA, correct?

463
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:53,707
Yes, sir.

464
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,166
I've heard really
great things about you,

465
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,249
and I'd love to chat.

466
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,624
I would be honored. Any time.

467
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,416
How about right now?

468
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,957
Uh, sure.

469
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,375
Great.

470
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:09,291
You may not know this,
but I'm a cancer survivor.

471
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,624
I did know.
And I am so sorry.

472
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,374
Thank you so much.

473
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,249
I got through it,
and because of my experience,

474
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,041
I truly understand
the pain and distress

475
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,874
that accompany illness.

476
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:25,207
I just started a new firm,
and I had to really think hard

477
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,332
about what kinds of cases
I would take on.

478
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,041
And after what I went through,

479
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,957
I felt like I was
in a unique position

480
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,374
to represent Purdue Pharma.

481
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,874
I'd love for you
to come to my office

482
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,457
sometime in the next week
and see a presentation

483
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,624
that I put together
on OxyContin.

484
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,832
I think Purdue has

485
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,624
a wonderful drug.

486
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,041
And they're doing
all that they can

487
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:52,208
to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

488
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:59,624
♪ ♪

489
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,749
How much do you think

490
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,832
Giuliani raised
for the DEA Museum?

491
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,624
10 grand? 20?

492
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,041
Whatever it is,
it's not good.

493
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,416
- Yeah.
- And it's not good

494
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,457
for your investigation.
This guy is a national hero.

495
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,292
He's friends
with the president.

496
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,916
We finally heard
from Jay McCloskey,

497
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:33,792
- the U.S. Attorney in Maine.
- I know who he is.

498
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,707
Dr. Richard,

499
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,874
you've become
very curt with me,

500
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,958
and it's disrespectful.

501
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:50,292
And frankly,
it's getting upsetting.

502
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,583
Jay McCloskey?

503
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,874
Yes.

504
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,541
He's going to chair
a law enforcement conference

505
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:07,999
on how to best deal with
the OxyContin issue.

506
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,499
That's good.

507
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,749
I agree.

508
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,999
We need to keep this
a law enforcement issue

509
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,541
and not a medical issue.

510
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:18,041
He's--he's invited us
to attend.

511
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,207
And I think we should send
a small delegation

512
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,916
to make clear we want to help
in any way we can.

513
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,916
Absolutely.

514
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,874
We need him
to understand abusers

515
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,791
are compromising life-saving
medications.

516
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:34,417
We need to keep
hammering the abusers.

517
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,416
You know,

518
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,833
I actually think
you shouldn't attend.

519
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,166
Why not?

520
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:55,541
You have really passionate
feelings on addiction,

521
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:58,457
and we need to be as politic
as possible right now,

522
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,207
something that you, at times,

523
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,542
are not very good at.

524
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,083
Hm.

525
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,000
Fine.

526
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:37,333
Just be sure
to hammer the abusers.

527
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,166
I haven't shared
very much or spoken

528
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,041
about anything in here, like--

529
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:49,208
like all--all you guys did.

530
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:56,124
So I want to--
I want to apologize for that.

531
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,124
I don't know
if all of you know this--

532
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,457
some of you might know--
but I was a--

533
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,457
I was a physician

534
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:06,374
who prescribed OxyContin

535
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,541
to some of my patients.

536
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,500
Some of these people,
I considered my friends.

537
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,875
Some of them became addicted.

538
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,917
Some of them died.

539
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,458
Sometimes I think I'm the one
who should have died.

540
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:42,207
These are just good,
decent people

541
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,249
who thought
they could trust me,

542
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,499
and I feel like
I betrayed them,

543
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,708
and I feel like
I let them down.

544
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,292
I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

545
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:03,749
I don't even know if I'm ready

546
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,625
to go out into the world,
but...

547
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,792
Well, there you go.

548
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,417
Guess I'll give it a shot.

549
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,832
I don't know, I feel, uh,

550
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,332
like I'm still addicted,
you know?

551
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,124
Like--like I still need it.

552
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,124
Well, these feelings
don't magically go away.

553
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,707
It's gonna feel
overwhelming at times.

554
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:32,874
But it is important
to live one day at a time.

555
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,875
- You know?
- Yeah.

556
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:37,082
Wake up each morning,

557
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,291
recommit to the process.

558
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,708
Okay. Well...

559
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,791
You have someone
picking you up?

560
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,916
- Yeah.
- Good.

561
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,499
- Yeah, I'll just wait here.
- I do.

562
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,624
Hey.

563
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,791
We're here if you need us.

564
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,832
Okay, thank you.

565
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,417

For my health,
my--my recovery.

575
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:55,332
But most of all,

576
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:59,957
I want to thank you
for my wonderful parents,

577
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:04,541
who have stuck with me through
the most horrible of times.

578
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:08,124
I'm so lucky to have them.

Dr. Finnix.

596
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,417
Dr. Finnix!

597
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:20,499
Dr. Finnix?

598
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,958
One second.

599
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,916
Hey.

600
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,166
Hey, how you doing?

601
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,499
- Are you joking?
- You called me last night

602
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,083
and said you were gonna
kill yourself.

603
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:38,249
I did?

604
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,957
No, that's--

605
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,750
I wasn't serious.

606
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,374
Are you gonna invite me in?

607
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,916
Yeah, please, come in.

608
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,374
I was on the night shift,
so I couldn't leave.

609
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,292
I was worried sick about you.

610
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,832
Sit. Come on, sit down.

611
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,207
How you doing? How you doing?

612
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,832
You want some coffee
or something?

613
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,916
No. Thank you.

614
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:12,499
You want some juice?

615
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,000
You're using again,
aren't you?

616
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,792
Yeah.

617
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,666
You know, rehab didn't work.

618
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,249
I mean, you know,

619
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,374
people over there
just keeps coming in and out,

620
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,624
going back and forth.

621
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,916
They come in, they go out,
they come in.

622
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,207
A doctor at the hospital
told me the same thing.

623
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,874
He said those places
work better for alcohol.

624
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:49,374
That recovery is a lot harder
for opiates.

625
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,583
It's damn near impossible.

626
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,791
Have you thought
about methadone?

627
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,707
He said it might work.

628
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:01,916
Just get addicted, like,
trade one for the other one,

629
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,542
'cause those guys--
those Vietnam guys--

630
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,207
the vets I used to work with,

631
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,249
they just called it
liquid handcuffs,

632
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,457
'cause you just--
you know, just--same thing.

633
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,791
Well, you gotta try something.

634
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,375
Yeah.

635
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:23,582
I asked around, and there's
a good clinic in Knoxville.

636
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,958
It's worth a shot, Dr. Finnix.

637
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,749
I'm not a doctor anymore.

638
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,791
I don't care what you are.

639
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,207
I just don't want you dead.

640
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,750
Can't you at least try it?

641
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,207
I'm sorry, we have
to postpone St. Moritz.

642
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:57,249
But the kids are really
looking forward to it.

643
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,041
I mean, David won't shut up
about those new skis.

644
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:01,707
It's--it's only two weekdays.

645
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,207
It's a very serious
situation.

646
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,457
A U.S. Attorney in Maine

647
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,208
is causing
some real problems for us.

648
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,416
What are you so afraid of?

649
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,749
You're president.

650
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,541
The drug is making
a billion a year.

651
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,500
Why can't you just enjoy it?

652
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,833
Maybe I'm not capable of joy.

653
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:34,792
Then the kids and I
will go without you.

654
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,833
Okay.

655
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,832
Well, thanks
for meeting with us.

656
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,041
I know the FDA must be
pretty overwhelmed

657
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,124
with approvals and such.

658
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,999
- We are.
- How can I help you?

659
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,582
We want to know
how the approval process works

660
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,500
for scientific charts.

661
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,916
Well, any data
that a company wants to use

662
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:17,624
in marketing and promotions

663
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:22,457
has to be approved by us,
to ensure accuracy.

664
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:27,124
So if Purdue Pharma used
specific language in charts,

665
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,874
then the FDA approved it?

666
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,166
That's correct.

667
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,207
We'd like to ask you

668
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,457
about this blood chart
that sales reps at Purdue

669
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,666
showed doctors to demonstrate
that the drug

670
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:42,000
didn't have the same peaks
and valleys as other opiates.

671
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,707
Would you guys give us
the room for a minute?

672
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,208
- Sure.
- Thank you.

673
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,375
- Where did you get this?
- In discovery, at Purdue.

674
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,957
And you're sure that

675
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:12,332
this is a chart that Purdue
reps actually showed doctors?

676
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,916
Mm-hmm. A version of it.

677
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,332
There are others
that are similar.

678
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:19,582
It was used in seminars
and for promotional purposes.

679
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,125
God damn it.

680
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:26,666
- Is that a problem?
- Yes, that's a problem.

681
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,499
That's a big problem.

682
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,874
This chart has been manipulated

683
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,624
to give
a false impression of the data.

684
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,707
The scale in this column
has been deceptively numbered.

685
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,624
Their drug actually spikes
like any opioid,

686
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,207
not this bullshit plateau
that the graph claims.

687
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,374
Why'd the FDA approve it?

688
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,124
We didn't.

689
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,707
We specifically told Purdue

690
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,249
they could not
make these claims.

691
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,791
I can give you the letter
we sent them years ago.

692
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:52,582
And we rejected
the use of the term

693
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,082
"fewer peaks and valleys,"

694
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,207
as that is clearly
not accurate.

695
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,999
Are you aware that sales reps
at Purdue used this term

696
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,749
as a major marketing tool?

697
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,750
Not until this conversation.

698
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,666
Those fucking assholes
do this all the time!

699
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,249
They just do whatever
the hell they want.

700
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,416
And this division has been
pushing back on them for years.

701
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,207
And would you be willing
to testify to this

702
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,791
before a grand jury?

703
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:23,166
Oh, gladly.

704
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,499
U.S. Attorney McCloskey,

705
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,207
esteemed participants,
thank you for including us

706
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:30,166
in this important conversation
and for bringing this

707
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,542
concerning topic
to our attention.

708
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,207
This is more than
just a concerning topic.

709
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,707
It's a crisis in our state

710
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,374
that stems
directly from your drug.

711
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,041
I was reluctant
to include representatives

712
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:44,416
from Purdue here today,
but we need all hands on deck,

713
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,291
as this problem
continues to escalate.

714
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,957
And we want to do
what's right,

715
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,457
so we've come up
with some solutions

716
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,166
we believe
will be very effective.

717
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,916
Like what?

718
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,374
Doctor?

719
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,874
Yes, at Purdue Pharma,

720
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,957
we'll immediately commit to
hiring a team of expert

721
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,457
independent consultants
to develop a strategy

722
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,749
to educate physicians
on the ways to identify

723
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,332
addicts and abusers.

724
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,124
This is Rick Mountcastle
calling for Jay McCloskey.

725
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,916
I have tried several times,
and as a former U.S. Attorney,

726
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,374
I'd expect that
he'd at least call me back.

727
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,874
Mr. McCloskey apologizes.

728
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,332
He's been very busy.

729
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,332
He'll return your call
as soon as possible.

730
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,999
Thank you so much.

731
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,791
What will these experts
accomplish?

732
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,207
Phase one of their strategy

733
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,916
will be to have
our sales team members

734
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,499
conclude all of
their doctor's visits

735
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,082
with a clear reminder:

736
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:34,124
opioid-based painkillers
are common targets

737
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,916
for both drug abusers
and drug addicts.

738
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,041
Mm.

739
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,291
Maybe he's having
personal problems.

740
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,749
Mm.

741
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,541
Or maybe he's an asshole.

742
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,041
Easy on the language.

743
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,082
Hey, guys.

744
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,374
You don't need
to call him anymore.

745
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,249
I literally just found out
why McCloskey's

746
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,249
- not returning your calls.
- Why's that?

747
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,832
Mr. McCloskey,

748
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,541
this is
a law enforcement issue.

749
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:01,332
And the last thing Purdue wants
is for addicts and abusers

750
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,291
to cause millions
of pain patients

751
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:05,916
to lose access
to the only thing

752
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,749
that provides them
with pain relief.

753
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,207
After he went
into private practice,

754
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,249
take a wild guess
who he took on as a client.

755
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,082
- No.
- Yep.

756
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,292
The former U.S. Attorney is
now representing Purdue Pharma.

757
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,666
I'll take it
under consideration.

758
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,207
They are buying off
everybody

759
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,125
who's supposed to be
regulating them.

760
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,749
♪ ♪

761
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,707
You know, Randy,
I owe you an apology.

762
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,874
For what?

763
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,875
Jay McCloskey
really is an asshole.

764
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,624
41-year-old male.

765
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,457
Died in his sleep.
No respiratory arrest.

766
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:49,082
No suicide note or
history of suicidal ideation.

767
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,749
So this one is
a confirmed OxyContin death.

768
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,749
It is. But to be honest,

769
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,750
we're running into
some serious issues.

770
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,416
We threw out about
a third of the reports

771
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,874
right off the bat, because
they're missing key info

772
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,791
or are actually
unrelated deaths,

773
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,749
like gunshot wounds or cancer.

774
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,374
Right, we expected that.

775
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,916
Right.

776
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:14,832
But we didn't expect
the biggest hurdle.

777
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,332
Nearly all the reports
show multiple drugs

778
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,416
in the deceased's system,

779
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,041
which we excluded
from the study,

780
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:23,707
since we're trying to pin down
deaths from Oxy as prescribed.

781
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,041
So where does that leave us?

782
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,332
What number are we at?

783
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,417
It's not
what you're looking for.

784
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,166
So far, we've only found

785
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,708
a dozen overdoses
with just oxycodone.

786
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,082
Just a dozen.

787
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,124
At this point,
we were expecting about 150.

788
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,124
I'm happy to keep going,
but it's not promising.

789
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,707
We could do this for months

790
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,500
and barely triple
these numbers.

791
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,957
No, no, that's fine.

792
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,958
We can stop.

793
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,667
Thank you
for all the hard work.

794
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,041
Honey.

795
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:46,500
I TiVoed 24.
Should we watch it?

796
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,125
Bridget.

797
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,207
Oh, um, yeah, sure.

798
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,374
You okay?

799
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,583
You don't want
to hear about it.

800
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,417
Honey, I do.

801
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,042
Hey, talk to me.

802
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,583
Honey.

803
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:25,374
I met a kid a few years ago,

804
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,832
in Kentucky.

805
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:29,207
Uh-huh.

806
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:32,291
And interviewing him

807
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,207
was the moment I realized

808
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:37,083
that there was something
unique about the drug.

809
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:45,375
He just died from an overdose.

810
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:58,041
I could have done more.

811
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,541
I could have worked harder...

812
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,582
- Come on, Bridget.
- And smarter.

813
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:04,707
This is not your fault.

814
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,082
And I could have saved him.

815
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,457
You did not make this drug.

816
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,707
You did not sell this drug.

817
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,416
- I could have worked harder.
- Honey.

818
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:16,417
- And I could have done more.
- Honey.

819
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,833
This is not on you.

820
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,875
This is gonna sound strange.

821
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:38,666
But I keep having this fantasy

822
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:41,082
that I have Richard Sackler

823
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:43,583
handcuffed to a chair.

824
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,666
And I force him to watch
a video of all of the victims

825
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:53,167
who have died from OxyContin.

826
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,208
Make him face
all of his victims.

827
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,167
All the lives
cut short for profit.

828
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,875
All the tragedy
that he brought to families.

829
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,791
All the communities destroyed

830
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:22,125
for his family's greed.

831
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:28,624
I just want him to see it all
with his own two eyes

832
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,167
exactly what it is
that he has done.

833
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:39,042
But do you think
he'd even care?

834
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,666
No, he wouldn't, would he?

835
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,749
Anyone who would do this
in the first place

836
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,666
probably wouldn't at all.

837
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,167
Wouldn't care.

846
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,041
Too long.

847
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:32,332

848
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,749

859
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,833
we could get lunch sometime.

860
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,958

00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:24,791

Yes, of course.

- Take care of yourself.
- Okay--

You okay, sir?

867
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,749
Tell me about Maine.

868
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,666

this is
a law enforcement issue,

871
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,874
and I didn't get the sense

872
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:23,083
he's going to push
to regulate the medication.

873
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:29,791
He said he wants to keep
in open communication with us.

874
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,291
I think we definitely should.

875
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:34,666

sniffing around,

877
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,791

extra careful with

what people
are putting in writing.

879
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,957

instantly delete

Uh, listen.

Well, I ain't got no OCs,

No, no, I'm just catching up

Don't be. What's up?

941
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:32,541
Um, I know a lot of other
drugs are commonly prescribed

942
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:36,707
along with OxyContin,
like Xanax and antidepressants.

943
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,041
Would it be possible
to separate out

944
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:41,791
other non-lethal
prescription drugs

945
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,124
with Oxy in their systems?

946
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:47,082
Because those
drug combinations most likely

947
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:49,666
would have been taken
as approved by the FDA.

948
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:53,582
Exactly, if we separate out
non-lethal combos,

949
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,874
then we end up
with a more accurate number

950
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:58,541
of Oxy-related
overdoses, right?

951
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:00,041
Can you make that distinction?

952
00:56:00,042 --> 00:56:01,417
Absolutely.

953
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,332
Okay, we're likely missing
quite a few deaths

954
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,832
that are just
too difficult to uncover.

955
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,749
But even so, with the changes
to our methodology,

956
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,250
the results
are frankly shocking.

957
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,957
When combined with
non-lethal medications,

958
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,332
we found far more deaths
linked to OxyContin

959
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,457
than had previously
been estimated.

960
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,458
464.

961
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,916
464.

962
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:33,541
Yeah, but that's
not the biggest thing.

963
00:56:33,542 --> 00:56:35,791
Only 12 of those
are the result of

964
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,666
chewing, snorting,
or injecting,

965
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,874
which means 98% of those deaths

966
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,332
were the result of people
taking the pills orally,

967
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,749
as directed.

968
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,957
Our findings suggest
it's most probably

969
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,874
not the abuser who's dying
from OxyContin consumption.

970
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,791
It's pain patients,

971
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:55,874
who are taking the drug
exactly as prescribed.

972
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,999
Correct.

973
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,707
They're the ones

975

My latest theory,
from all this new data,

976
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:04,832
is that actual abusers

977
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,750

like heroin.
