'Cause, we've
popped them normal before.

37
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,903
Did Purdue say it was easy
for someone to bypass

38
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:24,323
the time-release coating
on an OxyContin pill?

39
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,658
No, Purdue claimed
the coating

40
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,577
was difficult to get around,
and therefore,

41
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:32,456
OxyContin would be
unappealing to abusers.

42
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,916
Was the coating difficult
to dissolve?

43
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:38,670
No, it was very easy.

44
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:41,465
All you had to do
is dissolve it in saliva

45
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,884
and then scrape it off.

46
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:46,553
And then the abuser
would have immediate access

47
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:48,930
to the full 12-hour supply.

48
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,893
They just crush it off
then snort it.

that more than 1%

179
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,058
become addicted, it's dead.

180
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,434
And one year of strong sales

181
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:34,396
isn't gonna make up
for the 40 million you spent.

182
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,193
Any suggestions?

183
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:42,445
Take a page
from Arthur's playbook.

184
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,072
Get an expert
who'll tell doctors

185
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,491
the truth of our wonder drug.

186
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,118
We've got Russell Portenoy.

187
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:52,247
No, I'm thinking someone
more aggressive,

188
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,292
especially if your 1% claim
is, um, hmm.

189
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,212
What's that medical term?

190
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,673
Fucking bullshit.

191
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:03,676
Fine.

192
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,555
We'll find
an aggressive expert.

193
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:12,225
No, the--the osteoarthritis
was truly debilitating,

194
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:14,060
and nothing seemed to work
until I realized

195
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:15,937
that the patient
needed something strong enough

196
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:17,814
to stop the breakthrough pain.

197
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,525
So I started the patient
on methadone,

198
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,318
and she was back to normal
within just a few days.

199
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,863
Methadone?

200
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,073
You said find me aggressive.

201
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:30,160
He has a theory
called pseudo addiction,

202
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,414
which basically means addiction
doesn't exist.

203
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,376
Who is this guy?

204
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,836
David Haddox.

205
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,754
He went to dental school
but now heads

206
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,007
the Pain Management Department
at Emory.

207
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:47,343
A--a fitting progression.

208
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:48,554
You wanna meet with him?

209
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,974
God, yes.

210
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:55,685
So you really feel opioids
are under-prescribed?

211
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,270
For decades.

212
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,731
Now, the Porter/Jick study
is exactly right.

213
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,485
Under the proper care,
opioids are totally safe.

214
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,698
I--I recently read
a theory of yours,

215
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:12,243
which is why I--
I wanted to meet.

216
00:11:12,244 --> 00:11:13,329
Thank you.

217
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,999
Let me guess: pseudo addiction?

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,543
- Correct.
- How'd you come up with--

219
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,838
mm, uh.

220
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,718
Where did you discover
pseudo addiction?

221
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:33,389
Yeah, so I was, um,
so I was, uh, was working

222
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,725
with a 17-year-old
leukemia patient

223
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:38,394
who showed
classic signs of addiction.

224
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:40,188
And yet we upped
his medication,

225
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:41,940
and he was fine.

226
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,067
Turns out that
he wasn't addicted at all.

227
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,069
It was that
that underlying pain

228
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,821
hadn't been properly treated.

229
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:53,409
So pseudo addiction means

230
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,329
that, uh,

231
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,750
addiction symptoms are,
in actuality,

232
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:03,670
the symptoms of untreated pain?

233
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,213
That's correct.

234
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,758
Yeah, taking away a patient's
medication isn't helping them.

235
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,843
It's torturing them.

236
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,680
What they need
is more medication,

237
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,223
and then these supposed

238
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:18,518
addiction symptoms
will quickly go away.

239
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,354
So--

240
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:25,108
so do you think all addiction

241
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:30,071
is, in actuality,
pseudo addiction?

242
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,282
In relation to medication?

243
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,658
- Yes.
- Huh.

244
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,202
I look in those rare
instances when a patient

245
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,745
truly is an addict;

246
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:40,581
that's not the fault
of the drug or the doctor.

247
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:44,168
No, the patient was most likely
a drug addict to begin with

248
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:47,005
due to genetic defects.

249
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,340
What about cigarettes?

250
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,592
Addiction or pseudo addiction?

251
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:55,555
Yeah, smoking--smoking is
definitely pseudo addiction.

252
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,182
It's all in their heads.

253
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,608
How would you like to work
for Purdue Pharma?

254
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:21,457
♪ ♪

255
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,303
Morning, boss.

256
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,349
Still no update
on the funding?

257
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,726
Well, good morning
to you too, Randy.

258
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:43,936
How's Jennifer? The kids?

259
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:45,813
Sorry, good morning.

260
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:46,982
Nailed it.

261
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:52,070
You know,
it seems pretty darn odd

262
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,988
if these FBI guys
won't grant us

263
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,324
a small amount of resources.

264
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:57,867
Could just be,
as my son would say,

265
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,495
a dysfunctional government.

266
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,747
Your son's four, Rick.

267
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:05,416
Feeling a little inadequate
right now.

268
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,793
Good morning, guys.

269
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:08,294
- Morning.
- What's up?

270
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,713
Still haven't heard back
from the Medicaid office,

271
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,174
and Dr. Jick's office finally
called me back and said,

272
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:14,967
"The doctor's unavailable."

273
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:17,595
Unavailable? Today?

274
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,932
- Nope.
- She said unavailable, period.

275
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,229
Yes, I told you,
Dr. Jick is unavailable.

276
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,480
Well, I've called
multiple times,

277
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,856
and I'd just like
an explanation

278
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:31,067
as to why Dr. Jick refuses
to speak to me.

279
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,318
He said he's very busy,

280
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,737
but I'll leave a message.
Thank you.

281
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,869
Well, this just
got interesting.

282
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,122
So what's the latest?

283
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,248
Well, as you know,

284
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:47,291
Purdue aggressively
pushed the drug

285
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,751
as non-addictive
with the phrase

286
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,420
"less than 1% get addicted."

287
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:53,589
That figure comes from
the Porter/Jick study

288
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,093
that was done
by Dr. Hershel Jick at, uh...

289
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,470
- Boston. Boston University.
- Boston University.

290
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,556
Well, let me guess, it's that
the fraudulent study

291
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,224
that was secretly funded
by Purdue?

292
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,976
- Just like the pain study?
- Well, that's one theory.

293
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:08,896
We actually called Dr. Jick
to discuss it with him,

294
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:12,108
but something
very interesting occurred.

295
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,570
He wouldn't get
on the phone with us.

296
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:19,866
Well, nothing says suspect

297
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,952
quite like
an unanswered phone call.

298
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:25,746
If that 1% study
is indeed fraudulent,

299
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:29,083
it's a home run in proving
criminal misbranding.

300
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,376
Yeah, and if you can find

301
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:31,878
the high-level Purdue exec
that oversaw it...

302
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,254
Could indict them for fraud.

303
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:36,549
- Yeah, that's right.
- It sounds like a great lead.

304
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,885
Yeah, this case is starting
to take up so much time.

305
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,136
That's right.

306
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,512
We need more funding
for prosecutors

307
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:43,181
- for our non-Purdue cases.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

308
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,099
I mean,
why won't the FBI or the DEA

309
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,559
give us additional funding?

310
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,060
You know, I don't know.

311
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:50,855
Maybe they're not, uh,
connected to the issue.

312
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,315
You know what you should do,
you should try

313
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,900
the Virginia State Police.

314
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,610
Try Virginia Medicaid
Fraud Unit.

315
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,778
They'll get it.
And you know, the more we find,

316
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,071
the more it opens up
those coffers.

317
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:01,449
Yeah, but it, it just--
it is really difficult

318
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,409
to find anything without
the proper resources.

319
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,952
I mean,
I knew we'd be outspent,

320
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,412
but I did not expect

321
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,414
to not have access
to the most basic things,

322
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,916
like high-speed computers
and scanners.

323
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,627
Look, guys, I--I get it,
trust me.

324
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,462
But we just
keep pushing, all right?

325
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,506
- Yeah.
- We'll see where it goes, sir.

326
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:18,841
- All right, boys.
- You can enjoy your lunch.

327
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,176
- Thank you.
- Keep me posted.

328
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,512
- Oh, Randy.
- Sir?

329
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,722
Uh, how you doing,
health-wise?

330
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,682
I actually just had
my one-year scan,

331
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,352
and I am cancer-free.

332
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,897
- Yeah, he's good.
- That's great news.

333
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:40,029
OxyContin is becoming
the leading cause

334
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,948
of overdose in the country.

335
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:44,408
Newspapers are filled
with arrests in rural areas

336
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,079
where crime directly related
to the drug is skyrocketing.

337
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,664
Isn't Diversion
and local authorities

338
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,207
supposed to deal
with these crime issues?

339
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,918
Yes, but what makes this
so overwhelming

340
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,128
for law enforcement
is the sheer ease

341
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,714
with which users
can get access to the drug.

342
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:02,635
I mean, they are available in
every pharmacy in the country.

343
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,720
What do you feel
is the best approach?

344
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,556
I think
the most effective way

345
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,474
to solve this problem

346
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:10,977
is to limit the drug's use
for severe pain only.

347
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:14,522
It is a very strong narcotic
that is being prescribed

348
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:17,441
for issues such as basic
dental work and even headaches.

349
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:20,111
If it was no longer allowed
for moderate pain,

350
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,445
then overnight,

351
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:23,990
millions of pills
will be off the streets.

352
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,866
What about the millions
of legitimate pain patients

353
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,326
that will lose access
to the drug?

354
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:30,454
If they have severe pain,
they will not lose access.

355
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:33,583
But this recent practice
of opioid use for moderate pain

356
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:37,670
is causing a startling new wave
of crime and addiction.

357
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:40,673
The role of the FDA is
to make sure medicine is safe.

358
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,301
And when this drug
is taken as prescribed,

359
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:46,178
this medicine is safe.

360
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,056
And I disagree.

361
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,103
Anecdotes about abuse and crime

362
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,355
are not a scientific analysis
of the drug's safety.

363
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,941
They're tales of addicts
abusing pharmaceuticals,

364
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,359
which happens with all opioids.

365
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,030
So until you can prove
the drug itself is dangerous,

366
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:06,241
I don't see how we can
put restrictions on it.

367
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,626
Okay.

368
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:20,379
Well, you're not gonna
take action,

369
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,051
then I will call in Purdue,
discuss it with them directly.

370
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,471
- I think you should.
- I will.

371
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:36,103
And your warning label
that this drug

372
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,356
is somehow less addictive

373
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,274
is total bullshit.

374
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,320
You should look into
changing that immediately.

375
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,283
Why would you start him
on 20 milligrams

376
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,327
when 40 milligrams sounds like
it's gonna be more effective?

377
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,621
- Hey, yo, Teddy.
- Yo.

378
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:55,373
Right, that's why you keep
titrating 'em up

379
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:57,875
until all there's left to say
is thank you.

380
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:01,170

are, in reality,
untreated pain.

396

And the cure
for pseudo addiction

397
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,378
is that the patient
needs more medication.

398
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:44,463
More than 100,000 physicians,

399
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:46,424
almost half of all doctors
in the country

400
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:49,218
will be sent
pseudo addiction pamphlets.

401
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,387
Give one to any doctor
if their patients

sorry, pseudo addiction.

Questions? Yes.

404
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,771
Last week, I had a doctor
tell me he had two patients

405
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:03,107
taking way more pills
than he prescribed.

406
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:04,275
Like, he was very worried

407
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,735
they were addicted
to the medication.

408
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:06,944
No, no, no, no,
it sounds like

409
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:09,155

actually under prescribing.

410
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:10,573
No, he's not.

411
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,491
They're already taking
80 milligrams a day.

412
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,618
Look, if I tell them
that they're pseudo addicted

413
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,037
and need to be bumped up
to 160 milligrams,

414
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,414
he'll just kick me
out of his office.

415
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:22,001
Now that is
a defeatist attitude.

416
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:26,213
Dr. Haddox is giving us
innovative concepts,

417
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:29,759

appreciation for his expertise.

As opposed to other drugs,

443

opioids are uniquely
challenging to stop using

444

because they can change

00:49:45,472 --> 00:49:47,056
Sure was.

878
00:49:47,057 --> 00:49:49,350
Maybe it'll
help us get more funding?

879
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:50,644
I doubt it.

880
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:56,149
Rick Mountcastle.

881
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:02,113
Oh yeah, I remember you, Toby.
How're things at the DEA?

882
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:07,409
Mm-hmm.

883
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,953
Well, it's still early
in the case.

884
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:10,746
We haven't found anything yet.
You know what?

885
00:50:10,747 --> 00:50:14,375
I'll tell you what--
it isn't a good time to talk.

886
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:16,877
Try you another time? Yeah.

887
00:50:16,878 --> 00:50:20,090
It's all right. Great, bye.

888
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,265
DEA wants to know
how the pharma case is going.

889
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,476
They have zero interest,

890
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:34,395
and right when we land
something big,

891
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:37,356
they just--they call us
right outta nowhere?

892
00:50:37,357 --> 00:50:39,817
Let's keep this buttoned up.

893
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:41,820
Just me, you, and Brownlee.

894
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:45,991
I don't trust anyone
on this case.

895
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,703
Even after
nine years staying sober,

896
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:53,038
I know I got a disease.

897
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,834
So grateful I can come here
every week as a reminder

898
00:50:56,835 --> 00:51:01,714
of what I need
to do to stay on my path.

899
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:05,176
Thank you for sharing, Belle,
and you're not alone.

900
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:11,099
Betsy, would you
like to speak?

901
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:16,520
Do I have to?

902
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,273
You might find it helpful.

903
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:22,318
This is a very safe space.

904
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,737
Just share
from your heart, dear.

905
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:26,615
We're all here to support you.

906
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:38,626
Okay, um.

907
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm Betsy.

908
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,296
Hi, Betsy.

909
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:45,591
I was prescribed OxyContin

910
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:49,346
for, uh, a back injury...

911
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:56,227
And it worked great at first,
but...

912
00:51:58,146 --> 00:52:04,569
Then it stopped working,
and I needed more.

913
00:52:08,114 --> 00:52:09,783
Here you are, sweetheart.

914
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:16,247
I guess--

915
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:25,381
I guess I always felt
kinda tense

916
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:30,303
and uncomfortable
around people.

917
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,355
But taking the pills, it was...

918
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:46,111
It was the first time
I felt normal.

919
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,782
In maybe my whole life.

920
00:52:56,788 --> 00:52:57,789
And now...

921
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:05,003
And now I don't feel

922
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:07,298
anything at all anymore.

923
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:13,263
All I think about
is getting more pills.

924
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:18,601
And it can get scary.

925
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:41,874
Aww, everything's
gonna be just fine.

926
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:44,460
Don't you worry.

927
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:46,171
How long has it been?

928
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:51,008
- Two days.
- I feel like I'm gonna die.

929
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:54,970
Oh, honey, it's the
worst feeling in the world,

930
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:56,890
but I can help with that.

931
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,809
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,563
I got 10s, 20s, and 40s.

933
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:07,024
It's a dollar a milligram,
so if you've got $40,

934
00:54:07,025 --> 00:54:11,153
I can give you
four 10s right now.

935
00:54:11,154 --> 00:54:15,949
I mean, wouldn't it be nice if
all this pain just went away?

936
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,701
Yeah.

937
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:19,329
