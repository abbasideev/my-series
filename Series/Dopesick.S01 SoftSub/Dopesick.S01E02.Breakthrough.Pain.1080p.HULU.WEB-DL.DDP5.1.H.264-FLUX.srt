OxyContin is less powerful

after the shoot while
we were editing the video.

00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,337

for OxyContin?

- Great to see you again.

How's your divorce coming?

732

The FDA, Justice, the doctors,
they all want their drugs.

740
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,567
And big pharma will
spend everything they can

741
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,028
to make sure
that they get them.

742
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,364
And this is just gonna
keep going and going

743
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,076
till we're all just one big
pill-popping zombie nation.

744

Have you seen Purdue's
I Got My Life Back video?

745
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,249
- Sure.
- It's a fraud.

746
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,293
They were told it was a PSA
when they shot it.

747
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,921
And several of those
participants became addicted.

748
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,843
Few of them are dead
or close to it.

749

Sarah Miller, Judy Cohen.

752
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,612
At the DOJ's office
of consumer litigation.

753
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,115
Well, I thought
they were all conspirators

754
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,868

zombie apocalypse.

755
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,453
Not everybody.

756
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,583
Now, that was my tip
for the day, boys,

757
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,042
so if you can both
kindly fuck off,

758
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,712
I'd certainly
be better off for it.

759
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,132
Thank you, Bridget.

760
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,096
I'm sorry about your divorce.

761
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,351
I'm at a loss for words.

762
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:00,355
It--it--it--it almost makes me
want to tear up a little bit,

763
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,442
but I--it--it's just changed
my life for the better.

764
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,069
I'm coming home
with energy to spare.

765
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,488
Just to have the evening
to do things with

766
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,782
was unheard of.

767
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,994
We've been having problems
with Purdue from the get-go.

768
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,247
- Like the label?
- Like the label.

769
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,707
So when Curtis Wright
approved

770
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,668
the original FDA label,
was there internal pushback?

771
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,128
Oh, yeah.

772
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,546
Diane Schnitzler
emailed him that

773
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,381
Purdue's "less addictive"
claims sounded like bullshit.

774
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,175
What was Mr. Wright's response?

775
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,970
He said, "Actually, Diane,
this is literally true."

776
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:36,475
So Curtis Wright is
the FDA medical review officer

777
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,770
who approves an unprecedented
label for Purdue.

778
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,731
And then he goes
and he works for Purdue.

779
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:46,360
So do you think there's
quid pro quo with Purdue

780
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,028
to grant such generous wording?

781
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,363
Yeah, well, I get that

782
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,741
it has the appearance
of corruption,

783
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,910
but it's possible there wasn't.

784
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,749
What Curtis Wright did
is the way the industry works.

785
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,167
It's a revolving door

786
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,294
where as soon as people
leave the government,

787
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,547
they go and work for the exact
people they were regulating

788
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,468
for five times the money,
and it's all legal.

789
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,469
What appears to be corruption

790
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,429
is simply how the system works.

791
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,517
Here's an ad, says patient
only needs two pills a day,

792
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,811
but the drug often
didn't last 12 hours.

793
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,937
So how does an ad like this

794
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,897
get through the FDA
approval process?

795
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,482
You'll have to ask
Ronald Reagan.

796
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,818
Does he work
for Purdue now too?

797
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,028
No, but when
he gutted the FDA,

798
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,363
they went from policing
big pharma

799
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,073
to being at their mercy.

800
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,494
39 employees are responsible
for 35,000 promotional items.

801
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,621
How do they grant
proper oversight?

802
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,332
Just give me five minutes.

803
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:47,004
It works as an honor system.

804
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,506
Drug companies
are supposed to be honest.

805
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,800
I know.

806
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,219
So if a company was being
criminally dishonest

807
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,054
in its promotional marketing,

808
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,472
what would you charge them with

809
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,225
if--if fraud
was too high a bar?

810
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,560
Sarah?

811
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,979
Can you all give us a moment?

812
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,868
If it were me, I'd charge them
with criminal misbranding.

813
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,244
Never heard of that before.

814
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,704
Most people haven't.

815
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,831
It's perfect for this because
you don't have to prove

816
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,541
the misbranding
caused the overdoses

817
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,168
or pin it on an individual,

818
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,380

misbranded the drug.

we might get shut down
by Main Justice.

843
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,686
It's pretty crappy
if you ask me.

844
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,064
I wouldn't say "crappy"
when we go to Comey.

845
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,274
He doesn't like
that kind of language.

846
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,276
No, that's Ashcroft.

847
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,239
I heard he dressed Comey down
one time for saying "turd."

Comey tells us the case is off,
I'm gonna say,

849

"Well, that's one big
turd burger, sir."

850
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,249

It's not really my thing.

Thank you, though.

866

I just want to see

00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,938
Okay, so just
let me handle this.

868
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,525
Even if Comey says we're dead,
it doesn't mean we're dead.

869
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,735
Then what does it mean?

870
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,112
It means we're dead.

871
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,783
Getting some complaints
about your investigation.

872
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,286

These guys are behaving
like pros.

876
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,465
And this is a very serious
issue that warrants

877
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,800
all the attention
we've been giving it.

878
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,469

Yes, chicken.

00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,813
What do you--what
do you mean by chicken?

883
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,357
Do you mean, like,

884
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,984
chicken the food
or chicken you're scared?

885
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,654
Like you--you're a chicken?

886
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,240
Chicken, the food.

887
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,119
Why are you investigating
the chicken guy?

888
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,371
Colonel Sanders?

889
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,582
No, Frank Perdue.

890
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,961
- Oh, no, sir.
- No, no, no, no.

891
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,005
Uh, we are not investigating
Perdue Farms.

892
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,716
We are investigating
Purdue Pharma.

893
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,510
It's--it's spelled
differently, I think.

894
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,972
Yeah, it's spelled with a
"U" instead of an "E."

895
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,515
Yeah, Purdue Pharma.

896
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,518
No, it's the company
that manufactures OxyContin.

897
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,022
It's not the--the, um--
it's not the chicken people.

898
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,568
Well, my staff must have
been misinformed.

899
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,112
Well, perhaps whoever's
complaining about us

900
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,239
is trying to get you
off our track, sir.

901
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,700
And for good reason.
It's early days.

902
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,326
We already have
substantial leads.

903
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,329
Manipulative advertising,
false claims about addiction,

904
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,999
overdoses are skyrocketing
while Purdue continues to lie

905
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,542
about the drug's safety
to doctors,

906
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,461
to patients, and the FDA.

907
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,672

a complementary OxyContin
bucket hat?

924
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,212
Uh, no.

925
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,213
Maybe one of
our compact discs?

926
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,465
- No, thanks.
- All right.

927
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,508
- Hey, well, enjoy your day.
- Okay, thanks.

928
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,052
Dr. Finnix, so glad
you could make it.

929
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,803
- Thanks.
- Hell of a spread, right?

930
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,347
Oh, you bet.

931
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,348
I wasn't lying to you.

932
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,724
No, you weren't.

933
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,935
Um, I wanted to introduce you
to Dr. Russell Portenoy.

934
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,312
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, no.

935
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,688
The honor's all mine.
Believe me.

936
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,065
You're very kind.

937
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,984
Uh...

938
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,861
I feel a little silly,
to be honest with you,

939
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,531
but I actually brought
your book down

940
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,201
and I wonder
if you'd sign it for me

941
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,869
over the weekend
if you have a chance.

942
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,788
- Are you kidding?
- It'd be my honor.

943
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,748
- All right, great.
- Great.

944
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:00,001
Well, look, don't let us get
between you and the food.

945
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,753
- Don't miss out on that lobster.
- All right, Billy.

946
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,004
And, uh,
we'll see you shortly.

947
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,130
- We're just over here.
- All right.

948
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,757
All right, Doc.

949
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,509
We're honored
that you'd take a break

950
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,220
from your busy schedules
to spend the weekend with us,

951
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,223
and--as well as--

952
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,267
the country's leading
independent pain organizations.

953
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:20,397
We have representatives from
the American Pain Foundation,

954
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,358
the National Foundation
for the Treatment of Pain,

955
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,443
American Chronic
Pain Association,

956
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,861
the American Pain Society,

957
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,157
and the American Academy
of Pain Medicine.

958
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,371
But to start us off,
we wanna begin

959
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,749
with the foremost
pain specialist in the country.

960
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,128
He is co-chief of the Pain
and Palliative care Service

961
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,966
at Sloan-Kettering,
Dr. Russell Portenoy.

962
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,514
This is truly
a special moment

963
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,474
in the history of pain care.

964
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:00,770
Hospitals, doctors,
think tanks, and even the FDA

965
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,357
are rethinking the very nature
of pain treatment.

966
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,445
And what we've learned is
that opioids, certain kinds,

967
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,115
are not nearly as addictive
as they have been perceived.

968
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,867
Narcotics can be abused

969
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,120
and are not appropriate
in all instances.

970
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,123
But when properly
prescribed by doctors,

971
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,961
they almost never lead
to addiction.

972
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,550
In most immediate-release
opioids,

973
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:35,305
blood plasma levels spike
between euphoria and pain.

974
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,307
But OxyContin's
time-release system

975
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,516
causes blood plasma levels

976
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,477
to have
fewer peaks and valleys,

977
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,520
creating a plateau effect,

978
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:46,983
which results in less euphoria
and less potential for abuse.

979
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,488
And did--did doctors attend
these weekend seminars?

980
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,656
Yes, many of them did.

981
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,200
This is Dr. Samuel Finnix.

982
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,118
Runs a patient care practice
in Appalachia.

983
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,288
And, Drea here, we stole
from Johnson and Johnson

984
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,499
and she, uh,
she runs the South.

985
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,125
Covers multiple
Southern territories for us.

986
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,752
It's an honor to meet you.

987
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,128
Nice to meet you.

988
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,546
I'm from a small town
in Alabama,

989
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,965
so I know how important
the local doctor is.

990
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,509
Yeah.

991
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,053
Have you been prescribing
OxyContin to your miners?

992
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,679
To a few, yeah.

993
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,223
Yeah, it's been--
it's been effective.

994
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,726
And what occurred
at these events?

995
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,897
Doctors were often co-opted
by Purdue Pharma.

996
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,690
You should do a talk
with Dr. Finnix.

997
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,026
I bet people would love
to hear about his patients.

998
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,570
Great idea.
Yeah, well, what do you think?

999
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,863
No, I-I can't really

1000
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,990
get up and speak
in front of people.

1001
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,117
Oh, please.
You're far more impressive.

1002
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,744
You're on the front lines.

1003
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,204
Just think how incredible
it would be

1004
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,705
if the story of a coal town

1005
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,751
could help change lives
all over the country.

1006
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,920
- Absolutely.
- And I mean, it'd be easy.

1007
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,421
You know, I'd be asking you
the questions

1008
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,006
so you don't have
to embellish anything.

1009
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,467
Just, uh, tell people
what you're seeing.

1010
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,677
It'd be wonderful
for these city boys

1011
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,263
to see how us country folks
get things done.

1012
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,058
- Yeah.
- Well, uh, sure.

1013
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,601
Okay, I guess.

1014
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,186
You're gonna ask me
the questions?

1015
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,230
- Absolutely.
- I'll be right with you.

1016
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,984
- All right, well.
- See how that goes.

1017
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,529
So, uh, Dr. Samuel Finnix,
tell us, what kind of ailments

1018
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,614
do your patients
typically have?

1019
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,867
Many of my patients
are miners,

1020
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,329
so I see back injuries,
shoulder lacerations,

1021
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,665
broken hands, things like that.

1022
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,875
And you would say,
in your experience,

1023
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:32,088
pain is part of everyday life
in the mines?

1024
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,717
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

1025
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:43,891
I-I have, um, uh,
firsthand experience of pain.

1026
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:48,354
My father was diagnosed
with a rare form of cancer.

1027
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,564
Oh, I'm sorry.

1028
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:50,982
Thank you.
Which he survived,

1029
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,568
but watching him
suffer through that

1030
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,362
was one of the--the hardest
things that I've been through.

1031
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,865
You also have
firsthand experience

1032
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,700
with that kind of pain, right?

1033
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,452
I do, yeah.

1034
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,538
Uh, my wife had cancer, um,

1035
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:11,085
and, uh, well, she passed away;
she didn't make it.

1036
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,712
I'm so sorry.

1037
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,297
Purdue's drug, MS Contin,

1038
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,843
was very helpful to her
in her final days, wasn't it?

1039
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,346
- It was.
- It was--it was helpful.

1040
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:24,599
That's why I wanted
to try OxyContin

1041
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,227
on my patients because, uh,
I don't want them to suffer.

1042
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,646
If there's a drug out there

1043
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,732
that can help them,
well, then I-I want to try.

1044
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,611
And the patients are wanting
to try it, too, right?

1045
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,781
Heck yeah, they are.

1046
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,586
I know most people don't,
you know,

1047
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,255
they don't think about us
up there in the mountains.

1048
00:52:56,256 --> 00:53:03,221
Uh, but these people,

1049
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,682
you know,

1050
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,892
when this country needed
to build airplanes,

1051
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,228
uh, during World War II
overnight,

1052
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,814
where--where do you think
that steel came from?

1053
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:16,317
The bridges we drive across,
the high rises you live in,

1054
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,529
stadiums
where we all watch football,

1055
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,864
that's all--that's steel.

1056
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,784
And steel comes from coal.

1057
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,578
Um, I'm probably
talking too much.

1058
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,579
Am I talking too much?

1059
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,081
No, please, please.

1060
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:34,210
And who do you think digs
that coal out of the--

1061
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,379
out of the mountains
in the hollows?

1062
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,381
My patients do.

1063
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,466
It's dangerous work, and...

1064
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,719
they risk their lives every day

1065
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,179
to keeps the lights on
in places like this.

1066
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,598
To keep the lights on
in the big cities.

1067
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,935
Keep the lights on
in your fine homes.

1068
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,937
And, uh, they carry the burden

1069
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,314
of building this nation
on their backs,

1070
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,275
and they deserve to do it
without pain.

1071
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:03,781
So if this drug can help
these good folks

1072
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,784
have a better life
and feed their families,

1073
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:11,247
well, then Purdue Pharma
is doing these people,

1074
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,585
my people, a great service,
so...

1075
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,338
God bless them for it.

1076
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,562
- Were you nervous?
- Yeah.

1077
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,980
Oh, well,
you didn't look nervous.

1078
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,106
- You were incredible.
- Would you excuse me?

1079
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,441
You were
absolutely incredible.

1080
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,901
I've been to hundreds
of these, and seriously,

1081
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,569
I've never been so moved.

1082
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,987
- Oh, thank you.
- Really appreciate it.

1083
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,405
- Hey, Daniel.
- Do you mind if I steal

1084
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,407
the star of the weekend
for just a few minutes?

1085
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,075
- Of course not--thank you.
- Nice talking to you.

1086
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,494
Nice talking to you.

1087
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:53,414
I have to tell you,
you spoke for the people

1088
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:57,710
that don't often
get a voice in this country.

1089
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,172
Well, look, thanks
for getting me up there.

1090
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,632
Oh, it was beautiful.

1091
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,759
You know, Purdue
has a speaker's bureau.

1092
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,762
They'd be lucky to have you.
Is this okay?

1093
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,431
Yeah.
What's that?

1094
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,933
Oh, we pay speakers

1095
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,060
to go to events
like this around the country.

1096
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,647
They get $500 to $3,000
for a speech.

1097
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,981
Those speakers get paid?

1098
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,025
- Oh, yeah.
- It's not a secret.

1099
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,860
You should think about it.

1100
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,780
You were great up there.

1101
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,657
That guy's amazing.

1102
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,700
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1103
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:33,246
He's, uh--he's really special.

1104
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,499
And I'm sorry about your dad.

1105
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,918
Is he okay now?

1106
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,839
Yeah, I, uh...

1107
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,384
I made that up.

1108
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,472
My, uh--my dad
never had cancer.

00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:54,892
Wow.

1110
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,727
This is the first time

1111
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,814

to fuck you.

1112
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,820
Huh.

1113
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,865
You, uh--you want to do
something about that?

1114
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,742
Oh, oh, William,
I don't think so.

1115
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,288
But just because
this is the first time

1116
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,498
doesn't mean
that it's the last.

♪ ♪

1118
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:25,089
Once a month, you could have
a fun weekend for yourself

1119
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,674
and you'd get to see
my big smile

1120

if it wouldn't
bother you too much.

1121
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,679
Oh, I don't think
seeing your smile

1122
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,764
would bother anyone.

1123
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,688
I thought you said
it was working.

1124
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,524
It was.

1125
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,028
I'll be right back.

1126
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,822
There are many cases
where a higher dose

1127
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,199
loses its effectiveness
fairly quickly

1128
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,703
because the patient
develops a tolerance.

1129
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:06,632
♪ ♪

1130
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,162
This makes the user
increase their dose again

1131
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,538
at a fast rate.

1132
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,916
And is that dangerous?

1133
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,125
Absolutely.

1134
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,627
It's one of the reasons
why overdose rates

1135
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,671
are so much higher
on OxyContin.

1136
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,631
These are
the new numbers,

1137
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,925

a significant difference

1138
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,053
from the initial
rollout figures.

1139
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,601
Better.

1140
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,811
Really great job, Richie.

1141
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,145
That's really great.

1142
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,898
Yes, yes, there's
been a definite improvement

1143
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,192
in the sales figures.

1144
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,945
We also found doctors who
attended the weekend seminars

1145
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,280
have been writing
twice as many prescriptions

1146
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,074
as doctors who don't.

1147
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,494
Then we should throw
more weekend seminars.

1148
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,040
But, um, more significantly,
doubling the dose

1149
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,168
not only solved
the breakthrough pain issue,

1150
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,295
it increased our bottom line,

1151
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,465
since manufacturing
a 20 milligram or 40 milligram

1152
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,469
is almost the same cost
as a 10 milligram.

1153
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,138
This is bringing in revenue

1154
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,683
at a much faster rate
than projected.

1155
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:44,311
There's a scenario
I've been concerned about.

1156
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,064
And what is that,
my dear cousin?

1157
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,526
Well, what happens if
someone has breakthrough pain

1158
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,321
and they're already
at 40 milligrams?

1159
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,244
The sales reports from last
quarter were terrific,
