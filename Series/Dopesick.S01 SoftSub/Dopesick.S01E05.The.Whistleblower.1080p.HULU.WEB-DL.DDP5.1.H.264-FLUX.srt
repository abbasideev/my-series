Not yet, but it is implied.

180
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,166
- I don't need implied.
- I need a direct link.

181
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,541
I need examples that show

182
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,207
reps dangerously pushing
higher doses for profit.

183
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,874
Well, we might find that
in the call notes.

184
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,749
We just completed
cataloguing all of them,

185
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,124
and a part of me thinks

186
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,791
that there could be
some information in there.

187
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,957
I need orders
from management,

188
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,874
not with the sales reps
or telling management.

189
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,041
Can I finish, Rick?

190
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:08,166
We might find something
that leads us to a sales rep

191
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,957
who's willing to flip
on the higher-ups.

192
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,499
How?

193
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,082
These call notes contain
everything that they wrote

194
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,207
to their managers
after every doctor's visit.

195
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,707
So maybe there's a rep
that said people are

196
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,291
getting addicted,
but they got ignored,

197
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,291

to talk about it.

198
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,124
We might find a whistleblower.

199
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,374
Right, well,

200
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,874
since we haven't found a
smoking gun in the higher-ups,

201
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,124
then whistleblower would be
our best bet, wouldn't it?

202
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,041
That is a wonderful idea,
boss,

203
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,874

204
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,416

change their mind?

They didn't.

209
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,999
Rick convinced the Virginia
Medicaid Fraud Unit

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,832

And this job requires

And sometimes you do
push too hard,

691
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,124
and your approach doesn't work.

692
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,832
Example:

693
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,041
Purdue requested
another meeting with us,

694
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,374

is going to join.

695
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,957
That means the press war
is already working.

696
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,957
It is,
but Purdue also requested

697
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,499
that you not attend
the meeting.

698
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,707
Is Purdue Pharma dictating
who attends DEA meetings now?

699
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:27,457
No, but there is a feeling
we might have more success

700
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,832
with a different approach,

701
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,166
since ultimately, we need them
to act voluntarily.

702
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,457
And if I go
for Sackler's jugular,

703
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,624
it might scare him to act.

704
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,832
Or not.

705
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,582
Sometimes being
a hard-ass isn't

706
