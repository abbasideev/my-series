The time has come

to redefine the nature of pain.

4
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,092
For too long,
the American medical community

5
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,887
has been ignoring chronic pain.

6
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:34,475
And this has created
an epidemic of suffering.

7
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:40,814
When we live with pain,

8
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:44,276
we are not living
our true selves.

9

We're not even living at all,

11
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,241
because the pain overtakes

12
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:54,870
our ability to think, feel.

when our patent
for MS Contin expires,

16
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,010
it will deliver a significant
blow to the company,

17
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:14,973
because it comprises
25% of our sales.

18
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,434
However, I have a solution.

19
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,730
I propose we take
the extended time-release

20
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:24,482
of the Contin system

21
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:27,861

22
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:32,073

to treat moderate pain

23
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:33,908

Dr. Peterson,
please tell the grand jury,

31
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:01,019
when did you first hear
about OxyContin?

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,650
Um, it was around
the summer of 1996.

33
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:08,859
A sales rep from Purdue Pharma

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,612
told me
that they had a new drug

35
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,531
that was very effective
in combating pain.

36
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,618
"Pain" was becoming
a big buzzword at the time.

37
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,036
There was a nationwide movement

38
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,038
to rethink
the treatment of pain.

39
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,832
Did Purdue Pharma
spearhead this campaign?

40
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,376
I believe they did.

41
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,045
I don't know if it was them
in particular,

42
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,090
but their sales reps
brought it up repeatedly.

43
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,175
The sales rep said
the drug was different

44
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,761
because it was basically
nonaddictive.

45
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:38,264
Had you ever heard
of a nonaddictive opioid?

46
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:39,516
No, sir, I had not.

47
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:41,101
And did he tell you
what percentage

48
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,977

49
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,230
That was the key

00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,572
Yeah, well,
it's, uh--

361
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,157
It sure is impressive,
isn't it?

362
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,242
You know, we even
churn our own butter.

363
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:22,244
So how'd you end up
in Abingdon?

364
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,705
- Well, I got a, uh--
- A clerkship with a judge

365
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,373
at the state courthouse
just down the block,

366
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:27,833
and this job came open.

367
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,544
He--he, uh--he tried
to talk me out of it.

368
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,045
Told me I'd be broke
my whole life,

369
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:33,589
but I thought, "What the hell?"

370
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,592
And, you know, honestly, it's
the best decision I ever made,

371
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:39,219
'cause I love working all
the different kinds of cases

372
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,721
and learning new things.

373
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:43,808
It's, uh--it's what
makes life interesting.

374
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:47,853
- What about you, Rick?
- How'd you end up here?

375
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,523
I just came here
to serve justice, sir.

376
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:53,442
We got multiple
bank fraud cases,

377
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:56,528
illegal arms, racketeering,
federal health care kickback.

378
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,197
Okay, yeah,
that all sounds good.

379
00:20:58,198 --> 00:21:00,657
Look, here's...

380
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,619
what I drove two hours
to say to you face-to-face:

381
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,078
I'm not afraid of risk,

382
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,414
not afraid to rattle the cages,
I'm not afraid to lose

383
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,124
if we're on the side
of the righteous.

384
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,753
And I want you not to be afraid
to think big.

385
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,671
Took this job
to get things done.

386
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,048
And when I leave here,
I'm gonna hit the road,

387
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,674
I'm gonna tell
every sheriff that I meet

388
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,301
that if they've got someone
in their community

389
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:21,386
that is violent,
that's a predator,

390
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:23,514
for whatever reason,
the state won't get it done,

391
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,141
bring it to us, and we'll throw
that son of a bitch in jail,

392
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:29,686
'cause we sure as hell
are gonna get it done.

393
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,356
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

394
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,610
You guys holding out on me?

395
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:38,154
Um...

396
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,448
Well, it's still very early,

397
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:44,660
but we've begun looking
at something that could be big.

398
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,370
Mm, what are we
talking about?

399
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,038
OxyContin.

400
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,415
Specifically Purdue Pharma.

401
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,875
That's the company
that makes it.

402
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,795
They've been marketing the drug
and pushing it on doctors

403
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,672
as something
that's nonaddictive,

404
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:58,131
when it clearly is.

405
00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:59,925
Has any other
U. S. attorney pursued?

406
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:00,926
No, sir.

407
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:02,135
Civil litigation?

408
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:04,429
What is it, 65 cases?

409
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,889
And how many has Purdue won?

410
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,516
- 65.
- Yeah.

411
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,893
Well, going after
a publicly traded company

412
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:11,770
is a pretty steep hill
to climb.

413
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,897
They're not publicly traded;
it's privately owned

414
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:16,149
by a single family,
the Sackler family.

415
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,527
Sacklers.

416
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,404
They're big philanthropists,
right?

417
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,114
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, they give lots of money

418
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,449
to museums and schools.

419
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,285
- Rich-person stuff.
- Very rich.

420
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:27,703
So what do you guys got

421
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:30,497
that no other U. S. attorney
in the country is onto?

422
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:32,791
Well, about four months ago,

423
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,251
I was reviewing our caseload

424
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,211
when I noticed
an unusual pattern.

425
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:39,339
Almost every case
over the last three years,

426
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,258
uh, was related to OxyContin.

427
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,759
Nearly every one.

428
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,179
Illegal drug sales, theft,
armed robbery, job abandonment.

429
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,141
I mean,
it has transformed

430
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:50,684
the entire district.

431
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,561
Jails are suddenly full.

432
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:54,354
Violent crime
is running rampant.

433
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:56,940
Uh, you know,
for the last 200 years,

434
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,318
folks around here
didn't even lock their doors.

435
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,402
Didn't even think about it.

436
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:01,945
Now, starting
three years ago...

437
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,238
Everyone locks their doors.

438
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,489
It's the single
highest source of crime

439
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,824
in the entire region.

440
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:06,909
Well, look,
if you guys want

441
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,410
to go after
a billion-dollar company

442
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,204
from a strip mall,
you're gonna need more evidence

443
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:14,124
than you can fit
in this entire building.

444
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,001
No other U. S. attorney
wants to touch this thing.

445
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:17,628
That means it's gonna take
something significant

446
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,254
to make it work.

447
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:20,756
You have to prove
the heads of this company

448
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:22,883
know that they're lying
about the dangers of the drug

449
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,426
and that
they're selling it anyway.

450
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,638
Well, we believe
that very well may be the case.

451
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,932
Since I've been
on this new medication,

452
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:32,309
I haven't missed
one day of work.

453
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,936
This frees me up.

454
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:36,229
And it helps with my anxiety.

455
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,815
You can just
take the medicine and go.

456
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:41,401
I can
take walks with my husband.

457
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:43,362
And I can go swimming.

458
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,613
All because
of the pain medicine.

459
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:45,739
Rick? Rick!

460
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,200
Would you get up here?

461
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,285
Uh-huh. Yeah.

462
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:51,828
Thank You, Lord, for this meal,

463
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,456
and allowing us
to enjoy it together. Amen.

464
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:57,584
- Amen.
- Amen.

465
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,461
You working
on that pharma thing?

466
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,714
Yeah. Napkin in your lap.

467
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:04,049
But it's tricky.

468
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,635
Uh, we'll be outspent
by millions.

469
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:09,054
And, uh, I'm looking at it,
you know,

470
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,556
and there's just--

471
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,558
There is something there.

472
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,228
It's just, uh, I can't quite
find a way to get at it.

473
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:17,771
I don't even know
what to charge them with.

474
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,106
- Hmm.
- Digging through

475
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:22,651
a mountain down there,
and I just can't find--

476
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,111
Can't find a way at it.

477
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,405
Well, what does the new,
handsome boss think?

478
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,699
He's ambitious,
so he likes it,

479
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,702
if we can find something
to get it going.

480
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,996
Aren't all U. S. attorneys
ambitious?

481
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,706
Wow.

482
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,583
She must really think
he's handsome.

483
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:41,628
Maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

484
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,131
for you to take on
something big that...

485
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:47,385
might scare off someone
who isn't as ambitious.

486
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,970
Well...

487
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,140
The DEA was actively
investigating Purdue last year.

488
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,933
What's the status
of the investigation?

489
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:58,603
About six months ago,
the DEA basically ended it.

490
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,856
No fines, no charges.

491
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:03,191
From what I can tell,
very few actions taken at all.

492
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:04,776
And she's Diversion?

493
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:07,487
Yeah.
This is Bridget Meyer.

494
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:10,532
She's the deputy director
of the Diversion Division.

495
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,575
Mm-hmm.

496
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,035
Try and say that
three times fast.

497
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,953
You think she's
gonna tell us what happened?

498
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:16,288
No.

499
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,581
You know, I had
to call her four times

500
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,623
just to get this meeting.

501
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:21,711
She, uh--she's got an edge.

502
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:24,629
All right, guys,
I don't have a lot of time,

503
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,089
so what do you want?

504
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,550
Well, we know about
your investigation into Purdue,

505
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:31,136
and we were hoping to find out
what you uncovered,

506
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,722
why it abruptly ended.

507
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:34,931
Did you find evidence

508
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:38,435
that they were illegally
promoting the drug?

509
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,772
Is there a reason you're
not answering the question?

510
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:47,069
Anything with the DOJ
is a waste of time.

511
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,029
So is that it? 'Cause
like I said, I'm really busy.

512
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,447
Right. I know. I know.

513
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,116
How can a couple hicks
from rural Virginia

514
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,869
take on a massive company
like Purdue Pharma?

515
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,871
You know, Rick here
is former army,

516
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,664
so he's been
all over the place,

517
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:00,999
seen lots
of different countries.

518
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,167
Been to France?

519
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:03,502
- Argentina.
- Argentina.

520
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:04,961
- South Korea.
- See?

521
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:08,298
And I even wore
my fancy no-lace shoes.

522
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,175
It'd sure be nice
if you could just have

523
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,762
a reasonable conversation
with us.

524
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:22,729
"Delayed absorption, as
provided by OxyContin tablets,

525
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,651
is believed to reduce
the abuse liability of a drug."

526
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,862
Barely makes sense.

527
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:33,115
That fucking label
caused everything.

528
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,491
How so?

529
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,493
It was the first time
the FDA labeled

530
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,079
a Class II narcotic
as less addictive.

531
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,081
Now, how does that
even happen?

532
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,833
That's a great

You're probably
already familiar

768
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,540
with our drug MS Contin.

769
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:16,043
Used to treat severe pain,
many patients with cancer.

770
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:17,712
MS Contin
is a very good drug.

771
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:20,464
So what Purdue did is,
they took the same system,

772
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,924
uh, the Contin system,

773
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:25,428
and they produced a opioid
for chronic and moderate pain.

774
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,556
I would never prescribe
a narcotic for moderate pain.

775
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:32,351
There's a pretty long history
down here of pill abuse.

But it is.

779
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:43,696
The FDA actually created
a special label

780
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:47,950
to say that it's less addictive
than other opioids.

781
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,535
