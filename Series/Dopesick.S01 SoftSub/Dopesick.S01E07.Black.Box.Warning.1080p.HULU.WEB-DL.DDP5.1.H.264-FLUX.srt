You can fine a company,
but you can't put it in jail.

182

Because a company
feels no pain.

183

184

186

187
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,624

marketing materials.

188

some hard evidence

190

All right.

191
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,707
Morning, Ms. Moles.

192
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,791
It's Randy Ramseyer, U.S.
Attorney's Office Abingdon.

193
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,416
We talked about four years ago.

194
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,416
Sorry, I'm late for work.

195
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:02,082
Oh, should we talk
at the FDA instead?

196
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,624
I had a couple questions
about Curtis Wright,

197
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,707
specifically the OxyContin
label that he approved.

198
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,957
You know, actually,

199
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,166
we got a bunch
of unanswered questions

200
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,124
and we're not afraid
to open up our investigation

201
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,832
to individuals
beyond Curtis Wright.

202
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,957
You're referring to me?

203
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,582
I'm referring to anybody
at the FDA

204
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,166
who played a part in that
approval process, ma'am.

205
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,416
We got Purdue sales reps
using that warning label

206
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,749
to sell OxyContin
as basically nonaddictive.

207
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,332
And the guy that approved it
went from working at the FDA

208
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,457
to working for Purdue Pharma
for $379,000 a year.

209
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,624
I mean, it looks to me like

210
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,624
he sold out the health
of the nation.

211
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,957
And I just need to know

212
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,082
if he was promised a job
for that approval.

213
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,999
- I have no idea.
- I wasn't part of that process.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,375
Now, I have to go to work.

215
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,832
A few years ago,
I had cancer.

216
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,041
And I'm fine now,
but at the time,

217
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,457
when I was in the hospital,

218
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,457
well, I very easily could've
become addicted to Oxy.

219
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,499
And it wouldn't have been
the disease that killed me,

220
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,250
it would've been my medication.

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,624
I got lucky.

222
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,625

223

Please just tell me what you
know about that warning label.

something rotten going on here.

227
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,957
I heard that

228
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,916
about a year
before the drug was approved,

229
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,207
Purdue rented out a hotel suite
in Rockville

230
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,499
down the road from the FDA,

231
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,666

of the medical review,

00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,541

of safety and efficacy.

237
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:54,291

write their own review.

Did--
