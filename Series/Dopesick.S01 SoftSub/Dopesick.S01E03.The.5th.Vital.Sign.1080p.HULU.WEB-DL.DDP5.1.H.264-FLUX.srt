00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:03,734
Today,
we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:05,361
a medical condition
known as breakthrough pain.

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:07,655
We were curious as to
why nobody says OxyContin

4
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:10,533
in a video designed
to promote OxyContin.

5
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:12,159
I'm at a loss for words.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,827
It's just changed my life
for the better.

7
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,412
We just did
what they wanted.

8
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:17,414
They said, "Make a PSA,"
so that's what we shot.

9
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,333
This drug has
only been on the market

10
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,960
for three years,
and there's already been

11
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,754
a spike in overdoses
and crime rates.

12
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,840
Purdue Pharma is doing
my people a great service,

13
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,218
so God bless 'em for it.

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,554
What happens if someone has
breakthrough pain

15
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,931
and they're already
at 40 milligrams?

16
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:36,225
It is time
to double the dose again

17
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:38,060
as I present to you,

18
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:39,520

Pulse rate,
body temperature,

22
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,916
blood pressure,
respiration rate.

23
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:45,461
These are the four vital signs.

24
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:46,670

life-sustaining functions

26

should these indicators
be off standard levels.

28
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:58,432
But I would argue

29
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,850
that if we want to ascertain

30
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,227
the true health
of our patients,

31
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:04,438
then these four vital signs
are not enough

32
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,400
because they do not
monitor pain.

33
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,943
From pain,

34
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:13,947
we can instantly determine
if a patient is suffering.

35
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,157

of a patient's health

37
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,204

- Good.
- That's what I wanna hear.

45
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:51,318
So it's been four weeks.

46
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,655
I wanna taper you off the meds.

47
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:57,658

We are getting reports

84
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,860
that doctors have had
a lot of success

treating breakthrough pain
by doubling the patient's dose,

86
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:02,241
so this got us thinking
that perhaps there's a way

87
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:05,577
to prevent breakthrough pain
before it even begins,

88
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,539

89
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,960
Why start someone
at 10 milligrams

90
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,588
if they really need to start
at 20 milligrams, or even 40?

We don't know the needs
of a specific patient

92
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:21,176

so we need to let

93
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,761
physicians and nurses know

94
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:25,265

If we can obtain
a relaxed status,

we'd be uncontrolled there.

much stricter than the FDA,

00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:00,055
Okay.

712
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:01,683
You asked to speak
to me, sir?

713
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,938
Stay out
of Diversion's domain.

714
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:10,524
You made a presentation,
and we listened.

715
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,359
But in no way did this
give you the right

716
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,569
to start
an independent investigation.

717
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,029
I understand, sir.

718
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,573
And I immediately gave
everything I uncovered

719
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:22,327
to Diversion,
but I believe we must pursue.

720
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:23,328
Why?

721
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:25,205
Agent Spellman told me

722
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,749
that the reason we can't pursue
an OxyContin case

723
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,669
is that there is no cartel
to go after.

724
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,087
The drug is here legally

725
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:33,964
and opioids are now
widely accepted

726
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:35,924
in the medical community.

727
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,385
But I believe
I found the cartel.

728
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,011
- Oh, you have?
- Yes, sir.

729
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,513
I even have their address.

730
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:45,016
201 Tresser Boulevard,
Stamford, Connecticut.

731
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:47,310
That's the main headquarters
of Purdue Pharma.

732
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,146
They are the makers
of OxyContin,

733
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,523
and they are the cartel, sir.

734
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,483
They are lying to doctors
and patients

735
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:56,153
about the dangers of the drug,
and they are forcing pharmacies

736
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,405
to carry it with threats
of lawsuits if they don't.

737
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,866
And the FDA is
an unwitting coconspirator

738
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,993
because they issued Purdue
a warning label

739
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:05,954
that gives them cover to say
that the drug is less addictive

740
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:09,624
than other opioids
when it's clearly not.

741
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,169
Could the FDA be colluding
with Purdue?

742
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,171
It's possible.

743
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:17,299
The individual who approved
this highly unusual wording

744
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,343
on the warning label
now works for Purdue.

745
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:21,762
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

746
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:24,848
Curtis Wright.
We need to act now.

747
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,726
We have to go after
Purdue Pharma now, sir.

748
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:28,811
Right now.

749
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:36,443
How attached are you
to your service pistol?

750
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:37,944
Why do you ask?

751
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:42,616
Diversion agents aren't
allowed to carry firearms.

752
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,367
Are you transferring me?

753
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:46,328
No.

754
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,872
No, I'm promoting you.

755
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:50,582
I'd like you to be
deputy director

756
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,542
of the diversion division.

757
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:54,837
They need someone with balls
over there.

758
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:58,674
I accept.

759
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,553
Congratulations, Bridget.

760
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:05,388
I believe you're now
the highest ranking woman

761
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:08,558
in the DEA.

762
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,726
Thank you.

763
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:11,019
Oh, hey, Doc.

764
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,438
This is Rick Mountcastle,
U. S. Attorney's office.

765
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,357
See, uh, we wanna ask you
a few questions

766
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,692
about a case
that we're working on.

767
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,110
Sure.

768
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,696
So Randy described a scenario
in which his nurse

769
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:24,407
was quite forceful
about him taking OxyContin.

770
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:25,742
Is that standard?

771
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,077
What do you mean?

772
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,537
I mean, is there
some sort of hospital policy

773
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:31,957
to push OxyContin?

774
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,417
The hospital can now get sued
if the patient felt

775
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:36,795
that we didn't manage
their pain properly.

776
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:38,839
Or they can write us
a bad review online,

777
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,050
which would cause the staff
to be rebuked by management.

778
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,553
Nurses have been fired
over online reviews.

779
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:46,304
Is that just this hospital?

780
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:48,890
No. All across the country.

781
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,475
Internet has really
changed things.

782
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:52,143
Online reviews
have caused a shift

783
00:38:52,144 --> 00:38:54,354
in national opioid prescribing?

784
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:58,191
♪ ♪

785
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,610
How are you feeling?

786
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:02,362
I'm a little better.

787
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,406
I appreciate it, Doc.
Thank you.

788
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:07,159
- All right.
- Well, I'll check back in.

789
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:13,415
The older nurses hate it.

790
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:14,667
All the opioids.

791
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:23,008
I wanted to show you this.

792
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:25,969
Pain societies have
infiltrated the hospital rooms,

793
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,597
and they love their pamphlets.

794
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:31,641
I never heard that phrase
before today,

795
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:33,519
and now it's everywhere I look.

796
00:39:36,814 --> 00:39:39,733
Thank you all
for coming.

797
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:42,569
I'm Roger Thurby from the
Appalachian Pain Foundation.

798
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,614
We're here tonight to discuss
opioids in our community.

799
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,657
We know they've been getting
a lot of attention lately

800
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:51,286
and there's been some folks
struggling with addiction,

801
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:54,122
so we decided to gather experts
on the situation

802
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:55,540
and discuss it publicly.

803
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,167
First, I'd like
to turn the microphone over

804
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:59,502
to Ms. Barbara Mullins,
who's on the editorial board

805
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:00,962
of the "Journal of Pain."

806
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,256
Thank y'all
for having me here tonight.

807
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:05,675
Opioid abuse is
certainly growing,

808
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:08,970
but it's important
to distinguish between abusers

809
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,765
and legitimate pain patients
who need these medicines.

810
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:13,600
So is this a consensus?

811
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,519
Pills aren't the issue,
it's the addicts abusing them?

812
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,230
Absolutely, but I also
think it's important

813
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,316
the pharmaceutical industry
does a better job

814
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,692
working with law enforcement

815
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:25,487
to keep these products
out of the hands of abusers.

816
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:28,239
They have some responsibility
here too.

817
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,950
Uh, my sciatica was so bad

818
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:31,993
I couldn't even get up
in the morning.

819
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:34,579
And right when I finally
get back to normal,

820
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,539
I'm terrified my drugs
are gonna be pulled

821
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,958
'cause of these junkies.

822
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,250
Absolutely not, ma'am.

823
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:40,585
We are doing everything
in our power

824
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:42,088
to make sure
you get your medication.

825
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:48,051
- Yes, sir, in the back.
- Hi.

826
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:50,553
Um, I've been hearing
from some folks

827
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:52,472
the real problem is,
OxyContin is

828
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:55,976
much more addictive
than its maker claims.

829
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:58,979
- Is there any truth to that?
- No, it's a misconception.

830
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,605
Vicodin is actually
being abused

831
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:02,691
at a much higher rate
of its total sales.

832
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:04,109
That's right.
Much higher.

833
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,112
And actually, Vicodin is
potentially bad for your liver.

834
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:08,822
I personally wouldn't use it.

835
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:10,031
I wouldn't either.

836
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:11,574
It has addictive qualities,

837
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:15,162
whereas less than 1% of people
become addicted to OxyContin.

838
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:25,338
- Hey. How you feeling?
- I'm good. I'm good.

839
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:27,465
- How y'all doing?
- Good. We missed ya.

840
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:28,758
Hey, the guys are
in the conference room.

841
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,427
Get in here and talk
to these maniacs.

842
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:33,013
Pain Society has been
pushing them for years,

843
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:37,392
and once pain became accepted
as the fifth vital sign, yeah,

844
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:40,061
J-Co went from anti-opioid
to pro-opioid.

845
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,230
- Hey, Gregg!
- Hey.

846
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:45,150
Conversation sounded like
a barrel of laughs.

847
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,069
Mind if I grab a sarsaparilla
and join y'all?

848
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:49,404
Brother,
when you said one week,

849
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,239
you really meant it.

850
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,700
Randy, how are you feeling?

851
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:55,702
I think I just might be
in the clear.

852
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:57,120
Everything's negative.

853
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,664
That's wonderful news.

854
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:04,002
So what have we got
on these pain foundations?

855
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:05,170
Totally legit, right?

856
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:07,672
Just a bunch
of straight shooters.

857
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:10,842
- Yeah.
- Humanitarians of the year.

858
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:13,094
Uh, started with the
Appalachian Pain Foundation.

859
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:17,140
Pulled their tax returns,
and you were spot-on, Rick.

860
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:20,477
In 2000, they got a $20,000
grant from Purdue Pharma

861
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:24,189
to literally start
their organization.

862
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,274
What tipped you off?

863
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,609
When they were
pushing OxyContin

864
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,612
and trashing Vicodin.

865
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:31,738
Subtle.

866
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:33,198
Did you find
Purdue connections

867
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,618
with other pain societies?

868
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,206
Gentlemen,
it is time to buckle up.

869
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,500
The American
Pain Society claims

870
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,085
to be
an independent medical group

871
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:47,295
representing physician
pain specialists,

872
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:49,297
but it receives a sizable
portion of its funding

873
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:50,632
from the drug industry,

874
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,802
including significant grants
from Purdue Pharma,

875
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:55,553
who are one
of the biggest beneficiaries

876
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:57,889
of the society's
successful effort

877
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,101
to make pain
the fifth vital sign.

878
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:03,019
Purdue also spent heavily

879
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,772
to subsidize the American
Academy of Pain Medicine

880
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:07,565
and, in 1997,

881
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:11,694
spent $500,000 to underwrite
the work of a joint committee

882
00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:14,823
formed by these two groups,
which issued a report

883
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:17,951
urging the broader use
of powerful narcotics.

884
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:21,162
Now, Purdue also
contributed generously

885
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:22,872
to patient advocacy groups,

886
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:25,583

for the Treatment of Pain

887

and the American
Chronic Pain Association,

888
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:31,047
but in effect, they helped fund

889
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:33,591
an entire network
of pain groups

890
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:36,636

as independent,

891
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:40,765
but all heavily promoted
the use of opioids.

Uh, permission to approach
the bench, Your Honor?

893

Now, you might recognize
this pain chart,

894
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,693
as, uh, it's in hospital rooms
and doctor's offices

895
00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:53,153
all across the country.

896
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,446
It's from the organization
Partners Against Pain,

897
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:57,282
which is ostensibly
an educational alliance

898
00:43:57,283 --> 00:43:59,868
dedicated to the treatment
of pain,

899
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,661
but, in fact,

900
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:03,788
it is fully funded and run
by Purdue Pharma.

901
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:08,084
It is 100% Purdue-owned.

902
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:10,503
In effect,
it's Purdue's shadow company,

903
00:44:10,504 --> 00:44:12,130
which has infiltrated

904
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:15,508
hospital rooms
and doctor's offices

905
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:18,761
as a stealth tool
to prompt pain discussions

906
00:44:18,762 --> 00:44:20,805
between doctors, nurses,
and patients

907
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:22,473
with the goal
of prescribing more opioids--

908
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:25,268
Objection. Conjecture.

909
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,103
Purdue has never hidden
its relationship

910
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:28,479
with Partners Against Pain.

911
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,398
Then why not put Purdue
Pharma on these pain charts

912
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:31,524
instead of
a different company name?

913

Partners Against Pain
also has a website

916
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:41,784
masquerading
as a patient advocacy group

917
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:44,704
to guide pain sufferers
to specialists,

918
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:46,623
but every specialist
that it sends you to

919
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:50,585
is a doctor with a very high
rate of prescribing OxyContin.

divisions for big pharma.

923
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:04,098
The deception is so effective
that some sales reps at Purdue

924
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:06,851
thought they were using
independent data

925
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:09,229

from the American Pain Society

with slogans like, "Pain is
the fifth vital sign."

927
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:15,485
And, of course,
the solution for pain

928
00:45:15,486 --> 00:45:20,990
is always, always
an increased use of opioids.

929
