00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,107
(GIGGLING)
Hey. You ready?

2
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,409
Hm?
Ah, all right.

3
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,144
All right.
Secret sign.

4
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,246
Hey. Ryan?

5
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,180
Very good.

6
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,282
Excellent, excellent.

7
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,118
DWIGHT:
Michael.

8
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,627
MICHAEL:
Today, at lunchtime,

9
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,130
we are going to be playing
the warehouse staff

10
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,797
in a friendly little game
of basketball.

11
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,299
My idea.

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,634
The last time I was
down there, I noticed

13
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,236
they'd put up
a couple of hoops.

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,805
And I play basketball
every weekend,

15
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,108
so I thought, pfff,
this might be kinda fun.

16
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,344
And so I start messin' around.

17
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,346
And, uh, I'm sinkin' a few.

18
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,181
You know?
Swish, swish, swish.

19
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,149
Nothin' but net.

20
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:25,486
And, uh, their jaws
just drop to the floor.

21
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,190
African-Americans. Um...

22
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:32,360
But, you know, it's really just,
uh, a good friendly game.

23
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,328
A reason for everybody
to get together.

24
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,664
Pam-Pam,
thank you ma'am!

25
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,299
Messages, please.
Thank you.

26
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,401
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please, privately?

27
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,870
Uh...
In your office?

28
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,274
I think I should be
on the team.
No.

29
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,409
(CLEARS THROAT)
And that's not me
being mean, Dwight.

30
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,910
That is based
on your past behavior.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
Oh, please.

32
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,381
When I let him, uh,
come to my pick-up game.

33
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,648
I apologized for that.
I vouched for you.

34
00:01:54,682 --> 00:02:00,321
Michael--
I vouched for you in front
of Todd Packard, Dwight.

35
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,689
(CLEARS THROAT)

36
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,358
(TOY PLAYS JINGLE)

37
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,462
All right,
here's what I'm gonna do.

38
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,565
The hand strikes
and gives a flower.

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,534
You are not going
to play basketball.

40
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,403
Oh.
But...

41
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,371
I need somebody to come in

42
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,374
and take over the holiday
and weekend work calendar.

43
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,476
I can handle that.
Good.

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,178
Excellent.
It'll be fun.

45
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,447
Yeah.
Because corporate, uh,

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,317
wants somebody to be here
on Saturday, and so we're gonna

47
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,352
have to have a couple of people
come in on the weekends.

48
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,886
And I know nobody's
gonna wanna do it.

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,423
And everybody's
gonna complain and bitch,

50
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,291
and I don't wanna have
to deal with it.

51
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,759
And that's why you have
an Assistant Regional Manager.

52
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,262
Yes, it is.

53
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,364
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.
Same thing.

54
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,266
No, it's not.
It's lower, so...

55
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,934
It's close.

56
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,806
So we need someone
to work this Saturday.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,576
And I think
that that should be...

58
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,577
Jim.

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,412
God, this is so sad.

60
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,314
This is the smallest
amount of power

61
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,351
I've ever seen go
to someone's head.

62
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,685
Phyllis, can you
believe this?

63
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,588
Keep me out of it.

64
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,891
My fiance has plans
for us this Saturday,

65
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,361
so I really hope Dwight
doesn't make me work.

66
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,896
Maybe I should
sleep with him.

67
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,366
I'm kidding.
(LAUGHS) Kidding.

68
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,733
Totally kidding.

69
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,734
MICHAEL:
All right.

70
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:25,439
Managing...by walkin' around!

71
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,276
This is our warehouse,

72
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,512
or, as I like to call it,
the "whoorehouse."

73
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,647
But don't you call it that.
I've earned the right.

74
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,249
Fine.
Don't worry about that.

75
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:39,620
And here we have
Mitta Roger's neighborhood.

76
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,422
Come on over here.
Hey!

77
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,392
This is Ryan.
He's tempin' upstairs.

78
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,225
What's up?

79
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,727
And this is the foreman,
Mitta Rogers.

80
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,396
That's not my real name.
No.

81
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,665
It's Darryl.
Darryl is Mitta Rogers.

82
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,666
Darryl Rogers?

83
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,802
Darryl Philbin.
Then Regis.

84
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,405
Then Rege. Then Roger.

85
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,341
Then Mitta Rogers...
Then Mitta Rogers.

86
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,942
(LAUGHS)
And that is Lonny.

87
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,943
And this is Roy.

88
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,944
Roy dates Pam.

89
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,679
You know, the, uh,
the best-lookin' one upstairs.

90
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,714
RYAN:
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,416
You still gettin'
it regular, man?

92
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,720
Huh? I mean, I can tell her
it's part of the job.

93
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,022
Rapport.

94
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,591
No, n-n-no, I know that
the warranty's expired,

95
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,527
but isn't it supposed
to last longer than two years

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,530
if it isn't defective?

97
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,598
Okay, fine, three years.

98
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,667
JIM:
Pam gets a little down.

99
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,369
Her toaster oven broke.

100
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,972
Um, which she got
at her engagement shower,

101
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:37,911
um, for a wedding that
still has yet to be set.

102
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,315
And that was three years ago.

103
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,984
So! Um, 1:00 sharp
and we've got a game on.

104
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,419
We're loadin' at 1:00.
Oh, I see.

105
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,388
You're, uh,
you're chickenin' out.

106
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,322
You're bailin' on me.

107
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,791
No, we got a truck
goin' out at 1:15, so...

108
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,526
Uh-huh.
That's the busy time.

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,962
Oh, well, I'm glad that
some time is a busy time,

110
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:00,334
because whenever I'm down here,
doesn't seem too busy to me.

111

Oh. You can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

What's that supposed
to mean?

in my driveway.
No.

Can I be team captain?
No, I'm team captain.

Can I be team manager?
No, I am the team manager!

You can be assistant
to the team manager.

No.

this weekend then.

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,041
Jim, you're in charge
of the vacation schedule now.

176
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,676
Oh, my God.

177
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,812
Threat neutralized.

178
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,197
MICHAEL:
Off the backboard!

179
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,866
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

180
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,100
Please don't throw
garbage at me.

181
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,069
Oh, Pam with a zinger.
(LAUGHS)

182
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:53,874
Hey, Pam, how would you like
to be our cheerleader today?

183
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,209
You know?
Some, uh, pigtails.

184
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,079
Little, uh, halter top.
You could tie that up.

185
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,682
And, you know, somethin'
a little just youthful,

186
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,050
for a change,
just this once.

187
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,852
I don't think so, Michael.

188
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,887
Besides, I can't cheer
against my fiance.

189
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,589
JIM:
I'll do it.

190
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,091
Wear a little flouncy skirt
if you want, and...

191
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,025
Yeah, I bet you would.

192
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,094
Just try not to be
too gay on the court.

193
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,064
And by gay,
I mean, um...

194
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,000
you know, not in
the homosexual way at all.

195
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,234
I mean the, uh,
you know,

196
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,636
like the bad at sports way.

197
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,171
I think that goes
without saying.

198
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,606
PAM:
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,207
MICHAEL:
Oh, yeah, right.
I'll do it.

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,076
Oh, yuck!
That's worse than you playing.

201
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,744
(MICHAEL SIGHS)

202
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,914
'Cause you know what,
we need you

203
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,316
as an alternate, in case
somebody gets hurt.

204
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,752
That's where we need you.

205
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,089
Blessed be those
who sit and wait.

206
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,191
You made it!

207
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,293
Suit up.
You're on the team!

208
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,764
All right.
Cool!

209
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:53,100
Very good.

210
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,068
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

211
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,936
It's a spy
from the warehouse.

212
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,671
Tryin' to figure
out our plays, huh, man?

213
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,772
Just gettin' a tea bag.

214
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,140
(LAUGHS)
Ooh.

215
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,842
He's runnin'.
He's runnin'!

216
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,144
He's runnin', but he can't hide,
because you know what?

217
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,146
1:00, you better bring
your "A" game.

218
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,183
Because me and my posse guys
are gonna be in your face.

219
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,084
Right in your face!

220
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,121
Why don't we make
it more interesting?

221
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,056
Loser buys dinner
at Farley's.

222
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,126
Oh-ho, I like
the way you think.
Yeah.

223
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,894
You know what, I'm gonna
take that one step further.

224
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,964
Loser works on Saturday.

225
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,167
No...

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,235
That's not as much fun.

227
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,705
(CLUCKING)

228
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,840
You know what?

229
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,941
Oh! What?

230
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,876
You on.
Okay.

231
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,611
Cool!

232
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,179
You're on.

233
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,816
(CLUCKING)
Don't screw this up.

234
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:54,227
Classic beginner's mistake,
eating before a game. Tck!

235
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,996
(MICHAEL CLEARS THROAT)

236
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,244
Has anyone seen
the first aid kit?

237
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,749
How many times
have I told you?

238
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,950
I'm the safety officer.

239
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,252
Not you.

240
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,240
Basketball was kinda my thing
in high school.

241
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,276
And I'm--Yeah.
I'm looking forward to playing.

242
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,813
You know, I think I'm gonna
impress a few people in here.

243
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,715
JIM:
You comin' down?

244
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,816
Yeah, I'm just
forwarding the phones.

245
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,450
You gonna wish me luck?

246
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,053
Yeah, you're gonna need it.
Whoa.

247
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,055
Is that trash talk
from Pam?

248
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,858
I'm just saying,
Roy is very competitive.
Oh.

249
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,192
And he wants to take
the waverunners

250
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,328
to the lake
this Saturday, so...
Wow.

251
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,698
Well, I'm goin' to
the outlet mall on Saturday.

252
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,835
So if you wanna save
big on brand names

253
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,102
and Roy has to work,

254
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,906
which he will,
because I'm also competitive,

255
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,775
you should feel free
to come along.

256
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:19,747
Um, I think I'm gonna be
up at the lake.

257
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,115
I think I'll see
you at the mall.

258
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,416
Yeah.

259
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,786

(DOOR OPENS)

261
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,256
Hey.

262
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,959
There he is.
Secret weapon!

263

(CLAPPING)

264

MICHAEL:
All right, you guys.
Come on.

265
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,203
Let's bring it in.
Here we go.

266
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,106
Okay.

267
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,877
Listen, this is just going
to be a friendly game, right?

268
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,045
We are all
on the same team here.

269
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,181
The Dunder Mifflin team.

270
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:58,118
Of course, if you
beat us, you're fired.

271
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,853
That's a joke.

272
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,122
(MICHAEL LAUGHS)

273
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,223
Okay!

274
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,392
Let's do it!

275
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,459
Have a good game, man.

276
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,796
Yeah, you too.
Should be fun.

277
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,030
All right, everybody,
stretch out a little bit.

278
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,964
Stretch it.

279
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,366
Full stretch.
Ryan, you want to stretch?

280
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,235
I stretched
before I came.

281
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,539
Okay, Ryan, you have Darryl.

282
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,074
I have Roy.
Really?

283
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,342
I thought
I'd take Roy.

284
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,211
No, actually,
I think Roy's

285
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,813
their best player,
not Lonny.

286
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,147
So Dwight,

287
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,950
you have
the East German gal.

288
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,325
Um, okay.

289
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,927
All right, you guys?

290
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,928
Okay, we'll be skins.

291
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,196
Oh, come on, Dwight.

292
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,364
What?

293
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,233
Shirts, on or off?
On. Just put it on.

294
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,101
You sure?
Yes.

295
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,170
Pam, you kind of have
your foot in both camps here.

296
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,172
Why don't you do
the jump ball, okay?

297
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,506
Don't listen
to him, Pam.

298
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,843
Trust me. Tip it my way
or you're sleeping in the car.

299
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,780
Stanley!

300
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,084
What?

301
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,219
You gotta be kidding me!

302
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,290
Here we go!

303
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,291
Who's on him?
Who's on him?

304
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,193
Somebody get him!

305
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,227
That's what
I'm talking about.

306
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,231
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

307
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,933
Over here!
Over here!

308
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,168
Three!

309
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,603
Let's go to zone.
Let's go in the zone!

310
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,239
Defense!
Defense!

311
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,142
TEAM:
Defense. (clapping)
Defense. (clapping)

312
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,146
MICHAEL:
Who's got him?
Who's on Roy?

313
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,389
Whoo!

314
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,159
Oh, come on!

315
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,496
What is wrong with me today?
Usually hit those.

316
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,304
Dwight, I was open.

317
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,907
All right, let's go.

318
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:05,979
Oh.

319
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,982
Okay, foul.
Charging. Charging.

320
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,251
That's a foul.

321
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,286
MICHAEL:
Okay, I'll take it.

322
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,677
When I am playing hoops,

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,013
all of the stress
and responsibility

324
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,915
of my job here
just melts away.

325
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:42,950
It's gone.

326
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,051
Three!

327
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,685
I'm in the zone.
What's with me today?

328
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,921
Who am I?
Am I Michael Scott?

329
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,190
I don't know.

330
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,624
I might just be
a basketball machine.

331
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:55,162
What's Dunder Mifflin?
I've never heard of it.

332
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:55,929
Filing, paperwork?

333
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,099
Who cares?
Possible downsizing.

334
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,301
Um...

335
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,336
Well, that's--that's probably
going to happen, actually.

336
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,405
Jim! Jim! Jim!
Right here!

337
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,274
Jim, give me the ball.
Ryan, cut.

338
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,343
My bad.

339
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,449
Here we go.
They don't want
none of that.

340
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,985
There you go.
There you go.
Uh, uh, uh.

341
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,686
Where you at?
Where you at? Where you at?
Uh. Oh.

342
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,621
You over there?
I'm over here.
Yeah. Mm.

343
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,190
Here. Uh.
That is cool.

344
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:26,226
Is that like the robot?

345
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,262
(CHEERS)

346
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,264
Come here.
There's no free throws.

347
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,001
Can we just do one?
That's cool. That's fine.

348
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,268
All right, let's go.

349
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,305
MICHAEL:
Don't get hurt.

350
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,040
Back off, man!

351
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,675
Come on!
Hey, Dwight. Dwight.

352
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,514
Yeah!
In your face!

353
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,149
Yeah, like that counted.

354
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,550
Hey! Hey, you know what?
Dwight. Dwight.

355
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,085
Football is like
rock and roll.

356
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,987
It's just * buh buh boo

357
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,256
And basketball
is like Jazz, you know?

358
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,525
You're kind of
* doop be doo

359
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,028
* doop be doo
It's all down beat.

360
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,462
It's in the pocket.

361
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,032
It's like * blee dee dee
bloo doo doo blah da da *

362
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,568
("SWEET GEORGIA BROWN")
* Do do do do do do do

363
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,772
* Do do do do do

364
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,773
Harlem Globetrotter.

365
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,243
(HUMMING TO HIMSELF)

366
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,382
* Doot doo doo doo doo doo
Your ball.

367
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,117
MICHAEL:
All right, time.
Time out.

368
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,753
Come on, sales.
Over here.

369
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,156
Bring it in!
Come on!

370
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,324
What's goin' on?
What is goin' on?

371
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,759
You guys are playing
like a bunch of girls.

372
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,095
You know what,
let me take Roy.
All right, we'll switch.

373
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,197
Take it up a notch.
Come on.

374
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,745
DWIGHT:
Shoot it. Shoot it.

375
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,614
(SMACK)

376
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,249
MICHAEL:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

377
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,485
Foul. Naked aggression.

378
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,720
Oh, that is...

379
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,555
You all right, Jim?
Suck it up.

380
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,458
He's afraid of you now.

381
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,828
MICHAEL:
Ouch!

382
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,829
Oh, how much
does it hurt?

383
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,365
How much
does it hurt?

384
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,213
MICHAEL:
Yes!

385
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,381
What the hell, man?

386
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,382
Take it easy.

387
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,750
No, you take it easy.

388
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,157
Watch the long passes,
you guys.

389
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,329
Same team, Dwight.

390
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,330
MICHAEL:
Dwight.

391
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,697
Yes!

392
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,836
MICHAEL:
Yeah! Yeah!

393
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,271
Yeah!

394
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,373
In your face!

395
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,842
Hazel,
what's the score?

396
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,244
You're ahead.

397
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,346
Yeah, baby!
Here we go!

398
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,880
Jim. Jim.
Right here.

399
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,649
Ow, God!

400
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,452
Okay! Foul! Foul!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,486
You all right?
God!

402
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,520
Oh, that hurts.

403
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,322
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What's your problem, man?

404
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,757
I didn't mean to do--
God!

405
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,559
Just clocking me
for no reason.

406
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,294
ROGER:
Take your shot, man.

407
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,728
No, no, no, no.

408
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,464
That was a flagrant
personal intentional foul.

409
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,465
Right there.
No, it wasn't.

410
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,633
Yes, it was. You know what,
I'm just being fair.

411
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,402
No, really, you were
bearing down on me.
No, no, no, no.

412
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,371
I just put my arm up--
Game over! Game over!
Game over!

413
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,806
MICHAEL:
That is it.
I'm sorry, you know?

414
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,376
I hate to do it this way,
but, you know,

415
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,577
that's just--

416
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,345
We were having
a friendly game.

417
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,714
It's a shame.
This is a damn shame.

418
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,283
But, you know,
we're like a family here

419
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,184
and that's just--
that won't fly.

420
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,419
This is a cold pack.
Here, give me that.

421
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,455
You have to break
the interior bag.

422
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,456
Thanks, Dwight.

423
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,192
Wait, what does that mean?

424
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,893
What is it, a tie?
What's going on?

425
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,496
Well, let's just say
whoever was ahead won.

426
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,597
That was you.

427
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,265
That was us, really?

428
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,600
I didn't--I didn't know.

429
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:58,705
Great. I mean, I guess
you guys working Saturday.

430
00:18:58,738 --> 00:18:59,939
Your face.

431
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,309
No, no, no.
I'm not coming in on Saturday.

432
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,876
Yeah,
this isn't happening.

433
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,347
Uh...

434
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,749
Well, guys, you know...

435
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,684
I am the boss.

436
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,453
So what--what's that?

437
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,322
We--we coming in
on Monday, right?

438
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,962
Monday?

439
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,666
You guys believed me?

440
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,701
Come on.

441
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,370
Dawgs, you know,

442
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,374
you should know me
better than that.

443
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,676
Do you think that would've
been good for morale?

444
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,311
No. No. No.

445
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,513
Exactly. No.

446
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,948
I'm embarrassed
it was even that close.

447
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,417
No, of course,
we're coming in Saturday.

448
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,855
ROY:
Good game.

449
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,292
Word.

450
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,623
So I talked to this gal.

451
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,991
Looks good.

452
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,693
I haven't signed anything.

453
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,927
Hey, baby.
Hey.

454
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,265
Look at Larry Bird.
Larry legend.

455
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,301
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's pretty good, huh?

456
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:39,539
Let's get you into a tub.

457
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,873
Yeah, let's get you
in a tub.

458
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,476
(PAM LAUGHING)

459
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,846
Hey!

460
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,016
What a game, huh?
What a game.

461
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,684
What time
do we have to come in?

462
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,354
Come on.
Let's not be gloomy here, man.

463
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,523
We're all in this together.
We're a team.

464
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,732
You know what?
Screw corporate.

465
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,634
Nobody's coming in tomorrow.

466
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,402
You have the day off.

467
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,804
Like coming in an extra day
is going to prevent us

468
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,606
from being downsized.

469
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,408
Have a good weekend.

470
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,311
The great thing
about sports

471
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:22,715
is that it is all
about character.

472
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,652
And you can learn lessons
about life

473
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,521
even if you don't win.

474
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,623
But we did because
we were ahead.
