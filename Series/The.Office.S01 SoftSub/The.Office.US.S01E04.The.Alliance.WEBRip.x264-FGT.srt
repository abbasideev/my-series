1
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:37,271
Michael.

2
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,806
D'oh! God!
Dwight, come on!

3
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,374
I wanted to talk to you
about the downsizing--

4
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,709
There's no downsizing.
Ai'ight.

5
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:42,843
But if there were,
I'd be protected

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,412
as Assistant
Regional Manager?

7
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,779
Assistant to the Regional
Manager, Dwight.

8
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,615
Yeah, so I don't
have to worry, right?

9
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,716
Look, look, look--

10
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,084
I talked to corporate

11
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:51,285
about protecting
the sales staff,

12
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,653
and they said they
couldn't guarantee it

13
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,088
if there's
downsizing, okay?

14
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:56,290
But, there's no downsizing,
so just don't--

15
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,526
Bottom line--
do I need to be worried?

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,429
Mm mm mm...maybe.

17
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,664
MICHAEL:
It looks like there's gonna
be downsizing.

18
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,168
And it's part of my job,
but...blech.

19
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,669
I hate it.

20
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,605
I think the main difference
between me and Donald Trump

21
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,775
is that, uh, I get no pleasure
out of saying the words,

22
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,444
"you're fired."

23
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,678
[AS TRUMP]
"You're fired."

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,813
"Uh, you're fired."

25
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,282
He just makes people sad,

26
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,617
and an office
can't function that way.

27
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,519
No way.
"You're fired."

28
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,887
I think if I had
a catchphrase,

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,822
it would be,
"You're hired.

30
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,292
And you can work here
as long as you want."

31
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,127
But, that's
unrealistic, so...

32
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,332
DWIGHT:
It's a real shame.

33
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,434
Because studies have shown
that more information

34
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,835
gets passed through
water cooler gossip

35
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,803
than through
official memos.

36
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,308
Which puts me
at a disadvantage because...

37
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,543
I bring
my own water to work.

38
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,412
Why'd you do this?

39
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,646
DWIGHT:
I didn't do it.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,881
What do you mean?

41
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,317
Oh, the water cooler
was brought over here

42
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,320
for...maintenance.

43
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,555

Now, I think I've had
a little stroke of genius,

48
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,736
in that I have had
my assistant Pam--

49
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,837

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,540

and find out whose birthday

51
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,541
is coming up,

52
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,943
so we can have a little
celebration for them.

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,412
Not bad!
Not bad at all!

54
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,413

59
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,360
Um, actually,

60
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,895
we don't have any staff
birthdays coming up.

Well, I was
just gonna say

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,555
maybe we could
have streamers,

88
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,258
but that's dumb,
everybody has streamers.

is kind of whoreish.

we flip a coin,

she doesn't like to gamble.

Of course, by saying that,

101
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:12,786
she was gambling
that I wouldn't smack her.

to figure out

and who is protected...

to get back at him,

but only in ways
that would get me arrested.

"No, Jim, here's a way."

00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,988
Wait, this isn't gonna work.
The lid's open.

359
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,890
So, tape it down.

360
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,991
I can't do that.

361
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,359
Then you won't be able
to breathe.

362
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,028
Look, I can breathe
just fine, okay,

363
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:42,429
but if it makes you
feel better,

364
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,031
I'll poke holes
in the box.

365
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,899
Thank you.
Thank you. Okay.

[DOOR OPENING]

367
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,304
Surprise!

368
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,040
Oh! Surprise!

369
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,041
No, it's a--

370
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,976
It's surprise, Meredith!

371
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,177
MICHAEL:
One, two,

372
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,547
* Happy Birthday to you *

373
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,548
Find the key...

374
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,983
* Happy Birthday *

375
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,584
So, you want me
to stay here

376
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,320
and, you know,
stand next to the box, or--

377
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,121
No!

378
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,290
You need to go upstairs
to the party

379
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,025
so people don't notice
that we're both gone.

380
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,393
Right. That's good.

381
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,064
Can I trust Jim?
I don't know.

382
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,067
Do I have a choice?
No. Frankly, I don't.

383
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,236
Will I trust Jim? Yes.
Should I trust Jim?

384
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,106
You tell me.

385
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,476
* Happy Birthday,
dear Meredith *

386
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,612
* Happy Birthday to you

387
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,415
* And many more *

388
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,223
You were surprised,
weren't you?

389
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,224
Yes.

390
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,993
You looked freaked, man.

391
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,395
We said, "Surprise,"
and you were, like, "What?

392
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,297
What the hell's
goin' on here?"

393
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,066
Good cake.
Why don't you have some?

394
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,101
I...I can't, um.

395
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,335
C'mon. A little bit.
A little bit.

396
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,303
No, no, I can't eat dairy.

397
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,371
Oh, right. Oh, God.
Too bad, it's so good.

398
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,406
Yeah, it makes me sick.

399
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,208
You know what?

400
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,210
If I were
allergic to dairy,

401
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,344
I think I'd kill myself.

402
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,847
'Cause this is way,
way too good.

PAM:
He's in a box?

404
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,154
JIM:
Pam, he's in a box.

405
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,423
He's downstairs
in a box

406
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,958
on the floor
near the shelves.

407
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:18,992
[LAUGHS]

408
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,393
I'm serious.
Go down there.

409
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,428
And work your magic...

410
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,499
PAM:
Hey, where are you?

411
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,537
Yeah, we were supposed
to meet here.

412
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,571
What?

413
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,608
Oh, my gosh!

414
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,110
That ties in perfectly

415
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,313
with something that Michael
was telling me earlier.

416
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,416
I just don't know
what some of the people in,

417
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,086
like, accounting,
are gonna do.

418
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,554
It said specifically that...

419
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,289
Oof...

420
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,290
Oh...

421
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,259
Hey, Jim.

422
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,293
Good party, huh?

423
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,328
Just a little something
I...whipped up, you know,

424
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,396
a little morale boost.
Yeah?

425
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,264
No big deal.

426
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,431
Speaking of which,
I meant to tell you.

427
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,699
Very impressive.

428
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,469
The, uh, donation you gave
to Oscar's charity.

429
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,503
Oh.
What was that, 25 bucks?

430
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:07,674
Yeah, well, you know,
money isn't everything, Jim.

431
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,442
It's not the key
to happiness.

432
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,378
You know what is?

433
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,545
Joy.

434
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,181
You should remember that.

435
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,716
Maybe you'd give
more than $3.00 next time.

436
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,986
Yeah, well, $3.00 a mile

437
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,054
is going to end up
being, like, 50 bucks.

438
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,055
So...

439
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,590
God, I can't even calculate

440
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,226
what you're gonna
have to give.

441
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,600
Is Oscar around?

442
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,602
I just thought
it was a,

443
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,738
kind of a flat,
you know, $25

444
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,473
one-time donation.

445
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,342
I didn't think it was
a per-mile kinda deal,

446
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,743
you know, so...

447
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,479
Well...that's what
a walk-a-thon is.
I know--

448
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,081
It says it right
on the sheet.

449
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,216
Look, look at the sheet.

450
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,384
It says it's however
many dollars per mile.

451
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,987
Right. Got it.
Yes. So, it does.

452
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:54,988
Um...

453
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,356
I just think
it's kind of cheap

454
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,590
to "undonate" money
to a charity.

455
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,292
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,494
I-I wasn't--that wasn't
what I was...no.

457
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,530
I-I-It's not about
the money.

458
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,698
It's just...

459
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:11,038
it's the ethics
of the thing, Oscar.

460
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,405
How's your nephew?

461
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,074
Is he in good shape?
Yeah.

462
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,608
How many miles
did he do last year?

463
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,010
Last year,
he walked 18 miles.

464
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,511
Son of a bitch.

465
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,147
That is impressive!
Good for him.

466
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,636
Happy birthday,

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,704

Read it out loud.

468
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,073
And say who
wrote everything,

469
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,108
so we know
whose is the best.

470
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,111
"Happy Bird-Day."

Because of the downsizing.

you're gettin' old.

No, I get it--
it's funny.

So...that's cool.

That's--you know what?

493
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:44,164
Actually, I have
a bunch of these...

494
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,365
good ones
that I didn't use.

She wants her age back
and her divorces back."

been divorced,

Well, if everybody...
could do it.

Well, that wasn't even mine.

515
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,773
I got that off

516
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,807
so, don't
get mad at me...

517
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,875
Uh...

518
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,877
Nice party, Michael.

519
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,780
This isn't my fault.

520
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,781
Um, ladies,

521
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,583
not your best effort.

522
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,584
The streamers?

523
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,186
I think we could have
done better than that,

524
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,220
don't you think?

525
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,789
Phyllis wanted red.
I didn't.

00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:43,823
Oh, boy, you...

527
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,159
Okay, wait--
all right, people,

528
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,761
hold on, hold on,
hold on just a second, okay?

529
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,796
I think we're losing sight

530
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,864
of what is really
important here.

531
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:56,936
And, that is
that we are a group of people

532
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,471
who work together.

533
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,808
I was--I really wasn't
gonna flaunt this.

534
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,944
I have made
a very sizeable donation

535
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,681
to Oscar's nephew's...

536
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,751
Walk-A-Thon.

537
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,752
$25.

538
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,753
Per mile.

539
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,887
Per mile, yes.

540
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,458
When I retire,
I-I-I don't want to just

541
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,294
disappear
to an island somewhere.

542
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,396
I want to be the guy
who gives everything back.

543
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,898
A check for the kids.

544
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:26,699
And for the team.

545
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,535
MICHAEL:
I want it to be like,

546
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:32,439
"Hey, who donated
that hospital wing...

547
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,441
that is saving
so many lives?"

548
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,876
"Uh, well, I don't-
I don't know.

549
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,811
It was anonymous."

550
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:43,450
"Well, guess what?
That was Michael Scott."

551
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,652
"But, ah...
it was anonymous,

552
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,988
how do you know?"

553
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,624
"Because I'm him."

554
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:55,995
Thank you, Michael.

555
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,664
MICHAEL:
Come here.

556
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,999
Don't cash that
until Friday, okay?

557
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,269
Really? Today?
Yeah.

558
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,737
Oh. Happy Birthday.
Thanks.

559
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,738
I could say something--

560
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,907
Don't do that.
Okay.

561
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,943
Okay, okay--
I have something

562
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,446
that totally
tops the box!

563
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,781
Oh, tell me!
Tell me!
Okay.

564
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,349
I have just
convinced Dwight

565
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,718
that he needs
to go to Stamford,

566
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,919
and spy on
our other branch.

567
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,720
No, no, no.

568
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,722
JIM:
But before he does so,

569
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,624
I told him that he should
dye his hair

570
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,692
to go undercover.

571
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,026
[LAUGHTER]

572
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,496
If we can get him
to drive to Connecticut

573
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,363
and put peroxide
in his hair--

574
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,631
[DOOR SLAMS]
What the hell is this?

575
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,732
What, are you trying

576
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,600
to cop a feel
or somethin', Halpert?

577
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,934
No, dude, no--
Dude, no, I was just--

578
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,969
listen--whoa--

579
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,305
God, I don't even--

580
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,806
I don't even know
how to explain this.

581
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,007
Um, uh...

582
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,009
Dwight asked me
to be in an alliance.

583
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,010
[LAUGHS]

584
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,380
And, then, um,
um, we were--

585
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,848
we've just been
messing with him,

586
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,883
uh, because of the whole
alliance thing.

587
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,884
Um...

588
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,052
It's just office pranks.

589
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,454
It's stupid.
It's just office pranks.

590
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,522
An alliance?

591
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,557
What the hell's
he talking about?

592
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,760
I have absolutely no idea.

593
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,333
C'mon.

594
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,671
DWIGHT:
Do I feel bad
about betraying Jim?

595
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,073
Not. At. All.

596
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,742
That's the game.

597
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,344
Convince him we're
in an alliance,

598
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,546
get some information,
throw him to the wolves.

599
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,448
That's politics, baby.

600
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,450
Get what you can
out of someone,

601
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,817
then crush them.

602
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,018
I think Jim
might have learned

603
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,321
a very valuable lesson.
