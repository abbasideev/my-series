1
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,769
It's cold.

2
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,734
Good. Thank you.

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,821
There's a new girl
at the ice cream store.

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,533
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

5
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,034
Let's go check her out.

6
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:57,564
What are we
supposed to be doing?

7
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,995
It's almost 4:00.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,663
You got somewhere to be?

9
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,791
We know he likes
to manipulate people.

10
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,918
He's probably testing us.

11
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,669
To find out what?

12
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,505
How long we can
look stupid for?

13
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,467
He said he'd be here by 3:00.

14
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,260
He's obviously not coming.

15
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,764
- I'm going home.
- Nobody follow her.

16
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,392
She Pied Pipered nine people
right out of a job last week.

17
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,942
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

18
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,070
New patient, 37-year-old male.

19
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,364
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

20
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,199
- Why are you late?
- To see who'd put up with it.

21
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,867
So, if we'd have left,
we would have been fired?

22
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,828
I was going to fire
whoever stuck around,

23
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,996
but since
everyone stuck around...

24
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,712
28% curvature of the spine
has caused reduced lung capacity

25
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,558
and he has reduced
the bone mineral density.

26
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,883
The patient has
spinal muscular atrophy.

27
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,719
It's genetic, incurable.

28
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,471
This is not
a diagnostic mystery.

29
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,266
You have just given
the state secrets to the enemy.

30
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,393
- What enemy?
- New patient, new rules.

31
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,062
Today, you're going to
split yourselves into two teams.

32
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,314
The first to figure out what's
threatening to deprive the patient

33
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,567
of the 20 or so
miserable years he's got left

34
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,236
with SMA
gets to keep their jobs.

35
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,655
Take off your numbers.
You look stupid.

36
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,260
And I think I know
who you are by now.

37
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,950
Wait, how do you
want us to split up?

38
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,579
Good question,
Overly Excited Former Foster Kid.

39
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,957
There's 10 of you. I was thinking
six against six? No, wait.

40
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,584
How about women versus men?

41
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,336
Excellent suggestion, Fat Twin.

42
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,338
More interesting
than evens versus odds.

43
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,049
Less interesting
than shirts against skins.

44
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,344
If your sex organs dangle,
you're the Confederates.

45
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,556
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing, you're the Yanks.

46
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,767
Dr. House?
I'd like to be on the men's team.

47
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,729
Do your sex organs dangle,
Cutthroat Bitch?

48
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,023
Not yet.
You've never hired more

49
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,025
than one female
on your team before.

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,943
If you're going to
purge an entire gender

51
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,737
it isn't going
to be the danglers.

52
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:59,699
Sounds logical, if you don't think
about it for more than three seconds.

53
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,368
I just told you that
if the danglers lose, they're out.

54
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,913
So, I can only assume
you're hiding the real reason.

55
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,831
You don't think the women
will be aggressive enough,

56
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,958
will be good enough at science.
They'll be too emotional.

57
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,418
Can I switch teams?

58
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,130
If the danglers are okay,
I'm okay.

59
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,174
- We're not okay.
- I get it.

60
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,052
You don't like me because maybe
I'm a little bit competitive.

61
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,011
Manipulative.

62
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,846
"Cutthroat Bitch"
is your official title.

63
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,432
It's a game. You can either play
for fun or play to win.

64
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:27,435
If you want to win,
you want "Cutthroat".

65
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,395
No, thank you.

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,940
First thing we have to
do is get inside his head.

67
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,274
It's not psychological.

68
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,443
I'm not talking about the patient,
I'm talking about House.

69
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:38,196
He's insane,
but he's not irresponsible.

70
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,657
He wouldn't be playing this game
if he didn't already know the answer.

71
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,583
The first thing we do
is gang-bang the sucker.

72
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,411
There's five of us.
We can run dozens of tests.

73
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,622
We don't need a theory.
We just need brute force.

74
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,332
What about the assist dog?

75
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,543
Picks bacteria-infested things up
with its bacteria-infested mouth,

76
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,670
hands them over to the guy...

77
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,505
It's not the dog, wouldn't be fair.

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,507
- To who?
- Whom.

79
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:00,218
The men.
House knows I used to be a vet.

80
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,720
If the dog's the answer,
they'd be at a handicap.

81
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,055
What about the dog?

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,556
Assist dogs put
everything in their mouth.

83
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,849
Money, doorknobs...

84
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,102
- Great.
- That's not what I said.

85
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,987
- Why do you think a low sodium...
- I don't.

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,064
Patient took a trip to Thailand
two weeks ago.

87
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,692
Hey, write bigger and angle the board
more so they can see it.

88
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,651
This is wrong.

89
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:17,986
It's only wrong
if they cheat off us.

90
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,237
And if they cheat off us,
they're wrong.

91
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,281
They're not cheating,
but one of them is moving.

92
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,706
Hey. Stop playing with your sutures
or I'll have to re-do them.

93
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,251
Why do you guys keep a D-cell battery
in a urine specimen cup?

94
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,378
Because we pulled it
from a patient's intestine.

95
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,714
Why would somebody
swallow a battery?

96
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,091
Why do you assume
it was swallowed?

97
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,051
Bed five needs a bag
of Ringer's lactate.

98
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,846
Would have been worse
if he'd used a nine-volt.

99
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,931
Who said it was a "he"?

100
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,474
False assumptions. You're good.

101
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,934
You're trying to get me
to think like him.

102
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:53,438
And you're trying to kiss my ass.
Why are you talking to me?

103
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,483
Because House is turning patient care
into a game. It's dangerous.

104
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,695
The patient's going to suffer.
Maybe die.

105
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,704
Wow! You really need a shave.

106
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,457
See what I did there?

107
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,667
Whoa.

108
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,760
Interesting.

109
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,890
I need a crash cart in here!

110
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,901
I didn't do it.

111
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,404
When a person faints,
it's because they're

112
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,947
not getting enough blood
to their brain.

113
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,158
The act of falling
corrects the problem.

114
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:50,912
You faint again strapped into
that power chair where you can't fall,

115
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,288
you might not wake up.

116
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,082
Killed by an assistive device?

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,875
At least my death would be ironic.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,959
I think when you
went to Thailand,

119
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,629
you picked up a threadworm
called strongyloides.

120
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:00,963
They usually go up
through your feet.

121
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,132
I didn't do a lot of walking
on the beach.

122
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,219
But I assume you did have someone
lay you down in the sand.

123
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,598
Bare back, bare legs increases
exposure tenfold over bare feet.

124
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,769
Two pills.
You'll be all better.

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,650
Can I have some water
for those, please?

126
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:25,738
Hey, take a number!

127
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,240
House didn't say anything
about taking turns.

128
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,282
What's she testing you for?

129
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,244
Don't. They'll spend all day
obsessing over my idea

130
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,538
instead of coming up
with one of their own.

131
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,706
And, hey, I might be wrong.

132
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,552
Seriously.
I'm worried that if we don't know

133
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,001
what she's given you,
there could be conflicts.

134
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,169
No, you're not.

135
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,296
House told me
he's keeping track of all that.

136
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,174
Ten doctors.
I should be getting ten cures.

137
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,802
We need blood, hair, and stool.

138
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,097
You poop and then you use the wooden
sticks to collect the fecal matter,

139
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,723
then rub it on the green box.

140
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,016
Hand it to my dog.

141
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,685
Only one of those things
I can do on my own.

142
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,855
And the last couple of days,
I haven't been doing that.

143
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,983
Is it all right with you
if we carry you into the bathroom?

144
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,778
If you want me there, that's the way
you're going to have to do it.

145
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,787
Okay-

146
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,122
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

147
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,207
One, two, three.

148
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,127
Can I get a little head support, please?
Thank you.

149
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,314
Why are you here?

150
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,192
My offices are being used
by my teams.

151
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,028
Teams?

152
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,197
Which means this is the only place
where you can yell at me.

153
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,823
You have "teams"?

154
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:51,782
Two of them.

155
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:53,428
I wanted to deal
with the yelling today

156
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,869
because I noticed
what you were wearing,

157
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,663
and I wouldn't have to listen
all that closely.

158
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,124
You can't make a competition
out of patient care.

159
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,920
Without competition,
we'd still be single cell organisms.

160
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,380
- Can I go now?
- Not until after the yelling.

161
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,385
What's wrong with him?

162
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,634
I have seven of
the finest minds on it.

163
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,801
Along with three very special...

164
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,095
You wouldn't be doing this
unless you already knew.

165
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,805
I tell you, you tell them.
Game's over.

166
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,933
If you know,
you are obligated to treat...

167
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,936
Well, then, in that case,
I don't know.

168
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:24,398
Why would a guy voluntarily shove

169
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,817
a metal object
into an electrical socket?

170
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:30,363
I'm getting closer and closer
to knowing the answer.

171
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,615
What would happen
if I shut down this game?

172
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,701
I'd fire them all,
hire 40 new fellowship applicants

173
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,371
and start the game
all over again.

174
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,289
You do know what's
wrong with him, right?

175
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,334
It would be pretty irresponsible
if I didn't, wouldn't it?

176
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,715
Antibiotics aren't working.

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,134
Legionella could
explain the lungs, the fever.

178
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,637
If she had Legionella,
she'd have low sodium.

179
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,639
What can you tell me about her?

180
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,932
She likes body surfing.

181
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,643
Maybe picked up a virus
swimming off Jones Beach.

182
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,145
But she doesn't even have the energy
to finish her crossword anymore.

183
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,230
Her boyfriend said...

184
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,731
That's it.

185
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,191
- What is?
- Blurry vision.

186
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,117
How do you get blurry vision
from not being...

187
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,655
You don't stop a daily ritual
that cures boredom because you're bored.

188
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,260
She stopped doing
her crossword puzzle

189
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,002
because she's having
a hard time reading it.

190
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,911
What causes fever, boggy lungs,
and blurry vision?

191
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,122
Fungal
Aspergillus would explain

192
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,541
the pneumonia,
which explains the fever.

193
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,376
Start her on amphotericin.

194
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:29,380
Hey, guys. Great job.

195
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:43,394
If you were going to try to take
yourself out, why choose electricity?

196
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,855
You eat a bullet,
jump off a building...

197
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,982
I love the team thing,
by the way.

198
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,484
Bury yourself alive
in Cuddy's cleavage.

199
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,155
Teamwork, collaboration,
all for the greater good...

200
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,449
It could have been
a suicidal gesture

201
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,617
as opposed to
an actual attempt.

202
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,412
Interestingly,
the rain in Spain doesn't

203
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,290
actually fall
in the plain all that much.

204
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,209
But who puts
their internal organs

205
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,295
on a skillet
just to get attention?

206
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,130
Go ask him.

207
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,884
That would be cheating.

208
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,638
Got a diagnosis yet?

209
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:20,639
Get out of here.

210
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,058
Got a stool sample yet?

211
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,017
How could you know?

212
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,312
Oh, I talked to a nurse.
Pretty brilliant, huh?

213
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:29,565
I give you a move House will love
straight from one of his former fellows

214
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,983
and you let me join your team.

215
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,319
You're too late.
We already have our diagnosis.

216
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:36,781
He's lying because
he wants you to go away.

217
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:37,740
So do I.

218
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,116
How do we know
you're not a double agent?

219
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,035
Find out what we're thinking
then go back to the women.

220
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,079
Because I don't care
what you're thinking.

221
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,045
You want to know why
I want to be on your team?

222
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,165
Because you're idiots.

223
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,959
If I can get the women
out of the competition, I'm in.

224
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,961
And so are two of you.

225
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,351
So what's the big move?

226
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,645
It's called xenodiagnosis.

227
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,898
We let these bugs bite you,
then we test their feces for parasites.

228
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,775
Why can't you test my feces?

229
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,277
Because you've been chugging
milk of magnesia for the past hour.

230
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,613
You've got a lot going in
and nothing coming out.

231
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,325
Testing the bugs' feces is actually
more accurate than testing yours.

232
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,078
Smaller haystack,
easier to find the needle.

233
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,292
You okay? Get the bugs off him.

234
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,090
- Get the bugs off him!
- The test isn't done.

235
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,633
He's choking!

236
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,687
<i>Patchy infiltrates
on the X-ray, but patient</i>

237
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:53,065
<i>improved with chest PT and oxygen,
consistent with aspiration.</i>

238
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,401
So, now we have
another symptom to explain.

239
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,696
Why does his throat think
his lungs are his stomach?

240
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,950
And why are your
throats closing up?

241
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,618
Shouldn't we be in separate rooms?

242
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,463
You think I'm going to run
two differentials

243
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,914
at this time in the morning?
Grumpy, you're first.

244
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,874
I'm not grumpy.

245
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,543
Well, why would I call you that
if you weren't?

246
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,462
It's an unusual combination.

247
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,839
Unusual equals
exotic equals foreign.

248
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,674
It has to be connected
to his trip to Thailand.

249
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,301
You practice medicine overseas?

250
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,511
I was with Doctors Without Borders
for eight years.

251
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,847
- Ta-da!
- It's in my file.

252
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,141
David Blaine hides
the six of hearts in a beer bottle.

253
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,726
It's still impressive.

254
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,645
- You like exotic. Why are you here?
- I want this job.

255
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,605
Parent sick?

256
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,523
No. I... I just...

257
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,941
This is not the job you want.

258
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,776
This is the job
in the zip code you want.

259
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,028
You engaged?

260
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:39,987
Yes.

261
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:40,946
Ta-da!

262
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,574
Am I not allowed to grow up
and change my priorities?

263
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,951
You're allowed to.
People usually don't.

264
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,453
This is not a new symptom.

265
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,705
Our patient has
spinal muscular atrophy.

266
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,624
He has documented trouble swallowing.

267
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:52,875
The choking is not new.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,169
So, if it's nothing new,
what caused the old?

269
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,339
Strongyloides worms explain
the fainting. We already treated...

270
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,259
So, he's all better,
woman who... Thirteen.

271
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,260
He hasn't gotten any worse.

272
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,305
That's a pretty passive approach
for the daughter of an alcoholic.

273
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,389
Wrong again.

274
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:10,142
We could stress his system,
put him on a tilt table.

275
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,479
If he stays conscious, it means
we made the right diagnosis and we win.

276
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,022
Then, why haven't you?

277
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,069
Six against four.

278
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,531
One of the men is going
to have to join the women's team.

279
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,574
On the other hand,
one of the men isn't

280
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,911
an actual doctor,
so I guess it's pretty fair.

281
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,331
Men, you're in the penalty box.

282
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,749
Who's not the doctor?

283
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,793
Glad you asked about that.

284
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,796
The reason I'm penalizing you
is time management.

285
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,715
In diagnostics,
you're always working against the clock.

286
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,240
The women came up with a theory
and they treated the patient.

287
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,581
You guys just
sat around in a lab,

288
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,347
hoping a series of blind tests
would give you a theory.

289
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,016
You wasted the patient's time.

290
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,060
Now, I'm going to waste yours.

291
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,979
Her gums are turning yellow.

292
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,273
Whatever it is,
it's in her liver now.

293
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,149
Fungal fit perfectly.

294
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,569
We were wrong.

295
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,814
And we're going to keep being wrong
until we're right.

296
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,322
Or until she dies.

297
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,116
Yeah. That was very helpful.

298
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,744
Need a team to tell me
we're mortals.

299
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,790
Look. I'm sorry. You're right.

300
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:19,587
Doesn't hurt to be reminded that
we're dealing with real stakes, here.

301
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,965
Liver failure is a bad thing,
but it's also a clue.

302
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,883
What does it tell us?

303
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,937
I can't let you leave
if I think you're still suicidal.

304
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,023
I wasn't trying to off myself.

305
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,860
No, that's right, you were
just trying to kill the wall.

306
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,738
I check this box,
and your next roommates

307
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,907
are going to be
Jesus and Crazy McLoonybin.

308
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,869
That guy never had a chance.

309
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,746
It's going to sound stupid.

310
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,623
Suddenly, you're shy?

311
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,625
You pooped your
pants in front of me.

312
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,877
It's one of the nasty
side effects of dying.

313
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,344
Last Saturday
I got in a car crash.

314
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:12,723
A drunk driver came over the line
and hit me, head on.

315
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,017
It was like slow motion.

316
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,978
I saw these headlights,

317
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,064
then,

318
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,524
I saw...

319
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:31,075
Paramedics said I was
technically dead for 97 seconds.

320
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:38,707
It was the best 97 seconds
of my life.

321
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,549
Okay, here's what happened.

322
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,803
Your oxygen-deprived brain
was shutting down.

323
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,598
A flood of endorphins
and serotonin was released.

324
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,183
That's what gave you the visions.

325
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,145
No. Believe me.
It wasn't chemicals.

326
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,190
I've done every hallucinogenic
there is.

327
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,276
This was way bigger than that.

328
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,657
There's something out there.

329
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,953
Something more.

330
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,332
Hey, can I have my knife back?

331
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,583
Nope.

332
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,422
Who the hell isn't a doctor?

333
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,798
House said we can't talk.

334
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,258
He meant we can't talk about the case.

335
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,468
House is just jerking us around.

336
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,428
That's what he does.

337
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,971
You're not curious.

338
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,723
Only one reason
you wouldn't be curious.

339
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,225
We should talk about the case.

340
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,977
He's punishing us for wasting time.

341
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,663
Maybe we shouldn't
be wasting this time.

342
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,772
Close that door.
You're going to get us all fired.

343
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:47,568
We need to find a link
between fainting and trouble swallowing.

344
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,821
We need to know if it's dysphagia
or full-blown achalasia.

345
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,156
Paraganglioma.

346
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,950
How would a nee-plastic growth
in his abdomen explain...

347
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,452
Not his abdomen. In his neck.

348
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,746
A carotid body tumor
causes trouble swallowing.

349
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,166
Food presses against the vagus nerve
and causes the fainting.

350
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,085
So, if this guy has cancer,
we get to keep our jobs.

351
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,370
If he's healthy, we're fired.

352
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,504
We need a CT to prove it.

353
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,590
And we need the women not to
figure it out while we're sitting here.

354
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,969
And does House's computer
have a built-in microphone?

355
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,916
There is a potential toxicity
with an experimental treatment.

356
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,417
I was never here.

357
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,549
Blood pressure is remaining stable
through 60 degrees.

358
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,302
No pauses on his EKG, no nausea.

359
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,970
Our treatment worked.

360
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:57,930
I need our patient.

361
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,848
Syncope's cured, Amber.
It's over.

362
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,937
You obviously haven't stressed
his system hard enough.

363
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,647
<i>You crank it up high enough,</i>

364
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,856
anyone will pass out.

365
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,734
This is incredible!

366
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,070
This is the most
I've moved in 20 years.

367
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,116
The tilt table test
showed that the patient's EKG,

368
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,803
BP and pulse
remained normal, despite...

369
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,662
Who are you, Thirteen?

370
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,497
My name's in the file.

371
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,123
The fact that you won't
answer my questions

372
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,929
tells me more about you
than answers could.

373
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,001
No, it doesn't.

374
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,044
We turned the thing up
to 95 degrees...

375
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,421
You don't think that non-answers
tell me anything?

376
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,423
Sure. Just not as much
as actual answers.

377
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,675
That's why they're called answers.

378
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,926
They tell me
you're hiding something.

379
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,052
Tells you
I'm hiding everything.

380
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,857
Tells me you've got something
worth hiding.

381
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,181
Was it Turkish prison?
Gay porn?

382
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,517
You killed a man just 'cause he was
asking too many questions?

383
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,018
Can I finish reporting on the patient?

384
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,144
No need.

385
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,773
See you in an hour or so.
Got to set some stuff up.

386
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:58,407
Thank you all for coming
to tribal council.

387
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,453
A man of your integrity,
I feel I can trust, Big Love.

388
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,832
And I don't call you that
'cause you're a Mormon.

389
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,625
Where's your team's sixth man?

390
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,544
She went rogue.
Broke the rules.

391
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,380
You also sinned. You have no right
to cast the first stone.

392
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,306
And atheists have no right
to quote scripture.

393
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,717
The rules said, "No talking."

394
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,802
I told them not to talk.

395
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:18,760
Out loud.

396
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,554
We were trying to save a man's life.

397
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,306
Key word being "trying".

398
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,225
Tilt table test confirmed
that you guys were wrong.

399
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,353
You're fired.

400
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,190
The prodigal son returneth.

401
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,400
You're also fired.

402
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,986
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

403
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,614
We were right about the area,
wrong about the diagnosis.

404
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,783
Turns out the esophagus
is just straightening. It's scleroderma.

405
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,493
Explains the syncope
and the choking.

406
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,453
He needs steroids.

407
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,787
You did a CT scan?

408
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,415
- Obviously.
- After you were already proven wrong?

409
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,083
Good for you.

410
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,461
It's too bad you're wrong.

411
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,838
Straightening indicates weakening,
not hardening.

412
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,132
SMA explains the weakening.

413
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,093
Strongyloides infection
explains everything else.

414
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,555
You ladies have the honor
to give the patient a feeding tube.

415
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,766
Discharge him.
Show up for work tomorrow.

416
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,770
The rest of you...
You're a disappointment.

417
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,397
You make me
want to stop dangling.

418
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,992
It was the best
two weeks of my life.

419
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:28,246
I think I will miss you most of all,
Ridiculously Old Fraud.

420
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:38,994
Do you think
House could be wrong?

421
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,175
I thought he fired you.

422
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,343
No. He fired the men.

423
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,809
I don't think he's wrong.

424
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,227
If he is, how would I prove it?

425
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,812
I just said
I don't think he is.

426
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,606
Well, thinking
isn't good enough.

427
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,567
You have to run a blood test
for anticentromere antibodies.

428
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,236
Would you mind
running the labs?

429
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,195
You can't.

430
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,154
Well, I can, but...

431
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,407
No, I was making a statement.

432
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:04,574
You've been fired.

433
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,201
So, you no longer
have lab privileges.

434
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,244
You weren't
coming here for advice.

435
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,080
You were coming here
to con a favor to save your job.

436
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,374
Sorry. I'm not working
for him anymore,

437
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,793
but he can still
make my life miserable.

438
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,006
And you have a chance
to make his life miserable.

439
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,219
I'm insulted.

440
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,055
You conned Cameron by
appealing to her humanity...

441
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,557
I told her what
she wanted to hear.

442
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,475
And you told me
what you thought I wanted to hear.

443
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,187
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives are more interesting.

444
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,941
I cannot believe he fired you.

445
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,402
Go draw his blood.

446
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll meet you in the lab
when I'm done here.

447
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,747
Guess you didn't find your tumor.

448
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,041
The other doctors tell
you that you were fine?

449
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,836
Yeah, in the sense it's just
my disease getting worse.

450
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,925
You come to terms
with this disease.

451
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,722
You know it's there.
You know it's waiting.

452
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,059
And every now and again
it takes something away.

453
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,065
Took my walking.
Took my modesty.

454
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,402
Now, it's taking one
of my last pleasures.

455
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,738
Well, there's an outside shot

456
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,143
that something
other than the SMA

457
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,949
is causing your
eating problems.

458
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,369
And if it is, we can fix it,
remove that tube.

459
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,005
Is that my blood? It's green.

460
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,175
What does that mean?

461
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,015
It means I'm not fired.

462
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,727
Is he a Vulcan?

463
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,356
If no, what makes
Nimoy bleed green?

464
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,690
Are we officially un-fired?

465
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,776
How do we know she didn't fake
the green blood?

466
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,319
'Cause that would be stupid.

467
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,031
And while she may be manipulative,
borderline evil, shallow...

468
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,158
They get it. I'm not stupid.

469
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,993
What contrast did
you use for the CT?

470
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,870
- ICM.
- His kidneys aren't working.

471
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,541
They didn't filter the contrast,
which, in ICM, is green.

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,918
Ten points.

473
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,712
Okay, let's add kidney failure
to our list of symptoms.

474
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,318
What are these points?
Is that how you're deciding who to fire?

475
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,759
I'm going to fire the next person
who asks me who I'm going to fire.

476
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,044
Now we're on the point system?

477
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,053
What happened to
men against women?

478
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,012
Forget the game.

479
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,055
What do you mean,
forget the game?

480
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,141
I mean, forget the damn game!

481
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,810
This guy's kidneys are failing.
We need to diagnose exactly...

482
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,145
I thought we were diagnosing.

483
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,647
You were diagnosing.
Now, I am, too.

484
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,859
I thought that Thirteen was right
about the strongyloides.

485
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,193
I was obviously wrong.

486
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,114
Okay, kidney failure,
aspiration, fainting. Go.

487
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,950
Kidney failure could be the result
of a gram negative bacteria.

488
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,743
Our patient wears
a catheter full-time.

489
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,871
It virtually guarantees
bacterial infection.

490
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,373
Which could have
migrated up to his kidneys.

491
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:02,294
Infection stresses his already
weakened system, makes his SMA worse.

492
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,045
That explains
the choking and fainting.

493
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,589
Put him on an IV amp and gent.

494
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,841
Our team's
scleroderma diagnosis still holds.

495
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,342
The test could have
been negative because

496
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,802
the blood was tainted
with the contrast.

497
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,179
Do a skin biopsy.

498
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,181
Get a side of lymph node
to confirm.

499
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,398
I could have you fired.

500
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,150
You already had me fired.

501
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,276
Just proves that I can.

502
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,652
Were the men wrong?

503
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,820
No.

504
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,405
- That doesn't change the fact...
- Why are you yelling at me?

505
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,073
Because performing
tests for someone

506
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,575
who is not a doctor
in this hospital...

507
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,702
You're frustrated.
You want help, I'm here.

508
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,788
If you just need to vent,
leave a message.

509
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,336
I like him better like this.
You?

510
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,131
Patient developed pneumonia.

511
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,466
His lungs are filling fast.

512
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,967
We started him on antibiotics.

513
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,302
Nothing. We were wrong.

514
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:53,386
And you're here to say?

515
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,472
We were wrong, too.
He doesn't have scleroderma.

516
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,599
Biopsy revealed
no fibrotic changes.

517
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,601
Cervical lymph node
has black flecks.

518
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,645
Just small areas of necrosis.
It's nothing.

519
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,147
You say, "Nothing,"
I say, "Cancer."

520
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,191
It's a bit of a stretch
to jump right to cancer.

521
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,027
I'm not jumping. Broad specs
haven't worked, so ifs not bacterial.

522
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,780
Failing liver despite treatment
suggests it's not fungal.

523
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,740
And her high lactic acidosis
points towards

524
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,784
anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

525
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,579
Also suggests infection, which is
a lot easier and safer to treat.

526
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,581
Large cell lymphoma
is incredibly aggressive.

527
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,746
She'll be dead in a week
if we follow the textbooks.

528
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,710
Unless it's infection,
in which case you irradiate her,

529
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:27,545
and she'll be dead in a day.

530
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,506
And I know you have
some experience with that.

531
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,718
I've seen
doctors do this before.

532
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:34,886
Go back to
the scene of the crime,

533
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,514
if you're right this time,
you purge yourself of past ghosts.

534
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,557
I know
it's contrary to protocol.

535
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:40,558
But I think it's more likely...

536
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,478
Ghosts are there for a reason.

537
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,313
So you don't make
the same mistake twice.

538
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,276
Switch her over
to third-generation cephalosporin.

539
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,534
You want to remove his eye?

540
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,618
Who told you?

541
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,161
You booked the OR.

542
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,413
Good.

543
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,416
You can't beat
me in a foot race.

544
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,002
I thought we were dancing.

545
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,755
Cervical lymph node
is a garbage dump.

546
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,881
A very small one.

547
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,134
Just one truck comes
and it only comes from one home.

548
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,885
Al Gore would be appalled.
The home...

549
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,179
The home is the right eye.
I get it.

550
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,140
Do a biopsy.

551
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,641
On my Way-

552
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,810
You're not doing a biopsy.

553
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,335
You ordered
an orbital exenteration.

554
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,439
Right. Because I don't want to
remove a little, tiny piece,

555
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,190
sit in the lab and confirm
what I already know,

556
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,234
while my patient drowns
in his own fluid.

557
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,321
But if you want me to,
I absolutely will.

558
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,905
How advanced is the pneumonia?

559
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,158
It's taking college courses.

560
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,743
Hey, Wilson!

561
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,578
I'm going to cut
some cripple's eye out!

562
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,747
Want to come watch?

563
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,458
Good times.

564
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,959
We good to go?

565
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,805
I thought melanoma
was skin cancer.

566
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,267
Technically, it's cancer
of the pigment cells.

567
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,437
The same cells that
give your iris its color.

568
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:08,980
Cancer?

569
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,442
Why not? What else
can God throw at me?

570
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:16,196
Hail, locusts,
smiting of the first born...

571
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,114
All depends on
how evil you've been.

572
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,824
House.

573
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,619
If it's cancer,
it's spread everywhere, right?

574
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,040
That's what's in my lungs?
My kidneys?

575
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:30,502
There is a chance, by removing the eye,
to get the primary tumor,

576
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,253
and three courses of radiation,

577
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,671
that could...

578
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,675
Could what?
A few months? Years?

579
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,054
More likely months.

580
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,682
Any of your other doctors
have any cheerier diagnoses?

581
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,851
If they do, they're wrong.
This is the answer.

582
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,686
It's the only way to help you.

583
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,023
I already can't walk.
I can't eat.

584
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,612
You're telling me
that the rest of my life

585
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,408
is in this bed,
puking and pain?

586
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,576
We can manage the pain.

587
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,538
I'd rather just
get this over with.

588
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:13,169
I've been trapped
in this useless body long enough.

589
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,258
It'd be nice
to finally get out.

590
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,428
Get out and go where?

591
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:22,929
I mean, you think
you're going to sprout wings

592
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,681
and start flying around
with the other angels?

593
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,559
Don't be an idiot.
There is no "after". There's just this.

594
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,018
House!

595
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,158
You can't let a dying man
take solace in his beliefs?

596
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,451
His beliefs are stupid.

597
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,743
Everybody lies.

598
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,328
Some for good reasons,
some for bad.

599
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,122
This would have been
a fantastic reason to lie.

600
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,874
Hi. Greg House.

601
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,002
Why can't you just let him
have his fairy tale?

602
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,962
If it gives him comfort
to imagine beaches

603
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,381
and loved ones
and life outside a wheelchair...

604
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,216
Are there <i>72</i> virgins, too?

605
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,176
It's over.

606
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,595
He's got days,
maybe hours left.

607
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,600
What pain does it cause you if he spends
that time with a peaceful smile?

608
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,224
What sick pleasure
do you get in making

609
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,310
damn sure he's filled
with fear and dread?

610
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,480
He shouldn't be making
a decision based on a lie.

611
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,805
Misery is better than nothing.

612
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,017
You don't know there's nothing.
You haven't been there.

613
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,360
Oh, God,
I am tired of that argument.

614
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,738
I don't have to go to Detroit
to know that it smells.

615
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:25,783
Yes. Detroit,
the afterlife, same thing.

616
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,464
You're not
getting enough oxygen,

617
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,842
so we're inserting a tube
directly into your lungs.

618
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,011
It should help us drain
some of this excess fluid.

619
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,388
Should make you
a little more comfortable.

620
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,062
SATs are still dropping.

621
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,397
The fluid's clear.

622
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,442
If this was cancer,
there should be blood.

623
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,568
Call House.

624
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,779
He just paged me.

625
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,788
Dr. House!

626
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,554
Maybe it was

627
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,598
just an accident.

628
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,433
It wasn't an accident.

629
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,239
Think his nihilism got the best of him
and he tried to kill himself?

630
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,937
- He paged me.
- He paged you?

631
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,648
- Why you?
- I assume because...

632
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,900
Don't assume anything.

633
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,277
Don't fall into that trap.

634
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,528
Is he okay?

635
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,448
Burned his hand pretty good.

636
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,492
His heart stopped
for nearly a minute.

637
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,411
But your cohort
managed to restart it.

638
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:19,207
But he has not
regained consciousness.

639
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,920
So, since I have you all here,

640
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,464
we should probably talk
about your actual patient.

641
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,425
Clear fluid from the lungs
indicates that it's probably not cancer.

642
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,680
So it would be nice if we could
come up with a new idea.

643
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,149
You're an idiot.
You nearly killed yourself.

644
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,401
That was the whole idea.

645
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:47,402
You wanted to kill yourself?

646
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,737
I wanted to nearly kill myself.

647
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,447
Is he better?

648
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,491
No. But he doesn't have cancer.

649
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,368
We think it might be
eosinophilic pneumonia.

650
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,371
Maybe you didn't want to die,
but you didn't care if you lived.

651
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:01,082
You insisted that I needed
to see for myself.

652
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,043
Was he discharged?

653
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,253
No. He's dying.

654
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,673
You've already had
two near-death experiences.

655
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:12,343
Not that guy,
the guy in the car accident.

656
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,053
With the knife.

657
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,640
I need to talk to him.

658
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,642
He died almost an hour ago.

659
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,197
Apparently, it's bad
to electrocute yourself

660
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,774
within days of suffering
massive internal injuries.

661
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,528
Why did you need
to talk to him?

662
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,281
Did you see something?

663
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,408
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

664
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,660
House? What did you see?

665
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,078
Nothing.

666
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,747
Whose idea was that?

667
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:41,706
Brennan.

668
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,709
"Nothing," you don't want
to talk about it, or, "Nothing..."

669
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:45,835
Which one's Brennan?

670
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,962
Is he the ridiculously old guy?

671
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,881
House, you've got
to talk about this.

672
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:54,218
If it's aggressive enough
it might have gotten past the steroids.

673
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,512
Start him on cyclophosphamide.

674
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,014
I already did.

675
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,766
Just looking at you hurts.

676
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:04,103
I'm gonna order up
some extra pain meds.

677
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,605
I love you.

678
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,696
How fast will this work?

679
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,407
New meds should start helping
in minutes, okay? Hang in there.

680
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,327
Vacutainer's full.
I need to replace it.

681
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:23,956
I don't think it's working.

682
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,500
Try and relax.

683
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,129
You must be wrong.

684
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,130
Stop talking.

685
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,842
Hurry up and get
the chest tube working.

686
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,427
Okay. I got it.

687
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,847
Can you get Hoover?

688
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,203
I can't...

689
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,373
Can you put m)!

690
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:07,333
Hand

691
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,211
on his head?

692
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:18,010
It's okay. Don't worry.

693
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,223
I'm not scared.

694
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,573
Oh, God.

695
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:52,920
Time of death...

696
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,516
You're looking better.

697
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:07,894
Stark's dead.

698
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,860
What are you doing?

699
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,612
Going to see our patient.

700
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,155
He's dead.

701
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,324
"Dead" is not a diagnosis.

702
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:24,201
- You really shouldn't be...
- Shut up and give me my cane.

703
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,539
I assume we're all fired.

704
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,458
Should I fire myself, too?

705
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,253
I thought it was strongyloides,
then I thought it was cancer.

706
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:37,548
- A little help, here?
- Ready? One, two...

707
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,723
Why did you call me?

708
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,516
Because if I pooped myself
in front of Wilson,

709
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:48,643
I'd never hear the end of it.

710
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,394
But why not one of the others?

711
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,812
You always have that phone
in your hand.

712
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,482
We all have cell phones,
that's not the reason. What is?

713
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,068
If I died,
you'd never get the job.

714
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,861
I knew you wouldn't
let that happen.

715
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,280
You don't think anybody else
has any reason to care?

716
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:02,907
I think this is starting
to come back to me.

717
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,618
It's right, left, then repeat.

718
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,329
Yeah. That works.

719
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,583
What did we miss?

720
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,710
If we knew,
he wouldn't be dead.

721
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,504
So, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

722
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,215
No. We were defeated.
It's over.

723
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,593
Patient presented with syncope.

724
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,137
We thought it was thread worms,
gave him invermectin.

725
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,264
Thank you.

726
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,310
The patient seemed better
until his blood turned green.

727
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,937
Can we at least
remove the body before

728
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,523
launching into a purely
academic exercise?

729
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,609
The patient didn't respond
to antibiotics or steroids.

730
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,735
You okay, boy?

731
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,821
What's wrong with the dog?

732
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:51,914
He's dead.

733
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,791
There are only
a handful of viruses

734
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,085
that can cross
between dogs and humans.

735
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,087
But they may not
be connected at all.

736
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,964
The dog was old.
I've seen it before.

737
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,299
They hang on way past
their normal life expectancy

738
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,625
to take care of their masters.

739
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,804
Did you watch
him take the pills?

740
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,224
The invermectin.
Did you watch the patient

741
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,476
put them in his mouth
and swallow them?

742
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,103
I don't know. I think so.

743
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,228
What kind of dog is that?

744
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:16,188
English Shepherd.

745
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,524
- That's in the collie family, right?
- Not really.

746
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,068
- But they share the MDR-1 gene?
- Yeah.

747
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:25,239
What happens when you give a dog
with the MDR-1 gene ivermectin?

748
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,198
They don't.

749
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,576
I mean, it's used to treat
heartworms in most dogs,

750
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,328
but it would be
fatal if they...

751
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,546
Look familiar?

752
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,577
I think the last
time you saw it,

753
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,176
it didn't have
that dead dog's teeth marks on it.

754
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,386
I just put it on the bed tray
to get him some water.

755
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,514
When I asked you if you watched
the patient swallow the pills,

756
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,516
the right answer was, "No."

757
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:58,064
Take his body
down to the morgue.

758
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:14,080
If you hadn't treated this patient
as a game, he wouldn't be dead.

759
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,040
Feeling much better, thank you.

760
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,918
I'm supposed to
show you sympathy?

761
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,963
He died while his attending
was lying on a hospital bed

762
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,758
because he stuck
a knife in a wall socket.

763
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,928
He died because
a doctor made a mistake.

764
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,137
She was an idiot.

765
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,180
You employed her.

766
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,725
You're responsible.

767
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:48,823
Dr. Foreman.

768
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,577
How's she doing?

769
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:57,665
Fever's gone. AST and ALT are back
within normal range.

770
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:00,584
She should be out
of here in a few days.

771
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:01,919
Gutsy call.

772
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,004
- Thanks.
- It wasn't a compliment.

773
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,882
If you were wrong,
she'd be dead.

774
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,718
- I was sure...
- No, you weren't. You couldn't be.

775
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:11,137
There's a reason we have rules.

776
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,597
If every doctor did whatever
his gut told him was right,

777
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,892
we'd have a lot more dead bodies
to deal with.

778
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,561
It won't happen again.

779
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:20,020
Yes, it will.

780
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:23,357
Because you confuse saving her life
with doing the right thing.

781
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,319
I'm sorry, Dr. Foreman,
you're fired.

782
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,384
As soon as the pathologist
cut into the lungs,

783
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,344
we saw the threadworms.

784
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,349
Do you think it's
fair that I fired

785
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:58,795
all the other members
of your team

786
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:01,896
when you guys actually came up
with the right diagnosis?

787
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,525
I keep replaying it in my mind.

788
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,403
Did I drop the pills
when I put them on the bed tray?

789
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,656
Did I knock them over
when I turned to leave?

790
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,119
You know, he'd be alive.

791
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,080
His dog would be alive.

792
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,248
I know.

793
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,252
You forced us to act
on a false assumption.

794
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,921
- I know.
- Everything we built

795
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:29,131
from that step on,

796
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,467
every test, every theory,
every treatment...

797
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,678
I know. Forget the lecture
and fire me already.

798
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:40,309
If I was gonna fire you,
I wouldn't be giving you the lecture.

799
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:48,317
I know you're not gonna let
anything like this ever happen again.

800
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,406
I'll see you tomorrow.

801
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,503
I'm sorry to say,

802
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,422
I told you so.
