1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:07,008
The Chinese Water Torture Cell
was invented in 1911 by Harry Houdini.

2
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,223
Nothing like new material.

3
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,600
He was lowered
head-first into the water.

4
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:19,396
His ankles were locked
and bolted to the top of the tank.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,649
I'm going to need a volunteer.

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,734
Ooh! Ooh!

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,655
The guy dislocating
his shoulder, right there.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,581
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

9
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,577
Come on, get up there, man.
Get up there, man! Come on!

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,415
Come on!

11
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,590
- Hi, have we met before?
- No.

12
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,968
See, if you'd said, "Yes,"
you could've gone back to your seat.

13
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:53,805
Now, can you vouch for this audience
that this is a glass tank full of water?

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,014
- Yeah.
- No, you can't.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,809
You haven't done
anything yet. Come on.

16
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:59,227
Knock on the glass.

17
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,271
Solid glass. Knock on it.

18
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,733
It's real water, too.
Ilana, splash the guy.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,610
- Does that feel wet to you?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,029
And you think that proves it's water?
I think we have met.

21
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,532
Do you know the public washroom behind
the truck stop east of Omaha?

22
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:13,783
- No.
- See, if you'd said, "Yes,"

23
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,119
that would have been so funny.

24
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,747
Hold out your arms for me.

25
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,040
- You've done this before, right?
- No.

26
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,877
Again, two choices
and you went for the unfunny one.

27
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:44,314
Now, remember. There's only one thing
you've got to be able to do.

28
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,817
Drag a screaming, crying shackled man
out of a tank of water.

29
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,902
Up!

30
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,870
Hey, you can swim, right?

31
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,122
Tell me you can swim!

32
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,707
Yeah.

33
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,460
Two answers, man. Two answers!

34
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,060
Is that part of the act?

35
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:23,645
I'm new. I think so.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,482
Maybe not.

37
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,527
Get up here!

38
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,078
Aw.

39
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,249
Five eager doctors,
and no sick people.

40
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:30,920
Let us try and fill
our spare time with a new challenge.

41
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,714
The winner gets immunity...

42
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,924
I've a sick guy.
I saw this magician last night...

43
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,385
The girl's fine.
He didn't really cut her in half.

44
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,151
His heart stopped while he was hanging
upside down in a water tank.

45
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,433
A drowning man's heart stopped?
That is a mystery.

46
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,477
Along with immunity,
the winner gets to nominate two...

47
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,844
He lost consciousness
almost as soon as he hit the water.

48
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:52,233
You have to leave work at 6:00 p.m.,
but you make time for man dates?

49
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,401
What's the challenge?

50
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:54,806
Are we not allowed
to be friends?

51
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,155
I'm just hurt. When I asked you
to come see <i>Mamma Mia...</i>

52
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,365
No history of heart disease,
no angina, no...

53
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,491
He's lying.-

54
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,938
About his history?
ER confirmed...

55
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,203
About everything. He's a magician.
That's what they do.

56
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,248
He screwed up the trick, started
drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.

57
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,876
You were talking
about a challenge?

58
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,588
The winner nominates
two of your competitors.

59
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,674
I will fire one of them.

60
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:20,845
Even if he was drowning,

61
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,931
it would have taken longer to set off
a cardiac incident

62
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:23,890
without some
underlying problem...

63
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,017
Fine. Go run your tests.

64
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,769
If you're wrong, you're fired.

65
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:28,854
If I'm right, do I stay?

66
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:32,482
If I say no, are you going
to let your patient die?

67
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,736
What's the challenge?

68
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:40,281
We can all applaud the doctor who's
willing to break all the rules.

69
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,368
But the real hero
is the unsung doctor,

70
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:47,872
toiling in anonymity, because he broke
the rules without getting caught.

71
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,750
I need to know
you have these skills.

72
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,335
I need you

73
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,714
to bring me
the thong of Lisa Cuddy.

74
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,052
Not kidding.

75
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,472
Thong, Cuddy, go-

76
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,855
It's how I got hired.

77
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,112
You're actually
considering this?

78
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,323
If you want to stand on principle,
I really respect you for that.

79
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,118
It's childish, unprofessional
and inappropriate.

80
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,327
The job is not worth it.

81
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:30,707
We should all beg off, tell him
we failed, no winners, no losers.

82
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,917
Fine.

83
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:34,794
You're going to do it,
aren't you?

84
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,754
Of course I'm going to do it.

85
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,801
No valvular regurgitation,

86
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,804
no wall motion abnormalities,
no other structural defects.

87
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,765
If you didn't sound so despondent,
I'd say that was good news.

88
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,226
It is for you, not for him.

89
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,520
Notice any heaviness in your legs
the last couple days?

90
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,938
Why isn't it good news for you?

91
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,734
Because if there's nothing wrong
with you, he gets fired.

92
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,236
- Seriously?
- Somewhat seriously. Your legs?

93
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,988
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

94
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:05,408
- Shortness of breath?
- Would it help if I puked?

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,705
Pick a card.

96
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,708
- Any tightness in your chest or arms?
- Pick a card.

97
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,914
You don't seem too worried.

98
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,169
Would you please pick a card?

99
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,379
Our boss thinks your cardiac arrest
was just a result

100
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,256
of you accidentally drowning.

101
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:23,760
Your boss is an idiot.
Put it back. Shuffle them up.

102
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,636
So, then,
why aren't you worried?

103
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,847
Either I'm dying or I'm not.

104
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,682
I mean, I don't want
the ride to be over,

105
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,144
but unless worrying is some new form
of treatment...

106
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,897
- Your card.
- No.

107
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,858
I'm going to prep you
for a transesophageal echo.

108
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:39,817
You sure you shuffled these?

109
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,986
And I'm going to
need to sedate you.

110
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,739
Might wanna check
your wallet first.

111
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,659
Would you check your wallet?
It's part of the trick.

112
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,170
That's my card.
How did you do that?

113
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,047
Do it again?

114
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,852
- Thought you weren't playing.
- I'm not.

115
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,338
She'll fire you
if she catches you.

116
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,023
I don't think she can fire me
for not trying to steal her panties.

117
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,441
You trying to will them off?

118
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,943
If I had a plan,

119
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,446
the first part would be
not telling you what the plan was.

120
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,198
You haven't touched
that coffee.

121
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,407
Yes, I have.

122
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:32,620
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet. We work together.

123
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,831
One wins, protects the other.

124
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:40,169
Or, I win by myself, and then you try
desperately to convince me to spare you.

125
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,758
Dr. Cuddy!

126
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,178
Dr. Taub, are you okay?

127
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,097
I just tripped. I'm so sorry.

128
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,809
I have some extra time.
Do you need any help in the clinic?

129
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:55,893
Okay-

130
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,319
We found no apparent cause for the
arrest. TTE and TEE revealed no...

131
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,030
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

132
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,324
We checked for clots,
we checked for...

133
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,535
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to House,

134
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,740
because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

135
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,289
And you thought
I'd save your ass.

136
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,665
Yeah.

137
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,503
I thought he was sick.
What was I supposed to do?

138
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,924
What about his lungs? Decreased oxygen
saturation leads to heart failure.

139
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,926
- ER didn't find anything.
- ER wasn't looking.

140
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,513
Too busy trying
to keep him alive. Get an MRI.

141
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,103
<i>Clinic.</i>

142
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,356
Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy to come
to the nurses' station? Stat.

143
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,900
<i>Right away.</i>

144
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,176
I asked you to get Dr. Cuddy.

145
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,678
Dr. Taub said
she'd be right out.

146
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:22,605
A fungus in my lungs? How would I even
get something like that?

147
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,815
Well, right now it's just a theory.
We don't even know if...

148
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,817
God, I knew I shouldn't
have done those mushrooms in college.

149
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,183
I'm sure there's no connection.

150
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,654
It was a joke.

151
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,073
You really lose your sense of humor
when your job's on the line.

152
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,951
Sorry. Most dying people
don't really like to...

153
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,870
Not that you're dying.

154
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,538
But a little sick
would be perfect?

155
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:40,915
Yeah.

156
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,003
My stomach!

157
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,880
Stabbing or throbbing?

158
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,467
Grey Turner's sign.
He's got internal bleeding.

159
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,718
I'll call surgery.

160
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,805
The surgeons have transfused
three units AB positive,

161
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,390
but they're still
looking for the source of the bleed.

162
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,309
No trauma. Could be liver disease,
vitamin K deficiency.

163
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,104
Only thing we know
for sure it's not, nothing.

164
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,189
And we would've noticed
something chronic like liver disease.

165
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,984
It's probably an
intestinal infarct.

166
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,527
No, I got it!

167
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,368
Eau de Cuddy.

168
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,203
No way. How did you get them?

169
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,621
Only one way.

170
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,001
These are not Cuddy's panties.

171
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,127
You don't think that I...

172
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,253
No.

173
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:31,048
Also, she's wearing
a red bra today.

174
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,967
Like I'm the only
one who noticed.

175
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,012
Means that
the downstairs will match.

176
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,139
Do your research, people.

177
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,642
An intestinal infarct could be linked
to the cardiac arrest.

178
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,977
Hike up your skirt.

179
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,729
That's rude, even for you.

180
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,816
Hike it down then. You're wearing a
black bra. Let's see the underwear.

181
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,026
No!

182
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,154
You two cut a deal.

183
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,247
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

184
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,124
So, you're not
wearing any underwear?

185
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,751
There's a guy bleeding...

186
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:11,088
Foreman, she's not wearing any
underwear. You used to be more fun.

187
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,049
She's not wearing
any underwear, big deal.

188
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,940
When she stops wearing clothes, then we
can drop the medical stuff.

189
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,261
Let me see the MRI film.

190
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,637
We didn't get any images.

191
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,604
He started screaming
as soon as I turned it on.

192
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,058
Define soon.

193
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,436
I didn't even get
a chance to sit down.

194
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:27,646
You guys ever wonder

195
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,817
how he was going
to get out of that water tank?

196
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,277
You, come.

197
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,874
Lacerations in his digestive tract
and his spleen is shredded.

198
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have nothing in my hands,

199
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,837
nothing up my sleeve.

200
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,715
I do have something
in my pants,

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,960
but it's not going to help
with this particular trick.

202
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,719
Watch closely.

203
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,849
- How you been?
- Fine, 'til now.

204
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,688
Ta-da!

205
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,983
Now, you disappear.

206
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,326
Look familiar?

207
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:26,997
The MRI's magnet ripped this through
your intestine into your spleen.

208
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,251
Forgot about that,
on account of almost dying.

209
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,962
Where's Dr. Kutner?

210
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,005
He's no longer on your case.

211
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,466
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with you.

212
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,969
I didn't screw up that trick.

213
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,430
Everything that's happened
can be explained

214
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:45,057
by you being forgetful
and incompetent.

215
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,892
You screwed up,
you passed out...

216
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,354
Know my favorite time to lie?
When my life hangs in the balance.

217
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,982
Your life doesn't
hang in the balance.

218
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,650
You know your life
doesn't hang in the balance.

219
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,235
Your reputation might hang...

220
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,820
You ever do magic as a kid?

221
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,031
You seem like the type.
Lonely, obsessive...

222
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,992
I outgrew it. You?

223
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,244
Pick a card?

224
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,913
Too much trouble.
Can I just pick my nose?

225
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,540
I am not a hack.

226
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,962
I tell you how it's done,
will you go home?

227
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:21,302
Guess you're going to
make it magically appear in my wallet...

228
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,558
You are a hack.

229
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,948
I don't screw up.

230
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,754
Nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

231
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:00,382
Means the cardiac arrest
was a symptom.

232
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,842
Stop gloating.

233
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:02,968
I'm not gloating.

234
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,220
Then what's that smirk?

235
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,013
No smirk, it's just how I look.

236
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,515
What about
the underwear challenge?

237
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,725
I declare it
officially on hold.

238
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,269
Not really fair, but I get it.

239
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,871
It's Cuddy's.

240
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:31,956
Pull down your pants.

241
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,165
You think I'm lying?

242
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:37,419
No, I want to give you a reward.
Yes, I think you're lying.

243
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,256
Cardiac arrest
plus nosebleed. Go.

244
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,842
Patient has no significant family
history, no angina, no prior attacks.

245
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,344
What if isn't his heart?

246
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,845
What if it's
the vessels around his heart?

247
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:50,516
Polyarteritis nodosa causes cardiac
symptoms and hypertension,

248
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,681
which makes his nose bleed.

249
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,895
You know what else makes your nose bleed
and your heart race? Cocaine.

250
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,022
Guy works in
a B-list nightclub in Atlantic City.

251
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,025
He's got to be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

252
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,736
You, take the gloater
to the patient's drug den.

253
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,781
Make sure you pat down
his pockets before you leave.

254
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,534
You and Big Love, biopsy a blood vessel
from around the heart.

255
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,869
Test for polyarteritis nodosa.

256
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,956
You, in my office.

257
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,755
Those aren't my panties.

258
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,173
I know.

259
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,676
Hypothetical.

260
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,054
A young woman does something
clumsy in public,

261
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,393
and instead of laughing it off, she gets
irrationally upset. Explain.

262
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,938
Maybe she's clumsy
'cause she's nervous

263
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,108
'cause she forgot
to do her spelling homework.

264
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,819
Well,
in my hypothetical, she's eight.

265
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:48,240
This girl's not insecure.
Seems more like she's afraid.

266
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,285
Do you have a point, or did you
just get a new book of riddles?

267
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,245
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

268
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,747
I'm not.

269
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,332
I'm glad we had this talk.

270
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,335
Doctors often try to ignore
their symptoms,

271
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,379
because they
think they can't get sick.

272
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,549
If you've got something going on,
I need you to take care of it.

273
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,177
And I take your
compassion entirely at face value.

274
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,846
It's not compassion. It's self-interest.
I want my team healthy.

275
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,848
It's not
self-interest. It's curiosity.

276
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,808
I dropped a file, House.

277
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,438
I start bleeding from the eyes, I'll be
sure to make an appointment.

278
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,482
Okay-

279
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,488
- Well, found some pot.
- Bag it.

280
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,381
I'm not sure it really
fits the symptoms.

281
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:33,118
Of course not, but it'd be irresponsible
to leave it here.

282
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,830
- You have a quarter?
- No.

283
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,556
How did Cole get
those panties off Cuddy?

284
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,794
They were never on her.
No way those are hers.

285
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,587
Aha.

286
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,339
Tularemia.

287
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,799
No, he'd have to have rabbits.

288
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,636
True, maybe a tick
jumped from a rabbit

289
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,473
and landed on one of these white,
fluffy alligators.

290
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,558
Then it jumps onto our patient,

291
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,063
transfers the bacteria, causes
pericarditis, explains everything.

292
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,488
What are you giving me?

293
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,739
How'd you do the trick?

294
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,078
If I explain, it becomes mundane.
You lose the actual magic.

295
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,205
What do you mean,
"The actual magic"?

296
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,541
You think you're actually
sawing women in half?

297
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,084
You going to
tell me what's wrong with me or not?

298
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,213
Magic is cool.
Actual magic is oxymoronic.

299
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,465
Might not even be oxy.

300
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,927
You're not going
to tell me unless I tell you?

301
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,805
You got a nurse
to plant the card.

302
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,432
I can't get a nurse
to help me pee.

303
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,183
You got a buddy
to plant the card.

304
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,644
The fun is in not knowing.

305
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,237
The fun is in knowing.

306
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,576
My head.
Oh, I've got a headache.

307
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,327
How bad? Is it new?

308
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,579
It's not too bad.

309
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:02,291
I'll just take one
of these Vicodin.

310
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,220
You eat a lot of beets,
you have an electric toothbrush

311
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,639
and you sleep less
than six hours a night.

312
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,057
That's impressive.

313
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,936
The red betamine from the beets stains
the plaque deposits on your teeth,

314
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,397
which are then swirled
by your spinning toothbrush.

315
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,066
Your heavy lids and
your prematurely aging skin

316
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,194
tell me that you're
carrying a major sleep debt.

317
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,122
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

318
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,114
It was meaningless
until I explained it.

319
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:38,285
People come to my show
because they want a sense of wonder.

320
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:43,373
They want to experience
something that they can't explain.

321
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:46,210
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

322
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,629
there never was any wonder.

323
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,050
You have tularemia from your rabbits.
I put you on antibiotics.

324
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,844
You'll be better
in a couple of days.

325
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,347
Sorry to spoil the mystery.

326
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,766
Thank you.

327
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,030
I'll get it.

328
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,285
Oh, my God!

329
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,247
- You're not wearing underwear.
- Of course, I'm...

330
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,249
A skirt that tight,
you got no secrets.

331
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,335
A skirt that tight
I can tell if you got an IUD.

332
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,628
Have you seen Dr. Cole?

333
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,754
No...

334
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,631
- You're blushing.
- I am not.

335
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,299
Look at me.

336
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,803
Oh, my God!

337
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,102
How'd you do it?

338
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,896
So I'm safe?

339
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,441
In this job, yeah. Your crotch,
on the other hand...

340
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,569
How'd you do it?

341
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,028
Prayer, mostly.

342
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,869
Just tell me.
Does Cuddy have her groove back?

343
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,664
It'd be rude of me to discuss.

344
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,417
You handed over her panties.

345
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,003
I don't think gallantry's really
an option at this point.

346
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,255
If I tell you,
then where is the magic?

347
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,258
He passed out. Ultrasound revealed
bleeding around his heart.

348
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,783
We drained 100 cc
before it stopped.

349
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,250
The antibiotics aren't working.

350
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,638
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

351
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,557
Excuse me, we were talking.

352
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,726
Bleeding around
the heart could mean botched biopsy.

353
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:26,932
When Cole was looking for...

354
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,145
Why would you accuse the man

355
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,272
who decides your fate
of screwing up?

356
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,485
Those really were her panties?

357
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,655
Cole has traveled
through the forest of crustaceans

358
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,449
and brought us a treasure.

359
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,367
He has earned his reward.

360
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,994
If I could just
get the immunity, I would...

361
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,246
No, Sophie. You can't.

362
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,790
Use whatever criteria you want.

363
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,335
Could be a clotting issue.

364
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,587
If he developed DIC after the surgery,

365
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,392
even a normal biopsy
bleeds out of control.

366
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,967
So, cardiac arrest and DIC.
What's the common denominator?

367
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,053
- Could be cancer.
- We've been looking at his chest

368
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,378
since he got here. It's clean.

369
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,680
So the main mass
is somewhere else.

370
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:08,352
Throws off a clot, blocks an artery
in his heart, causes the arrest.

371
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,230
Good. Go find out
where he's hiding his cancer.

372
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:19,404
If you swallowed any more metal
now would be a good time to tell us.

373
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,161
My hands feel kind of numb.

374
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,455
You lost a lot of blood.

375
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,501
I'm going to die.

376
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,628
Everybody gets scared
in the hospital.

377
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,995
You're sick, you feel awful...

378
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,631
No.

379
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,676
This time tomorrow,

380
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,346
I'll be dead.

381
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,446
So, who's going on the block?

382
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,116
He thinks he's dying.

383
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,409
He's probably right.

384
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,245
Tomorrow.

385
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,331
You decide to put me up,
I totally get it.

386
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,416
Nothing personal.

387
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,875
I haven't decided anything.

388
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,043
But you don't like me.

389
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,461
I like you.

390
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,507
There's some
fluid in the lungs.

391
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,426
No masses.

392
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,179
I'm manipulative.
I play the game.

393
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,015
I can be a bitch.

394
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,433
There's a dark spot.

395
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,769
Damage from where
the key ripped through.

396
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,397
You're probably expecting me
to bash the others.

397
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:40,694
Give examples of how they screwed up.
You know I can. I'm a good doctor.

398
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,365
As good as anybody around here.
Probably better.

399
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,660
And you know that's
the only thing that matters.

400
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,504
What's that?

401
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,928
It's not a tumor, it's another bleed.
This one's in his kidney.

402
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,307
And his thigh. He's bleeding
all over the place.

403
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,226
His timetable may be right on.

404
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,443
It was creepy.
The patient predicted his own death.

405
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,568
Would have been more impressive if he
predicted that he wasn't going to die.

406
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,136
- Of course, that takes longer to prove.
- Could be a symptom.

407
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,366
Sense of impending doom.

408
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:32,662
Yeah, could be adrenal gland disorders,
blood issues, anaphylaxis...

409
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,581
If you're going to
kiss his ass to protect your ass,

410
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,625
at least wait until
he's had a good idea.

411
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,376
It's a symptom
of him being a charlatan.

412
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,337
He's a second-rate magician
with a mysterious illness.

413
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,755
Why wouldn't
he predict his own death?

414
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,132
If he's wrong, we all forget it.
If he's right, he goes out a legend.

415
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,926
He got scared right
after a transfusion.

416
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,845
Tainted blood has been known
to cause a sense of impending doom.

417
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,930
It could also explain the DIC.

418
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:53,892
I predict all
your pagers go off right now.

419
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,104
But if it had happened...

420
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,483
Anyone bother looking at his panel?
His immunoglobulin levels are low.

421
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,901
That doesn't tell
us anything specific...

422
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,655
Are you acting stupid because
you know you're safe? Clever.

423
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,117
Low immunoglobulin plus failing heart,
plus fluid in the lungs,

424
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,452
plus internal bleeding
equals amyloidosis.

425
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,704
He's bleeding way
too much for amyloidosis.

426
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,165
Say anything about
his hands or feet feeling weak?

427
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,503
He said his hands felt numb,
but that's explained by the blood loss.

428
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,342
No!
Do not give me credit for that.

429
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,929
Close doesn't count. That's how people
get sucked into this stupidity.

430
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:31,888
He's seizing.

431
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,723
Somebody stabilize him.

432
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,601
The rest of you pull
his medical records. Go back 10 years.

433
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:40,897
Look for joint pain, fatigue,
anything associated with amyloidosis.

434
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,568
Mr. Finn,
nod if you can hear me.

435
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,946
You had a grand mal seizure.

436
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,912
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

437
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,366
Just try to rest.

438
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,828
Pulse is dropping.
He's stabilizing.

439
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,872
You're not going to
put me on the block, are you?

440
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,207
I haven't decided who
I'm going to pick.

441
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,917
It's cool.

442
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,753
His legs look swollen to you?

443
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,172
Slight swelling could be renal.

444
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,673
I baby-sat for you.

445
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,343
I decided I'm going to make my decision
based solely on who deserves to be here.

446
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,762
That's admirable,
though stupid.

447
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,765
You shouldn't save the strongest.
You should get rid of the strongest.

448
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,852
Eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

449
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,770
And I'm your friend.

450
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,457
And how you going
to explain to your kid

451
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:26,026
that I can't take him to the zoo
next week because you got me fired?

452
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:29,112
Kutner,
he's going to seize again.

453
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:33,658
Flank pain, his kidneys are shutting
down. Also, Amber's a racist.

454
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,580
You knew they'd get paged?

455
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,040
I noticed a trend.

456
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,877
If nobody does anything,
sick people often gets sicker.

457
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,546
Do you think it's
remotely possible they had sex?

458
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,049
They're both single.
It's still legal in the blue states.

459
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,800
She barely knows him.

460
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,469
You know, in some cultures,

461
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,764
hiring people to steal someone's
underpants is considered wooing.

462
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:59,267
You should move there, because here
it's just, you know, creepy.

463
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,562
This was no woo.
This was an effective test!

464
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,774
This is beneath my skills.

465
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,442
Kidneys are shutting down.

466
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,694
Led to a sodium deficiency
and caused him to seize.

467
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,030
Kidney failure means
that I was right about amyloidosis.

468
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,700
Except that nothing in his medical
history remotely indicates amyloidosis.

469
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,245
So, kidney failure
proves I'm right about the bad blood.

470
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,664
Bad blood doesn't
explain the heart or the liver.

471
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,229
His major symptoms didn't start
until after we transfused him.

472
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,877
Is cardiac arrest
no longer considered a major symptom?

473
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,379
Not when it's
caused by drowning.

474
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,984
So your new theory is that you were
an idiot to take this case.

475
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,549
Yes. Can I go test
that theory now?

476
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,262
Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow
transplant for the amyloidosis.

477
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,708
You'd have to
irradiate him first.

478
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,722
If they're right
about the blood,

479
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,141
you'd be destroying
his immune system for nothing.

480
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,812
Which could be a good thing.
Does he have a really crappy life?

481
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,564
Go prove I'm right.
Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.

482
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,531
At least let us eliminate
the bad blood theory.

483
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:52,153
Check the blood banks
for mismarks and contamination.

484
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,158
You got two hours.

485
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,618
That's completely arbitrary.

486
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,663
No, if I'd said that you've got
three lunar months,

487
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:02,988
that'd be completely arbitrary.

488
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,624
Two hours is how long
it's going to take Big Love

489
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,710
to finish the biopsy
that you guys can't do,

490
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:10,130
because you're wasting
two hours checking blood.

491
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,799
- Nine, three!
- Five, all!

492
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,930
Hey, brought you
something from the cafeteria.

493
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,518
It's not a bribe.
This is a bribe.

494
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,398
How much?

495
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:29,649
$1 million.

496
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,652
$5,000.

497
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,289
- This is so wrong.
- House specifically said

498
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,074
you can use whatever
criteria you want.

499
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,493
I've got money. You need money.

500
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,372
- Hand me that slide.
- Right now, you're earning

501
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,459
what I'm earning,
which is miserable.

502
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,379
I know what school your kid's at.
I know what it costs.

503
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,758
I've seen his picture.

504
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,886
He's going to need braces.

505
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,514
No RBC damage.

506
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,724
Nothing wrong with storage.

507
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,311
I'm going to double-check type
and start cultures.

508
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,147
We still got 32 minutes left.

509
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,441
Time flies.
What have you found?

510
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,647
You're checking up on them.

511
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,819
It means Cole's finished
with the biopsy and it was negative.

512
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,738
Inconclusive.

513
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,585
The fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

514
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,493
You need to biopsy his actual organs,
lungs, kidneys, liver.

515
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,328
We stick another
needle in him, he'll hemorrhage.

516
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,789
Unless we start
treatment for amyloidosis.

517
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,707
Unless it's not amyloidosis.

518
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,876
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

519
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,336
Show me evidence of infection.

520
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,754
We need more than two hours.

521
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,881
Some of these cultures
will take at least a day to grow.

522
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,883
- He'll be dead in a day.
- Like he predicted.

523
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,177
No, he'll be half a day off.

524
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,470
Would it make you guys feel any better

525
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,390
if I let you argue
with me for three minutes

526
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,184
before I order you
to treat for amyloidosis?

527
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,770
No. Just treat for amyloidosis.

528
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,146
No, don't.

529
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,567
You're playing the Cuddy card?

530
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:55,735
That's why I'm here.

531
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,195
Amyloidosis was your idea.

532
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,405
I was wrong.

533
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,907
Yeah, me, too.
You were never fun.

534
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,411
Give me the blood.

535
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,164
I'm type AB. Give me the blood.

536
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,707
Whatever's in there
could be killing him.

537
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,084
In where?

538
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,795
How much tainted blood
do you think they keep in here?

539
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,879
How many people
have gotten sick from...

540
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,364
It would have to have
been the first batch, the splenectomy.

541
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:18,341
That's when
the symptoms started.

542
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,302
Okay, let's transfuse blood
from those donors.

543
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,597
I'll be fine, we'll move on,
treat for amyloidosis.

544
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,725
Fill 'er up!

545
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,982
I have a new theory.

546
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,318
You're not stubborn.

547
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,740
You're not going to get checked because
you already know the answer.

548
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,452
I found an
old picture in your wallet.

549
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,745
Of course you did.

550
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,375
I wasn't snooping.
I needed lunch money.

551
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:57,755
I figure it's your mom,
except she looks about 32 years old.

552
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,969
Now, the only reason
not to update a photo in 20-odd years,

553
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,472
is she's not talking to you,

554
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,348
which would be interesting,

555
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:10,727
or she's dead, which would
also be interesting.

556
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,356
She's dead.

557
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,776
So is Grover Cleveland.

558
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,698
Pretty young to
have a dead mom.

559
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,911
Even younger 20 years ago.

560
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,206
I Googled her obituary.

561
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:37,462
Said she died at New Haven Presbyterian
after a long illness.

562
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,632
Parkinson's?

563
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,893
Huntington's chorea.

564
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,940
I'm sorry.

565
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,318
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

566
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,945
No, you're not.

567
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,030
You don't want
a doctor on your team

568
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,783
who's slowly losing
control of her body and mind.

569
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,869
Huntington's isn't
the only thing that causes tremors.

570
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,412
You think it's
just a coincidence?

571
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:15,208
I think you're the only
one on the team who drinks decaf.

572
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,129
I've been switching it out
with the regular

573
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,173
ever since you dropped that file.

574
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:26,010
You're trembling because
you're hopped up on caffeine.

575
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,596
The first file wasn't my fault.

576
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,141
Medical explanation for that is,
people drop things.

577
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,520
I've been walking around
thinking I'm dying.

578
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,980
You are.

579
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:37,981
You don't know that.

580
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,967
With Huntington's,
it's inevitable.

581
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,444
No, you don't know,
because I don't know.

582
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,824
How could you not get tested?

583
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:54,622
If your mom had it, it's a 50% chance
you're a bomb waiting to explode.

584
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,417
Not knowing makes me do things
I think I'm scared to do.

585
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:01,045
Take flying lessons, climb Kilimanjaro,
work for you.

586
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, 'cause if you knew,
you couldn't do any of those things.

587
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,094
What?

588
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,220
You're sweating.

589
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,099
You're burning up.

590
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,020
House, you're sick.

591
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,860
Could be pneumococcus. That'd
cause chest pain and a stiff neck.

592
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,153
It's not pneumococcus.

593
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,488
Let me check your lymph nodes.

594
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,073
I'm not the patient!

595
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,950
The patient is
the one whose body is shutting down.

596
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,745
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

597
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,206
Pseudomonas would present
as an armpit rash. Take off your shirt.

598
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,542
- You first.
- House, you gotta let us do this.

599
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,919
We can't biopsy him
without bleeding him to death.

600
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,171
You are not biopsying me.

601
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,090
How's your stomach?
Any diarrhea?

602
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,469
The more transfusions you have,
the greater the chance of you reacting.

603
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:53,097
I've had three in a decade. The fever
will be gone in a couple of hours.

604
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,308
I heard somewhere
that doctors ignore symptoms

605
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,101
because they think
they can't get sick.

606
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,895
You told us to give you the blood
so that you wouldn't...

607
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,438
I am not sick.

608
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,814
Fever is a symptom.

609
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,816
But not of what
the patient has.

610
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,152
My kidneys are working.
I'm not bleeding out of every organ.

611
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,445
Yet.

612
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:09,947
This is a waste of time,

613
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:13,284
and it's distracting you
from the actual case.

614
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:17,705
What's wrong?

615
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,082
The room's spinning.

616
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:20,208
You Okay?

617
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,628
Dizzy, my mouth just went dry.

618
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,835
Could be a symptom of a...

619
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,215
It's a symptom of narcotics.

620
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,844
Who spiked my...

621
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:43,856
What'd you drug him with?

622
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,902
Amber's nickname is "Cutthroat Bitch"
and you're pointing at me?

623
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,987
Got the kidney sample.

624
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:54,242
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

625
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,495
Could have been you. You don't seem
to care if you get this job or not.

626
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,664
Yeah, I've been here for eight weeks
because my subscription

627
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,998
<i>to Masochism Weekly ran</i> out.

628
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,544
You're the only one who hasn't asked me
not to put them on the block.

629
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,422
You're either going
to pick me or you're not.

630
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,632
You're fair enough
to try to make the right decision,

631
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:13,177
and arrogant enough that
nothing I can say will change your mind.

632
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,805
I don't want it
to be over, but,

633
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,434
unless worrying about it
is going to make a difference...

634
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,363
I'm going to run some stains.

635
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,199
He'll be less of an ass to you.

636
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,794
Patient dead yet?

637
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,045
No.

638
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,176
It's a little much
for a first date.

639
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,595
Obviously,
you've never dated me.

640
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,474
Feels like you
already got the lung and kidney samples.

641
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,100
Now I just need
a piece of your liver.

642
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,478
Hey, you might want
to use a little bit of lidocaine.

643
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:06,773
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Slight pinch!

644
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,910
You drugged me.

645
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,996
You drugged me.

646
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,523
Stopped by the lab.

647
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:52,443
Your mutinous team is starting to worry
about life on Pitcairn Island.

648
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,862
All your biopsies are clean.

649
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,907
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

650
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,869
Did Foreman finally okay
the amyloidosis treatment?

651
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:05,122
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

652
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,751
You risked your life again.

653
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,271
You couldn't be sure
he had amyloidosis.

654
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,880
You can't be sure
that I couldn't be sure.

655
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,507
You did one test.
It was negative.

656
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:15,883
- Inconclusive.
- Well, then,

657
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,303
by all means, flood your body
with possibly lethal blood.

658
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,889
I usually like to give
the lethal blood to Foreman,

659
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,516
but I'm the only
one who's type AB.

660
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,186
Of course
you're type AB, universal recipient.

661
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,438
You take from everybody.

662
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,525
Of course,
you're type O. Universal donor.

663
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,528
No wonder you're
paying three alimonies.

664
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:39,198
How do you know
what blood type I am?

665
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,450
I don't.
It just seemed to fit the metaphor.

666
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:42,952
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

667
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,955
Did you
test my blood for something?

668
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,082
Why would you
test my blood for something?

669
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,667
I didn't.

670
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,295
You must have told
me what you were.

671
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,922
Who the hell chats
about their blood type?

672
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,924
You had to have tested me.

673
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:05,182
There's no reason to ask anyone
their blood type.

674
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,312
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

675
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,525
Nurse,
can I have a moment with my patient?

676
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:15,735
He's due in radiation.

677
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,321
It's too late, he's dying.

678
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,578
Told you.

679
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,747
I'm sorry I doubted you.

680
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,835
It'd be a shame
if your secrets died with you.

681
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,173
Perhaps you've got
that trick written down somewhere.

682
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:41,218
Or maybe you want to
tell me and I'll write it down for you.

683
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,138
That way you can live on.

684
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,061
I'm taking it with me.
See, that way it stays magic.

685
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,357
You were wrong
about everything.

686
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:57,944
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

687
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,155
What's your blood type?

688
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:02,823
Type A.

689
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:05,910
What?

690
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,704
Trust me,
it's way cooler to know.

691
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,461
Where's Finn?

692
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,338
Up my sleeve.

693
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,300
It's not amyloidosis.
And his blood's fine.

694
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,511
We just gave him
the wrong type.

695
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,931
Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding,
multi-system failures.

696
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,060
But we tested his blood.

697
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,852
That's because we don't test blood
for type. We test for antibodies.

698
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,521
Because your
body only makes those antibodies

699
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,648
when you actually
have that type of blood.

700
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,233
Well, apparently,
he has one more symptom.

701
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,194
His body's making
an extra antibody, type B.

702
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,322
Combine that with his natural
type A and, presto, change-o,

703
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,242
he magically pulls
blood type AB out of his hat.

704
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,327
- Would you stop that?
- God, yes.

705
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,539
Autoimmune diseases can make antibodies
go haywire, but, still...

706
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:54,417
It's happened. And apparently,
it's happened again.

707
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,044
I finally have a case of lupus.

708
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,172
Flush him with saline,
transfuse four units, type A

709
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,590
and start him on steroids.

710
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:04,885
He'll be back
hoodwinking idiots in no time.

711
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,997
Big Love, rise.

712
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,089
Use their power wisely,
my Lord.

713
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,804
I nominate Amber.

714
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:52,016
Cutthroat Bitch, rise.

715
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:58,814
You're surprised?
You're everyone's pick.

716
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,816
Next victim.

717
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,318
I nominate.

718
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,404
Kutner.

719
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,914
Now everyone's surprised. Why?

720
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,042
You said I don't
have to justify my picks.

721
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,337
No, I said you
could use whatever criteria you want.

722
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,422
Doesn't mean
I don't wanna know.

723
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,966
He was right about
this being a real case,

724
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:30,888
he was right about the botched
transfusion and he's your love nugget.

725
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,182
You got no reason to pick him.

726
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:41,065
But somebody else does.

727
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,443
Kutner's a liability.

728
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,570
He electrocuted himself,
lit a patient on fire,

729
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,449
it's only a matter of time
before he burns the hospital down.

730
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,577
You made a deal with Cuddy.

731
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,375
That's how you
got her underwear.

732
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,379
She sold it to you for the right
to put her choices on the block.

733
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,882
You said get
her underwear. I got it.

734
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,969
Your scheme was brilliant,

735
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,681
and you're fired.

736
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,809
You're all about
breaking the rules.

737
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,769
Her rules, not mine.

738
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,230
The whole point
of this was to subvert Cuddy.

739
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,983
You became her partner,
gave her power she didn't already have.

740
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,485
Let her greedy fingers
into my cookie jar,

741
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,405
which sadly
is not as dirty as it sounds.

742
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,242
Thanks for playing.

743
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:01,729
What the hell is this?

744
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,693
Looks like an envelope with
the results of a genetic test

745
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:09,778
for Huntington's inside.

746
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,447
Did you look?

747
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:13,282
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

748
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,700
I don't want to know.

749
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,785
No, you're afraid to know.

750
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:21,457
I might die. So could you.
You could get hit by a bus tomorrow.

751
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:25,461
The only difference is you don't have to
know about it today. So why should I?

752
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,838
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers,

753
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,841
but if someone offered them to me,
I'd take them.

754
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,136
You spend your whole life
looking for answers,

755
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,932
because you think the next answer
will change something.

756
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:40,935
Maybe make you
a little less miserable.

757
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,771
And you know that when you run out
of questions

758
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:46,607
you don't just
run out of answers,

759
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,901
you run out of hope.

760
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,072
Are you glad you know that?
