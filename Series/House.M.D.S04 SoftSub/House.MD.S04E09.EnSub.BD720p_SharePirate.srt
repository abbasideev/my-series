1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,891
Roman emperors
were the real punks.

2
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,685
Don't say "punk." It's cliché.

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,890
Whatever. Let me tell you
about these dinner parties.

4
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,730
Nero loved a good poisoning.

5
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,524
- At a dinner party?
- He'd arrange one right at the table...

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,608
I don't feel like
going on tonight.

7
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,736
Too bad, 'cause that's what
makes the club feel like paying us.

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,613
Titus, this was
all in the book.

9
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,198
Titus would ply
his guests with wine,

10
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:32,701
then bind their privates
with a chord.

11
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,495
Hey! Did you get a new guitar?

12
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,957
A '64 teardrop reissue.
Not a mark on it.

13
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,460
All right.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,004
Can I see it?

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,092
Oh, it's nice.

16
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:55,306
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, cut it out, man! Hey!

17
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:57,684
You stupid son of a...
You're gonna pay!

18
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,602
It's a hunk of wood, bro.

19
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,187
It should look
like a hunk of wood.

20
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,189
We're not the philharmonic.

21
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,567
See, look, man.
It's better already.

22
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,114
Hey! It's 10:45.

23
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,533
How about taking that onstage?

24
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,327
Now I feel like going on.

25
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,038
<i>You're my child,
and so arethose quadruplets,</i>

26
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,874
<i>and I'm not gonna
give any of you up.</i>

27
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,502
<i>Don't you dare talk to meas a mother.</i>

28
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,672
Sign on the door
says "closed for private event."

29
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,632
You're alone.

30
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,343
How much more
private can you get?

31
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,678
Will you pass me a tissue?

32
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,722
Who are you keeping?
You owed me a decision 10 days ago.

33
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,224
Total amnesia.

34
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,937
<i>You're my whole life, you.</i>

35
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:09,607
And Luisa Maria can't decide
if she's gonna keep the quadruplets.

36
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,442
<i>Then how can you...</i>

37
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,696
She keeps them.
I read it online.

38
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,990
You happy now?
I ruined it for you.

39
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,867
- I want two names by Friday.
- Fine.

40
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,702
I'll arrange for a patient
with a mysterious illness

41
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,786
to come in on Thursday.

42
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,663
Yes. You need more tests.

43
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,206
It's only been two months.

44
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,709
Who knows how they'll react
to freak weather patterns?

45
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,043
They all did fine
in the wind tunnel.

46
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:33,464
Two names by Friday or the pay overruns
come out of your salary.

47
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,471
<i>I can hurt you.
I know that now.</i>

48
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,349
And I move
your parking space to the E lot.

49
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,353
<i>Don't ever leave me, Mom!</i>

50
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,772
Hey.

51
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,649
Who's the sickest patient
you got?

52
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:55,111
I've got a guy who'll be dead
in the next 10 minutes.

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,115
Oh. You mean someone who might actually
survive a diagnosis.

54
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,076
There's nothing here.

55
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,413
Just the usual cracked heads,
gunshots, false alarms.

56
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,708
Who would you pick to fill your
narrow little flats?

57
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,669
So, you can fire them
off my recommendation?

58
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,254
Nice try.

59
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,050
Hey, who do I have to grope to get
some turndown service in here?

60
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,719
Jimmy Quidd.
He's a punk rock singer.

61
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,346
Punk rock star to you.

62
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,015
Repeated trauma,
self-cutting, fever,

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,561
arthralgia, hyper-inflated chest,
fatigue, anemia,

64
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,355
blood in the stool and urine.

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,440
I've died and gone
to diagnostic heaven.

66
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:36,235
His blood results show booze, cocaine,
amphetamines, opiates.

67
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,447
The only mystery here
is how he made it to be 38.

68
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,615
<i>I'm 28.</i>

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,991
And he lies.

70
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,620
And he's a pain in the ass.

71
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,163
- Hey, come on.
- No.

72
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,415
Wrap him up.
I'll take him to go.

73
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,087
Dizzying array of symptoms,

74
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,967
any of which could be caused by drugs,
trauma, being a loser.

75
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,469
The guy's a walking pharmacy,
could be anything.

76
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:04,973
Oh, forgot to mention.
Final case.

77
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,058
Get it right, you're hired.

78
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:10,728
Runner-up will be decided strictly
on some definition of merit.

79
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:11,854
- Endocarditis.
- Hemorrhagic lesions

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,939
on the lungs and gut.

81
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,316
Bronchiolitis obliterans,
he smoked his airways into oblivion.

82
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,921
- Endocarditis.
- I already said that.

83
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:17,986
I heard of it
before you mentioned it.

84
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,113
Speed counts.
Find something else.

85
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,438
Could be bacterial meningitis.

86
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,074
- You already picked.
- I'll take meningitis.

87
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,743
Too late. Go run your tests.

88
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,371
No. He's sick
'cause he's a drug addict.

89
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,458
No. He has every symptom
you'd expect from a drug addict.

90
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,460
So, you think
it's all too perfect?

91
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,746
Some other disease
is trying to throw us off its trail?

92
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,090
If he had four out
of 20 possible symptoms,

93
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,217
he'd be
a garden-variety druggie.

94
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,761
Twenty out of 20,
there's an underlying disease.

95
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:44,721
Run your tests.

96
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,972
No!

97
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,225
He's weak, in withdrawal,
just spewed blood.

98
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,852
They're gonna rip off
a piece of his lung,

99
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:51,978
ram instruments
down his throat,

100
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,730
and Rota-Rooter his intestines.

101
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,023
It'd be nice
if we didn't kill him

102
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:57,984
trying to figure out
what's killing him.

103
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,906
One diagnosis,
one test at a time.

104
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,533
O2 sats are low,
hyper-inflated chest.

105
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,743
I need a bronchoscopy to...

106
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,828
- You just lost two points.
- What for?

107
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,913
For thinking
it makes a difference who goes first.

108
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,332
- Only one person can be right.
- What points?

109
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,834
Can't have an objective system

110
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,335
of measurement without numbers.

111
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,379
You lose three
for not knowing that.

112
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:24,677
From now on, only the person
holding this can treat or run tests.

113
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,930
Wanted to give you the serpent staff
with the poison axe-head,

114
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:31,142
but I left it in my car.

115
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,069
Don't need you.

116
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,904
It's one thing to hire based on a game.

117
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,863
Don't need your lecture.

118
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,907
It's insane to treat
based on a game.

119
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,700
You're not
taking the long view.

120
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,286
The one where
we stuff another patient in a body bag?

121
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,497
No, if we're wrong,
that'll come pretty fast.

122
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,124
The long view is the one where
we pick the best team,

123
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,003
that way we can use all the bags
we save for grocery shopping.

124
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,647
You're not buying
that argument, are you?

125
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:02,757
No.

126
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,258
In which case,
I'm back to my original position.

127
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,760
Don't need you.

128
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,603
What do you think of Amber?

129
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,564
I screwed up a diagnosis.

130
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,113
You don't seem
that upset by it.

131
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:31,077
I diagnosed a guy with adenocarcinoma
three months ago.

132
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,787
Told him he had six months.

133
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,957
So, now you gotta tell him that he's way
behind on his Christmas shopping?

134
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,918
He didn't get worse.
I rechecked everything.

135
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,754
Biopsy was a false positive.

136
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,590
Harmless lesions
caused by talc inhalation.

137
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,801
Medical clemency.

138
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,136
Interesting.

139
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,221
Why would you use that word?

140
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,181
Because I'm interested.

141
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,975
When I'm interested,
I describe the things

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,018
that make me interested
as interesting.

143
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,980
Most people would say
good, possibly great.

144
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,505
Why aren't you
able to just enjoy...

145
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:04,110
Why aren't other people
able to just be interested?

146
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,743
- Is he in there?
- Yeah.

147
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,787
Why'd you go right
for the drug theories?

148
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,832
If he had a history
of shoving cancer into his veins,

149
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,834
I'd have guessed cancer.

150
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,253
Okay. You're an idiot.

151
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:25,590
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

152
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,758
alone in a bathroom
with an oxygen tank.

153
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,810
I got your
new test results back.

154
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,022
Sorry I'm late.

155
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,233
Who's your colleague?

156
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,401
Dr. House.

157
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,986
Yes, Dr. Wilson.

158
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,947
I really don't
need the consult.

159
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,574
I know the prognosis.

160
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,075
Apparently not.

161
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:58,623
Mr. McKenna,
I can't believe I'm able to say this,

162
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,876
but you're cancer-free.

163
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,046
The biopsy looked
like adenocarcinoma, but it wasn't.

164
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,965
Harmless lesions
on your lungs. You're fine.

165
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,097
I don't get it.

166
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,935
- Cool.
- No, it's...

167
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,853
I know this must
come as a shock,

168
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,898
but I've
double-checked the labs.

169
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,901
I just accepted
an offer on my house.

170
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,445
I've had three goodbye parties.

171
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,073
I'm buying
plane tickets to Venice.

172
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,617
You can still use those
if you're alive.

173
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,955
I have to pay a $6,000 broker commission
on a house I'm not selling.

174
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,166
Money I don't have.

175
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,132
Thank you for letting me know.

176
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:02,061
I would have thought the living
would mean more than the expenses.

177
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,188
It's not about the money.

178
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,115
I have 17 points?

179
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,992
I started you all out on 100.

180
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,597
Then you blew up
part of the building.

181
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,995
Where's Foreman?

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,996
He 9011 paged.

183
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,956
- By who? Is it about our...
- Me.

184
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,542
I needed him right away,
somewhere else.

185
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,085
We're hiding from Foreman?

186
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,880
Foreman accused me
of playing games with patient care.

187
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,046
Who gets the eyeball next?

188
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,717
I haven't run my test yet.
It still might be a lung issue.

189
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,469
You can't run your test. The patient
had massive smoke inhalation.

190
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,638
Do a bronchoscopy,
it'll set off a laryngospasm.

191
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,015
I'll do
an open-lung biopsy instead.

192
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,017
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

193
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,810
The patient snuck a cigarette.

194
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,479
The patient is an addict.
It's not his fault he's jonesing

195
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,044
for whatever
he can get his hands on.

196
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,983
Not his fault he's jonesing?

197
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,319
In what universe does
that make any sense?

198
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,446
Get him on a nicotine patch.

199
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,823
That'll keep up
with his joneses.

200
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,283
Do your biopsy.

201
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,085
How's the new us's
final case going?

202
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,006
It's a moving target. House keeps moving
it, so I can't find it.

203
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:17,428
So, you decided to focus on solving
the problem in Darfur?

204
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,514
Taub is in there
prepping the patient for a biopsy.

205
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,392
Stay close to Taub,
I stay close to House.

206
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,187
And stay close to the game.

207
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,022
I'm trying to stop the game.

208
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,149
That's your role in the game.

209
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,485
Did you wander
over here to annoy me?

210
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,487
You're not wearing a lab coat.

211
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,280
House doesn't
wear one, does he?

212
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,531
Damn!

213
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,075
Now when I walk away,
it's gonna look like

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,369
I have a reason other
than just annoyance.

215
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,541
He won't let us
finish prepping him for the biopsy.

216
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,001
Try the other arm.

217
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,380
The problem's not the arm,
it's the entire patient.

218
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,808
Hi.

219
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,227
He let you check his chest.

220
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,021
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

221
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,025
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

222
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,198
Real rebellion has a point,

223
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,992
it's not just
juvenile and purposeless.

224
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,996
Maybe purposelessness
is my purpose.

225
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,748
Mission accomplished.

226
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,543
Amber, it's not the patches.

227
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,670
He's got blood clots
moving through his body.

228
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,464
Means I was wrong.

229
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,135
Oh!

230
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:46,100
If the clot reaches his lungs
or his heart, it'll kill him.

231
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,563
It's true!

232
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,022
We all know it's true.

233
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,148
You just wasted our time.

234
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,483
And what you're doing?

235
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,651
I'm not competing.

236
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,903
- Where's Taub?
- Foreman was following him.

237
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,113
So, you paged Taub.

238
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,240
Didn't see that
I had much choice.

239
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,076
He has schistocytes
on his blood smear

240
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,036
which means DIC's
causing the clotting.

241
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,288
What's causing the DIC?

242
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,290
- Drug impurities.
- You lost your round.

243
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,455
New symptom, new round.
This has to be drug related.

244
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,711
This is how doctors kill patients,
by seeing the stereotypes...

245
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,088
Drug addicts use drugs
is a stereotype?

246
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,090
Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

247
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,134
- Losers lose is...
- Malaria.

248
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,677
He hasn't left
the country in years.

249
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,345
Malaria's relapsing-recurring.

250
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,222
For all we know,
he could have been sick for years.

251
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,642
It explains not just the DIC and
the bleeding, but the tiredness, fever,

252
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,186
everything
we attributed to drugs.

253
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,563
Oh, yeah. It's much more likely
that this ass punk rocker

254
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,733
was exposed to
malaria than drugs?

255
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,152
If you were always right,
then you wouldn't have just been wrong.

256
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,446
Or let the patient
mainline nicotine.

257
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,323
Or ravaged my anatomical model,

258
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,867
which Grandma House bought me
when I aced my MCATs.

259
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,578
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on Tuesday.

260
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,079
Grandma does
some part-time work.

261
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:51,290
The rep was
a 30-something babe.

262
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,334
Thank you. I got her hips.

263
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,002
Carry it with pride.

264
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:58,714
Manipulative bitch,
you're wanted in the laser's circle.

265
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,305
Why do you hate drug addicts?

266
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,224
Your situation is different.

267
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,476
You're taking
a necessary prescription...

268
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,604
I know. I'm fabulous.
And I'm not the patient.

269
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,439
I'm not allowed to have
a problem with junkies?

270
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,234
You're allowed.
There's gotta be a reason.

271
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,238
He's the patient. You don't know him.
Why do you hate him?

272
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,656
He's throwing his life away.

273
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,158
'Cause he's
setting his own terms,

274
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,119
not living in fear
of every pop quiz?

275
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,539
I thought we were
talking about him.

276
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,084
We were never
talking about him.

277
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,629
Why are you afraid to lose?

278
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,258
Are you gonna fire me
because I like to win?

279
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,510
Just wanna know the reason.

280
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:51,392
I watched this football game once,
and I noticed something odd.

281
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,144
The winning team
was the happy one.

282
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,064
I did the math.

283
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,857
Our patient's happy.

284
00:14:58,983 --> 00:14:59,858
He's an idiot.

285
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,819
He's a happy idiot.

286
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,863
That screws
with your worldview.

287
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,910
There's something freeing
about being a loser, isn't there?

288
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:10,869
Why are you afraid to...

289
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:14,623
Mommy didn't love me enough.
Daddy expected too much from me.

290
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,334
Something.

291
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:23,382
Let's assume that's true. I get how
that can make me a screwed up person.

292
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,469
But how is my willingness
to do anything to get the right answer

293
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,263
bad for my patients?

294
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,062
Or put in terms you can understand,
how is it bad for you?

295
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,405
I didn't ask you
to pick up the meds.

296
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,615
I'm trying to be
a good colleague.

297
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,033
You're trying
to boost your score

298
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,398
by prescribing drugs for House.

299
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,744
Why else
would you have a second bag?

300
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,203
Didn't say good
colleague to you.

301
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,496
You realize
we still have a patient.

302
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,831
Don't care about the patient.

303
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,833
You care about this job more
than you care about his life?

304
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,710
I care about my wallpaper more
than I care about his life.

305
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,075
Okay. You're jerking me around.

306
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,504
There's no reason
to be a doctor if you don't care.

307
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,548
I care about life.
I just don't care about his.

308
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,009
He doesn't care, why should I?
My time is better spent...

309
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,053
Kissing up to your boss?

310
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,222
Average doctor cuts off a patient
18 seconds into a history,

311
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,350
because that's all
the time he's got.

312
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,852
Meanwhile, six of us are administering
to a guy with a death wish.

313
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,145
So, why do you want the job?

314
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,440
Not because I'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

315
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,108
Good for you.

316
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,907
Where is he?

317
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,117
We're gonna spend the next hour

318
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,329
looking for a guy
who doesn't wanna be found.

319
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,255
Jimmy Quidd's
greatest stiff. 1989.

320
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,258
A profit-seeking
entity released this?

321
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,344
He put it out himself.

322
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,221
He wanted people to
listen, but apparently

323
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,057
didn't want people
to enjoy listening.

324
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,809
- Now, why would someone...
- Truly a mystery.

325
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,187
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

326
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,194
Why would you have
a blank liability release form

327
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,197
plus your checkbook
on top of your desk?

328
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,867
Probably because
they were in the second drawer,

329
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,619
in a manila envelope,
under a book,

330
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,413
and you put them
on top of my desk.

331
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,331
You usually keep
your checkbook at home.

332
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,710
It's your go-to excuse
for why you can't lend me money.

333
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,005
You're gonna pay
the guy the six grand, aren't you?

334
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,551
There are other people
I write checks to. I do have cable.

335
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,387
There's no negligence
without injury.

336
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,556
I handed the guy
a death sentence.

337
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,401
He's not distressed
with the death sentence.

338
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,351
He's distressed
with the life sentence.

339
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,603
I gave him
three months of misery.

340
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,606
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

341
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,234
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

342
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,153
and without you,
he's gonna be boring again.

343
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,239
Hi.

344
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,742
Results of
the malaria tests already?

345
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,160
Well, no.

346
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:00,539
But we were wondering if you'd sent
the patient for any additional tests?

347
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,837
You lost the patient.

348
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,885
Taub, you check lost and found.
Thirteen, come with me.

349
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,639
Why do you love drug addicts?

350
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,809
I won't pigeonhole the patient,
so that means I'm...

351
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,604
Perfectly capable
of drawing my own conclusions.

352
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,290
Are you capable of
answering a question?

353
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,077
I think there's more
to him than the drugs.

354
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,192
Admirable, why?

355
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,902
I need a reason
for doing something admirable?

356
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,111
There's always a reason.

357
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,780
He's a patient.
You don't know him. Why do you like him?

358
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,282
Alcoholic parent?
Druggie youth?

359
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,371
There's no such thing
as a saint without a past.

360
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:38,368
Or a sinner without a future.

361
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,663
What makes you so sure that drugs
are a mask for something else?

362
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,500
Drugs are always
a mask for something else.

363
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,047
That's the dumbest thing
I've heard in my life.

364
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,060
You really want this job?

365
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,354
Why, you think
you can talk me into leaving?

366
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,522
You're a person
who likes her privacy,

367
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,488
working for a man
who needs to know everything.

368
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,484
You're a person
who cares about her patients,

369
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,403
working for a man
who cares about games.

370
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,405
I hear him.

371
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,246
Neither sleet, nor mail,
nor dread of night.

372
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,623
Hold on.

373
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,334
Malaria's not contagious.

374
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,920
Children, I bid you good night.

375
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,556
Which one of you guys
sapped my powers?

376
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,394
Was it you?
Did you take my powers?

377
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,146
Or maybe it was you.

378
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,233
Well, no matter. See, I'm feeling
stronger already.

379
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,199
It's okay. It's okay.
He's okay.

380
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,951
Respiration's good.
Pulse is solid.

381
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,203
We need a lot of
nurses in here!

382
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:24,057
Dr. Cuddy, the face
that launched a thousand long faces.

383
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,685
Get control of your patient.

384
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,812
Strap him to the bed
if you have to.

385
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,480
I wanna keep all four.

386
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,065
You can have two.

387
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,234
You don't get
negotiation, do you?

388
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:38,030
I say four, you say three.
We finally settle on three-and-a-half,

389
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,893
which would be
good news for Taub.

390
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,284
You don't want four.
You don't want three.

391
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,163
But if I say three,
you get to keep playing your game.

392
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,957
Who would you pick?

393
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,751
Are you asking my opinion?

394
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,296
If you have any absolute truths,
that would be even better.

395
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,214
You never want my advice.

396
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,551
You spend your life
trying to avoid my advice.

397
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,553
You're
a bureaucratic nightmare,

398
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,971
you're a chronic
pain in the ass,

399
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,140
and you're
a second-rate doctor at best.

400
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,017
Am I blushing?

401
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,437
But you do know this stuff.

402
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,736
Can we get this over with?

403
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,364
Taub and Kutner.

404
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,576
Taub will stand up to you. You won't
like him, but you'll respect him.

405
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,080
Kutner shares
your philosophy of medicine.

406
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,151
God knows I don't
need two of you,

407
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,751
but he will actually help you.

408
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,171
It's not malaria,
the blood work is negative.

409
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,656
But we did find the reason for the DIC.
Bad blood fragments.

410
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,434
So if we can figure
out how they got there...

411
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,848
Blood exposure during sex?

412
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,433
Haemolysis
from the malaria meds?

413
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,395
Stop guessing,
you'll spoil the surprise.

414
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,938
If you're looking
to get information out of the guy,

415
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,649
he's not exactly
the bare-your-soul type.

416
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:01,905
Hey, I was wondering if you guys know
The <i>Girl</i> from Ipanema?

417
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,784
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

418
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,207
That's mine, man.

419
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,751
You're gonna be
denying that in a second.

420
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,426
Next time make sure you bring enough
for the whole class.

421
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,886
He's been sharing
needles with this guy.

422
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,222
Means he injected this guy's blood,
his own blood attacked it,

423
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,975
chewed it up,
those were the fragments we found.

424
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,101
So, DIC was nothing?

425
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,477
We're back to bloody vomit,

426
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,273
and his two dozen other drug
or non-drug symptoms.

427
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,943
Re-check everything.

428
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,946
Throw these guys out
and strap the patient down.

429
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,114
House!

430
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,079
Respiratory failure.

431
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,082
Good news for you, Thirteen.

432
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,003
'Cause that is
definitely not drugs.

433
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,967
The blood clots
were drug related.

434
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:08,055
Coughing up blood and the respiratory
arrests are still on the table.

435
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,139
Inhalants?

436
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,141
If I wanted or needed
your drug diagnosis,

437
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,851
I would have told
Foreman where we are.

438
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,770
He knows where we are.

439
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,607
'Cause he followed you!

440
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,400
- I followed Taub.
- I followed her.

441
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,736
He had a bleeding problem.
That could cause respiratory arrest.

442
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,739
Again, if I wanted to forgive
his Drano drinking ways,

443
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,783
I wouldn't ignore
what you just said.

444
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:28,788
Could be an infection.

445
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,870
- No, lumbar puncture's clear.
- What lumbar puncture?

446
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,371
You didn't authorize that test.

447
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,540
True, and yet here
I am with the results.

448
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,425
Thirteen thought it was
bacterial meningitis.

449
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,044
And I had the eyeball.

450
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,378
It was a harmless test.

451
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,547
Patient's welfare still counts
for something, doesn't it?

452
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:43,840
Yep. Minus 50.

453
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,177
Chronic pulmonary embolisms
would explain the breathing problem

454
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,846
and the blood
coming from his lungs.

455
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,768
- I'll run an ultrasound...
- You're not running any tests.

456
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,020
He knows it's not PEs,
the guy's d-dimer's normal.

457
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,063
That doesn't always rule out...

458
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,357
You go in to run one test,
run eight more like she did,

459
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:04,069
find out which one's right,
then comes back with a brilliant guess.

460
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,821
- Is this true?
- No.

461
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:09,157
That's too bad, 'cause that would have
earned you 40 points for cleverness.

462
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,576
Points go to Amber.
Foreman, you run the test.

463
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,454
Sure, anything I can do
to help your game.

464
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,660
- He's not gonna run the tests.
- No. I don't think so.

465
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,049
So, what's wrong with me?

466
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,927
You mean, besides your music?

467
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,847
Oh, sure. Just because I don't play
your kind of music,

468
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,598
it's not music, right?

469
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,518
Yeah, I resent you
'cause you're not Perry Como.

470
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:43,483
Look I don't play
for an audience, okay?

471
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,778
Well, then, that stage
you stand on is an odd choice.

472
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,573
I just... I do it for me, okay?
I don't do it for you.

473
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,658
There are three choices
in this life.

474
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,743
Be good, get good or give up.

475
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,705
You've gone for column D. Why?

476
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,712
Simple answer is if you don't try,
you can't fail.

477
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,217
Are you really that simple?

478
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:13,722
Look, yeah, some people,
they like my music.

479
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,640
Most people can't stand it.

480
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,604
But they just sort of
just shrug and ignore me.

481
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,691
But a few, they feel
like they have to tell me

482
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,363
what I'm screwing up,
you know, what I'm wasting.

483
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,202
Why do they care?

484
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:41,082
You have some peculiar masses
near your heart.

485
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,542
Peculiar, how?

486
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,629
Well, unlike your music, they elicit
some emotional response.

487
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,883
That's odd.

488
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,510
You care
if I appreciate your music,

489
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,096
but you don't care
if you live or die.

490
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,101
Maybe the answer
is that simple.

491
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:05,982
I can't apologize
enough, to you, to your family.

492
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,987
There may not be any technical
liability here but...

493
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,952
You're ripping it up
because you think

494
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,746
it would be wrong
to take money from me?

495
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:24,042
I think it would be wrong
to take so little money from you.

496
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,503
You're out $6,000...

497
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,004
You ruined my life.

498
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,881
I ruined three months.

499
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:34,010
For the first time in my life,
I was living in the present,

500
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,256
'cause that's all there was.

501
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:41,726
You're suing me, not for the wrong
diagnosis, but for the right one?

502
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,731
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

503
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,943
You gave me happiness,

504
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,239
and then you took it away.

505
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,538
Definitely no emboli.

506
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:02,580
It's pretty fuzzy.

507
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,250
Hey, for point and shoot,
I thought I did okay.

508
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,584
It's fuzzy
'cause he was still shaking,

509
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,254
'cause he was coming down
from the heroin.

510
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,422
Where is everybody else?

511
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,424
Clinic's been quarantined.

512
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,051
Patient came in with
avian flu-like symptoms,

513
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,262
and 50 extra dollars
in spending money.

514
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,055
Can you do this echo again?

515
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,975
Okay, minus five
for ingratitude.

516
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,476
No "Thank you, Dr. House."

517
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,103
No "Here's a bottle of Codeine"

518
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,748
"for your troubles,
Dr. House." Oh, no.

519
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,315
I was asking
if you could do it again

520
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,817
after giving him
a sedative to keep him still.

521
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,361
I could. We'd definitely
get the answer,

522
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,613
but since the opiates would decrease
his respiratory drive,

523
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,824
and he already
can barely breathe,

524
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:40,118
minus 10 for asking me
to kill the patient.

525
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,454
What if it's
a congenital defect,

526
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,456
an anomalous
vessel on his heart?

527
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,833
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff, right?

528
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,668
And the lungs do the breathing?

529
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,546
If the vessel wrapped
around his trachea.

530
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,508
What do you want me to do?

531
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:58,636
MRA.

532
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,723
So you can get a clear picture
of that vessel.

533
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,976
What? Wait, what? What? Why?

534
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,480
You said the picture sucked
because the patient was shaking.

535
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,689
MRA will be worse.

536
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,733
We have to get a picture.

537
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,364
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

538
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,324
How can we see it
if we don't take a picture?

539
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,619
You can see me, right?

540
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,039
We wanna look at his heart
with our eyes.

541
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,293
So, I kill the patient
on my operating table,

542
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,087
you get to keep
testing your team,

543
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,381
and I take the heat from Cuddy.

544
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,347
If it goes that way, yeah,
that'd be excellent.

545
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,103
His respiratory status
is through the floor.

546
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,387
If there's a vessel
and we don't remove it fast,

547
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,722
best case,
he's on a ventilator for life.

548
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,849
Granted, it'll be a short one.

549
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,644
Who do you think I should hire?

550
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,772
You want me to tell you
in front of him?

551
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,691
Well, it'd be rude
to ask him to leave now.

552
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,445
If you don't do the surgery,
the patient will die.

553
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,322
You'll have had
nothing to do with it,

554
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,408
and everyone will know
that you had nothing to do with it.

555
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,243
And everyone will know
that it's because

556
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,203
you were pissed off
at House for firing you.

557
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,996
You know that's not
why I'm saying no.

558
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,958
Yeah, but that's how
it's gonna play out.

559
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,545
Keep him and Amber.
You'll get stuff done.

560
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,965
Prep him for surgery.

561
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,929
This isn't an anomalous vessel.

562
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,141
Look at these lymph nodes.
Way too big.

563
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,893
They're the masses you saw.

564
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,770
70 over 40. He's crashing.

565
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,063
Two units of PRBCs.

566
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,732
Starting dopamine.
We're losing him!

567
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,652
So, how's your game going?

568
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,905
It's not whether
you win or lose.

569
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,414
Respiratory failure
and large lymph nodes.

570
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,792
Whatever this is, he's not gonna be
breathing much longer.

571
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,502
Does Foreman being here
means the game's over?

572
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,546
It means the patient's life
is almost over.

573
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,882
You can call it what you want.

574
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,219
We're done, people. Come on!

575
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,889
I need ideas. I don't care
who they come from.

576
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,534
Of course you do.
This is still a game.

577
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,518
You're still gonna reward whoever gets
the right idea, punish whoever's wrong.

578
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,313
Hire who you want.
Get this over with.

579
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,985
Thirteen, Kutner.

580
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,281
I'm sorry. Go home.

581
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,869
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

582
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:28,828
He just told me that I gotta...

583
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,246
Lungs are stiff, could be ARDS.

584
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,748
You fluid overloaded him.

585
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,083
Anyone's lungs would leak
after that surgery.

586
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,752
- Goodbye.
- Anaphylactic shock.

587
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,003
No sign of bronchospasm.

588
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,129
What if the lymph nodes
are caused by

589
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,881
chronic stimulation
of his immune system?

590
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,049
Impurities in his drugs
could've...

591
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,717
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things.

592
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,261
An immune overreaction
would explain everything.

593
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,055
Drug diagnosis.

594
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,390
That's what you're going with?

595
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,526
That firing thing,
it was all a dream.

596
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,613
Go find where he gets his drugs
and what's in them.

597
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:07,116
And put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

598
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,289
Competition works.

599
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,091
So, you're not
gonna tell me who sells you drugs?

600
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,428
What does it matter?

601
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,514
You're dying. Does that matter?

602
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,725
Not really.

603
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,399
I'm not an adult.

604
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,778
Never wanted to be.

605
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,157
So, if the choice

606
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,328
is running out
the clock with a walker,

607
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,957
and a bedpan...

608
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,175
You don't regret anything?

609
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,512
Well, there was a lot of drugs,

610
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,602
a lot of drinking,
a lot of fights.

611
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,362
I regret everything else.

612
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,536
You hate me, don't you?

613
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,540
Yeah.

614
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,336
I don't care.

615
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,384
What's it like?

616
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,891
It means you have no regrets.

617
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,119
Kind of
sticks in your head, doesn't it?

618
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,871
This guy's amazing.

619
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,415
There's not one redeeming note.

620
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,542
What sort of a lawyer
tells his client

621
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,920
he's got a case because
he's going to live?

622
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,214
I've heard that not all lawyers

623
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,257
are as ethical as
the ones we see on TV.

624
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,385
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

625
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,220
Well, the guys on TV
don't, either.

626
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,681
I think he has
a medical degree.

627
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,112
It directly affects
my bottom line.

628
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,196
If you have less
money to lend...

629
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,657
I'm trying to take
responsibility.

630
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,951
And I'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

631
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,452
You might as well keep yours.

632
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,204
And lend it to you?

633
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,707
You have to control everything.

634
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
How come you're going around asking
everyone who you should fire?

635
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,420
I'm asking for input!

636
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,346
I thought you would have
admired the humility.

637
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,674
You like games because
you can control them.

638
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,008
God, I'm gonna put
the record back on.

639
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,886
You like what's interesting,
never mind if it's real or good.

640
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,180
You wanna know
why you offered that guy six grand?

641
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,466
Life just happens,
and that scares the hell out of you.

642
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,226
You think you can cure pain.

643
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,511
You think you can avoid pain.

644
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,443
You think you're responsible
for every failure,

645
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,899
every patient's boring life,
every friend's screwed-up...

646
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,569
You don't wanna
face it any more than my patient does.

647
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,280
Dying's easy. Living's hard.

648
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:38,703
That can't possibly be
as poignant as it sounded.

649
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,125
Still can't find
the drug source,

650
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,376
but I don't think
that's the problem.

651
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,003
The dimercaprol isn't working,

652
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:50,381
and Quidd volunteers
at a home for abandoned kids.

653
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,587
Why are you telling me this?

654
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:52,925
Because his
bass player told me.

655
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,260
Is it medically relevant?

656
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,386
I don't know.

657
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:59,182
Well, then, why are you...
Stop playing games and do your job.

658
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,356
No.

659
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,909
This time I'm firing
Taub and Amber.

660
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,288
This is a joke, right?

661
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,665
It's only a joke if you come up
with the answer.

662
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:27,376
It's not really funny
if you don't.

663
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,881
Thirteen and Kutner,
you're fired, too.

664
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,134
- Foreman?
- He's a druggie.

665
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,512
I was never sure
there was a disease in the first place.

666
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:40,515
So, all we know
is that he's dying.

667
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,518
Who wants to tell the patient?

668
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,396
Fine, I'll get some kid
to go talk to him.

669
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:50,525
It's the only people
he gets along with anyway.

670
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,693
Are we still fired?

671
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,533
He works with abandoned kids.

672
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,660
Is it medically relevant?

673
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,411
I think so.

674
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,416
I need a brain biopsy.

675
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,377
For the patient.

676
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,630
You two switch.

677
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,674
You wanna drill into
the skull of a patient

678
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,885
who almost died
on the operating table yesterday?

679
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,765
Why are they here?

680
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:26,811
Because I wouldn't have gotten
the answer without each of them.

681
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,855
You could have just told me.

682
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,398
I want you to feel guilty.

683
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,358
She thinks
the patient's a loser.

684
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,193
She thinks
the patient's a winner,

685
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:37,029
just a regular guy
with a regular problem.

686
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,615
He thinks he's gonna be great
once he's all grown up,

687
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,077
and he thinks...
What did you think?

688
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,662
- Autoimmune.
- Right.

689
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,706
Less interesting
but just as important.

690
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,584
- We can't all be right.
- You're all wrong.

691
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,128
My mom always said that two wrongs
don't make a right.

692
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,797
She never said anything
about four wrongs.

693
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,883
I always found that suspicious.

694
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,302
Plain old measles,
constant exposure from

695
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,304
hanging out with
Oliver Twist and his lot.

696
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,389
I assume he's been vaccinated.

697
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:06,434
Patient's immune system
was shredded with years of drugs.

698
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,603
Early markers of rash and fever

699
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,187
would have been lost
on a druggie.

700
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,556
His immune system overreacted,

701
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,066
which is why
his body went haywire.

702
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,402
That's clever.

703
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:21,532
You're not doing a biopsy
without neurological symptoms.

704
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:24,243
If I'm right,
the virus is in his brain.

705
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,579
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course.

706
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,915
I need a neurological...

707
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,291
He kept swallowing.

708
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,793
Could be neurological,
could be a complex partial seizure.

709
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,712
What did it look like?

710
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,885
Good God, woman,
how much more proof do you need?

711
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,264
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

712
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,184
<i>Hoes, hum!</i>

713
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:51,437
We're gonna use
flashing lights.

714
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,565
Noxious stimulation,
it'll irritate your brain.

715
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,858
If there's damage
to your neurons,

716
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,486
it'll trigger a seizure.
That way we can...

717
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:01,113
I got something
much more noxious.

718
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:08,746
It's not as commonly used, but sound
can be just as big an irritant.

719
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,839
Now remind me
of your influences here!

720
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:22,051
'Cause I'm gonna
say Thelonious Monk

721
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:25,888
and the sound a trash compactor
makes when you crawl inside it.

722
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:31,310
I don't do it for you.
I do it for me.

723
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:42,571
What do you think?
Is he seizing or dancing?

724
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,031
Seizing.

725
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,117
Play him the B side,
it's even worse.

726
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,327
Schedule an OR for the biopsy.

727
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,621
See you in the lecture hall.

728
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:22,445
A little mood music,
build the suspense.

729
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,280
Sounds more folky.

730
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,452
You seriously have no idea
when to shut up, do you?

731
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,289
Amber, please stand.

732
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,044
You didn't call me bitch.
Is that bad?

733
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:44,091
You played the game
better than anybody else here,

734
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,219
but for the wrong reasons.

735
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,388
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing...

736
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,848
You were wrong.

737
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:59,482
Twenty years ago, this was recorded
by Jim Moskowitz,

738
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,568
who later became
known as Jimmy Quidd.

739
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:09,533
Loves kids, apparently has a heart,
perhaps even a soul.

740
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,497
If you're gonna work for me,

741
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:18,459
you have to be
willing to be wrong, willing to lose.

742
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,754
Because you just did.

743
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,756
You're fired.

744
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,434
Thirteen, please stand.

745
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:41,816
You're fired.

746
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,322
You just said
I was right about...

747
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,199
He was a drug addict.

748
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,872
Four applicants, two spots.

749
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:00,501
If I had three, I'd keep you.

750
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,758
Game over.

751
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,615
You're gonna
have to grow old after all.

752
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,327
You've got measles. We're blasting you
with corticosteroids.

753
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,707
What's wrong with you?

754
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,333
I got fired.

755
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,089
Well, what are you doing here?

756
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,675
Trying not to care.

757
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,386
Yeah?

758
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,639
That's not easy.

759
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,399
What the hell did you do?

760
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:07,985
You told me to hire
Kutner and Taub.

761
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,361
Because I knew you wouldn't.

762
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,321
Oops.

763
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,198
I can't let you hire two men.

764
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:13,407
Now, that is sexist.

765
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,825
You've already got Foreman.

766
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,910
Is he a dude?

767
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,828
Hire a woman, too.

768
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,121
Hire two women?

769
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:22,541
You can have the one that
gives a crap about people.

770
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,295
- They both do.
- Right.

771
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,714
Hire Thirteen.

772
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,516
This was your plan all along.

773
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,442
Well, at least
the games are over.

774
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,362
How long have you known me?
