1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,963
<i>Big Eye,
this is Cobra Zero Six.</i>

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,633
<i>Just entered Indian Country,
approaching way point four.</i>

3
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:09,803
<i>Request confirmation
to engage target on first approach.</i>

4
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:11,388
<i>Roger, Cobra Zero Six.</i>

5
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,807
<i>Big Eye waiting for
confirmation as well.</i>

6
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,225
<i>If we wait any longer, Big Eye,</i>

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,726
<i>we're not gonna have
any choice in the matter.</i>

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,687
<i>I can't exactly
do a U-turn here.</i>

9
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:21,523
<i>Roger that, Cobra.
Hold for confirmation.</i>

10
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,450
Captain Cooper, are you okay?

11
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,784
What happened?
You weren't answering.

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,370
Because the damn comm cord
got disconnected!

13
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,205
You spend a billion
dollars on the avionics

14
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,291
and don't bother to check
the comm connection?

15
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,792
No, I checked that
twice before you got in...

16
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,503
And the next time you ask us
to test a prototype,

17
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,756
it'd be nice if your directional gyro
didn't spin like a top

18
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,883
when I'm supposed to be
500 feet off the floor.

19
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,509
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:36,139
I'll go review the simulation,
see if I can figure out what went wrong.

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,098
Who is this man?

22
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,979
Come on, take a shot.

23
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm not gonna fire you every time
you get a wrong answer.

24
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,775
Neville Chamberlain.

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,984
You're fired.

26
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,947
Does this man look
like he's ceding Czechoslovakia

27
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,782
to a fascist dictatorship?

28
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:40,370
It's Buddy Ebsen, the actor.
He's dead. Why are we...

29
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:45,208
Buddy Ebsen was the original tin man
in the Wizard <i>of Oz,</i> for a day.

30
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,336
He was diagnosed allergic
to the aluminum dust in the makeup.

31
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,173
His lungs failed. He nearly died.
Question is, why?

32
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,883
Didn't you just
say he was allergic?

33
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,720
You may not have legs, but you got ears.
I suggest you use them.

34
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,223
I said he was
diagnosed allergic.

35
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:04,269
Since we are currently short
exactly one interesting patient,

36
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:08,439
we are gonna figure out what really
happened to Buddy Ebsen in 1938.

37
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,441
Now, on one hand,
he's not getting deader.

38
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:14,863
On the other hand,
your jobs hang in the balance. Se...

39
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:16,656
House?

40
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,497
I want seven alternate
diagnoses when I get back.

41
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,336
Did you forget how
to count to three?

42
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,671
I get a budget for three.

43
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,157
Doesn't mean I can
only hire three.

44
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,883
Actually, that's exactly
what it means.

45
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:37,427
I cut the permanent
salaries by 10%.

46
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,346
Over three years, that'll more than
make up for the breakage on the <i>27</i>

47
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,973
that I'm gonna weed out
over the next few weeks.

48
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,017
There's 40 people in there.

49
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,604
Row D, you're fired.

50
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,024
I didn't actually
count all the resumes.

51
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,319
This is stupid.
You can't manage that many people.

52
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,571
You're just gonna keep
weeding them out arbitrarily?

53
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,698
Sure, and having them
sitting in my office

54
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,409
schmoozing about their
favorite Algerian surfing movies

55
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,952
is a much better system.

56
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,872
- Wait a second. Were you in Row D?
- Yes.

57
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,625
My apologies. My boss says
I'm being arbitrary and stupid.

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,711
Row D is not fired. Row C is fired!

59
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,088
- What?
- Great. Thank you.

60
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:18,051
See, that was not arbitrary.

61
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,054
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I've been paged.

62
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,389
That's interesting.

63
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,308
Apparently, <i>I</i> paged myself.

64
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:39,197
If you have a resume there,
I'm not interested.

65
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,241
But I wouldn't mind hearing
how you got my pager number.

66
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,785
It's not a resume.

67
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,705
$50,000.

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,250
Does One-Eyed Nicky want me to run
that to Jimmy the Nose?

69
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:53,503
It's for my medical bills.

70
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,714
I need you to find out
what's wrong with me.

71
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,300
Insurance is usually
cheaper than that.

72
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,971
Cash means there's
something to hide.

73
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,430
I'm a captain in the Air Force,

74
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,224
about to start
a new assignment.

75
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:09,185
NASA's astronaut
training program.

76
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,605
I discovered salt
and created FM radio.

77
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,025
Something is wrong
with my eyes, my ears...

78
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:20,905
Well, if it's fixable,
the Air Force will do it for free.

79
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:22,865
If not, it doesn't matter.

80
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,326
There are a hundred applicants
ready to take my place

81
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,078
who don't need to be fixed.

82
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,913
I need to do
this off the books.

83
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,916
I did the research.
You're the best, you break rules,

84
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,585
and you don't care about anyone
except yourself.

85
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,548
Well, let's say that's true.

86
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,051
You get a new job.

87
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,930
Hospital gets
a nice wad of cash.

88
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,307
What do I get?

89
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,185
I crashed a flight simulator

90
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,315
because I started
to hear with my eyes.

91
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:01,988
The aluminum could
have been tainted...

92
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,948
Don't care. New patient!

93
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,453
30-year-old female
with synesthesia.

94
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,538
New rules.

95
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,710
You generate a lab report,
you shred it.

96
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,545
X-ray, you melt it.

97
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,839
No notes, no records, nothing.

98
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,426
As far as you're concerned,
the patient is Osama Bin Laden

99
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:27,346
and everyone not in this
room is Delta Force. Any questions?

100
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,016
We're protecting
Osama Bin Laden?

101
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,517
It's a metaphor.

102
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,811
Get used to it.
Any more questions?

103
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,117
And you're not even gonna
tell us her name?

104
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,067
You think her name might be connected
to what's wrong with her?

105
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,070
Here's Osama.

106
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:54,207
Now, you all have numbers,
so we're gonna do this alphabetically.

107
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,710
8, 15 and 5.

108
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,212
Is the synesthesia new?

109
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:00,797
Yes.

110
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,466
Any history of
similar symptoms or psychiatric...

111
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,717
No, nothing.

112
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,179
Are you on any prescription meds
or use any other drugs?

113
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,181
- No.
- Should we trust her answers?

114
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,184
What, you think I'd pull
you off Buddy Ebsen just for a junkie?

115
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,685
Can we trust your answers?

116
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,104
You gotta trust someone, right?

117
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,396
No.

118
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:21,109
Has anyone close to you been sick
lately? A family member, co-worker?

119
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,985
No, not that I'm aware of.

120
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,904
Two down. Kitty Carlisle?

121
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,573
Do you spend much
time above 20,000 feet?

122
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,662
Why would you ask that?

123
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,956
People who fly are immobile
for long periods.

124
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:38,084
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

125
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,752
That's an unusual choice.

126
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,379
Well, like you said,
you wouldn't interrupt Buddy

127
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,297
with anything that wasn't.

128
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,802
The patient is
a frequent flyer.

129
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,684
13, 32, 39, get Osama
an EEG, MRI and angiogram.

130
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,564
How many of you think
that Oswald acted alone?

131
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,484
If, by alone, you mean
that he was unaware that the CIA...

132
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,403
Oh, shut up.

133
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,947
Split yourself into two groups.

134
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,491
Test her blood. Test her stool.

135
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:15,037
Who likes the
designated hitter?

136
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,167
You're wrong.
You're lucky you're not fired.

137
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,711
Two more groups
LP and cultures.

138
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,714
Who doesn't know what
a designated hitter is?

139
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,633
Okay, here's her address.

140
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,179
I want you to break in
and find out what she's hiding.

141
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,686
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

142
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,771
Well, if you can find out
what she's hiding just by asking,

143
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,440
we'd have to redefine hiding.

144
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,943
You want to live in this country,
learn the language.

145
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,322
What do you want
the rest of us to do?

146
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,454
30 people for three openings
and I want you to wash my car?

147
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,581
This is not why
I busted my ass in med school.

148
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,791
We spend a half an hour
cleaning the car. Big deal.

149
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,627
It's demeaning.

150
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,213
Work is demeaning?
We're too good for this?

151
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,423
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

152
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,843
We all went to med school so we wouldn't
have to do an honest day's labor.

153
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,803
What about an honest
hour's labor?

154
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,263
In exchange, we get
a shot at learning

155
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,599
from one of the best
diagnosticians in the world.

156
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,893
No, we don't.

157
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:22,813
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

158
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,398
We're done.

159
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,025
He's just not gonna
cut us loose

160
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,904
until we've dusted his shelves
and starched his shirt.

161
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,201
I'm out of here. Who's with me?

162
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,175
Are we sure he wasn't joking?

163
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,427
Maybe this is just a test.

164
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,764
Everything's a joke and everything's
a test and he wants us to do it.

165
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,890
Come on, get up here.

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,851
Well, I could try,
but I pulled a muscle in 1987.

167
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,396
I didn't waste two years
repeating medical school

168
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,524
- to be arrested and deported.
- Why'd they make you repeat?

169
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,567
Not enough gym credits?

170
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,611
According to
the state of New Jersey,

171
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,532
medical schools in my country
suffer from not being from this country.

172
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,332
You know, if you get it open, you're
gonna have to come down and let me in.

173
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,418
Or, you could just
wait out here.

174
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,296
This is a competition.

175
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,886
Change your mind?

176
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,221
No.

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,182
- Then why are you here?
- Never intended to quit.

178
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,854
- Then why did you...
- Intended to get everyone else to quit.

179
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,107
Get off the car.

180
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,735
I need to clean it.
We need to clean it.

181
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,739
I stole his keys.
We'll take it to a car wash.

182
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,615
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

183
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:01,078
Obviously, respecting personal property
isn't one of the rules.

184
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,924
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

185
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,010
She hasn't been
answering the telephone.

186
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,179
Nice guy.
Two daughters in Mount Holyoke.

187
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:25,853
No evidence of clots, and other than
elevated red blood cell count,

188
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,357
the blood work
was unremarkable.

189
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,904
You got a problem
with the naked female form?

190
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,656
Not at all.

191
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:41,744
Maybe she's just not used to seeing it
spooning with the naked dolphin form.

192
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,538
That's not a dolphin,
it's a porpoise.

193
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,333
There is a difference, you know.
Salary, for one thing...

194
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,251
You want us to
give you a minute?

195
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:57,968
High red blood cell
count likely means...

196
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,345
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

197
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,846
There are a lot of
different explanations

198
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,181
for elevated red blood cells.

199
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,724
Yeah, well, which one fits best

200
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,268
with the damaged flue
that your competitors found

201
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,105
in the gas fireplace
in Osama's cave?

202
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:12,775
Car's clean.

203
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,861
Did you just see a blond guy
with a pretentious accent?

204
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,405
Can't see an accent.

205
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,697
Good point.

206
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,282
Can I have my car keys back?

207
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,746
Give me the car keys,
put the patient in a hyperbaric chamber

208
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,748
and no more
prime numbers for you.

209
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,334
Thank you.

210
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:35,589
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

211
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,634
This much oxygen for too long
can have some toxic effects,

212
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,386
so we'll do this in cycles.

213
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,222
Can I talk to you a second?

214
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,019
You're working that thing all the time.
Ls everything all right?

215
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:51,063
We're supposed to be watching
her heart rate and blood pressure.

216
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,232
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

217
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,110
I'm sending out a consult
on another patient.

218
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,236
Okay.

219
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,864
What? I'm not quitting my old job
until I'm sure I've got a new one.

220
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,907
- I didn't say anything.
- You had a look.

221
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,077
Yeah, I did. Sorry.

222
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,996
Hey, I think
she's having a heart attack.

223
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,832
No, I just feel a little funny.

224
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,585
Tachyarrhythmia.

225
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,504
Call the code!

226
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,050
Nothing.

227
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,552
V-fib. Where the hell is...

228
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,761
- Clear!
- Are you crazy?

229
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,180
You can't use those!
We're in a hyperbaric...

230
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,347
Clear!

231
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,021
She's on fire!

232
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,783
Her heart's beating.

233
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,911
And we are so fired.

234
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,419
We've started her
on nitro and blood thinners.

235
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,088
Electrolytes and post-arrest EKG
were normal.

236
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,216
The attack was not
caused by the procedure.

237
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,134
So, what does cause
synesthesia,

238
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,345
high red blood cell count
and heart attack?

239
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,058
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

240
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,437
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

241
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,147
And you didn't stop him.

242
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:19,652
Means either you thought it was a chance
worth taking, making you a hypocrite,

243
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:23,155
or you thought he'd fail,
making you a cutthroat little pixie.

244
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,450
- What causes...
- Takayasu's syndrome.

245
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,245
Not without a rash and a fever.
It's gotta be Whipple's.

246
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,997
No way. You ever see Whipple's
without abdominal pain?

247
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,457
Stop it!

248
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,877
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

249
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,963
You're both right.
In the sense that you've convinced me

250
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,673
that you're both wrong.

251
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,800
What about cardiomyopathy?

252
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,261
Structural abnormality
causes the heart attack

253
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:49,431
and throws clots to the brain,
leading to synesthesia.

254
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,432
How old are you?

255
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,185
I'm 21, unless it's relevant.

256
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,729
Okay, Scooter.

257
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,524
Do a transesophageal echo.

258
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,028
And since the positive divisors
of 26, are 2 and 13, have them assist.

259
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,364
The rest of you,
go to the cafeteria.

260
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,577
Document 10 things that
can cause infection, each.

261
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,879
I wouldn't.

262
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:26,135
Someone named 17 thinks there could be
lysteria in the cream cheese.

263
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,221
17's a stupid number.

264
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,765
What's Chase doing here?

265
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,267
You saw Chase?

266
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,644
Last night. Outside my office.

267
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,438
That's interesting.

268
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:39,898
It's more curious
than actually...

269
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:44,862
Chase took a job at the Mayo Clinic
in Arizona a week ago.

270
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,533
Interesting.

271
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:55,706
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you saw,
but Chase, the one you fired.

272
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,666
Not interesting.

273
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,170
Someone who looked like someone
I used to know walked by my office.

274
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:06,383
It's always interesting when repressed
guilt starts unrepressing itself.

275
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,220
The only thing I feel
guilty for is this.

276
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,229
We're gonna feed this
endoscope down your esophagus,

277
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:22,149
try to find where your
heart might be damaged.

278
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,944
It's gonna feel uncomfortable,
but just keep swallowing,

279
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,739
I promise you'll be fine.

280
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,492
She's ready.

281
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,163
Go ahead, take a whack.

282
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,708
Right, so if we don't find anything,
House blames me.

283
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,627
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

284
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,087
Why don't you wanna do it?

285
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,924
House isn't gonna be impressed by a
gray hair doing his ten-thousandth echo.

286
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,425
So, you're just
being altruistic?

287
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,303
That makes you suspicious,
Doctor...

288
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,516
Call me 13.
I'm not getting invested.

289
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,062
Her heart's structurally sound.

290
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,524
No clots, no valvular defects,
no wall motion abnormalities.

291
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,359
Got that from
structurally sound.

292
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,319
- What did she say?
- Structurally sound.

293
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,114
I assume you're not all walking with me
to tell me you found nothing...

294
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,658
It showed a short
burst in the...

295
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,245
Okay. Who's next?

296
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,010
It showed a short
burst of atrial flutter.

297
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,748
I ran a rhythm strip twice
and got the same result.

298
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,291
Stop.

299
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,961
Okay, here's how we
diagnose in transit.

300
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,382
I lead, you draft, I move, you move,
I stop, you stop. Got it?

301
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,508
Flutter could mean
hormone overproduction...

302
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,844
Wait a second. Why did you do the test?
I gave it to Scooter.

303
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,090
We didn't think it mattered.

304
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,096
It doesn't.

305
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,056
It matters that you let her.

306
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,979
Okay, 10, 24, 39, run a TRH
stimulation test for hyperthyroidism.

307
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,440
That could cause
another heart attack.

308
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,235
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid,

309
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,071
which is kind
of the point, right?

310
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,366
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

311
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,661
I ride alone.

312
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,914
The hormones
stimulate your thyroid.

313
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,333
Don't worry if you get flushed
or you start to sweat.

314
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,377
It means the thyroid's working.

315
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,422
And, if you want,
I can remove that mole.

316
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,050
I'm a plastic surgeon.
You're allowed a little vanity.

317
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,094
I'm fine with the way I look.

318
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,804
Good for you.

319
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:21,101
Although, I do find it a bit odd
that someone so self-assured

320
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,771
doesn't want her doctors
to find out what's wrong with her.

321
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,981
What are you talking about?
Why else am I here?

322
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,816
You're jerking us around.

323
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,360
You're handcuffing us
with all these restrictions.

324
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:31,945
I'm feeling warm.

325
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,240
Her pulse is 120. Stop pushing.

326
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,926
If House thought
this would handicap us,

327
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:37,826
he wouldn't have taken the case.

328
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,411
Or maybe that's
why he took the case.

329
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,697
He wants to see if
we can get it out of her on our own.

330
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,041
What did you find at her home?

331
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,709
- You were in my home?
- Nothing.

332
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,588
Travel pictures, yearbook,
her name on an employment slip?

333
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,314
We weren't checking
for that stuff, okay?

334
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,008
Obviously, House didn't
want us to.

335
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,803
You're gonna...
You're gonna out me, aren't you?

336
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,137
You're gonna ruin everything.

337
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,932
Nobody's trying to do anything,
just relax.

338
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,478
This is not a normal response
to the test. Pulse and BP are too high.

339
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,688
Get away from me.

340
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,779
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

341
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:25,749
Paging me during Judge <i>Judy,</i>
not the best way to win my affections.

342
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,394
She had another
episode of synesthesia.

343
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,669
It set off a psychotic attack.

344
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,088
And now she ran in there, and must have
jammed something in the handles.

345
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,965
So, you call me?

346
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,676
The guy with one good leg
and zero leverage?

347
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:40,347
We break that door down, security
shows up and her name goes in a file.

348
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,269
Luckily, violence is
not the last resort.

349
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,772
Extortion is.
So, go ahead. Extort her.

350
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,938
If you don't open this door,
we're gonna break it down.

351
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,740
Clever.

352
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,827
An appeal to her deep concern
for hospital property.

353
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,537
Let's see how that works.

354
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,586
If you don't open this door,
you're going to die.

355
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,045
Go away!

356
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,298
Well, you seem
to be getting to her.

357
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,133
She doesn't care if she dies.

358
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,384
You think she wants to die?

359
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,846
No, but I think she only wants to live
under certain circumstances.

360
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,895
Open up, or I blab
your secret to everyone.

361
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,313
You don't know anything.

362
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,106
I do.

363
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,328
No!

364
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,017
Anybody think that
a sedative might...

365
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,790
- I'm trying.
- Okay!

366
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,504
Who's that?

367
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,764
Who is she?

368
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,310
Osama Bin Laden.

369
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,282
Who is she?

370
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,662
Is she okay?

371
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,539
She's stable. Who is she?

372
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,000
What did House tell you?

373
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,754
That she is on the run
from an international crime syndicate.

374
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,172
That's what he told us.

375
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,509
House may be your boss,
but I'm House's boss.

376
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,136
You wanna work here,
I better be okay with it!

377
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,139
Honestly, he didn't tell us anything
about who she was or what she...

378
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,141
Her name's Greta Cooper.

379
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,311
Wants to be an astronaut.

380
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,982
Doesn't want NASA to know her brain's
getting her ears confused with her eyes.

381
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,151
I went through her mail.

382
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:04,241
You're a virus, House. Now instead
of one liability, I've got 20.

383
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,953
Apparently only 19.
Which number was it?

384
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,580
From now on, everything you
do gets charted.

385
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,833
With pen, on paper,
in a binder that says,

386
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,078
"Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital"
on the cover.

387
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,211
Mom!

388
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,463
If you wanna run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

389
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,632
If you do scans, I get a copy.

390
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,261
If you think about doing scans,
I get a copy.

391
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,806
You know my current thoughts, right?
I don't have to put those on paper.

392
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,730
Three issues.

393
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:38,108
One, number 10, you're fired.

394
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,484
She told you?

395
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,570
Well, it had to be someone
who went to her home.

396
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,656
Number 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

397
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,061
Obviously,
he doesn't feel guilt.

398
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,078
Number 2 is here on a visa,
she can't jeopardize.

399
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,077
You can't know.

400
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,289
And that chick's been pointing at you
since I walked in.

401
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,835
Issue two,
what causes synesthesia,

402
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,172
high RBC, tachyarrhythmia
and panic attacks?

403
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,632
Slight glucose elevation.
That says thyroid.

404
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,469
- Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1.
- 1.3.

405
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:06,887
Whatever.
Her thyroid's working.

406
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,013
What about her liver?

407
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,640
Original ALT levels weren't abnormal,
but were near the edge.

408
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,684
- She has patient data on her PDA.
- I do not.

409
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,395
I saw the lab values. You said
we couldn't write anything down.

410
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,813
I also said I wanted answers.

411
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,900
Liver cancer's the most likely.
Paraneoplastic syndrome.

412
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,234
We need to do an MRI.

413
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,599
Which brings us to issue three.

414
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,237
You're saying we
can write stuff down?

415
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,822
To you, I'm saying,
you're fired.

416
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,657
- To everyone else...
- But you said specifically...

417
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,201
I hate tattletales.

418
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,620
- She tattled on 10.
- Now, you've tattled twice.

419
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,372
Issue three...

420
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,041
Come on, let's go.

421
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,629
Issue three, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

422
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,840
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do tests,
she said we have to chart.

423
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,718
If we chart, we won't get consent,
so we can't.

424
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,929
The patient's life may
depend on her consenting.

425
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,973
Her dreams depend on
her not consenting.

426
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,186
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

427
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,106
You've got an hour.

428
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,322
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

429
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,366
And what's Cameron doing here?

430
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,537
Interesting,
so you're seeing Cameron now.

431
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:18,500
No, not interesting,
because not seeing. Saw.

432
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,671
My patient won't consent
to MRis or ultrasounds.

433
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,840
You've dealt with more liver cancer
than anyone else here.

434
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,885
So, you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learnt in Nepal?

435
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,638
Unfortunately, the monks made me
swear a blood oath.

436
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:32,931
Where was she?

437
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,099
In the lobby.

438
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,519
I guess, we could palpate
the area around the liver.

439
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,647
Which won't work unless
the tumor's enormous, which you know,

440
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:43,567
which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

441
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,026
Did...

442
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:48,530
She had blond hair.
Why would I hallucinate that?

443
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,532
Yes! Yes!

444
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,577
Why are you merging
Cameron and Chase?

445
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:57,372
We should find out before the next time
you see her, when she'll be black.

446
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,977
Because, of course, it's scientifically
impossible for a person

447
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,377
to go back and visit
somewhere they worked.

448
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,504
No. But since
she's not a dead cat,

449
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:08,383
it is scientifically impossible for her
to be in two places at once.

450
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,595
Physics joke.
Don't hear enough of those.

451
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,389
She just called
me from Arizona.

452
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,850
Notice the area code, 480.

453
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,561
They put an offer on
a place in Scottsdale.

454
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,063
Do you want to talk or should I?
I guess we could both talk.

455
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,608
Although, they're engaged,
and if you're staying in touch,

456
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,568
you might wanna buy them...

457
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:35,076
Maybe it's not repressed guilt,
maybe it's just panic.

458
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,079
Right now, you've got enough fellows
to build a rail road,

459
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,498
but you're gonna have to
narrow that room full of numbers

460
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:41,541
down to three people.

461
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,670
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

462
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,256
I think you're
gonna choose people

463
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,300
for reasons that have nothing
to do with their skills.

464
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:54,387
I think you're gonna choose people
just because you can't stand them.

465
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,724
Because if you like them,
well, that's just

466
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,352
stressful.

467
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,355
Stress.

468
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:05,815
I like it.

469
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,030
We need to stress
the patient's liver.

470
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,281
You mean make her sick?

471
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,617
I mean, make her
sick in a specific way.

472
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,745
If her liver's given to malfunctioning,
we make it malfunction.

473
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,747
Are we on the other
side of wrong here?

474
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,541
Don't we have an ethics board
that we should consult, or...

475
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,043
I fired you.

476
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,336
No, you didn't.

477
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,421
He fired you, you're number 6.

478
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,799
No, I'm not. I'm number 9.

479
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,426
I approve of
your shamelessness.

480
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,262
You're still fired.

481
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,013
So, how do we stress her liver?

482
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,557
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs, I think...

483
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,563
We could give her intravenous vitamin D
and stick her in a tanning booth.

484
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,231
If she goes into a coma,
we know it's a metabolic problem.

485
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:47,440
Nice.

486
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,859
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

487
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,665
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

488
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,989
We could get her wasted.

489
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,368
Give her shots of tequila and measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

490
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:01,371
If it's too fast, then we know her liver
is not processing alcohol.

491
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,331
Means it's shot.

492
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,376
I like you, number 9.

493
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,051
You wanted to see me?

494
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,386
You a Mormon?

495
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,141
You're wearing
a ring from Brigham Young.

496
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,436
Or did your folks
just do the lawns?

497
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,063
The Church has a very progressive
attitude towards racial equality.

498
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,983
Don't care.
Actually, I'm thanking God.

499
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,194
You're the only
non-drinker we got.

500
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,241
We need a control group

501
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,199
to establish whether the liver's
deterioration is within normal range.

502
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,578
Got a big drinker, a medium drinker,
now I got a no-drinker.

503
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,621
Just do an MRI.

504
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,835
You really think the guy
who created heaven and earth

505
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,421
cares what you put in
your digestive tract?

506
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:54,049
Her dream shouldn't
outrank my religious belief.

507
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,760
Why not?
Her dream might come true.

508
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,556
All life is sacred, right?

509
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:04,768
We're not saving her life.
We're doing a diagnostic test.

510
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,311
Not even a real
diagnostic test.

511
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:10,106
Well, that fake test
might really save her life.

512
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,570
Would you pull an ass out
of a pit on the Sabbath?

513
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:25,663
Would you or would you not pull an ass
out of a pit on the Sabbath?

514
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,170
Fine. I'll do it.

515
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,256
Good.

516
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,430
Why'd you have to pick tequila?

517
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,433
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

518
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,394
Wasn't our choice.

519
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,817
Okay, two minutes,
then round number five.

520
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,570
So, tell me about
the magic underwear.

521
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,366
Is that why you're here?

522
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,202
I'm the big drinker,
doing my part for science.

523
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,705
The interesting question is
why your religious beliefs

524
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,250
are suddenly less important
than her dreams.

525
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,615
You're reversing your argument?

526
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,961
I know what I believe.

527
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,504
I'm just not quite
sure what you believe.

528
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,841
Well, IDS doesn't try
to dictate every detail of our lives.

529
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:21,803
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

530
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,680
But your judgment
was to say no.

531
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,515
You used my judgment.

532
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,142
You made a good argument.

533
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,437
Rational arguments
don't usually work on religious people.

534
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,730
Otherwise, there would
be no religious people.

535
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:33,690
You're an atheist.

536
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,400
Only on Christmas and Easter.

537
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,277
Rest of the time,
it doesn't really matter.

538
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,862
Where's the fun in that?

539
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,613
A finite un-mysterious universe?

540
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:43,658
It's not about fun.
It's about the truth.

541
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,493
The truth is we're having this debate

542
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,829
because you wanna
figure something out about me.

543
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,831
What have you got so far?

544
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,877
Greta! Greta!

545
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,295
She can't breathe.
We need to intubate.

546
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,546
No!

547
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,256
At least oxygen.

548
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,884
NASA will need to know why!

549
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,813
I checked the tests
you ordered.

550
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,481
Did you just see Foreman?

551
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,151
You measured
the density of her teeth.

552
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,029
It's a shortcut
test for hypocalcaemia.

553
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,394
You had to have
just passed him.

554
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,282
So, you suspected hypocalcaemia

555
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,451
from her complete
lack of broken bones?

556
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,162
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens?

557
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,372
Patient might have
been sneaking uppers.

558
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,916
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

559
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,044
Foreman is running the
diagnostic department at New York Mercy.

560
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,345
Have you been drinking?

561
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,408
She was having
trouble breathing.

562
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,452
Refused oxygen and intubation.

563
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:12,121
So you put her on a treadmill?

564
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,040
Records will show
that we gave her oxygen

565
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,293
as a part of
a routine cardio stress test.

566
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,713
She gets to breathe,
your boss gets her paperwork.

567
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,423
Whose idea was that?

568
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:24,968
It was a joint decision.

569
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,595
It never is.

570
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,683
So, how old were you
when your brother left home?

571
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,894
- Why do you think that I...
- Why aren't you answering?

572
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,105
Did your mother
initiate the divorce?

573
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,440
We should probably focus
on what's wrong with her lungs.

574
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,525
Are you Wiccan?

575
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,360
She really can't breathe.

576
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,405
Okay. Hold still.

577
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:49,909
What are you doing?

578
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,995
Auscultatory percussion.

579
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,205
If you have
a good ear, you can...

580
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,085
You didn't have a lot of friends,
because you chose not to...

581
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,087
You can hear
while you're talking?

582
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:07,093
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

583
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,601
Game's over.

584
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:19,022
You either have lung cancer
or tuberous sclerosis.

585
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,442
We need to cut
you open and biopsy.

586
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,819
That'll

587
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,447
leave a scar.

588
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:30,074
NASA doctors will see it.
They'll know.

589
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,621
I never opened for Springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

590
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,874
You can live for years without dreams.
Without lungs...

591
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,459
Find a way.

592
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,796
Okay-

593
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,675
As long as you keep saying it strongly,
you won't die.

594
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,764
Find a way.

595
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,813
How do we force
a patient into surgery?

596
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:05,068
Texas bag scam? Saratoga Wire?

597
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,778
Paris Exposition Trick?

598
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,197
The problem's not the surgery,
it's the scars,

599
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,658
and we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide them.

600
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,869
Not that well. NASA's gonna
check every cranny.

601
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,622
I say we just put ether in her oxygen
and do what we have to do.

602
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:18,790
She'll sue.

603
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:19,832
For what?

604
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,794
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

605
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,671
We don't need to hide them.

606
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,215
We give her elective
cosmetic surgery.

607
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,550
The incisions will give us
access to her lungs.

608
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,220
And she's got an innocent
explanation for the scars.

609
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,055
You mean, like, liposuction.

610
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,225
No, no. Those incisions
are too far from the lungs.

611
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,311
We don't subtract. We add.

612
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,606
Turn her Bs into Cs.

613
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:49,570
It's myth that fake hooters blow up
at high altitude. She'll be fine.

614
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,283
Just think of it as
one giant rack for mankind.

615
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,662
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

616
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:01,124
Trust me, you'll be taken
more seriously. Just sign the form.

617
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,544
This'll make me a joke.

618
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:05,962
There's gotta be another way.

619
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:13,094
I've known a few people
who had dreams.

620
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,557
One thing they all had in common
was they got laughed at

621
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,185
and they didn't care.

622
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:34,157
You bumped a splenectomy
for a boob job?

623
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:35,992
Would you condemn
this woman to a life

624
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,327
where people look at her face
when they talk to her?

625
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,872
If you don't explain this,
I'll cancel the surgery.

626
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,082
Can I explain why you're here?

627
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,876
I think I just
told you why I...

628
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:49,589
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job. Which is ridiculous.

629
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,299
So, obviously you
had to confront me.

630
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,633
With you so far.

631
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,843
But I'm gonna
give you a reason.

632
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,094
Not a good one.

633
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,430
No. Not even close
to a good one.

634
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,184
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

635
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,436
My explanation will make sense.

636
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,689
Not to the board,
not to a judge, but to you.

637
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,900
So you'll let me do it.

638
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:12,820
Then, you're gonna have to sit next
to me at the administrative hearing.

639
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,407
Don't you have
better things to do?

640
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,836
It's in the best
interests of the patient.

641
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,760
Trocar's in, you're good to go.

642
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,393
Deflate the lung.

643
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,230
There, a cyst.

644
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,857
Cysts, I count three of them.

645
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,277
Probably the same, if not more,
on the left lung.

646
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:58,074
Okay, so what's been working overtime
to kill Miss Bin Laden?

647
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,784
We know her name now.

648
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,577
Yeah, but I forgot it.

649
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:05,039
Say the magic word and get immunity
from the next challenge.

650
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,792
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

651
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,710
She'd have had multiple
seizures by now.

652
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,212
Pulmonary Langerhans'.

653
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,339
Doesn't explain
the red blood cells.

654
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,383
Come on!

655
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,594
Cysts, synesthesia, heart attack.
You guys have gotta...

656
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,805
<i>Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

657
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,810
<i>Raises red blood cell count,
causes masses on the organs.</i>

658
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:28,563
<i>If one of the masses
is a pheochromocytoma,</i>

659
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,566
<i>it could cause neurologic episodes
and a heart attack.</i>

660
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,741
Do you see a blonde guy who still has
peach fuzz standing up there?

661
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,160
Yeah.

662
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:47,123
This is a closed procedure.
Gallery's off limits.

663
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:49,000
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

664
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,629
Are you gonna hire
that guy instead of us?

665
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:04,849
Not a chance. I love you guys.

666
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,729
Please dig out the cysts,
histology to confirm Von Hippel-Lindau.

667
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,064
Don't forget her chesticles.

668
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,410
Calling Arizona was
a very nice touch.

669
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,745
You do have residual...

670
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,122
Not only do I not
have residual feelings,

671
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,790
I didn't even have
primary feelings.

672
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,167
- You freaked...
- You lied!

673
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,627
Because you knew it meant...

674
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,003
It meant nothing!

675
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,589
I saw him 'cause he was there.

676
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:39,425
Did Cameron follow her bashert
to the surgery department?

677
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,135
I think Chase followed her.

678
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,660
She's been a senior attending in the ER
the last three weeks.

679
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,474
A blonde senior attending,
to be accurate.

680
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,559
And Foreman,
is he back in neurology?

681
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,646
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

682
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,815
- Did you see Foreman?
- No.

683
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:58,402
<i>Doctor Chang to OR.
Doctor Chang to OR.</i>

684
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,073
So, I'm cured.

685
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:05,034
You're fine for now, but
Von Hippel-Lindau is a genetic disease.

686
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,577
There's no cure.

687
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,539
Greta, you need to
come clean to NASA.

688
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,250
You said you got all the cysts.

689
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:14,794
They could re-emerge.

690
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,380
I'll go to radiology clinics.

691
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,006
I'll get regular screenings.

692
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,425
If something happened
while you're up there,

693
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,677
you'd be playing
Russian Roulette with...

694
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:23,886
Relax.

695
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,807
She doesn't have to tell,
and neither do you.

696
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,977
Turns out the NASA doctors even know

697
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:33,396
where the hyphen
in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

698
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,899
You called them?

699
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,901
I'm not an idiot.

700
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,529
Those shuttles fly over New Jersey.

701
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,335
So, here we are.
The big moment!

702
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,214
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day?

703
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,259
And which of you goes home
and rationalizes being fired

704
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,302
as character building?

705
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,531
The following numbers,
thanks for playing.

706
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:17,481
21, 19, 8, 34,

707
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,400
17,

708
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,861
29, 5,

709
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,822
36, 2.

710
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,409
The rest of you, 8 a.m. sharp.

711
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,203
I'll be in sometime
between 10:00 and 3:00.

712
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,539
Oh, and 26,
stick around a while.

713
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,838
I did nothing wrong.

714
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,590
Lots of people did nothing wrong.

715
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,383
Other people screwed up,
I never even...

716
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,594
Other people took chances.

717
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,846
26?

718
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,286
Buddy Ebsen actually was allergic to...

719
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,687
Yeah, I know. How old are you?

720
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,147
21.

721
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:00,191
You don't think it's relevant.

722
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,693
I'll likely have less time to use
the skills you teach us,

723
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,612
but I don't think
that's significant to you.

724
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:07,490
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school?

725
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,244
Which is why you let
the unlucky number do the trans echo.

726
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:16,290
At least you're
ethically unethical.

727
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:22,588
30 years I worked in the
Columbia med school admissions office.

728
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,509
Audited all the classes,
most of them, more than once.

729
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,678
I just never got a diploma.

730
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,723
You had to know I'd
find out sooner or later.

731
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,519
I know you break rules.

732
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,271
I thought maybe
you'd break one for me.

733
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,734
I can't hire you as a doctor.

734
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,821
But you can still
tell me what you think.

735
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:49,615
You could also fetch me coffee
and pick up my dry cleaning.

736
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,076
Until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

737
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:56,163
So, I'm playing this whole game
to be, like, your secretary?

738
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:59,083
Assistant sounds marginally
less demeaning.

739
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,585
It's not my dream job.

740
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,965
Actually, it is.
It's just not your dream title.

741
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,159
Three weeks.

742
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:36,912
For someone who never misses something
small, you missed something big.

743
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:40,124
You're an idiot.

744
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,210
The hair, where I'm working,
or both?

745
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,546
The hair makes you
look like a hooker.

746
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,756
I like it.

747
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:51,051
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims,

748
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:54,555
and reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels?

749
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:58,100
At least Chase's move
is only one step down.

750
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,603
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

751
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,650
Why'd you rat your
patient out to NASA?

752
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,321
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex,

753
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,072
but I hope they've
already been fired.

754
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,075
- Which number was it?
- Greta.

755
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,536
- Number.
- No number, the patient.

756
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,121
How do you think she got
your pager number?

757
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,040
She came into the ER,
didn't want to talk...

758
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:22,082
I didn't rat her out.

759
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,043
You lied?

760
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,588
I suppose I should tell her
that before she keys my car.

761
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,173
Why lie?

762
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,800
I had to stop some leaky faucets.

763
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,886
What did it matter?

764
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,222
It was no one's business.

765
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:38,641
Right.

766
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,935
She's gonna be
the safest astronaut up there.

767
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,369
Certainly more vigilant than the guy
next to her who's got no clue

768
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,607
about the aneurysm
in his head ready to pop.

769
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,108
Right.

770
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,362
You got a better reason?

771
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,450
You couldn't kill her dream.
