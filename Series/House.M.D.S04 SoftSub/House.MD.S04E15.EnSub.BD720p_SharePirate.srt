1
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,731
You like that?

2
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:25,610
I don't know.

3
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,488
You want me
to use my butt again?

4
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,621
I don't know how I got here.

5
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:44,713
How many drinks did I have?

6
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,006
Your scotch hasn't
even arrived yet.

7
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,634
Means I was drunk
when I got here.

8
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,596
8:50.

9
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,475
I remember being at work.

10
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,645
I've lost at least four hours.

11
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,232
Say five words.

12
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,650
What do you mean?

13
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,736
That's four words.

14
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:12,157
The accepted diagnostic test for global
memory impairment is five random words.

15
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,742
Are you okay?

16
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:19,205
I'm trying to find that out.
Now, give me five animals.

17
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,959
Cat. Bird.

18
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:27,589
Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.

19
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:34,220
Monkey. Rhino...
Either I'm massively drunk...

20
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,101
You're bleeding.

21
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,728
Or it's someone else's blood.

22
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,023
Can you see a wound?

23
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,321
- How bad is it?
- It's all over.

24
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:55,200
I have a concussion.
Retrograde amnesia.

25
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,539
No keys, no phone,
I've been mugged.

26
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,832
No, you haven't.

27
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,959
You already gave me a twenty.

28
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:05,960
Did you earn it?

29
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,462
Not yet.

30
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,347
Someone is going to die.

31
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,265
- Kenny!
- Not you.

32
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,560
I saw something. A symptom.

33
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,022
Someone is going to die
unless I find them.

34
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,565
Who?

35
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,194
I have no idea.

36
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,030
Keep the change.

37
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,046
I saw somebody dying.

38
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,840
You saw 30 people
flying into glass and metal.

39
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,051
I saw a symptom
before the crash.

40
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,969
You're concussed.
You don't know what you saw

41
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,095
and you don't know
when you saw it.

42
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,681
A week ago,
you noticed a symptom in a soap star.

43
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,600
Bad argument,
since I was right about that.

44
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,312
But your brain obviously thinks it
happened last night. Wires are crossed.

45
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:33,358
That's all of it. A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

46
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,776
' Ow! <i>'</i> Hey,

47
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:39,030
hold your head still unless you want me
to sew your nose onto your eye.

48
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,782
Why was I taking a bus?

49
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,367
Because you were drunk.

50
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:46,037
What if I saw someone
and I followed them on from

51
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,580
somewhere in Princeton?

52
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,374
You Okay?

53
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,792
Perfect.

54
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,336
Uh...

55
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:57,173
You.
Get histories from everyone in here.

56
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,508
Did you just forget his name?

57
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,884
No.

58
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,014
Lesbian, find out if anybody on that bus
was taken to other hospitals.

59
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,140
You just forgot mine.

60
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,393
No, Thirteen.

61
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,838
- I just wanted to call you a lesbian.
- I'm not a lesbian.

62
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:15,149
I was rounding up from 50 percent.
Find my cane and motorcycle.

63
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,277
Figure out
where I went last night.

64
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,656
Where's your cane and motorcycle,
and where'd you go last night?

65
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,200
You're gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

66
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,787
You're staying the night. We need
to monitor your brain for swelling.

67
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,247
How much bigger could it get?

68
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,667
You don't think it's

69
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,420
a little weird
that there's both a giant crash

70
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:38,631
and a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

71
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,010
What if it's not a coincidence?

72
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,430
You mean like the hand of God
reaching down and screwing with you?

73
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,808
That, or the symptom
caused the crash.

74
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,814
You see anybody
in a bus driver's uniform?

75
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:06,034
Right here,
purpura on Lalph Klamden's neck.

76
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,285
Indicative of leukemia.

77
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,496
It caused a bleed in the brain,
hence the accident.

78
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,167
Indicative of wearing a seatbelt.
It's just a bruise.

79
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,251
I have leukemia?

80
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,919
No, we just ruled that out.

81
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,464
Pay attention.
So he probably had a seizure.

82
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,217
I didn't have a seizure.
I got hit by a garbage truck.

83
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,802
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

84
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,638
You saw the bus driver exhibiting
the initial stages of a seizure

85
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,516
and didn't bother telling him
to pull over?

86
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,061
Hey!

87
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:36,481
Nobody leaves here
until I say they can be discharged.

88
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,900
- She said I was...
- Is she me?

89
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,777
You have a fever.

90
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,361
No, I'm fine.

91
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,863
98.6.

92
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,239
I need him to stay.

93
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,159
Pulse is normal, BP's normal,
everything's normal.

94
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,328
I just have a stiff neck
from the crash.

95
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,330
Stiff neck.

96
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,457
This man has meningitis.

97
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,292
We need to quarantine
the whole ER.

98
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,421
No one leaves here
until their full work-up is complete.

99
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,515
You left here at 5:23 p.m.

100
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,642
Your motorcycle
never made it home.

101
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:17,855
Well, that covers ten seconds out of
the four hours I can't remember.

102
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,107
Where else did you look?

103
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,942
We did pull up
a list of all the injuries.

104
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,507
Twenty-two victims
were brought here,

105
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,655
injuries ranging from a broken pelvis
to a severed right foot.

106
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,741
The other eight were taken over
to Princeton General.

107
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,787
Be helpful if these came
with head shots and resumes.

108
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:36,958
Twenty-something-year-old Jane Doe,
kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.

109
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,002
Both of which
are expected complications

110
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:43,297
when someone goes from 60 to 0
in no seconds flat.

111
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,134
Weirdest thing we've got
is a ruptured spleen.

112
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,969
Okay, new plan.

113
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,574
We make a list of all the bars
between here and the crash site,

114
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,889
we find out where I went, we go there...

115
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,391
On it.

116
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,229
You're not gonna do anything,
are you?

117
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,064
We're gonna go to the ER
and do our jobs.

118
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,525
Someone is dying
because I can't remember...

119
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,986
When you remember,
you can page us.

120
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,074
The shortest distance
between here and your memory

121
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,703
is straight through your pre-frontal
cortex. All we have to do is access it.

122
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,455
Great idea.
I'll build the giant submarine,

123
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,040
you get
the miniaturization gizmo.

124
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,586
Medical hypnosis can bring the brain
to a Class 2 Theta state,

125
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,754
increasing focus
and memory retrieval.

126
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,132
You're not gonna make me
do the chicken dance, are you?

127
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,885
Someone in the surgical department
must be trained.

128
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,181
Just relax. Keep letting go
of any intrusive thoughts.

129
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,603
So what? You saw an ad
on the back of a comic book?

130
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:41,147
I did a rotation in Melbourne.

131
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,524
Focus on the sound
of your breath.

132
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,651
You're taxing
an already injured brain.

133
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,362
It's like telling him to walk it off
after a broken ankle.

134
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,406
Wilson is done talking now.

135
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,913
Visualize the bus.

136
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,706
The way it looked.

137
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,458
The way it smelled.

138
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,253
The people on it.
What they look like.

139
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,759
This is a waste of

140
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,136
time.

141
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,935
Cool.

142
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,730
Focus on the details.

143
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,815
The bus is empty.

144
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,695
Is this really working?

145
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,825
Just focus. Clear your mind.
Think back to how you felt.

146
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,744
Details you saw.

147
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,708
I can't see out the windows.

148
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,294
And I can see you guys.

149
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,631
Memories further from the incident
should be clearer.

150
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,967
Where were you
before you got on the bus?

151
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,856
Why'd you get so drunk
at 5:00 in the afternoon, alone?

152
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,443
I need a reason?

153
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,779
God, I hate "Beer" brand beer.

154
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,656
When he's hypnotized,
can he lie?

155
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,574
- He...
- I could be mistaken,

156
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,035
but I can't actually lie under hypnosis.

157
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,704
- Is he lying?
- No.

158
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,069
What are you running away from?

159
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,458
When I'm drinking, without you,
what am I running away from?

160
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,670
One of those imponderables.
Can we hold off on your insecurities

161
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,171
until we find this patient?

162
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,674
Do you see anyone in the bar?

163
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:39,181
I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus?
Say something to make me focus.

164
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:43,019
He's concerned about you.
Why does that mean he's insecure?

165
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,105
Get your girlfriend
out of here.

166
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,566
- It's a legit question.
- Amber's there?

167
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,984
You've got Amber in your head?

168
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,485
You put her in my head.

169
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,155
I can't even have a conversation
with you in my subconscious

170
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,531
without her tagging along.

171
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,325
She'd better have
her clothes on.

172
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,909
Unfortunately.

173
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,023
I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

174
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,040
Say what out loud?

175
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,083
I didn't say it out loud?

176
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,044
Nothing.

177
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,962
What's going on in there?

178
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,798
If I can't lie,
I need these two out of here.

179
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,303
Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber
from now on, shall we?

180
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,347
I wish it were that...

181
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,356
That's some program they've
got down there in Melbourne. Cheers.

182
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,859
- I remember the bartender.
- Good.

183
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,653
Now you're accessing
your temporal lobe.

184
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,823
Does the bartender
have any odd symptoms?

185
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,451
No, he seems fine.

186
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,413
Is anybody here sick?
Anyone here taking the bus?

187
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,623
You are.

188
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,543
Because you took my keys.

189
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,589
Good. This is good.
Now we can retrace your steps.

190
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,217
Let's go back to the bus.

191
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,261
- What's in front of you?
- Passengers.

192
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,723
Anything special about them?

193
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:15,111
Some Emo guitar hero wannabe.

194
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,738
You're focusing on him. Why?

195
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,991
Because nose picking
could mean nasal pruritus.

196
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,451
He's dying-

197
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,579
- You a nose picker?
- Do I have to answer...

198
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,039
If the answer was no,
you would have answered.

199
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,040
Tilt your head back.

200
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,291
He's fine.

201
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,793
Doesn't even have meningitis.

202
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,004
Just like everybody else
we've had to give meningitis shots to.

203
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,297
You can go.

204
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:36,757
You have a brain tumor.

205
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,010
You're kidding, right?

206
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,887
If I was kidding,
I'd be dressed like you.

207
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,849
You're fine.
A nurse will sign you out.

208
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:49,103
Go home, have fun, relax.
I'm probably just a nut case.

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,985
Tilt your head back.

210
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,457
Get your things and go.

211
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,461
You need to rest.
I'm admitting you.

212
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,970
I can't gel "P!

213
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,097
I can't move my legs!

214
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,229
Your legs are not
your biggest problem.

215
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:36,692
Your biggest problem is I don't know
what your biggest problem is.

216
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,700
So, we have the who
but not the what.

217
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,702
We've only got
one symptom to go on.

218
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,454
Sudden onset paralysis.

219
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,914
We actually have two symptoms.

220
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,290
Only one that we remember.

221
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,125
You did a full work-up
on the guy.

222
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,669
- Did you find anything?
- CT ruled out subdural hematoma,

223
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,421
stroke,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

224
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,548
Guillain-Barre fits.

225
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,292
Just trying to figure out
what Guillain-Barré looks like.

226
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,804
You can't just
eliminate everything

227
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,890
because it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

228
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,017
How about because it doesn't match
what I could have seen?

229
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:13,354
Guillain-Barré has no external
physical manifestations.

230
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,607
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

231
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,567
And you're obsessive enough
to notice any of them.

232
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,860
Which means there's nothing
we can rule out.

233
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,571
Elevated white count.
Means transverse myelitis...

234
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,448
Sudden paralysis
while driving a bus.

235
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,660
That's the sort of subtle clue
that only a genius would have noticed.

236
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:43,425
Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

237
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,886
Where are you going?

238
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,514
To smell a bus. Obviously.

239
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:56,105
Yeah, I'll start him on antibiotics
in case it's transverse myelitis.

240
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,109
You guys go sniff a city bus.

241
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,740
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

242
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:11,453
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

243
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,581
I need to get back on that bus.

244
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,125
Okay.
So why are you taking so much Vicodin?

245
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,878
If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain
helps focus the memory.

246
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,299
You split your head open.
You should rest.

247
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,219
- Anything?
- Hint of

248
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,307
exploded bus.

249
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,854
House, that's four Vicodin
in forty seconds. At this rate...

250
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,397
Wish me luck.

251
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,401
I'm going in, Rambo style.

252
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,864
House, do you think this is gonna work,
or are you just stoned?

253
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,660
Both, apparently.

254
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,789
You're wrong. It's not working.

255
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,124
So you're saying I'm not here?

256
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,251
If it was a real memory,
you'd be limping

257
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,753
and you wouldn't be talking to me.

258
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,005
I'm obviously a hallucination.

259
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,133
Okay, so I went a little heavy
on the Vicodin.

260
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,720
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise,
means your brain's bleeding.

261
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,057
We're both in my head. You'd think
one of us would have noticed the blood.

262
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,642
Why haven't you
had a head CT yet?

263
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,728
Who do you want me to treat?
Me or you? Did you have a seizure?

264
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,315
Dumb question. The brain's too fried
during a seizure to form memories.

265
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,984
Dumb answer.
I wasn't asking you, I was asking me,

266
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,653
because you've already proven
that you're not here.

267
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,458
- I'm getting a headache.
- Is that a clue?

268
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,240
Again, I'm not here.
You're getting a headache.

269
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:33,911
Stop arguing with a hallucination
and get some treatment.

270
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,412
He can't.

271
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:42,127
The hallucination is your messed-up
brain's way of reasoning out a problem.

272
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,630
You weren't on the bus.

273
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,256
How do you know?

274
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:50,761
Five-hundred-dollar shoes?
Not on the Princeton cross-town.

275
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,721
Must be another reason
why I'm here.

276
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,517
Yes.
What do you have to tell me?

277
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,022
I was talking
to the passengers on the bus.

278
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,192
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an MRI.

279
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,155
<i>Stop fidgeting.</i>

280
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,368
If you haven't found the bleed yet,
it can't be...

281
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,621
There's edema and localized swelling
in the section of the temporal lobe

282
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,498
that controls
short-term memory.

283
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,876
<i>Also, the penis size cortex
is set to "pathetic."</i>

284
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,295
What didn't you say out loud?

285
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:26,547
Very little.

286
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,382
<i>When you were under hypnosis,</i>

287
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,467
you were talking to Amber.

288
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,304
I wanted to see her naked.

289
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,974
Seriously,
what were you hiding?

290
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,350
I want to see her naked.

291
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,769
You want to see everyone naked.
Why would you hide that?

292
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,190
Some guys get upset
when you objectify their girlfriends.

293
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,861
But if you're okay, I got
a digital video camera, so we could...

294
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,654
<i>Why would I be upset
that you're treating my girlfriend</i>

295
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,823
<i>like you treat every other woman
on the planet?</i>

296
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,035
Unless you're not.

297
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,830
<i>Unless it's deeper than that.</i>

298
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,667
You weren't objectifying her.

299
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:10,090
Trust me, I want to do some very nasty,
demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.

300
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,927
You have feelings for her.

301
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,348
This is bad.

302
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,603
It's a longitudinal fracture
of the temporal bone.

303
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,313
I banged my head.

304
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,315
This isn't just a boo-boo.

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,026
I'll rest once I figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

306
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,445
Why? Why this guy?

307
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,572
You want patients with weird,
undiagnosed symptoms?

308
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,658
You get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

309
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,453
And you'd never risk
your life for them.

310
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,499
Why is this guy so special that
all of a sudden you've become Batman?

311
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,709
I don't know.

312
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,505
Maybe it's because you have
a cracked skull and you're not yourself.

313
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,673
Go home, go to sleep.

314
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,507
My legs are holding.

315
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,385
Good. Now put all your weight
on your right leg.

316
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,013
The antibiotics are working.
It's TM.

317
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,223
It's 2:00 in the morning.

318
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,767
You should be home resting
what's left of your bruised brain.

319
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,269
Recovery's too fast.

320
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,115
What, the fact that he's getting better
is evidence that we're wrong?

321
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,274
I need to sit.

322
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,359
Recovery slow
enough for you now?

323
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,528
It's my stomach.

324
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,446
Which means it's
not transverse myelitis.

325
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,532
Rapid onset,
could be a perforated ulcer.

326
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:01,076
Wouldn't explain the paralysis.

327
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,370
Addison's. From a tumor.

328
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,831
It's possible that
I saw his eyelids droop.

329
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,417
We've scanned his head
five times.

330
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,086
You're bleeding.

331
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,546
Little thing called
a bus crash.

332
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,924
Just a scalp laceration. It could
be hidden in his optic chiasm.

333
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,135
It's coming from your ear.

334
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,720
Think that's a good thing?

335
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,848
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

336
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,059
I need to take a bath.

337
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,689
Hallucinations and smells were
kind of working, right? Why the bath?

338
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,860
Hypnosis gave me the nose picker.
Smells set off hallucinations.

339
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:39,656
Sensory deprivation should get the brain
into an alpha-theta phase.

340
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,241
Didn't you see Altered States?

341
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,785
I don't think I was even born
when that movie was out.

342
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:47,122
Then you're too young to be a doctor.
That movie was released in 1980.

343
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
That was 28 years ago.

344
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,875
No it wasn't. Shut up.

345
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,461
Did you just forget
what year it is?

346
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,838
No, I just remembered
how old I am.

347
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,967
I need to give my brain
time to transition

348
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,802
so I can embrace my inner monkey.

349
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,597
Or maybe I don't.
Get me some physostigmine.

350
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,083
It crosses
the blood-brain barrier.

351
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,738
And act like a nerve gas,
stop your heart,

352
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,812
you'll go to heaven and be omniscient.
Good idea. Not gonna happen.

353
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:15,984
Don't do anything. Even if I escape,
eat a goat or get shot by police.

354
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,279
"Wasn't born yet" means I won't
be entertained by further reference.

355
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,166
I didn't know you rode the bus.

356
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:36,546
I used to drive home after getting
drunk, but some mothers got mad-d.

357
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,634
What are you doing here?
You weren't on the bus with me.

358
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:45,347
Then I guess this isn't a memory.
It's a fantasy.

359
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:49,768
If it's a fantasy,
you'd be wearing this.

360
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,982
You're convinced
your patient is dying

361
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,401
and you wanna waste your time
with a sex fantasy?

362
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,403
Don't blame me,
blame my gender.

363
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,889
Well, I'm not here
to indulge that.

364
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,068
I'm here to help you figure out
what symptom you saw.

365
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,825
Your patient was driving the bus,
so all you could see...

366
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,743
Why can't you do both?

367
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:19,589
Your patient was driving the bus, so
all you could see was him sitting down,

368
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,800
most likely facing forward.

369
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:34,646
From behind I saw his earlobes wiggling,
or his head bobbing.

370
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,406
But not that.

371
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,241
Could indicate
aortic insufficiency.

372
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,870
- Marfan's syndrome.
- Or syphilis.

373
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,045
What if his earlobes
were just drooping?

374
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,421
Ehlers-Danlos?

375
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,798
Or Cutis Laxa.

376
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,216
It's not fatal in adults.

377
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,767
Yes, he's an adult,
very good point, keep going.

378
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,608
I'm distracting you.

379
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,234
No!

380
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,154
Dance, woman.

381
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,614
You'd rather be diagnosing.

382
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,574
I screamed no.

383
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,160
And your own subconscious
ignored you.

384
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,371
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

385
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,791
How screwed up is that?

386
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,627
Hey, over here. Remember me?

387
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,463
I'm the sick guy.

388
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,673
Tell me what I saw.

389
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,802
Was it the blood
dripping from my ear?

390
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:53,266
That doesn't make sense
because your shirt wasn't stained.

391
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,103
And because that was me.

392
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,525
I could have had a subtle hemiballismus,

393
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,652
indicating
the early stages of Huntington's.

394
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,279
Huntington's wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain,

395
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,573
and it's only on the table
because we're thinking of Thirteen.

396
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,660
A shuffling gait
could suggest Parkinson's.

397
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,870
Except there's no such thing as
"shuffling sitting."

398
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,374
He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.

399
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:21,128
Who are you?

400
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,881
I'm the answer. Look.

401
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,800
At what?

402
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,301
Here.

403
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,734
You were right.

404
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,533
Help him up.

405
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,160
I got it, it's Parkinson's.

406
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,369
House. Your ear.

407
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,453
Start him on levodopa.

408
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,080
You should sit down.

409
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,748
House!

410
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,140
Get that out of my face.

411
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,767
Welcome back.
I'm Nurse Dickerson.

412
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,102
I don't need your name.

413
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:22,022
And I got your profession
from your super competent technique

414
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,398
of melting my retinas.

415
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:27,277
Verbal faculties seem to be intact.
Do you remember passing out?

416
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,988
I remember puking
on Cuddy's shoes.

417
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,325
Yeah, skull fractures
tend to hurt.

418
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,578
Would hurt a lot less
if you hadn't swiped my pain pills.

419
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,944
Dr. Cuddy's orders.
Wants me to regulate the amount of...

420
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,208
Wait a second.
You brought muscle?

421
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,751
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

422
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:50,550
Means I was wrong.
My patient doesn't have Parkinson's.

423
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,720
Cuddy knows that's the only reason
I wouldn't want to stay here

424
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,640
with my pain pills,
porn and you forever.

425
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,852
Vomiting means
your brain injury is getting worse.

426
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,246
House's skull fracture extends
all the way down to his ear canal.

427
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,192
House is being looked after.
Our other patient has jaundice,

428
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,611
- low albumin and no diagnosis.
- Wilson's Disease.

429
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,416
Thank you.
But Wilson's wouldn't explain...

430
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,369
- Foreman.
- How did you eliminate Parkinson's?

431
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,163
Tests confirm the abdominal pain
was caused by liver failure.

432
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,041
I assume you've already ruled out
hepatitis and Wilson's.

433
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,668
You should really be resting.

434
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,994
Give him five minutes.
Brainstorming a few possibilities

435
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,297
<i>- isn't going to explode his brain.
- And if she's wrong,</i>

436
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,258
that makes this phone call
that much more exciting.

437
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,717
<i>What about hepatic fibrosis?</i>

438
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,177
Can't be,
his Alk phos was normal.

439
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,388
Could be thyrotoxic
periodic paralysis.

440
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,765
Did I mention
this diagnosis needs to make sense?

441
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,226
Why doesn't it make sense?
Bus driver's Asian.

442
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,602
His potassium's slightly low.

443
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,562
If he got paralyzed
while driving the bus,

444
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,523
don't you think I would have gotten off
at the next stop?

445
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:49,651
Not if the next stop
was at a 90-degree angle into an SUV.

446
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,611
The bus would have slowed,
I would've noticed.

447
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:52,612
Phone call's over.

448
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:56,533
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms.
There's no downside to testing.

449
00:26:56,658 --> 00:27:00,870
Genetic test is too slow.
Run the bagel test.

450
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,951
How many more bagels
do I have to eat for this to work?

451
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,962
High carbs plus exercise
is the quickest way to confirm TPP.

452
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,966
I've been on this for half an hour.
I'm not gonna collapse again.

453
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,051
- Up the speed.
- Keep eating.

454
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,764
Yeah.

455
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:22,809
<i>So the carbo-loading marathon
isn't working.</i>

456
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,020
<i>Stop looking
around suspiciously.</i>

457
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,479
To answer your
next two questions,

458
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,858
no, I am not there,
and yes, you are completely predictable.

459
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,318
<i>If the test had worked,
you would have called</i>

460
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:33,361
<i>to put my delicate brain
at</i> ease.

461
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,866
I told you not to lock the door.

462
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,993
Still wiping.

463
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,162
Put the phone up
to bus driver's grill.

464
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,295
Who are you talking to?

465
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,963
My large colon.

466
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,675
TPP's not consistent
with your patient's labored breathing.

467
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,921
Patient has labored breathing

468
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,012
because he's been on a treadmill
for the last thirty minutes.

469
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,348
Did you take my cell phone?

470
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,018
My large colon did.
I'm negotiating its release.

471
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:07,520
<i>Help.</i>

472
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,480
What's happening?

473
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,817
<i>The test worked. He collapsed.</i>

474
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,862
You're half right.
He's wheezing, isn't he?

475
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,073
Yeah.

476
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,743
Can't wheeze without moving
your chest muscles. This isn't TPP.

477
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:22,869
Then what is it?

478
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:25,246
How am I supposed to know?
I'm not there.

479
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,421
Right heart strain.
He's still not oxygenating.

480
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,924
Must be a pulmonary embolism.

481
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,676
So why haven't you
pushed a vial of tPA?

482
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,762
- You let him back in?
- I asked him back in.

483
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:44,057
At the tail end of me patiently
explaining how you idiots were idiots.

484
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,475
Pushed tPA 10 minutes ago.

485
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,434
That means it's not a clot.

486
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,394
Has to be a clot.

487
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,979
If he had a bagel stuck in his windpipe,
I would have seen it on the echo.

488
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,648
Get him to the OR
to suck it out.

489
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,374
Must have just screwed up
the intubation.

490
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,027
Seal's good.

491
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,654
It's a clot, House.

492
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,157
Wait, wait.

493
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,742
Look at his teeth.

494
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,037
He's got shiny new caps.
He's had recent dental surgery.

495
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:10,166
You can tell us what that means
while we're rolling him to the OR.

496
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,923
House! House!

497
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:18,383
House!

498
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,678
Get a syringe.

499
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:25,056
I didn't bring you back here
so you could stage a coup.

500
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:30,854
Listen to me. Dental air drill
pushed an air bubble into his gums.

501
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,690
Dislodged while he's driving.
Caused a myoclonic jerk.

502
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,984
That's what I must have seen.
Then it hit his spine,

503
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,610
his liver, and now his lungs.

504
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,362
Dr. Hadley, open the door.

505
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,822
I'm not plumping
his pillows here,

506
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,408
I'm putting him
in the Trendelenburg position,

507
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,909
move the bubble
to the apex of his heart

508
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,954
so you can suck it out.
Now get the damn syringe.

509
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,372
I can't risk you
stabbing him in the heart

510
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,040
looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.

511
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,125
Stab him.

512
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,627
- Dr. Hadley!
- See? She doesn't even know your name.

513
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,421
Stab his heart!

514
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:57,589
Sats at 75.

515
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,882
- Yes, he's suffocating.
- If you're wrong...

516
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,469
Shut up and make a decision. Keep
standing there, he's dead either way.

517
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,137
Dr. Hadley!

518
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,513
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,182
Open that door.

520
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,030
- Don't shoot!
- Get him to the OR.

521
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,615
The O2 sats.

522
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,952
It was an air bubble.
He's okay.

523
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,586
The other nurse always
used to tuck me in.

524
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,004
I'll be on the couch,

525
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:39,506
with a shotgun in my lap.

526
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,590
Worrying about me.

527
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,593
Making sure you don't try
and make a limp for the border.

528
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,303
Get some sleep.

529
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,165
I'm not sleepy, Mommy.

530
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,756
Me neither.

531
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,512
Who are you?
And why are you stalking me?

532
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,806
Technically,
you're stalking me.

533
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,599
What is that?

534
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,563
A mosquito?

535
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,314
Maybe just a fly.

536
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,109
In the ointment.

537
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,238
So there's something wrong,

538
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,742
there's some detail I'm not noticing
that's spoiling the big picture.

539
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:03,756
Is this significant? Or is this dream
just going in a different direction now?

540
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,717
Guess that depends.

541
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,095
What are you going
to do with that?

542
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,475
I have to tie this around you.

543
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:34,996
I'm cold.

544
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,832
Stay with me.

545
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,129
Why did <i>I</i> say that?

546
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,816
- Hey.
- Go away.

547
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,653
It's not over.

548
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,656
I saved the wrong person.

549
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:20,500
This wasn't just a dream, or a fantasy,
or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland.

550
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,025
So the bus driver with the air bubble
was just a coincidence.

551
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,255
No. I got the causation flipped.
The bubble didn't cause the crash.

552
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,508
The crash caused
the bubble to dislodge.

553
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,927
There was no myoclonic jerk.
I saw something else

554
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,136
in someone else.

555
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,513
You're not leaving.

556
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,932
What's the most dangerous thing
a patient could do

557
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,434
when his brain
is on the brink of herniating?

558
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,898
Elevated heart rate, BP,
which is exactly why you need to stop.

559
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,317
Instead of sleeping, I'm going
to be pacing around this apartment,

560
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,194
trying to decipher
those visions.

561
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,113
Why does this matter so much?

562
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,489
I don't know.

563
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,074
Heart rate?

564
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,785
- 121.
- BP?

565
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:01,416
Contextual memory, I need to get back
on that bus with all 31 passengers

566
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,292
to remember who and what I saw.

567
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:07,171
I'm not gonna call in crash victims
because you've gone insane.

568
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,717
Maybe I don't need
the actual victims.

569
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,594
Who's playing Anne McKeon?
Right here.

570
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,307
Jane Doe ♪2 from Princeton General?
Right here.

571
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,517
You, too, that's right.

572
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,895
Goth Kid,
at the back, on the right.

573
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,690
Yeah, here.

574
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,192
Okay-

575
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,070
You think that staring at pictures
on our shirts

576
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,406
is going to be more effective
than hypnosis?

577
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,866
If you'd stop talking,

578
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,452
the re-enactment could stimulate
activity in my hippocampus

579
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,746
and parahippocampal cortex.

580
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:40,830
How long do we have to sit here

581
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,332
before you are stimulated?

582
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,420
Stop staring at my breasts.

583
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,673
And don't say,
"Or lack thereof."

584
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:55,803
You Okay?

585
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,438
What did you see?

586
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:09,317
Just slipped away.

587
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,779
Is that Vicodin?

588
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,114
No, just a little
memory pick-me-up.

589
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,242
Physostigmine?

590
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,911
Are you crazy?

591
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,455
Alzheimer drugs will
make your brain go into overdrive.

592
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,125
That's the point.
It'll speed up my neuronal firing,

593
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,543
turn up the voltage
on my memory.

594
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:28,920
And blow out your heart.

595
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,213
How many did you take?

596
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:33,424
Just now, or including the ones
I took on the ride over?

597
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,639
<i>House, this isn't worth...</i>

598
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:47,980
House?

599
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,946
Why are you here?

600
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:59,617
You believe in reason above all else.
There must be a reason.

601
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,452
You have something to tell me.

602
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,871
Yes. Who am I?

603
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:07,542
That's asking, not telling.
Who are you?

604
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,669
You know who I am.

605
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:14,423
If I did, I'd be passed out in bed
instead of OD'ing on physostigmine

606
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,551
on the 6th Street cross-town.

607
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,178
What's my necklace made of?

608
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,726
- Resin.
- Who am I?

609
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,311
I don't know.

610
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,773
Why the guessing game?

611
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,234
Because you don't know
the answer.

612
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,695
And if I don't, you don't.

613
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,198
But you know the clues.

614
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,535
I know what's bugging
your subconscious.

615
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,495
What's my necklace made of?

616
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,336
No.

617
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,464
Who am I?

618
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,344
It doesn't make sense.

619
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,097
What's my necklace made of?

620
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:10,646
Amber.

621
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,018
I have to tie this around you.

622
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,693
I'm cold.

623
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,821
Stay with me.

624
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,157
Just stay with me.

625
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,883
Sir, are you all right?

626
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:28,385
Are you all right?

627
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:31,305
Are you injured anywhere?

628
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,109
They'll take care of you
over there.

629
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,829
He's coming out of it.

630
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:37,788
Strong pulse.

631
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,499
You idiot! Your heart stopped!

632
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,210
Amber.

633
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,630
- What?
- Amber.

634
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,301
It was Amber.

635
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,847
She was on the bus.

636
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:59,268
You almost kill yourself, and all
we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.

637
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,020
Have you spoken to her?

638
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:05,232
She's probably working,
she's been on-call.

639
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:09,820
I called her.
She didn't call...

640
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,453
- How could she...
- I don't know.

641
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,874
Jane Doe ♪2.

642
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:30,591
Female, late 20s,
kidney damage.

643
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,093
Does Amber have a birthmark
on her right shoulder blade?

644
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,352
She was on the bus with me.

645
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:47,066
She's the one who's dying.
