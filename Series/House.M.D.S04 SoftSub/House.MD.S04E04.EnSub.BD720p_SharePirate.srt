1
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,755
There were some
nice guys there,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:10,136
but they're all so quiet,
awkward smiles and sweaty palms.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,223
I'm not expecting Brad Pitt
to walk into St. Theresa's,

4
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:18,895
just someone who makes me laugh,
has a nice smile, full head of hair.

5
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:23,316
You know, someone like you,
Mr. Franklin.

6
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,738
It's a shame they're
going to cremate you.

7
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:57,350
Can I help you?

8
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:00,812
Martin!

9
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,736
Martin!

10
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:12,741
My purse is right there.
Go ahead, take whatever you want.

11
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,980
Irene, you call me?

12
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,777
Irene?

13
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,322
Irene!

14
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,036
How are you doing?

15
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,246
I'm fine.

16
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:46,751
FYI, if you ask me,
it's more the guys' fault than yours.

17
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,878
And House isn't
blameless, either.

18
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,672
If he hadn't pitted us all
against each other...

19
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,091
It was my fault. My mistake.

20
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,434
Was that always there?

21
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,604
Hello?

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,606
Sure.

23
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,859
It's House.

24
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,027
<i>Good morning, angels.</i>

25
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,573
<i>As you will see from the file,
we have quite the interesting case.</i>

26
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:19,993
<i>It's not often you get a patient
who sees dead people.</i>

27
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,327
What file?

28
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,872
What the hell?

29
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,540
I gave it to Bosley
a half-hour ago.

30
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,500
It was not a half-hour,
it was 10 minutes.

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,628
And he made copies
of the ER records first.

32
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,090
Less lip, more whip.

33
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,455
I only agreed to take this case

34
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,595
because you said that this mocha
frapalicious would have whip on it.

35
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,597
Fine. I'll refer
the case to Foreman.

36
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,932
Can't. Mercy fired him.

37
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,183
- Gimme.
- He got fired?

38
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:47,520
He disobeyed a superior officer under
fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.

39
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,606
How do you know about it?
You keeping tabs on him?

40
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,441
Girls talk.

41
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,694
When Bosley drags
his ancient ass in there...

42
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,654
I'm here.

43
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:01,784
Twenty-four year old funeral cosmetician
suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

44
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,119
Why does he get to be Bosley?

45
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,124
You want to be Bosley?

46
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,122
Bosley's, like,
the asexual messenger boy.

47
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,084
She had a vision of being raped
by a cadaver before passing out.

48
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,545
Seizure rules out
psychiatric illness.

49
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,256
No history of epilepsy,
head trauma or drug use.

50
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,217
Bosley keeps his job while they replace
five angels over three seasons.

51
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,886
Could be a tumor
to the temporal lobe.

52
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,220
Not with a normal CT scan.

53
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,306
You mean, it appeared normal
to the doc in the ER.

54
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,683
Way to get right back
on that horse, Thirteen.

55
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:26,643
No, that was Amber.

56
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,770
<i>Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch.</i>

57
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,481
<i>That was the worst Thirteen imitation
I've ever heard.</i>

58
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,067
Funeral home prep rooms
are filled with toxic chemicals.

59
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,070
And cadavers. Everybody in that place
obviously died from something.

60
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,572
I have a question.
Is he the one who's not a doctor?

61
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,200
Bullets aren't contagious,
but infections, parasites...

62
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:46,329
You said one of us wasn't a doctor,
and you called him a fraud.

63
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,290
<i>He's not a doctor.
Continue, Bos.</i>

64
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:50,708
Could be an STD.

65
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,126
Why isn't he fired?

66
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,962
You're breaking up.

67
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,505
<i>Going into a tunnel.</i>

68
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,257
Dark Religious Nut.

69
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,509
What did you call me?

70
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:00,468
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

71
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,720
<i>What do you people
want to be called this week?</i>

72
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,763
Cole.

73
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,682
No, I'm never gonna
remember that.

74
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,810
<i>Take Bosley and the other
visible minority to the funeral home.</i>

75
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,562
<i>The rest of you young, white people,
the world is your oyster.</i>

76
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:15,191
<i>Do an MRI with contrast,
EEG, LP and a blood panel.</i>

77
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,944
And, angels, be careful.

78
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,826
Just because he's religious,
doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

79
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,119
- You want to bet?
- No.

80
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,414
I want you to stop being
such a jerk to him.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,460
$100.

82
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,923
Smart call. The guy's a wuss.

83
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,800
He'll be the next one
on the train.

84
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,468
Define "kick your ass."

85
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,178
Any physical confrontation?

86
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,263
Or verbal?

87
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,222
Define verbal.

88
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,891
Anything over 70 decibels.

89
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,144
And you can't start
suddenly being nice to him.

90
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,870
You realize what you're
encouraging here.

91
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,356
Yeah. Someone kicking your ass.

92
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,697
The space inside
is smaller than I thought.

93
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,115
Don't worry, Reena.

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,701
The doctors are gonna
take good care of you, right?

95
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,786
Once the Valium kicks in
you'll feel better.

96
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:12,123
And then we'll have
some nice, warm milk when you're done.

97
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,583
I'd rather have more Valium.

98
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,625
Oh, Reena!

99
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,045
Let's wait just a bit,
see how it goes.

100
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,422
Try to lie as still
as possible.

101
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,553
Guess Father Time's
a lock for one of the spots.

102
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,096
Thirteen's a lock.

103
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,474
He doesn't have a medical license
and he's still around.

104
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,019
She killed a guy
in a wheelchair and his dog.

105
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:36,314
He doesn't care about
our qualifications, our ideas,

106
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,107
he just wants to have fun.

107
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,110
And she's the ultimate fun,
because he can't figure her out.

108
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,695
This game is insane.

109
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,989
So quit. Happy to
lose the competition.

110
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,911
If it's gonna be on your résumé, it's
got to be better to quit than get fired.

111
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,163
Either quit or shut up.

112
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,836
Actually, with House,
getting fired might look better.

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,300
Dr. House
is a dangerous egomaniac.

114
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:08,346
That's why I left. We had
different ideas on how to practice.

115
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,265
Glad to hear it.
Tell me about Mercy.

116
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,393
To be honest, I don't think
Dr. Schaffer really gave me a chance.

117
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,187
Obviously not.
You were there for three weeks.

118
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,064
What happened?

119
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,649
I saved a patient's life.

120
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:23,069
That's usually not
grounds for dismissal.

121
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,403
Have you spoken to her?

122
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,947
Yes.

123
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,532
Then why are you asking me
what happened?

124
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,200
You have an excellent résumé.

125
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:32,203
I felt I owed it to you
to hear what you had to say.

126
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,287
What did she tell you?

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,250
That you defied her instructions
and hospital procedures.

128
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,379
That's what happened,
nothing more I can add to that.

129
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,173
You could tell me
that you were wrong.

130
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,720
Sounds like you didn't
leave House quite soon enough.

131
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,350
<i>Cadavers were clean,
so is her food.</i>

132
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:58,187
<i>It's all organic, unprocessed crap.
It's got to be the embalming fluid.</i>

133
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,439
Ethanol can have
psychoactive effects and...

134
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,401
<i>Bosley, tell whoever's talking
that he's an idiot.</i>

135
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,865
Bosley?

136
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,994
<i>Either tell him he's an idiot,
or tell me why I'm wrong.</i>

137
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,078
You're an idiot.

138
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,289
You actually think
that I'd take a patient

139
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,667
who had a seizure in a funeral home,
if the ER hadn't already ruled out

140
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,586
- embalming fluid?
- I thought we weren't supposed to...

141
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,628
<i>Idiot!</i>

142
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,298
From the old French, idiots,

143
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:28,467
meaning effeminate,
mentally deficient Moor.

144
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,847
I found something
in the mortuary's files from '05.

145
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,601
A 48-year-old male's cause of death
was listed as pneumonia,

146
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,103
but the symptoms
in the autopsy report didn't fit.

147
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,148
<i>Confusion, memory loss,
depression...</i>

148
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,275
Mad cow. Very cool.

149
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,196
No, she's a vegetarian and only
ate organic vegetables, at that.

150
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,531
Tell him he's an idiot again.

151
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,742
The disease can be
spread by brain tissue.

152
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,869
Which is very cool.
Run with it.

153
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,246
So, because the answer
might be cool,

154
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,124
you want us to do a brain biopsy
on a 24-year-old woman?

155
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,376
No, because the answer
is something cool,

156
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:07,298
I want you to do a brain biopsy
on a 48-year-old dead guy.

157
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,050
The guy's already been buried.

158
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:10,092
We dig him up.

159
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,678
I'm not digging up a body
without a court order.

160
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,430
<i>Don't think of it as
digging up a body.</i>

161
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,726
Think of it as keeping
another one from being buried.

162
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,062
I can't do it.

163
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,482
Are we gonna have another one
of those ecumenical discussions

164
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:28,110
<i>where I tell you that your beliefs
are ridiculous and you totally cave?</i>

165
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,196
I just got to be home at 6:00.

166
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,364
The Sabbath.

167
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:35,117
The Lord works for six days,
then tells the union he needs a rest.

168
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:38,079
You know, if I was all-powerful
I think I'd take at least two days.

169
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,413
It's Thursday.

170
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,874
Well, then it must be the kid.

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,506
<i>You have oatmeal on your pants.</i>

172
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,507
Do you have a camera in here?

173
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,175
<i>Nope, I was guessing.</i>

174
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,761
<i>He had oatmeal on his pants yesterday
and the day before.</i>

175
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,973
<i>Have one of your wives
look after the spawn.</i>

176
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,225
I'm a single dad.

177
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,314
Where's the single mom?

178
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,402
I have no idea.

179
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,695
<i>Interesting.</i>

180
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,072
You claim a lapse of judgment,

181
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,117
or are you gonna admit that
a lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?

182
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,077
He's gone.

183
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,370
<i>Fair enough.</i>

184
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,330
Family comes first.

185
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:33,718
Dr. Cuddy? I'm Amber Volakis,
one of Dr. House's new fellows.

186
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,012
Sexual harassment claims
go through HR,

187
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,014
stress-related leaves
through workers comp,

188
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,224
and any accusations
of criminal activities

189
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,436
go directly to the
Princeton-Plainsboro police department.

190
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:48,107
Actually, I was wondering if you needed
any extra help in the clinic tonight.

191
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,088
You're not gonna score any points
with House by kissing my ass.

192
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,031
Understood, but I hear
Dr. House hates clinic duty.

193
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,490
If he were to hear through the grapevine

194
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,534
that I was willing to work overtime,
take some of it off his hands...

195
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,579
My advice to you is to do
whatever House wants you to do tonight.

196
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,305
And then tomorrow night
you can come back

197
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,333
and I will give you
extra clinic duty.

198
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,544
Does everybody around here
have trust issues?

199
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,839
I don't know what House wants you to do
and I don't want to know.

200
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,008
But if you really have
a problem with it, quit now.

201
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,302
It's only gonna get worse.

202
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,480
All right. Who's up?

203
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,773
Not me.

204
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,232
You haven't done
any digging yet.

205
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,192
I'm a surgeon.

206
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,319
If anything happens to these hands,
I'm screwed.

207
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,320
Let Bosley do it.

208
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,965
As long as he can keep
folding laundry,

209
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,448
his career...

210
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,034
Someone's coming.

211
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,988
Hey, shouldn't we be running?

212
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,039
If it's a cop, run.

213
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,917
Security guard,
I say we take him down.

214
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,469
Sorry I'm late.

215
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,512
Where the hell have you been?

216
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,513
I got lost.

217
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,723
We've been here
over three hours.

218
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,725
Really lost.

219
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,852
I brought coffee and donuts.

220
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,609
So, Thirteen,
you grow up around here?

221
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,946
We're digging up a grave
and you want to chit-chat?

222
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,616
I'm just making conversation.
It's what people do.

223
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,576
Why are you hiding everything?

224
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,497
And I'm asking you that question
because you're hiding everything.

225
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,458
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

226
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,210
I'm worried.

227
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,628
No, you're not.

228
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:36,090
Fine, but I am freaked,
because I don't think you're a freak.

229
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,466
I think you're doing this on purpose

230
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,301
because you know
House will be intrigued.

231
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,722
Yeah, I grew up around here.

232
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,939
Honey, I'm home.

233
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,358
Get the crowbar.

234
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,111
No, there's not enough room
to maneuver a crowbar down here.

235
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,448
Oh, God help us.

236
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,328
What the hell?

237
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,455
What is it?

238
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,041
Ankles. They buried the guy
the wrong way around.

239
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,176
The doctors' lounge
is covered in mud.

240
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,887
Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch
had a disagreement.

241
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,181
Cafeteria was out of Jell-O.

242
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,599
There were pickaxes.

243
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:30,186
Either you had them dig up a body,
or you're building a rail road.

244
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:33,022
A little, tiny piece of his brain.
Seemed a waste.

245
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,228
He wasn't using it anymore.

246
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,232
That's your defense?

247
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,318
"We just dismembered him."

248
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,987
They're looking for
Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

249
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,365
You get the results yet?

250
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:46,410
Does my breath smell
bated to you?

251
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,830
Yes. Let me know
when you hear anything.

252
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,374
And get that mess in
the shower area cleaned up.

253
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,210
I know just the guy.

254
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,754
How many of them
agreed to dig up a grave?

255
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,216
Six. But don't worry, the one
who didn't, didn't stand on principle.

256
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,843
He just had a diaper to change.

257
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,430
I really think there are
no bad choices in this group.

258
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:23,447
You guys don't wipe your feet
when you come in the house?

259
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,115
Doctors' lounge, let's go.

260
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,492
Why me?

261
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,744
Well, I can't ask the black guy
or one of the chicks to do it.

262
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,246
That would be insensitive.

263
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,997
And you can't ask Bosley

264
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,794
because that'd look like you only hired
the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

265
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,171
You keep stalling,
you're still gonna clean up,

266
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,757
but I won't let you
have the mop.

267
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,972
Sample came back negative
for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

268
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,353
Well, that discussion
didn't last long.

269
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,272
I just don't know
what else there is.

270
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,358
We had an idea, it was wrong.

271
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,193
Well, we could go home.

272
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,320
I mean, we have no idea
what's wrong with her,

273
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,114
which means it could be
completely benign.

274
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,576
Or, on the off chance
that it's killing her,

275
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,995
we could take it again from the top.

276
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,583
You've already done everything.

277
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,709
We may have missed something.

278
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,378
I just want to go home.
I'm sure I'm fine now.

279
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,381
Reena, the doctors know best.

280
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,799
You had some
serious symptoms...

281
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,719
If I have another one,
I'll come right back. Okay?

282
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,345
If you have it
while you're driving...

283
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,764
You can drive me,
make sure I take it easy.

284
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,268
Who can?

285
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,729
My mother.

286
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:40,983
Your mother's here?

287
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,194
What are you talking about?
She's right there.

288
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,751
<i>You sampled every bodily fluid,</i>

289
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:04,340
<i>peeked in her brain, violated
a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body,</i>

290
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,759
but missed the fact

291
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,471
that she was still seeing
things that weren't there.

292
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,891
Neurological symptoms
are getting worse.

293
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,811
It'd be nice if one of you
angels/morons had a clue why.

294
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,146
We did a full history.

295
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,316
She never mentioned seeing
or hearing anything unusual.

296
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,194
Well, as long as she never
said anything, how were you to know?

297
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,719
Same thing with the spinal fluid?
She tell you that was fine?

298
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,490
The labs were all clear.

299
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,034
Then either we're about
to meet the Alpha and Omega,

300
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,037
or you missed something.

301
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,455
We missed the new symptom.

302
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,832
It's not a new symptom.
We always knew she had hallucinations.

303
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,210
Seeing your dead mother's
a hallucination.

304
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,046
Not knowing she's dead
is a delusion.

305
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,299
You keep this up, you're gonna have
to start wearing sexier clothes.

306
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:52,137
Carbon monoxide could also cause
delusions. A lot of haunted houses...

307
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,348
There's no headache,
no tachycardia.

308
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,433
I guess they didn't cover that
at your medical school.

309
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,186
What about a hereditary connection?
I mean, she's 24.

310
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,604
Her mother died
when she was 25.

311
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,857
In Ukraine, 20 years ago.
Good luck trying to get those records.

312
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,359
So we start new records.

313
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,028
Test for every hereditary disease
that fits the symptoms.

314
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,447
There are at least 40 different
mitochondrial disorders,

315
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,407
another couple hundred...

316
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:16,286
Start with amyloidosis and you
keep going until you reach zamyloidosis.

317
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,460
Now what are you testing for?

318
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,171
Or should I ask
what you are not testing for?

319
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,464
Well, we could narrow it down

320
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,091
if you could remember
what your mother died from.

321
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,386
My mother is not dead.
She's sitting right there.

322
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,222
Do you think
we're lying to you?

323
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,890
Leave it alone.

324
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,106
Convincing her that her mother's dead
isn't gonna make her better,

325
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,066
just miserable.

326
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,068
You lose your mother?

327
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,826
Do you think we're trying to trick you?
Why would we do that?

328
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:59,163
Because you're mean,
and you're not good at your job.

329
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,749
Reena, stop.
You're being cruel.

330
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,459
They're wasting time,

331
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,754
doing exactly what the guy
in the wheelchair said they'd do.

332
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,038
A guy in a wheelchair was here?

333
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,551
You know who I'm talking about.

334
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,137
He's been hanging around
ever since they brought me in,

335
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,265
complaining about
how incompetent everyone is.

336
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,018
He said you killed his dog.

337
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:29,816
It doesn't make any sense.

338
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,861
I'm not interested.

339
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,071
If you weren't interested,
you wouldn't be here.

340
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,907
I thought it was social.

341
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,032
No, you didn't.
You always think there's an agenda.

342
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,285
That's why I left.

343
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,205
That's why you're good.

344
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,290
- You need a job.
- I'll find a job.

345
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,876
- I need someone that understands House.
- They'll learn.

346
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,836
I need someone that can control House.

347
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,174
Keep looking.
It might take a while.

348
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,221
I'll cut the salary
of everyone else on the team 15%,

349
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,639
give it to you.

350
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,600
That's more than you'll
get anywhere else.

351
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,519
What does House say about this?

352
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,022
You're the one person
on the team that he always respected.

353
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,193
This restaurant is 20 minutes out of
your way, half an hour out of mine.

354
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,613
You picked it to make sure
House didn't drop in on us.

355
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,532
It's my decision, not his.

356
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:20,244
You tell him that, then run back to your
office while I get to deal with him.

357
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,870
I left for a reason.

358
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,164
That reason hasn't changed.

359
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,758
So,

360
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,677
what's the news?

361
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,762
Everything's negative so far.

362
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,765
Yes. Why wait to finish
before reporting to me?

363
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,141
I have things to do, you know.

364
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,518
She's seeing someone else.

365
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,313
That's not news, that's olds.

366
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,358
Damn it. Why did God design
the human body this way?

367
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,609
A guy in a wheelchair.

368
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,404
In a hospital? That's enough
to give you the heebie-jeebies.

369
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:00,284
He had a dog.
She's seeing Stark, our last patient.

370
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,079
Well, if it's Stark,
he wouldn't be haunting a patient,

371
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,833
he'd be haunting the doctor
who killed him.

372
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,002
She probably just overheard
someone talking about it, or...

373
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,128
Probably?

374
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,922
You think there's a possibility
that the alternative is true?

375
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,507
- No.
- Then go away.

376
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,802
We're wasting time. We ran 32 gels,
we could run 100 more.

377
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,137
Without knowing how
her mother died...

378
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,014
You're gonna have
to run 100 more.

379
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:22,973
By you, of course,

380
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,225
I'm only referring to the people
who care enough about human life

381
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,144
to put in a full day.

382
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,729
You want to carpool?

383
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,565
How do you expect me
to respond to this stuff?

384
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,609
Exactly like you just did.

385
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,194
I have a theory.
Maybe you can help me out.

386
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,782
Black Mormon means masochist,
means kinky.

387
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,329
I'm thinking that someone got hurt
making the bastard. Am I right?

388
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,575
You leave my son out of this.

389
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,833
I wasn't referring to your kid's
hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.

390
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,669
Why don't we just ask her
how she died?

391
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,547
Because she won't tell us.
She thinks her mother's still alive.

392
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,134
I don't mean ask the patient.
I mean, ask her mother.

393
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,763
Cool.

394
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,933
Come on.

395
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,813
What the hell does that mean?

396
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,732
You guys talking
your own language now?

397
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:17,569
I'm sorry. I'll try to include
some visual aids next time.

398
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,910
Now, what?

399
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,873
I'm Dr. House.
Ls your mom around?

400
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,167
Why should I tell you?

401
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,586
You're just gonna tell me
I'm lying or crazy.

402
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,423
I'm not gonna do that. I really
need to know what she has to say.

403
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,716
What do you want?

404
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,081
When you were young, was she...

405
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,428
No, not you. Him.

406
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,139
The man in the wheelchair?

407
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,308
No. He's old.

408
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,816
Actually, looks like you.

409
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,286
Yeah, that's Grandpa House.

410
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,163
Tell him to call back
on a landline.

411
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,374
Terrible reception in here.

412
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,001
How much pain was your mom in?

413
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,127
It's Walter.

414
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,962
He says his name is Walter.

415
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:44,489
Can I help you?

416
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,117
My patient's talking to
my Grandpa Walt.

417
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,411
You have a Grandpa Walt?

418
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,787
Nope.

419
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,080
Which is what made me suspect

420
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,541
that maybe she's not actually seeing
into the afterlife.

421
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,710
What is this sudden obsession
with the afterlife?

422
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,047
My only obsession is with the idiots
in the right-here-and-now life

423
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,465
who think there's an afterlife.

424
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,925
- And you want me to...
- Nothing.

425
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:08,430
Just needed a place to hang low for
a while. I'm pretending to be spooked.

426
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,389
Because?

427
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:13,602
Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead
patient thinks that I believe her,

428
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,980
maybe she'll let me chat
with her mother's ghost.

429
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,024
The one you don't
believe exists.

430
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,108
Exactly.

431
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,028
The ghost is a hallucination,
which is the result of a delusion,

432
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,822
which most likely is the result
of a hereditary disease

433
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,075
that her mother died from
when the patient was four.

434
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,244
And you think you can
tap into her subconscious memory

435
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,288
by tapping into
her hallucination.

436
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,998
Mmm-hmm.

437
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,084
She might not know
what caused her mother's death,

438
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,628
but she will know
how she acted before she died.

439
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,073
You're quite impressed with yourself
right now, aren't you?

440
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,758
Who wouldn't be?

441
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,136
Well, that should
be long enough.

442
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,681
Back in a flash.

443
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,934
Take your time.

444
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,817
Is my grandfather still here?

445
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:02,776
No.

446
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,736
He should be right back.

447
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,114
He just went
to get some warm milk.

448
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,366
But your mom's still
here, right?

449
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,453
Yes, of course.

450
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,836
I know she's fine, now, but when
you were four or five, she got sick.

451
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:21,795
No.

452
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,339
You sure?
She wasn't in any pain?

453
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,258
I wasn't in pain.

454
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,801
No, she was just tired.

455
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,011
And sometimes
she would stay in bed all day.

456
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,138
Did she ever fall down?

457
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,305
Of course.

458
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,850
Everyone falls down
once in a while.

459
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,852
Sometimes, not that often.

460
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,186
How often?

461
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,983
Maybe it was actually
more than once in a while.

462
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,611
Remember that time
in the bathroom?

463
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:47,904
Mmm.

464
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,739
A few times.

465
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,242
Once she hit her head
on the bathroom sink.

466
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,744
There was blood all over the floor.

467
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,122
I got it on my sweater. I...

468
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,753
They took her away.

469
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,089
Yeah, to the place
where the doctor made her better.

470
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,675
But before that,
what about her arms and legs?

471
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,053
Did she ever walk funny,
like, sort of bent over?

472
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,433
I thought that was from
growing up on the farm!

473
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,018
What about her hands?

474
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:21,313
Did she ever have any difficulty
sewing, buttoning a shirt?

475
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,439
No.

476
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:28,320
But sometimes
my hands would shiver.

477
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,991
Like I was cold, but I wasn't.
I never quite understood.

478
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,620
She used to get the shivers.
Like she was cold.

479
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:54,346
Start her on L-dopa
and bromocriptine.

480
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,264
It's just Parkinson's.

481
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,362
Cole, how's it going
with your patient?

482
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,114
Still seeing stuff.

483
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,659
I hear House is
treating you like crap.

484
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,910
He treats everyone badly.

485
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,787
Yeah, but I heard
you're special.

486
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,164
Well, I can handle it.

487
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,293
Maybe you shouldn't. He's gonna
walk all over you if you let him.

488
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,671
That says nothing
about me, just him.

489
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,507
House respects people
who aren't afraid of him.

490
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:34,094
Get in his face.
Yell, if you have to.

491
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,972
I don't need his respect.

492
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,224
You do if you want the job.

493
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,311
Thanks for the advice.

494
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,068
You have to hold still.

495
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,736
I'm trying!

496
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,240
- Damn! Hold her down!
- No!

497
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,701
- Stop it!
- Let me do it.

498
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,036
No, no.

499
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,707
Hold her down!

500
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,418
No! No!

501
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,550
No!

502
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,055
Irene?

503
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,433
Irene?

504
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,020
You stabbed me.

505
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,273
You were having a nightmare.
It wasn't real.

506
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,108
My arm is bleeding.

507
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,944
No. It's okay now,
your arm's not...

508
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,244
Lesions aren't explained
by Parkinson's.

509
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,204
Any theories?

510
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,294
What, ghost got your tongue?

511
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,171
I'm fine.

512
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,505
What about vasculitis?

513
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,549
MRI didn't indicate
any cerebral ischemia.

514
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,385
But she has shown some focal weakness,
urinary retention.

515
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,071
Yes. Those are her big
mystery symptoms,

516
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,473
not the hallucinations
that vasculitis doesn't explain.

517
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,725
Unless it's retinal vasculitis.

518
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:09,314
House, this guy may be smart, and I'm
sure he's great to share a beer with,

519
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,400
but if he doesn't know that
visual symptoms are an electrical issue,

520
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,486
not vascular,
two separate systems...

521
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,446
So are the banks and the power grid,

522
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,241
but if I don't pay my bills
my lights go out.

523
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:30,335
Vasculitis restricts blood flow to
nerves, messes with electrical function.

524
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,545
Acute intermittent porphyria
is a better fit.

525
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,673
If you're wrong about porphyria,
the treatment could box her kidneys.

526
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,428
Vasculitis is treated with
corticosteroids, relatively harmless.

527
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,180
- Start her on the steroids.
- House, he's not...

528
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:45,475
Then test for both
so he can stop whining.

529
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,814
Big Love, have I humiliated you
in the last half-hour?

530
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:51,773
No.

531
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,525
Check your e-mail.

532
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,866
How's it going?

533
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,368
Great.

534
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,996
The only way he can turn any more cheeks
is by pulling down his pants.

535
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,624
He's not a wuss.
It takes a lot more strength...

536
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,751
We didn't bet on
how strong he was.

537
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:15,213
So, you're gonna collect $100
and fire him because he has principles?

538
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:18,550
What's your agenda here?
You obviously don't care about the 100.

539
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,218
He's a decent, smart...

540
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,543
You don't care about the team.

541
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,930
Does it annoy Wilson when you
ask questions and ignore the answers?

542
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,390
Very much.

543
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:29,185
You only care about
who I hire and who I fire

544
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,896
because you miss
going through my mail.

545
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,190
You can't stop controlling me.

546
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,817
No one controls you.

547
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,569
- Want your job back?
- No.

548
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,572
Too bad, you can't have it.
She'll take care of this.

549
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,159
You can take it out of the 100
you're gonna owe me.

550
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,872
I met House at a conference
about five years ago.

551
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,915
- He's quite a character.
- Yes, he is.

552
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,710
Probably one of the best medical minds
of our generation.

553
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,212
I agree. I learned
an awful lot from him.

554
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:59,549
I'll bet you did. I see here
you just did a stint at Mercy.

555
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:00,842
Great.

556
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:04,429
It says here "'07 to Present."
How long were you there?

557
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:08,725
About a month. Dr. Schaffer was great,
but it just wasn't the right fit.

558
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,853
Wait, was that you with Dr. Schaffer
and the lymphoma patient?

559
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:15,773
It was... It was a tough situation.
I probably could've handled it better.

560
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:20,361
No, Dr. Schaffer's
got a stick up her rear, good for you.

561
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,030
What made you so sure
it was lymphoma?

562
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,991
There was an unusual lactic acid level
in one of her labs.

563
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,743
I had a similar case
a few months ago.

564
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,787
Beautiful.
God, I wish I had your stones.

565
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,790
Well, my stones
are on the market.

566
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,919
No, I mean, seriously,
I wish I had your stones.

567
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,963
I could cram you down
the board of directors.

568
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,468
But I don't. I'm sorry, man.

569
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:45,887
Good luck.

570
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,212
When your retinas
see something,

571
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,518
they send electrical signals
to your brain.

572
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,728
These lenses will pick
up those signals.

573
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,897
If the signals are misfiring,
it'll confirm

574
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,775
that an old man without a medical
license is smarter than all of us,

575
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,360
that your hallucinations
were caused by...

576
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,321
They're not hallucinations.
Tell them, Mom.

577
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,615
Honey, they're doctors.

578
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,575
They must know
what they're doing.

579
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,121
If they know what they're doing,
how did they kill that poor man's dog?

580
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,795
Come on, this has got to be
freaking you out a little bit.

581
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,547
I appreciate your concern.

582
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,298
There's nothing to
be ashamed of here.

583
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,300
If the ghost of a man you killed
doesn't screw with your head,

584
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,844
there's something wrong
with your head.

585
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,812
See, that freaks me out.

586
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,108
Someone must have
left it in here.

587
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,609
Absolutely, that makes sense,

588
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,944
some dog was in here
getting his eyes checked

589
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,362
and forgot to put
his jewelry back on.

590
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,697
This isn't working.

591
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,032
You're just making me sicker,
like he said you...

592
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,201
What's wrong?

593
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,495
My stomach, it hurts.

594
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,251
- Code in the eye lab.
- Lean forward, Irene.

595
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:01,796
- You're gonna aspirate.
- I can't. It hurts.

596
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,173
Why won't you help me?

597
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,725
Spleen's ripe to bursting.
You guys thought it was vasculitis?

598
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:16,936
You used to be on
House's team, right?

599
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,814
Yeah. Got a lot of
blood in here. Sponge.

600
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,359
You got any advice for me?

601
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,319
Nope.

602
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,154
You always put up
with his crap?

603
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,322
Yeah.

604
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,408
Was it a mistake?

605
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:31,618
It was irrelevant.

606
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,910
Well, he fired you.

607
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,872
He'll fire you either way.
Eventually.

608
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,167
- Dr. Cameron told me about...
- Don't want to know.

609
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:42,670
- Why not?
- Because House is watching.

610
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,798
Not a metaphor. Look up.

611
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,304
<i>You guys gonna
shoot the breeze,</i>

612
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,807
<i>or you gonna do something
about all that bleeding?</i>

613
00:32:56,225 --> 00:33:00,104
That's not coming from the spleen.
It's the liver.

614
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,064
It's necrotic.

615
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,066
She's dying
from the inside out.

616
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,159
Enlarged spleen and
liver failure are classic AIP.

617
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,684
It's porphyria
and it's moving fast.

618
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,996
PBGs were negative.
If you read the reports...

619
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:20,166
PBG tests are only conclusive
if done during an attack,

620
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,377
which you would know
if you were a real doctor.

621
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,128
That is just great.

622
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:25,672
- What is?
- Which one of us is?

623
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,091
Both of you. Together.

624
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,010
Fighting. Passionate to
prove the other one wrong.

625
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,180
Couldn't care less about the patient,
but it all works out the same.

626
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,515
I hate Thirteen.

627
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,934
Not as productively. Continue.

628
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,061
It could still be vascular.

629
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,021
Vasculitis is off the board.

630
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,523
Steroid treatment didn't help.

631
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,441
Vascular isn't just vasculitis.

632
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,820
Something's got to be cutting off the
blood supply to her liver and spleen.

633
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,406
Do a visceral angiogram.

634
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,157
This is a joke, right?

635
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,742
He can't be right
every single time.

636
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,578
You're feeding him your ideas
just to embarrass us.

637
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:01,874
If I wanted to embarrass you,
I'd have you mop up the doctors' lounge.

638
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:40,204
Heavenly Father, I pray thee
that thou shalt give the Holy Ghost

639
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,916
unto all them
that shall believe in their words.

640
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,545
Irene, what are you doing?

641
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,963
I need to touch it.

642
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:49,922
Put your hand down.

643
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,425
No! Give it to me! I want it!

644
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,178
Give it to me! No!

645
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,647
What the angio say?

646
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,191
We couldn't finish.
She started groping me.

647
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:11,077
And you couldn't let her get to
second base just to get the test done?

648
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,570
I think that's third base.

649
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,490
She was convulsing, delirious
and hyper-salivating.

650
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:18,326
We had to knock her out
with lorazepam.

651
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,328
Well, that's definitely
not vascular.

652
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,747
What do you want us to do?

653
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,000
The question is,
what would Joseph Smith do?

654
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,084
This isn't the time for anti...

655
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,211
Casting out the demons?

656
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:31,172
The patient's not possessed.
She's dying. You can mock me tomorrow.

657
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,801
You believe that the book
has all the answers.

658
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,470
To morality, not science.

659
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,235
But the book is
inconsistent with science.

660
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,225
You know how many epileptics were
tortured because they were possessed?

661
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,310
How many teenage witches
were stoned to death,

662
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:45,394
because they took mushrooms?

663
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,730
Just shut up already.
We got a patient dying.

664
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:50,066
You either got to prescribe an exorcism,

665
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,027
or admit to me
that Smith was a horny fraud.

666
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,874
I know what she has.

667
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,669
You couldn't have spoken up
10 seconds ago?

668
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,295
You would have saved me 100 bucks.

669
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,798
Mushrooms weren't the only thing
that got people stoned to death,

670
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:17,468
jimsonweed, belladonna,
mandrake root and moldy bread.

671
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,719
It's ergot poisoning.

672
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:19,846
You'd need damp grain that's...

673
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,973
Completely unprocessed
and untreated,

674
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:25,810
like what's in that organic rye bread
she's been eating.

675
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,271
- Should I be going home?
- Is it 6:00?

676
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,314
It's why she got worse
on the bromocriptine.

677
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,439
It's an ergot derivative.

678
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,150
There hasn't been
a case in 50 years.

679
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,570
She kept asking for milk.
Dairy products counteract the effects.

680
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,405
You think she knew what she had
and was treating it?

681
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,447
Cravings based on actual needs,

682
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,658
it's a fairly common
evolutionary development.

683
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,997
You okay with an answer
based on evolution?

684
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,456
Yeah.

685
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,667
Hypocrite.

686
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:55,673
It's the stuff they make LSD from.
The treatment you're on should...

687
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,593
So, I've just been tripping?

688
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:02,471
It explains the hallucinations,
seizures, delusions...

689
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:06,601
Constricts the blood vessels,
which explains the necrosis.

690
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,319
She's not here?

691
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,576
I'm sorry, no.

692
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:28,915
The fact that you're even willing
to accept that answer

693
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,126
means the medicine
is starting to work.

694
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,925
But you'll live.

695
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,430
You're beautiful, Reena.

696
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:47,683
You too, Mama.

697
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,926
I'm going to miss you.

698
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,848
Mama.

699
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:05,636
As you know,
there are seven of you and...

700
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,763
One, two, three, four...

701
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,306
Only six roses.

702
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,183
Those are peonies.

703
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,521
But I'm sure they're
part of the rose family.

704
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:20,109
Actually, I'm surprised
there are seven of you.

705
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:23,070
You punch your boss
and stick around?

706
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,617
Give me the flower and shut up.

707
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,036
Don't overdo it.

708
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:35,416
Now, I would love to keep all of you,
but not enough to do anything about it.

709
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:40,504
So, according to my arbitrary schedule,
one of you has to go.

710
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,858
You're kidding!

711
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:07,239
I came up with the answer.
I robbed a grave. I...

712
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,659
Planted a dog collar in the procedure
room just to screw with my head.

713
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,536
No, I never.

714
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,540
What, you don't
believe she did it?

715
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,375
I'm sure she did it.

716
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,755
That's why she's getting the flower.
It was beautiful, she just overreached.

717
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,381
- She got into your head.
- No, I...

718
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,300
She owned you.

719
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,135
Planting the idea was good.

720
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,806
Letting it fester was good.
Leaving the collar was stupid.

721
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:35,518
Well-known fact,
ghosts don't leave things lying around.

722
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,770
So, am I gone then?

723
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,913
Oh, my goodness. I totally forgot
about you two. Well played.

724
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,722
Sorry, Henry.

725
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,768
We had some giggles.

726
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,856
You agreed with everything he said.
You finished each other's sentences.

727
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,941
That's why I got to go.

728
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,029
Don't need someone to tell you
what you're already thinking.

729
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,865
Funny, I was gonna say that.

730
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,413
- If you want to hang out...
- Yeah, I know.

731
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,873
Call Wilson.

732
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,918
The rest of you, 8:00 tomorrow.

733
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,927
Cash will be fine.

734
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,182
I bet you say that
to all the guys.

735
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,936
Take your blood money.

736
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:04,940
Who are you gonna protect next?

737
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,359
If I told you,
it wouldn't work.

738
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,459
I've re-thought some things.

739
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:24,752
Glad to hear it.

740
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:28,005
I'm prepared to come back
on a number of conditions.

741
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,466
I want the raise you promised,
plus five percent.

742
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,135
I want my own office
and a personal assistant.

743
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,555
That's not unreasonable.

744
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,475
I will give you none of those.

745
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,562
You can come back
at your original salary.

746
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,356
What's going on?

747
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,930
You haven't
re-thought anything.

748
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,945
You've just been black-balled.

749
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,196
You're "House, Lite" now.

750
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,961
The only administrator
that will touch you

751
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,826
is the one who hired "House, Classic."

752
00:42:57,952 --> 00:43:02,122
The good news is she'll pretend
she's not doing you a favor.

753
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,964
I can start Monday.
