1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,714
Brock, what are you doing?

2
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,592
Getting ready for surgery.
What's it look like?

3
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,803
You're operating on my sister.

4
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,139
And my fiancée.

5
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,058
You're drunk.
You could kill her.

6
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:19,145
It's the only way
to stop my hands from shaking.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,689
I need to drink.

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,191
For Anna.

9
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:26,194
What about our baby?

10
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:28,863
Our baby?

11
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:38,915
Brock! Oh, my God! Brock, are you okay?
Brock, speak to me.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,628
Oh, my God!
I think he's really hurt.

13
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:44,629
Cut!

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,041
That was scary. I thought for a second
you were really...

15
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:53,972
Then you're going to be the only one
in the world who did.

16
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,474
This is ridiculous.

17
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,559
That was great, Evan.

18
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:58,765
No, it wasn't. It was crap.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,061
The fans are going to love it.

20
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,855
The fans are crap. I'm crap.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,774
This whole damn show is crap!

22
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,693
Sorry, not your fault.

23
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,895
Where are you going?
My apartment's on the West Side.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,689
Excuse me, you need
to go the other way.

25
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,859
Hey, did you hear what I said?

26
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,284
What the hell's going
on here? What do you want?

27
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,412
An autographed
picture would be nice.

28
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,501
Oh, and I'm also going
to save your life.

29
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,795
You might want to think about
repositioning the crosswalk.

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,840
It's technically not a violation,
but the closer they are to the entrance,

31
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,633
the more likely
they are to be used.

32
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:54,843
Makes sense.

33
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,595
Listen, I actually wasn't
expecting you until next month.

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,057
Yeah, that's the problem with planned
visits, administrators plan for them.

35
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,895
The most recent New Jersey
Hospital Accreditation requirements.

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,689
Yeah, I'm familiar with...

37
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,073
Who is that?

38
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,827
I have no idea.
Shall we get started?

39
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:28,418
Just let me go. I won't press charges.
I'll forget the whole thing.

40
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,170
That's probably true,
seeing as how you have a brain tumor.

41
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,050
You're that nut-job doctor
that keeps calling my publicist.

42
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,720
Actually, I'm the nut-job
Head of Diagnostic Medicine.

43
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,932
I run every day. I don't get headaches.
I'm fine. So, if you don't mind...

44
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,601
Actually, I do mind.

45
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:48,354
I don't care if you die,
but if Brock Sterling dies,

46
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,941
Anna never finds out
he's the father of Marie's baby.

47
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,318
Help!

48
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,736
Help!

49
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,947
We're gonna need
a wheelchair here!

50
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,450
Look, in the last month,

51
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,621
your average line reading has slowed
from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

52
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,706
You're pausing more,
always at the same interval,

53
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,416
every seven to nine words,

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,341
which means you're having trouble
reading one side of the teleprompter,

55
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,587
which means a peripheral
vision problem,

56
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:15,882
which means a tumor
in your occipital lobe.

57
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:21,429
Just one test. If there's nothing wrong,
I'll take you right back home.

58
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:30,939
Make it cab fare. I don't want you
anywhere near my house.

59
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,986
Just put it in my spot.

60
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,949
The Accreditation Board
is here to protect us and our patients.

61
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,576
So, in dealing with
the onsite inspector,

62
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,373
please behave as if it wasn't also an
enormous pain in the ass. Thank you.

63
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,376
Chase, Foreman, Cameron,
up here, please.

64
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:57,048
Why is House driving a limo?

65
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,175
- Don't know.
- Don't have to know.

66
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,927
Don't care.

67
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,888
Wrong. Until this inspection
is over you're back on House-watch.

68
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,390
Current case. Past cases.

69
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,349
He doesn't have a current case.

70
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,642
I have a whole department.

71
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,560
And are you going
to fire us if we don't?

72
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,647
I was just asking
for your help.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,655
The last time I checked the ER, you had
the best-kept charts in the building.

74
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,241
Last time I checked the 4th-floor
janitor's closet,

75
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,701
I found House's charts.

76
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,661
He hasn't filed anything
since you left.

77
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:27,912
Now, House may not care

78
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,956
whether this hospital's accreditation
gets downgraded,

79
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:34,085
- but the people who sign my paychecks do.
- Current. Past.

80
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,712
He doesn't have a current case.

81
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,172
Did he tell you about the limo?

82
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,801
So, I just press this button
every time I see a light?

83
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,845
Tells me where
your blind spots are.

84
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,515
So, the twins,

85
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,767
they're going to turn out
to be yours, aren't they?

86
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,645
I told you, I can't
talk about that stuff.

87
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,773
But you want to be
done with this, right?

88
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,944
One's mine, one's Julio's.

89
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,155
I knew it!

90
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,743
Julio knocked her up before her appendix
burst. You got her after.

91
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,370
How can you watch that stuff?

92
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:10,788
Because it's awesome.

93
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,667
It's preposterous, not one real moment
since I've been on the show.

94
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:19,088
As opposed to shows that represent the
world exactly the way it is, like...

95
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,090
Can't think of any.

96
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,759
What's going on?

97
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:27,638
Hospital is being inspected, and Cuddy
dispatched you to keep an eye on me.

98
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,850
I just parked a Town Car
in an ambulance bay,

99
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:34,395
and instead of ripping me one,
Cuddy acted like she didn't know me.

100
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,814
It's either an inspection
or an aneurysm.

101
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,774
What's the test say?

102
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,859
As I suspected,

103
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,197
you have significant losses in the upper
right quadrant of your visual field.

104
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,281
Are you serious?

105
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,616
No, it's a joke.

106
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,326
Two guys go into a bar,

107
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,536
and one has significant losses in the
upper right quadrant

108
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,496
of his visual field.

109
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,831
The other one says you're
going to need an MRI

110
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,000
to confirm the type
and location of the tumor.

111
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,086
That readout says
his vision's fine.

112
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:59,087
No, it doesn't.

113
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,463
Yes, it does.

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,673
You lied to me?

115
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,135
I kidnapped you, and you're surprised
that I lied to you?

116
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,639
It just means that the symptoms
are intermittent.

117
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,350
You come near me again,
I'm calling the police.

118
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,228
You kidnapped him?

119
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,564
It's sweet that I haven't lost
the ability to surprise you.

120
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,324
Are you mocking me?

121
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,118
My back. My back is killing me.

122
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,369
Don't care. Busy.

123
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,829
Amber's damn mattress.

124
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,623
Well, that sucks.
Don't buy a new one.

125
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,668
Are you being sarcastic?
Because we are buying one.

126
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,628
She's incapable of doing
anything that matters

127
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,422
without turning it
into a zero-sum game.

128
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,508
We're buying
a mattress. For us.

129
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,177
Wow, I'm faster
than you right now.

130
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:57,395
It's all about her and whatever hapless
salesman wanders into her sights.

131
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:02,441
She's going to lie, steal and trade your
testes to get whatever she wants.

132
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:07,905
Hold on. Just got to do something before
he dials the second "one."

133
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,871
You're going to end up
humiliated, holding her purse

134
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,708
and going home to sleep
on a new mattress you hate.

135
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,418
What the hell are you doing?

136
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,752
He needs a MRI.

137
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,883
Give me one-millimeter slices
from the cortex down.

138
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,928
Any particular reason you
decided to sedate a patient

139
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,889
for a procedure that's
completely painless?

140
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,601
Guy has a history of violent outbursts
during surgical procedures.

141
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,144
Yeah, on TV.

142
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:42,106
It's Evan Greer. He's the main stud
on House's soap.

143
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,567
Frontal cortex
looks clean. No tumors.

144
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,820
Increase the magnification
on the occipital lobe.

145
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,115
You watch because you
like or because I like?

146
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,075
I was unemployed. I...

147
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,787
Sorry, that's not an answer,
that's an apology.

148
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,248
If we are ever to come out of the
darkness, we have to be proud...

149
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,752
Occipital, frontal and temporal
lobes are clean, so is the optic nerve.

150
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,837
Definitely no tumors.

151
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,673
He's fine?

152
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,425
And awake.

153
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,262
What should we tell him?

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,933
See if you can talk
him out of suing me.

155
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,647
He kidnapped me! He drugged me!

156
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,440
Perhaps you should
go out the back way.

157
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,443
I'm not going anywhere
you people tell me to go.

158
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,364
It's just someone of your
fame... I figured fans...

159
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,617
You're trying to hide me.
You don't want me making a scene.

160
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,494
The hospital is being
inspected today.

161
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,204
And you want me
to do you a favor?

162
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,457
Not us, our dean of medicine.
And House hates her.

163
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,918
You'd be doing House
a favor by complaining.

164
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,045
Oh.

165
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,509
This hospital is staffed
with lunatics and criminals.

166
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,636
Excuse me, where is Dr. Cuddy?

167
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,348
It's my foot.
What did he do to me?

168
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,349
What did House do?

169
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,142
Nothing. I was with
him the whole time.

170
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,061
It's numb. I can't feel it.

171
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,150
I can't walk.

172
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,784
Foot numbness has
a huge differential.

173
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:21,539
That gets a lot narrower when you add
in peripheral-vision problems.

174
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:25,334
Which gets a lot wider when there's no
proof he ever had a vision problem.

175
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,003
So House was wrong
about the first symptom,

176
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,671
but the guy just
happened to develop

177
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,881
a second, unrelated symptom
a few hours later?

178
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,676
He already kidnapped
and sedated the guy against his will.

179
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,929
Makes sense he'd also do something to
numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

180
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,890
But it doesn't make sense to include
a symptom that he caused

181
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,393
in a differential he's
so desperate to solve.

182
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,131
Unless he didn't
mean to cause it.

183
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,898
Stick to the filing, sweetheart.
Let the doctors do the doctoring.

184
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,608
Either toxins
or vitamin deficiency...

185
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm guessing, when
you drugged him,

186
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,903
you didn't catch him
and ease him to the floor.

187
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,156
He could've pinched a nerve
in his ankle when he fell.

188
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,783
You need to run an EMG test
for motor nerve entrapment

189
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,411
or the inspector
will own your ass.

190
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,540
Kutner, leave the room,
wait 30 minutes,

191
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,250
come back and tell her
the test was negative.

192
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,878
Is it okay if I use that
time to do the test?

193
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,588
Get out of here.

194
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,090
And the rest of them can
help me with all this stuff.

195
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,593
They're busy, which
is really annoying,

196
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,758
because I wanted to be able
to say that they're busy

197
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,930
for no other reason
than to screw with you.

198
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,724
Research.

199
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,020
So the nut job was right?

200
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,189
Usually is.

201
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,275
He said I was dying.

202
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,113
He's wrong a lot, too.
That's why we do these tests.

203
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,700
Bet it's cool, you know,
being the star of a hit TV show?

204
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:44,080
It's a daytime soap. It pretty much puts
me one step above dinner theater.

205
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,915
Come on, you're
on TV every day.

206
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,085
And who cares what the critics
think? Women love soaps.

207
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:53,923
You get to take pride in your job,
feel good when you go home at night.

208
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,966
You're entertaining people.

209
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,093
I don't care.

210
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,553
Then you've made
a strange career choice.

211
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,555
Look, I'm pandering.

212
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,142
I want to be part of something
that inspires people.

213
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:09,063
So, quit. Find something
inspiring and do it.

214
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,439
It's not that easy.

215
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,565
Why not?

216
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,986
Just isn't.

217
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,702
<i>It's my heart, Doctor.
It's racing.</i>

218
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,705
<i>I'm sure it's nothing.
You're a healthy woman, Marie.</i>

219
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,208
<i>Shouldn't you examine me?</i>

220
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,044
<i>Why don't you have Rico do it?</i>

221
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,964
You can't tell me
you didn't notice that pause.

222
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,674
Sorry.

223
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,801
<i>She's never waking up.</i>

224
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,263
This is a whole new
experience in super hi-def.

225
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,890
I had no idea Marie
wore an underwire.

226
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,017
It does sound a little forced.

227
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,187
Could be stiffening in his tongue,
which is a symptom of myxedema.

228
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:55,234
It's not the tongue. It's the dialogue.
I think I dated that nurse, though.

229
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,238
No.

230
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,366
What about the way he's
holding that stethoscope?

231
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,077
The thumb and forefinger
are meeting at an odd angle.

232
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,788
Could be a demyelination
from toxic exposure.

233
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,123
Back it up.

234
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,042
What's this, the AV Club?

235
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,837
It's diagnostic.
Everything's under control.

236
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:19,008
Yeah, excellent job
so far. House, outside.

237
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,845
Keep watching.

238
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,140
You'll never guess
what Rico's got in that box.

239
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,851
<i>Rico doesn't
even know I'm alive.</i>

240
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,855
You have an obsession with an actor or
the character he plays. I feel for you.

241
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,357
You need to work it out.
But I need you to do it

242
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:39,195
when the hospital's accreditation,
and my job, are not on the line.

243
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,324
You want the star of the hottest daytime
drama on TV to die in your hospital?

244
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,203
No, I want you to cure him without
committing any more felonies.

245
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,331
I can't do my job if you're going
to tie my hands like that.

246
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,832
Fifty-one weeks
out of the year,

247
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,836
I let you run around
like a monkey in a banana factory.

248
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,881
All I'm asking is
that you tone it down for a few days.

249
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,426
I want that TV.

250
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,761
We're not bargaining.

251
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,430
You want something. Either you're
bargaining or you're begging.

252
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,349
Me keeping my job
is good for you.

253
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,643
Yes, but it's better for you.

254
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,145
I just want us to
be equally happy.

255
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,024
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment.
Means the foot's a real symptom.

256
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,734
It could be vitamin deficiency.

257
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,278
- Or a toxin.
- Or atherosclerosis.

258
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,446
Or a toxin.

259
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,156
Why is toxin a better idea?

260
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,407
Might not be.

261
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,701
We'll know after I'm finished searching
his set and dressing room

262
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,746
for medically relevant stuff.

263
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,123
Got to go. Need a decision.

264
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,167
You're not going to
cut your own throat.

265
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,294
Yeah, that sounds like me.

266
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:42,007
Test for heavy metals, organics, bio
toxins, and search the home.

267
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,139
I liked the pillow-top.

268
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,266
I like this one.

269
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,145
Great taste. That model's
top-of-the-line.

270
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,188
How much is it?

271
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,898
$1,999. It's a great price.

272
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,985
- And what about...
- That's too rich for us.

273
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,113
I don't know. You think...

274
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,367
Honey, we can't afford that,
not with a baby on the way.

275
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,995
Congratulations. Your first?

276
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,413
Yes.

277
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,624
How about I knock 100 bucks off,
maybe throw in free delivery.

278
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,585
Money's really tight right now.

279
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,212
I'm a law clerk, and my husband
just got laid off.

280
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,257
He has an interview today.
Wish him luck.

281
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,593
Good luck.

282
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:26,885
Fingers crossed.

283
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,181
We might be able
to afford $1,500.

284
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,225
I'd have to check
with my manager.

285
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,893
Thanks. I appreciate it.

286
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,690
Hold this, would you?

287
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,154
911 from work. I better go.

288
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,034
So, am I getting the hard mattress or do
I have to go to my job interview?

289
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,203
Whatever mattress you
want. I'm fine either way.

290
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,623
You... Really?

291
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,375
Really. Just as long as
I get to help you break it in.

292
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,729
Pack your manhood on ice,
maybe the hospital can re-attach it.

293
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,273
You were so wrong.
She's letting me choose.

294
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,817
"You choose" does
not mean you choose.

295
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,694
<i>Really? It sounded like
"You choose."</i>

296
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,157
I suppose it's possible she
meant "House is so, so wrong."

297
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:35,829
It's a trap. It means, "if you love me,
you'll buy the one I want."

298
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,998
Amber doesn't do
passive-aggressive.

299
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,794
People who do aggressive
don't like to limit themselves.

300
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,047
Could a leaky space heater
cause vision problems and numbness?

301
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,008
He'd have gotten better at
the hospital. It's not a trap.

302
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,511
Did I hear a question mark
at the end of that sentence?

303
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,055
<i>House, look. She's...</i>

304
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,306
Got to go.

305
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,143
Manager says
I can do that price.

306
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,482
The gin bottles
are all gifts from fans.

307
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,735
Brock Sterling drinks on the show,
but Evan doesn't drink at all.

308
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,447
He's on this whole health kick
right now. Fruits, nuts...

309
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,283
Did you take those
from his dressing room?

310
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,493
No.

311
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,287
You're not going to
marry Brock, are you?

312
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:20,499
We've been waiting four years for him
to make it official with Anna.

313
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,085
Are you really a doctor?

314
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,130
Glioblastoma. Need more proof?

315
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,092
So, no toxins on the set.
What about his regular life?

316
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,678
Unusual hobbies?
Unsavory friends?

317
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:36,098
No, I've been out with him.
He's as vanilla as they come.

318
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,558
And by "out" you mean...

319
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,768
Well, I asked him on
a date last month.

320
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,688
We went out a few times,
but we weren't right for each other.

321
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,523
Too small or too large?

322
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,402
Is that medically relevant?

323
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,113
I'm a doctor, and it's
relevant to me, so, yes.

324
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,490
We never got that far.

325
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,952
We made out awhile, then
he said he should go home.

326
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,788
He's a real gentleman.

327
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,211
Now, that'd be interesting.

328
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,048
He's impotent.

329
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,388
A steady diet of sunflower seeds
causes a B6 toxicity,

330
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,267
which causes autonomic dysregulation,
which causes a wood-free existence.

331
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,603
One bad night and a couple
of sunflower seeds

332
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,313
and he's got autonomic
dysregulation?

333
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,522
It's more than just one.

334
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,443
He can't even remember the last time he
was able to salute. It's cool, huh?

335
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,863
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen, and
we didn't find anything at the house.

336
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,449
So, all we have to do is filter the B6
out of his blood.

337
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,117
Prep him for plasmapheresis.

338
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,162
Just because he didn't salute
doesn't mean he can't.

339
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:43,540
Can you find out where
that voice keeps coming from

340
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,042
and tell it to get
out of my head?

341
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,928
The impotence could be psychological.
He's depressed, hates his job...

342
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,421
Plasmapheresis has risks.

343
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,506
He should spend a night in the sleep
lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.

344
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,344
Confirmation is for wimps
and altar boys.

345
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,640
We don't need
to wait for a reflex.

346
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:04,061
If he can't get engorged the way God
intended, then he can't get engorged.

347
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,563
I'm not showing him my boobs.

348
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,817
Lack of response to your
chest tells us nothing.

349
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,985
Thirteen, show him...

350
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,149
Where can I find a decent
set of knockers around here?

351
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,574
Your porn's in
the second drawer.

352
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,543
All set. Heart monitor, blood-pressure
monitor, and the one on his junk.

353
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,380
This is humiliating.

354
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,465
We're <i>going to close the blinds to give
you some privacy.</i>

355
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,260
<i>The instruments will let us
monitor your response.</i>

356
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,222
I don't get this guy. He has the coolest
gig ever, but he's miserable about it.

357
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,932
Probably figures quitting
won't do him any good.

358
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,600
Figures he'd be
unhappy anywhere.

359
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,326
Our circumstances
affect whether we're...

360
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,354
You're pretty happy
in this job, right?

361
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,480
Sure.

362
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,899
Have you ever had a job
where you were miserable?

363
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,652
I once sold men's fragrances
in a department store.

364
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,654
And were you miserable?

365
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,072
The pay was awful.

366
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,283
It was a miserable job,
but you weren't miserable.

367
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,037
So, what about you?
Are you happy?

368
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,664
Not particularly.

369
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,375
Heart rate and BP are climbing.

370
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,752
Got some activity on the tumescence
monitor, as well.

371
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,506
There's nothing wrong with his
naughty. It's not B6 toxicity.

372
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,971
Did he just finish?

373
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:25,058
Sometimes when you haven't,
you know, for a while...

374
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,980
His heart rate is through
the roof. 220 and climbing.

375
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,108
He's headed for cardiac arrest.

376
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,285
We shocked his heart back
into sinus rhythm.

377
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,953
He's stable, at least for now.

378
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,955
Could be some sort of
atypical septic reaction.

379
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,457
Not without a fever.

380
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,375
Thus the word "atypical."

381
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,794
In that case, it could
be an atypical bunion.

382
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,754
He used to smoke.

383
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,479
Could be paraneoplastic syndrome caused
by small-cell lung cancer.

384
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,759
He quit 20 years ago, and his calcium
levels are normal.

385
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,010
Could be Graves' Disease.

386
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,970
Extreme hyperthyroidism
leads to systemic problems,

387
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,098
including numbness, vision loss
and cardiac arrest.

388
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,477
You want to be here.

389
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,562
I have to be here.

390
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,689
Just say the word.
I'll fire Thirteen.

391
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,317
Just sign the forms.

392
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,818
Smart move. I was bluffing.

393
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,448
She's right. We should fry the
thyroid before it fries him.

394
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,495
I know it's more exciting this way,
but shouldn't we confirm you're right

395
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,581
before destroying one of the most
important glands in his body?

396
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,626
If that gland has drawn a bull's-eye
on his heart, then, no.

397
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,544
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk

398
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,214
for vascular lesions
and all kinds of cancer.

399
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,424
Protocol says we should
do an iodine uptake test.

400
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:41,843
We?

401
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,304
Anyone else want
to run a useless test

402
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,766
while Brock's thyroid plots
its next lethal move?

403
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,145
It was rhetorical.

404
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,690
You were sure about
B6 toxicity, too.

405
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,149
House is right.

406
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,781
Seriously? I mean, I am,
but you think so?

407
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,952
If he goes into full-on
thyroid storm, he'll die.

408
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,789
We got to nuke his thyroid.

409
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,379
Hang up the phone.

410
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,922
Why? If we're going
to nuke his thyroid...

411
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,342
We're not nuking the guy's thyroid
without proof that it's Graves'.

412
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,011
Do the iodine uptake test.

413
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,138
- If House finds out...
- When House finds out...

414
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,514
We'll have the test results.

415
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,767
And we'll either do his
procedure or we won't.

416
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,490
What are you doing here?

417
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,950
Just grabbing a snack.

418
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,745
You keep food in the morgue?

419
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,039
If I keep it in the lounge,
everyone else eats it.

420
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,208
That's because it's
everyone else's food.

421
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,171
I thought it was just
everyone else's bags.

422
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,007
The Accreditation Board
will light us on fire for this.

423
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,468
They're not going to find out.

424
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,874
Unless, of course, Conway planned on
inspecting the morgue

425
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,181
in, say, two minutes.

426
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:11,975
Is that why you're here?

427
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,227
You're going to get me fired
over a sandwich?

428
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:18,607
No, over a TV. And you're not going to
get fired because you're going to fold.

429
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,192
No, I won't.

430
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,612
But you're going to push it,
so we need a safe word,

431
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,407
so you can signal
your unconditional surrender.

432
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:32,162
Call me "sweet sauce."
Dr. House. I don't think we've met.

433
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,581
Dr. Jamie Conway.
I've heard your name.

434
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,000
Most people have.
It's also a noun.

435
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,757
I sometimes come down here to relax,
unwind, maybe grab a...

436
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,342
Sweet sauce.

437
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,595
It's a nickname.

438
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,971
An ironic nickname.

439
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,560
Wow, it is almost 2:00.
Aren't you supposed to be...

440
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,190
Oh, yeah. Yeah, 'cause those
sick blind kids

441
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,858
aren't going
to read to themselves.

442
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,027
See you.

443
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:17,165
I recommend skipping C26. Floater, been
in the river at least a week.

444
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,543
- Thanks for the warning.
- Any time.

445
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:33,306
Doesn't the doctors' lounge
have that same TV?

446
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,686
No, they've got a 12-inch exactly like
the one that used to be in here.

447
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,522
Your files are done.

448
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,817
I'll be doing a dance of joy just as
soon as my leg is healed.

449
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,318
Can you tilt that down?

450
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,778
I know the paperwork
annoys you,

451
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:50,240
but patient records are important.
You can't just let them sit there.

452
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,034
I had to, in the
name of science.

453
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,953
I let the crap pile up,

454
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:58,582
then I see which team member
is most self-flagellating.

455
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,168
Breaks down,
clears up the mess.

456
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,629
Surprise was, it turned
out to be you again.

457
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,884
You weren't even
registered as a competitor.

458
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,636
- You miss me.
- You miss me.

459
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,555
You hired Thirteen
to replace...

460
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,349
Yeah, all pretty
girls are fungible.

461
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,143
You're avoiding.

462
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:23,815
I miss the job. I miss running around
playing private investigator.

463
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,110
I miss the puzzles.

464
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,363
Seriously, I'll fire Thirteen.

465
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,867
Or Kutner, if you
think Thirteen is hot.

466
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,995
I don't miss you.

467
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,335
That iodine left
a really weird aftertaste.

468
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,379
That's the tracer in it. We'll have the
images in a couple minutes.

469
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,966
You must do okay
with women, huh?

470
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,801
I already asked him that.

471
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,887
And?

472
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,748
It's not all it's
cracked up to be.

473
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,183
He feels unfulfilled.

474
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,351
I doubt it.

475
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,311
I'm lying?

476
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,022
I used to be a plastic surgeon.

477
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,192
I'd talk about my work
as shallow and meaningless.

478
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:14,241
Truth is, I loved every
boob job, every tummy tuck.

479
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,953
Meaning doesn't mean that much.

480
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,580
But you're not a plastic
surgeon anymore.

481
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,917
It's complicated.

482
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,252
Are you happier?

483
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,546
It's complicated.

484
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,839
His thyroid looks normal.

485
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,385
So, that's good news, right?

486
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,637
Everything look
too bright to you?

487
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:36,846
It could be the monitor.

488
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:44,187
It's not the monitor.
It's the iodine.

489
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,358
It's everywhere.
His body's not filtering it.

490
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,776
His kidneys are failing.

491
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,366
I told you to nuke his thyroid.

492
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,619
It's a good thing we didn't.
Kidney failure means it wasn't Graves'.

493
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,748
So, your test screwed me
and our patient's kidneys.

494
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,292
You practically poisoned
him with iodine.

495
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,169
Which he could have handled easily
if his kidneys were healthy.

496
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,172
All we did was reveal a new symptom.
Usually you're all for that.

497
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,842
It must be the rancid tinge
of betrayal that's put me off.

498
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,884
You were wrong.

499
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,845
So, tell me to my face.

500
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,557
You've never hesitated before.
The board's turning you into a coward.

501
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,517
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

502
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,922
You did it to pass
an inspection.

503
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,645
Does it matter?

504
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,856
Kidney failure on top of the other
symptoms

505
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,524
points to an autoimmune condition,

506
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,902
which means that any
of his other organs could be next.

507
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,741
We've already started dialysis. We need
to run ANA's for autoimmune.

508
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,078
You're right. You and the team
go measure the ceilings.

509
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,247
Excuse me?

510
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,999
Accreditation Board
guidelines state that

511
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,085
no object can be less than
18 inches from the ceiling.

512
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,410
Make sure we're in compliance.

513
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,339
There's nothing in our office
that would be less...

514
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,091
I don't mean us.
I mean the whole hospital.

515
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,768
Let's see how
this baby handles.

516
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,992
- What?
- You bought the firm mattress.

517
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,454
I thought that's
the one you wanted.

518
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,039
It was.

519
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,083
Why would you do that?

520
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,209
Because...

521
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,338
Is this a trick question?

522
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,714
I left it up to you.

523
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,093
You were supposed to get
the one you wanted.

524
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,930
I got the one you wanted
because I love you.

525
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,139
No.

526
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,063
You did it because
that's what you do.

527
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,232
With all your ex-wives,
you did whatever they wanted

528
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,193
because it was easier,
and you ended up resenting them.

529
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,196
Don't you dare do that to me.

530
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,157
What, take care of you?

531
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,077
Have you met me?

532
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,579
I can take care of me.

533
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,165
I need you to take care of you.

534
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,460
I have work to do.

535
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,886
You made it to page eight.

536
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,474
"Mysterious Hospital
Visit for Soap Doc."

537
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,853
Wow, I'll be sure to
send my mom a copy.

538
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,775
They told me I have
an autoimmune disease,

539
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,736
like Lupus or Sarcoidosis.

540
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,615
That's what we're
here to find out.

541
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,830
You really as good as everyone seems
to think you are?

542
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:52,834
Are you really as miserable as everyone
seems to think you are?

543
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,796
I just want to do
something that matters.

544
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,842
Nothing matters.

545
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:05,930
We're all just cockroaches,
wildebeests dying on the riverbank.

546
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,392
Nothing we do has
any lasting meaning.

547
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,603
And you think I'm miserable?

548
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,814
If you're unhappy on
the plane, jump out of it.

549
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,399
I want to,

550
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:19,861
but I can't.

551
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:25,033
That's the problem with metaphors.
They need interpretation.

552
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,661
Jumping out of the
plane is stupid.

553
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,955
But what if I'm not in a plane?

554
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,502
What if I'm just in a place
I don't want to be?

555
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,797
That's the other
problem with metaphors.

556
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,008
Yes, what if you're actually
in an ice cream truck,

557
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,594
and outside are candy
and flowers and virgins?

558
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:48,932
You're on a plane.
We're all on planes.

559
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:54,479
Life is dangerous and complicated,
and it's a long way down.

560
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,608
So, you're afraid to change?

561
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,237
No, you're afraid to change.

562
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:07,242
You'd rather imagine that you can
escape, instead of actually try,

563
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,371
because if you fail,
you've got nothing.

564
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,625
So, you'll give up the
chance at something real,

565
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,544
so that you can
hold on to hope.

566
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,881
Thing is, hope is for sissies.

567
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,471
When I get out of here, I'm not going to
be afraid anymore.

568
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,059
I mean, how many guys
get a second chance?

569
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:38,064
Too many. Half the people
I save don't deserve a second chance.

570
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,568
Now that I've got mine,
I'm going to set things right.

571
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,657
I'm going to start by being a better
father to you and to your sister.

572
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,202
- And to your other sister.
- And to your other sister.

573
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:55,248
You realize you're reciting
lines from last season?

574
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,167
We're going to do all
the things I promised.

575
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,046
Just help me get
out of this bed.

576
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,931
Cooling blankets in here. This guy's
brain is about to boil.

577
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,394
Do you know where you are?
What's your name?

578
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,521
Dr. Brock Sterling.

579
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,155
Fever rules out autoimmune.
He's septic.

580
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,197
He's got a massive infection.

581
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,116
We've got him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

582
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,619
but he's slipped from
delirium into a coma.

583
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,497
Good news is last time Brock
was in a coma, he fathered two children.

584
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,126
We need to identify the infection and
get him on more targeted meds fast.

585
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,337
What about pneumococcus?
Causes heart problems and sepsis.

586
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,006
But not the neuropathies in his foot
and eyes. What about tetanus? It fits.

587
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,717
He got a tetanus booster
last year. Lyme disease?

588
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,122
He would have
been sore all over.

589
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,845
There's a thousand infections
that could have caused this.

590
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,474
We can start testing, but
he'll be dead before the cultures grow.

591
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,603
Unless it's a fungus. We could see that
under a microscope.

592
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:02,482
Test for fungi, parasites,
all creatures great and small.

593
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:06,527
- Where are you going?
- To lie down. I need to think.

594
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:15,244
Could be rat bite fever,
but his glands aren't swollen.

595
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,999
Which one are you going to get?

596
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,377
She told me to
get the one I want.

597
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:23,544
So get it.

598
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:29,509
Listeria explains the sepsis,
possibly also the heart problem.

599
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,094
But not the numbness.

600
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,763
If the listeria
caused encephalomyelitis,

601
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,723
which then
caused the numbness...

602
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,893
I want a waterbed.

603
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,109
Wow.

604
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:50,405
I've always wanted one.
I know it's ridiculous, it's just

605
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,450
there's something nice about the thought
of being rocked to sleep in water.

606
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:00,957
No mocking? No Freudian analysis
of how the waterbed

607
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:04,419
is really a great big vagina
I want to crawl into?

608
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,338
I'm ignoring you
because you make me sad.

609
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,550
He's on ampicillin,
which means if it was listeria,

610
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,036
he would've shown
some improvement.

611
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:16,389
No, it's a whole thing. You need special
sheets and insurance and...

612
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:19,934
Who cares? You wanted
one your whole life.

613
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,229
You're a grown-up. You can afford it.
Stores sell them.

614
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,023
Most adults don't go through
life like you do, House,

615
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:27,900
indulging our every whim.

616
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,027
Then you don't
deserve to be happy.

617
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,196
And yet I am. You?

618
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,456
Amber will think it's stupid.

619
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,127
It is stupid.

620
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:53,259
Live the dream, Wilson.

621
00:34:56,596 --> 00:35:00,475
It's not an infection.
It's an allergy.

622
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,727
That's why it's not
responding to antibiotics.

623
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,353
This isn't a soap opera, House.

624
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,231
People don't just wake up from comas
the second you give them drugs.

625
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,485
Especially if we give them the wrong
drugs. What do the tests say?

626
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,862
It was negative for fungus and
parasites, but that doesn't mean...

627
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,906
The more infections we rule out,
the more likely it is

628
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,112
that it's not an infection.

629
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,243
He has no history of allergies
or asthma. Most importantly,

630
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,205
none of his symptoms remotely
resemble an allergic reaction.

631
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,624
Allergens could trigger
an allergic vasculitis.

632
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:27,109
- That would explain the symptoms.
- One in a million times.

633
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,128
Septic infection always
explains his symptoms.

634
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:32,048
But an infection is never
resistant to every antibiotic.

635
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,424
No, an infection
is rarely resistant.

636
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,344
And allergy never responds
to antibiotics.

637
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,846
"Never" beats "rarely." QED, I win.

638
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,812
There were chrysanthemums
in his dressing room.

639
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,351
My God, why didn't you say
he'd been exposed to plant life?

640
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:47,230
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.
It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

641
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:50,858
He has an infection.
If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.

642
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,277
He has an allergy. If we don't give him
steroids, we'll kill him.

643
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,403
Not as fast.

644
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:55,738
Fast enough.

645
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,907
You don't have time for the rest of
the tests. We have to do something.

646
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,326
And what we're doing
right now isn't working.

647
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:06,290
Hundred milligrams
methylprednisolone.

648
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,834
Patients' names?

649
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,377
It's one patient.

650
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,214
You want to give one patient 100
milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.

651
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,384
Perfect, my patient's
a '69 Ford Coma.

652
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,053
Anything over 50 milligrams,
I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

653
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,264
It's protocol,
and the inspector's here.

654
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:24,767
I am 99% certain
that she'll consent.

655
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,436
But for the sake of the
1%, why don't I just...

656
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,605
You're not allowed back here.

657
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,191
Well, tell the inspector
he can put it on my tab.

658
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,282
I didn't mean now.

659
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,796
100 milligrams of methylprednisolone
is an overdose.

660
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,381
We were wrong
about the infection.

661
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,800
He's suffering from
a severe allergic reaction.

662
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,177
The team hasn't finished
the test for allergy.

663
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:03,222
- His symptoms don't...
- In rare cases...

664
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,267
Trust me, at the end
of this conversation, I'm right.

665
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,728
Then confirm it.
Get a blood test.

666
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:12,398
What is it about this severe
and deepening coma

667
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:13,941
that makes you think
we've got time for protocol?

668
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,735
Protocol has saved your
patient from having his

669
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,487
thyroid destroyed
and his blood drained.

670
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:23,743
If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm
wrong. Don't talk about protocol.

671
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,666
My job's on the line.
Your job is on the line.

672
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:35,421
Okay, here's what you do.

673
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:39,759
You wait three minutes,
then you call security.

674
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,137
By the time they get in here
to lock me up, I'll be done.

675
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,307
He gets to live. Your ass
gets to be covered.

676
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:57,193
If he dies, let me know,
so I can pack my things.

677
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:52,248
Tests are negative. Patient's negative
for all floral allergies.

678
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:58,754
I'm going to restart
the antibiotics.

679
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,134
If he's still alive.

680
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,062
Ampicillin, two grams, IV.

681
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:20,192
Why? The steroids worked.
House was right.

682
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,318
The test was negative.

683
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,778
He was still right.

684
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,573
It was an allergy.

685
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:26,866
To what?

686
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,036
Thank you.

687
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,708
I was wrong.

688
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,420
You should have stopped me.

689
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:46,927
Heard about House's patient.
Bold move.

690
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,431
And you backed him.

691
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,640
He was right.

692
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,977
He wasn't even in
the same neighborhood as right.

693
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,103
The patient's alive.

694
00:39:56,228 --> 00:40:00,024
Okay, the rules exist
because 95% of the time,

695
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,651
for 95% of people,
they're the right thing to do.

696
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,695
And the other 5%?

697
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,405
Have to live by the same rules.

698
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,825
Because everybody thinks
they're in that 5%.

699
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:13,662
Okay-

700
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,665
I noticed that Dr. Chase...

701
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,939
What are you doing out here?

702
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,859
I can't sleep.
I hate the waterbed.

703
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,075
I actually kind of like it.

704
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,952
No, it's awful.

705
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,956
We're returning it tomorrow.

706
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,375
Okay-

707
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,471
I'm glad you got it, though.

708
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:14,974
Me, too.

709
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,437
I hope they'll take it back.

710
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,983
They will.

711
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,242
<i>You promised me
you'd stop drinking.</i>

712
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,912
<i>Of course I'm drunk, Anna.</i>

713
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,248
<i>They told me you'd never
wake up from that coma.</i>

714
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,501
<i>But how could you get
engaged to my sister?</i>

715
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,716
<i>We fell in love.</i>

716
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,761
<i>What do you want from me,
Anna? I'm just a man.</i>

717
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,055
<i>And I'm just a woman.</i>

718
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,474
<i>And as thrilled as I am
about The Lady Slipper being</i>

719
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,644
<i>the best nightclub
Port Lawrence has ever seen...</i>

720
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:18,454
Hello.

721
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,458
Don't hang up.
What was the verdict?

722
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,959
$200,000 fine.

723
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,795
You should have been fired.

724
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:27,796
Good night, House.

725
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,715
There are bubbles in his glass.

726
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,008
Can't this wait until...

727
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,969
My patient.
He's allergic to quinine.

728
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:39,016
And you got this from bubbles?

729
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,060
<i>His symptoms started
two months ago.</i>

730
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:43,771
That's also when Brock
started downing gin and tonics

731
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:46,065
like
a Brit staving off malaria.

732
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,818
Gin was fake,
the tonic was real.

733
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,405
And tonic water
is loaded with quinine.

734
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,492
Nice job.

735
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,661
You should have been fired.

736
00:42:58,786 --> 00:42:59,995
I'm taking back the TV.

737
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,288
I saved his life.

738
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,498
That wasn't the deal.

739
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:05,918
The contract clearly stated
no takesie-backsies.

740
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,419
Good night, House.

741
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,129
What are you wearing?

742
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:12,383
- Good night, House.
- Good night, Cuddy.
