1
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,634
<i>And now, coming to the line,</i>

2
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:12,639
<i>last year's
Rookie of the Year, Casey Alfonso!</i>

3
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:18,770
<i>In lane two, nine-time
national champion, Tony Kumer.</i>

4
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,152
<i>Tony's got his light onin lane two,
and now Caseyis approaching the line.</i>

5
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,405
- How do you feel?
- Great.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,906
I feel like
throwing up my guts.

7
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,157
You always feel
like throwing up.

8
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,534
Come on, Dad. Let's get
this digger on the line.

9
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,411
You sure you don't wanna
go to law school?

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,538
- I hate lawyers!
- Yeah, so do I.

11
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,039
Go get 'em, baby!

12
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,627
<i>Okay, looks like
we're ready to go!</i>

13
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,797
<i>Let's hear it, folks!</i>

14
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,762
<i>And it's Casey Alfonso,
by less thanhalf a car length!</i>

15
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,681
<i>What a spectacular finish
for the young female.</i>

16
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,143
Casey Alfonso,
with an amazing finish.

17
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,508
What'd you do at the end there?

18
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,771
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,398
At about 250 feet,
the car got out of shape a bit,

20
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:49,527
but about halfway down,
I just got into the zone or something.

21
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,413
I pedaled it back into the groove.
It was the coolest ride of my life.

22
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:55,909
How does it feel
to be nine-time national champion...

23
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:03,208
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

24
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,592
Casey? Casey! Casey!
Out of the way. Out of the way!

25
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,679
Casey! Get me an ambulance.
Ron, get the ambulance! Casey?

26
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,880
Sixty-eight year old male, non-smoker.

27
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,590
Sixty-eight's a good run.

28
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,052
That'll leave something in the lock box
for the rest of us. Next?

29
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,470
That's your breakfast?

30
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,875
Technically,
it's Wilson's lunch.

31
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,349
Twenty-month old baby,
persistent rash, fever...

32
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,308
Too much crying.

33
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,143
- Female college student with...
- Too much drama.

34
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,029
You don't care about
the crying or the drama,

35
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,522
'cause you won't
see the patient.

36
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,275
And you'd treat Methuselah if his snot
had an interesting color.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,862
Means you've already decided which case
you wanna take next.

38
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,363
Tell me about speed racer.

39
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,576
Female, seizure with visual and auditory
processing deficiency.

40
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,622
I did a consult, and...

41
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,120
What kind of race car?

42
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,246
Dragster.

43
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,748
Continue.

44
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,334
You're gonna take a case
based on the car she drives?

45
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,086
Nothing says,
"Thanks for saving my life"

46
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,051
like a test drive in a car that
accelerates faster than a space shuttle.

47
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,550
You can't save her life,
'cause she's not dying.

48
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,552
Her labs show
signs of dehydration,

49
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,762
means the problem's
just likely heatstroke.

50
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,681
Kind of hard to get
heat struck in four and a half seconds.

51
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,225
Not when you're wearing
a three-layer fireproof suit.

52
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,730
Excuse me, Dr. House?

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,777
No. Lazy ass
called in sick again.

54
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,613
We can give him the message.

55
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,493
May we talk in private?

56
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:16,382
So, either it's heatstroke,
in which case we take the afternoon off,

57
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,027
or it's one of the diagnoses
that you guys are gonna have for me

58
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,346
in two minutes.

59
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,597
You're in charge.

60
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:23,723
I know.

61
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,314
- Cop?
- He's not packing.

62
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,068
Your dad's either a cop
or a security guard.

63
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,195
Or she carries a weapon.

64
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,490
You're with the CIA.

65
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,785
One of our employees
just returned from an assignment sick.

66
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,164
Now, we believe he may be the victim
of an assassination attempt.

67
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,127
Sure.

68
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,545
You wanna close the door?

69
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,047
Door?

70
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:59,008
Well, I assume you're gonna drop trou at
some point during the dance,

71
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,373
I don't see why I should share.

72
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,552
This isn't a joke.

73
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:05,473
If you're willing to help us,
we need to leave now.

74
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,977
If I have to walk somewhere, there
better be at least five girls involved.

75
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,938
And they better be working
their way through college.

76
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,815
Okay, what have you got?

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,109
Hereditary brain disorder,
transient ischemia

78
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,610
or paraneoplastic syndrome.

79
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,405
None of those go away with IV fluids.
It's heatstroke.

80
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,448
Or Cushing's or calcium deficiency.

81
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,533
Who's your friend?

82
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,909
We use the term life partner.

83
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,997
Get a fresh history, neurological exam
and an MRI of her head.

84
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,456
Fifteen minutes
for the lap dance,

85
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,459
a half-hour to
scrub the guilt off my soul...

86
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,503
See you in 45!

87
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,882
Dr. House, we need to hurry.

88
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,926
Yeah, we need to hurry.

89
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,136
Little advice.

90
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,848
I mean, obviously the Village People
played out the whole cop thing.

91
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,225
But come on, CIA?

92
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,437
You seriously expect
anyone to believe that?

93
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,363
It helps when you have props.

94
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,704
Keep your eye on my pen.

95
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,623
Very good.

96
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,251
Any nausea or vomiting
before the seizure?

97
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,627
No.

98
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,172
My dad had some, but he's always like
that before a race.

99
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,339
Could have been food poisoning.

100
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,133
- You two eat breakfast together?
- No.

101
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:25,470
Any history of sciatica
or spinal injury?

102
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,721
No.

103
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,973
Abnormal deep tendon reflex.

104
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,225
Really? Let me see.

105
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,647
- It's there.
- I didn't say it wasn't there,

106
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,608
I said it was abnormal.

107
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,569
We're gonna give you
an MRI to be sure,

108
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:45,114
but I'm guessing your symptoms were
caused by just dehydration in the heat.

109
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,783
You're guessing?

110
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:51,871
Look, I make a living
driving 300 miles an hour,

111
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,291
which makes the ability
to stay conscious kind of important.

112
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,918
I'm sure it's just heatstroke,

113
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,129
but we're gonna do an MRI
to be extra careful.

114
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,392
You said you left
your cell in your office.

115
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:14,769
I lied.

116
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,730
I wasn't going to take it.

117
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,732
Just tell you to
turn it off for take-off.

118
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:20,691
I know.

119
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,819
I just wanted to see if you could tell
that I was lying.

120
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,029
Useful information. Yeah?

121
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,155
Where are you?

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,866
I'm on a top-secret
mission for the CIA.

123
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:30,785
Right.

124
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,578
There was nothing
on your race car driver's CT

125
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,539
and the history
and physical were normal.

126
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:36,833
Her deep tendon reflexes
seemed a bit weak to me.

127
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,127
Areflexia could
mean Miller Fisher.

128
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,462
Yes, areflexia
could mean Miller Fisher,

129
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,258
but since the reflex was weak, not
absent, it doesn't mean anything.

130
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,593
I'm releasing her.
You can go back to your poker game.

131
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,678
Poker's illegal.

132
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,930
<i>The CIA
would never allowillegal activity.</i>

133
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,892
<i>Have you considered
Miller Fisher?</i>

134
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,227
Why? What happened?

135
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,690
She just had another seizure. And now
she's getting a vertical nystagmus.

136
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,743
We think it's Miller Fisher,
an inflammatory process.

137
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,371
In rare cases, it can cause
respiratory failure, but...

138
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,039
Wait, wait.
She could stop breathing?

139
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,542
You said there was nothing wrong.
You said you were sure.

140
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,503
You just had another seizure.
Clearly there's something wrong.

141
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:26,591
So, why should I trust you
to figure out what it is?

142
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,509
Where's Dr. House?
I'm at this hospital...

143
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,052
It's gonna be all right.

144
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,096
We just need to start
the plasmapheresis.

145
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,431
No.

146
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,891
It's not going to be all right,

147
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,853
because you obviously
don't have a clue what you're doing.

148
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,022
I'm not letting you touch me.

149
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,064
Honey!

150
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,609
I wanna see House. Where is he?

151
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,206
It looks a lot better on 24.

152
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,299
I take that back.

153
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,554
Dr. Samira Terzi.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.

154
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,806
We really appreciate
the consult on such short notice.

155
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,727
There's nothing that gives me more
pleasure than helping out a colleague.

156
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,854
This is Dr. Sidney Curtis
from the Mayo Clinic.

157
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,731
He's also agreed to
help with the diagnosis.

158
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,149
Dr. House.

159
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,443
<i>Curtis on Immunology,
Sidney Curtis?</i>

160
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,527
You've read it?

161
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,197
Nope, but it is keeping
my piano level.

162
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,703
So, where is
the poor sick fella?

163
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,082
What do we do?

164
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,041
I don't know yet.

165
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,000
She needs treatment.

166
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,005
This is a test, right?

167
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,128
You're reporting
back to him everything we do.

168
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,631
Yeah. And I asked the patient
to be uncooperative.

169
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,236
Personally, I think
she overplayed it.

170
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,177
She's being uncooperative because you
made us all look like idiots.

171
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,582
We're only gonna
look like idiots

172
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,598
if we can't figure out how to get her
to agree to the treatment.

173
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,558
What would House do right now?

174
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,478
Pop a pill, insult us
and trick the patient.

175
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,896
We can do that last part.

176
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,773
She's never met House
before, has she?

177
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:06,732
Who's got a cane?

178
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,567
House isn't here.

179
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,070
We're not gonna act like him.

180
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,580
What do you want?

181
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,712
I'm gonna do what doctors
aren't supposed to do,

182
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,131
admit I made a mistake.

183
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,134
I shouldn't have been
so quick to dismiss your symptoms.

184
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,846
But you need to let us
start the plasmapheresis.

185
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,723
What do you want?

186
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:44,103
Case? Honey, do you
know where you are?

187
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,024
- She's burning up.
- Start the treatment.

188
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,775
- I can't.
- You've got my permission.

189
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,022
- She's obviously confused.
- Doesn't matter anymore.

190
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,406
Miller Fisher doesn't
cause delirium and fever.

191
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,366
I don't know what this is.

192
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,828
I'm afraid there are gonna be some
limitations on his medical history.

193
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,122
Just let me know what you need and I
should be able to provide it.

194
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:07,168
FYI, my malpractice insurance
doesn't cover alien autopsies.

195
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,377
That's fine.

196
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,879
X-files are the next wing over.

197
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,964
Where was the patient
when he first fell ill?

198
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,299
Sorry, that's classified.

199
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,760
But assume there aren't too many places
in the world John hasn't been.

200
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,219
And, yes, John's a cover name.

201
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,305
And what makes you
think it was an attempt on his life?

202
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,791
Sorry, can't tell
you that, either.

203
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,516
- Well, what can you tell us?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,811
Did Oswald really have sex
with Marilyn Monroe?

205
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,999
Good Lord.

206
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,710
Very professional.

207
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,672
Five days ago
he was 185 pounds. Perfect health.

208
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,636
Cool.

209
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,225
Fever and delirium rule out...

210
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,979
He's not gonna hire you just because
you called him the most,

211
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,441
especially since it's obvious
he doesn't want to be called.

212
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,693
Symptoms rule out Miller Fisher.
MS fits better.

213
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,695
Progression's too fast.
More likely meningitis.

214
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,261
Areflexia doesn't
fit as well with...

215
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,323
Does with amyloidosis.

216
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,575
That's even slower
than MS. It's lupus.

217
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,369
I'm with
the little man on this one.

218
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,080
It's attacking the body
and the brain, classic autoimmune.

219
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,209
Flirt all you want, but I should warn
you, <i>shiksas</i> are for practice.

220
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,003
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

221
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,172
It's primarily neurological.
Let's start her on...

222
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,966
Then why no plaques on her MRI?

223
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,135
MRI was inconclusive.
Start her on...

224
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,719
So, now you're sure
that it's MS.

225
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,055
Just like you were sure
it was Miller Fisher.

226
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,307
An hour after you were sure
it was heatstroke.

227
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,144
The symptoms fit.
Start her on interferon.

228
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,603
We're not gonna
score any points with House

229
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,529
if we solve this
just by running your errands.

230
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,524
- I get that you wanna be right.
- You don't?

231
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,290
I'm just trying to save the patient,
not score points with my boss.

232
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,864
Would it hurt the patient
if you let us run some tests?

233
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,785
You've got three hours.

234
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,586
We've run six complete
tox screens,

235
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,839
tested for every heavy metal, poison and
biological agent we can think of.

236
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,716
It says here he ate
a lot of chestnuts.

237
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,594
Hold on a second.

238
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:24,180
If the squirrel liberation army
is involved, I'm out of here.

239
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,514
Those little rodents are...

240
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,933
Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
If someone switched them...

241
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,619
Horse chestnuts
may look like chestnuts,

242
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,188
but they taste like
a horse's lower than chestnuts,

243
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,523
which makes the theory that he
accidentally ate a couple of hundred

244
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,692
slightly less persuasive.

245
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:42,490
Seeing as how he was prowling
the back alleys of Tehran...

246
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:44,617
It wasn't Tehran, it was...

247
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,245
You almost got me.

248
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,664
Unless we know the local
environmental factors,

249
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,707
the poisonous flora...

250
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,083
You know I can't tell you that.

251
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,837
Well, then why are we here? You might
as well just Google "poison."

252
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:01,133
All they would tell me is he spent
the last eleven months in Bolivia.

253
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,386
Who you gonna kill
in Bolivia? My old housekeeper?

254
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,638
We don't kill people.

255
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,015
I'm sorry, who are you
gonna marginalize?

256
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,601
If it is my housekeeper,
she has it coming.

257
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,269
Cleaning the windows
means cleaning both sides.

258
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,230
Am I right or am I right?

259
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,273
What does it matter
what he was doing?

260
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,275
- The guy's dying.
- Not anymore.

261
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,611
I know what's
poisoning him, and who.

262
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,029
John.

263
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,616
It's just pancreatitis.

264
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,117
He's not an alcoholic.

265
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,411
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers...

266
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,205
Spies can't get
fungal infections?

267
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,370
And the burns on his skin?

268
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,416
Spies can't get sunburns?

269
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,542
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

270
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:40,130
So, either we go with his theory
of the non-drinking drunk,

271
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,132
or he was poisoned
by some group

272
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,052
with the resources
to make it completely untraceable,

273
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,346
some customized isotope.

274
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,228
Let's treat for
radiation poisoning.

275
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:02,111
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

276
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,280
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

277
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,616
We should celebrate
with a beer or eight.

278
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,286
I don't drink.

279
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,497
Oh, me thinks he doth
protest too much.

280
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,749
He's deathly ill.
Why would he lie about drinking?

281
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:20,045
Guilt over killing a man would make
anyone hit the sauce.

282
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,172
We don't kill people.

283
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,424
Right.

284
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,426
You just lie
to your friends and family,

285
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,971
establish false identities, trick people
into betraying their country.

286
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,516
He'd never
cover up his drinking. He's too honest.

287
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,519
Hey! Something
I've always wanted to know.

288
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,397
That poison lipstick
that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan,

289
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,441
why didn't that kill her?

290
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:47,448
Okay, drum roll!

291
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,410
LP is negative for meningitis.

292
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,579
Sorry, Cole.

293
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:57,625
Fat pad biopsy is...
Wait for it...

294
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:03,297
Negative for amyloidosis
and Thirteen goes down!

295
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,590
Could we hurry this up?
My son has...

296
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,258
Can I have a kid, too?
I'm working too hard.

297
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,301
I could hook you up.

298
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,886
If I had two minutes
and some anti-nausea meds,

299
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,013
I'd take you up on that.

300
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,890
And for the gold...

301
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,686
Protein's 65, glucose, 70.

302
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,730
It's MS,
start her on interferon.

303
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:20,731
Now, turn to the last page.

304
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,108
Sad rate's 95,
ANA's weakly positive.

305
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,234
Positive, it's lupus.

306
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,111
Weakly, not lupus. It's MS.

307
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,236
We obviously don't know what it is.
Treat for both.

308
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,990
No. I gave in on the tests.

309
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,435
We're not treating her
for two completely separate diseases

310
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,621
because you think
lupus will win you a prize.

311
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,253
- Still think it's lupus?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,713
Me, too.

313
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,133
In case of emergency,
go to the emergency room.

314
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,053
Could be lupus.

315
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,221
That's what we figured.

316
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,889
Then why are you here?

317
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,100
You're an immunologist.
We wanted to confirm...

318
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,769
Who are you looking for me to help you
sell down the river? House or Cuddy?

319
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,521
Foreman.

320
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,232
- Sorry.
- He's pushing MS.

321
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,274
Thinks that because
he's in charge,

322
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,360
he has to prove
he's the smartest guy in the room.

323
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,946
All I've heard about you, you put
the patient above everything else.

324
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,074
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

325
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,245
- All House cares about is results.
- I know.

326
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,330
I'm talking about
how to deal with Foreman.

327
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,581
So am I.

328
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,670
Fever's down to 101.5.

329
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,396
Treatment's working.
Why are we out here?

330
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:27,798
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

331
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,675
It's kind of tacky doing it
in front of the patient.

332
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,635
You put her on steroids, too?

333
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,594
We had no choice.

334
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,554
The sad rate pointed to lupus.

335
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,847
And the ANA ruled it out!

336
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,306
Doctors!

337
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,935
Legs hurt?

338
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,647
I can't feel them at all. I don't think
I can move them.

339
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,290
Vitals stabilizing.

340
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,583
Tummy ache's gone as well.

341
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,002
So, the treatment's working.

342
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,299
You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy
and hop on the company jet?

343
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,801
Little trip down Mexico way,

344
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,722
and I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

345
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,476
Do you think acting like an idiot and
talking about sex works on girls?

346
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,121
Well, if it didn't, the human race
would have died out long ago.

347
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,427
You're pretty cheery
for someone

348
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,722
who was just proved wrong
about his pancreatitis theory.

349
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,174
I'm appropriately cheery
for someone who's been proved right.

350
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,528
John hasn't vomited
in six hours.

351
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,406
What's to vomit?
I'm eating his lunch.

352
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,117
Withholding nutrients
is the treatment for pancreatitis.

353
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,953
That, and the antibiotics
you put him on.

354
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,997
I did unhook
your iodine, though.

355
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,250
Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm
just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.

356
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,376
You're unbelievable.

357
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:50,130
Let's ask John if he'd rather be sick
honestly or cured dishonestly.

358
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,217
John? John?

359
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,604
Any chance he's just
overwhelmed with gratitude?

360
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,160
Paralysis.

361
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,540
It's a new symptom?

362
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,254
Big white space on the board
where it would fit.

363
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,710
Nice, multicolored markers.

364
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,130
I'm not writing it because we can't know
if it's a real symptom.

365
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,383
When these two went rogue and pumped
her full of steroids, we lost...

366
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,301
Steroids don't cause paralysis.

367
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,303
She was also on interferon.

368
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,848
Giving her both probably
fried her immune system.

369
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,432
Who knows what infection
you could cause...

370
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,518
We consulted
an immunologist, she said we have...

371
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,687
She? You talking
about Dr. Cameron?

372
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,897
- She thought lupus was...
- She tell you to start treating?

373
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,191
Yes! They've ignored you,
they screwed up

374
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,193
and it's fun
watching you spank them.

375
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,486
But, can we get back
to the medicine?

376
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,574
The last thing any of you
give a damn about is the medicine.

377
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,286
Look.

378
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,372
I'm not saying
you're bad doctors or bad people.

379
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,291
But House is.

380
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,918
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

381
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,254
planted you in it,
and is watching you play.

382
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,424
And none of it works
for anyone except him.

383
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,261
And whoever wins.

384
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,600
Given its quick progression,
we gotta assume botulism.

385
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,935
I'll go to her place.
Check out her fridge and pantry.

386
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,438
It's not botulism. It's polio.

387
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,905
Brilliant. We should search her home
for FDR's remains or a time machine.

388
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,711
She could have contracted it from anyone
who's been to Africa, or...

389
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,867
She's been vaccinated.

390
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:42,993
Vaccines wear off.

391
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,246
There hasn't been
a single American case in over 20 years.

392
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,749
I've seen this disease.
I know what it looks like.

393
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,543
That's why you're finding it,
because you're looking for it.

394
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,753
Polio?

395
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,671
- It's crazy.
- House wouldn't think so.

396
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,090
So, go find House
and tell him your theory.

397
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,886
Take a personal day.
Seriously. Get out of here.

398
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,764
You don't have
the power to fire me.

399
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,476
But I do have the power
to kick your ass off my case.

400
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,605
I'm starting
the botulism treatment.

401
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,942
The rest of you,
look for confirmation.

402
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,700
He should be
brought up on charges.

403
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,577
Okay, relax.

404
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,537
I'll take your book
out from under my piano.

405
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,415
He's dying of radiation sickness.
He's obviously in pain.

406
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,186
All of which could have been avoided
if you hadn't interfered...

407
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,712
What was that for?

408
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,299
Radiation sickness
kills specific cells at specific times.

409
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,145
His hair should be coming out in clumps
before he's writhing in pain.

410
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,555
Since it's not, I know who's
trying to kill him.

411
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,557
God.

412
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,518
It's blood cancer,
Waldenstrom's.

413
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,813
Radiation can cause infections,
which set off neuropathy...

414
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,232
If you had
any real evidence of foul play,

415
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,359
you'd be torturing Bolivians

416
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,988
instead of putting me into a state
of anticipatory sexual arousal.

417
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,364
Can we treat for both?

418
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:06,034
Bad idea. Unless you're
the one who's trying to poison him.

419
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,037
I'll arrange for
plasmapheresis and chemo.

420
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,094
Are you gonna trust him
after what he did?

421
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:14,209
I don't have to trust him
to agree with him.

422
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,590
You make a good point.

423
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,510
I've been wrong every time and she still
won't listen to you.

424
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:28,140
So, either she really likes me
or she really hates you.

425
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,600
And I got a ride in the jet.

426
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,233
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?

427
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,526
Just came to say hi.

428
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,736
Hi again.

429
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,821
Where's Mrs. Bearman?

430
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,031
Sent her home.

431
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,824
I was scheduling her
for an MRA.

432
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,576
If we gave MRAs
to every patient with a headache...

433
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,245
This wasn't just a headache,
it was the worst in her life.

434
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,810
And lucky for you,
I'm a neurologist.

435
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,666
She went to a wine and cheese tasting.
Both triggers for migraines.

436
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,168
She's never had
a migraine before.

437
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,614
And I never had
a blueberry bagel,

438
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,962
but for the first time
I had one.

439
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,338
Bagels don't kill people.

440
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,257
This is a classic ticking
bomb aneurism.

441
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,427
Wow. This taught me a lesson.

442
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,846
I guess when I mess
with other people's patients,

443
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,682
I risk looking like
an officious bitch.

444
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,980
We're gonna have to
track down Mrs. Bearman.

445
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,778
Wait. Never mind.

446
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,447
It's funny.

447
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,365
It's not funny,
it's totally immature.

448
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,617
It is funny.

449
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,619
You just can't appreciate it,
because you're the victim.

450
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:33,497
Yeah. I deserve shame
and ridicule for offering a consult.

451
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,082
Unheard of for a doctor.

452
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,084
You didn't offer
a medical consult.

453
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,461
You offered a
dealing-with-Foreman consult.

454
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,756
For the good of the patient.
It's what House would have done.

455
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,009
Maybe House will hear about it
and tear up with pride.

456
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,594
You think I'm trying
to impress him.

457
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,180
I think that for someone
who's not involved in his team,

458
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,100
you're remarkably
involved in his team.

459
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,102
Let it go.

460
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,561
Let him go.

461
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,692
And that's mature.

462
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,536
One-twenty over 80.
Let 'er rip.

463
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,126
Now we got the medical stuff
out of the way,

464
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,710
why don't we meet
back at your place

465
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,421
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

466
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,633
My safe word is, "Help,
please, please, stop."

467
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,136
It's two pleases. Anything
less than that, you keep going.

468
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,223
You actually cure this guy,
I'll show you my private water board.

469
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,270
We need to consult
an oncologist about the chemo.

470
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,608
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you
were still euphemizing.

471
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,444
My valet knows
a little oncology.

472
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,227
I was wondering when you'd grow bored
of avoiding my calls.

473
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,246
Oh, I could never grow
bored of ignoring you.

474
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,290
What's the latest protocol
on Waldenstrom's?

475
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,416
Where are you?

476
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,209
CIA headquarters.

477
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,419
<i>How much fludarabine
do you need...</i>

478
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,464
Either you're sprawled naked on your
floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin

479
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:07,465
or collapsed naked
in front of your computer

480
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,831
with an empty bottle of Viagra.

481
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,136
Please tell me which,
because Chase has another pool going.

482
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,221
They flew me in to help
deal with a sick employee.

483
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,505
<i>- How much...
- Hallucinations?</i>

484
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,600
Damn, I shouldn't have
bet on the Viagra.

485
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,394
Okay. Call the Langley switchboard,
ask for extension...

486
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,063
- Thirty-five, seventy-eight.
- Three, five, seven, eight.

487
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,400
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

488
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,654
You know, I happen to have a position
available on my penis.

489
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,036
Wait a second, I think
I screwed up that joke.

490
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,913
You offering me a job?

491
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,664
I'd settle for that.

492
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,419
As tempting as a position
on your staff is, I like it here.

493
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,922
Pays better, and we've only had
one assassination attempt.

494
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,423
And I'm sure
you're a great boss.

495
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,427
That's why your fellows
left en masse a couple of months ago.

496
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,679
I have satellite images.

497
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,147
Inspector Gadget?

498
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,776
My God, you're
actually at the CIA.

499
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,027
You've gotta get down here.

500
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,655
They've got a satellite
aimed directly into Cuddy's vagina.

501
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,533
I told them the chances
of invasion are slim to none, but...

502
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,244
Waldenstrom's.

503
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,956
Recommended dose is 25 milligrams
per meter squared.

504
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,457
They do
a background check on you?

505
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,792
Twenty-five milligrams.

506
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,126
They did a background
check on you,

507
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,628
they did a background check
on your friends.

508
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,588
Relax. I'm sure they already know

509
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,548
that you brought heroin back from
Afghanistan.

510
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,008
<i>That's not true.</i>

511
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,636
I've never been to Afghanistan.

512
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,638
House?

513
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,059
She's getting worse.

514
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,228
Her fever's risen slightly.

515
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:50,235
But it's definitely...
What? Botulism?

516
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,988
Right? Because
if you're wrong again,

517
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,615
and you're treating her for something
that she doesn't even have...

518
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,159
The anti-toxin
hasn't had time to work yet.

519
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,162
I know it's hard,
but try to be patient.

520
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,583
Excuse me.

521
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,592
I know you're pissed
I interrupted,

522
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,638
but you're gonna be
even more pissed in a second.

523
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,263
You tested her
without telling me?

524
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:22,183
Yeah. I know, I'm really,
really sorry, but...

525
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,769
On the other hand,
it's positive.

526
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,898
She has polio.

527
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,820
Now what, boss?

528
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,408
Where's House?

529
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,953
He's blown
off four hours of clinic.

530
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,583
He's consulting for the CIA.

531
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,378
Seriously, call Langley,

532
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,591
and ask for extension three, five...
It's three, five, three, six?

533
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,259
It's definitely two threes.

534
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,470
I wrote it down.
I have it somewhere.

535
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,806
He's gonna make up
twice his skipped hours in the clinic.

536
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,475
Okay-duke.

537
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,061
And for protecting him,
you're gonna make up twice that.

538
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,021
Why are you punishing me
worse than him?

539
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:11,024
Because House never learns.
You might.

540
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,744
How are you feeling?

541
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,080
Like crap.

542
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,540
Yeah. Cancer can be that way.

543
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,544
My hair is falling out.

544
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,925
Is that the chemo?

545
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,135
No, that's too quick.

546
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,723
So, what does it mean?

547
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,646
It means you don't have cancer.

548
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,942
Someone actually
did try to kill you.

549
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,201
You're stubborn.
You're arrogant!

550
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:04,202
There's no need to yell.

551
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,870
You may have cost
that man his life.

552
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,622
He's getting the
radiation treatment.

553
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,040
Twenty-four hours too late.

554
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,292
I didn't yell at you
when I thought you were wrong.

555
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,129
- I wasn't wrong.
- This isn't productive.

556
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:17,048
There is no "productive,"
it's too late!

557
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,093
Because of your inexperience,
your poor judgment

558
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,096
and your failure to recognize
a reckless fool.

559
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,267
Cordyceps sinensis.

560
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:36,192
It's an herbal treatment
derived from a parasitic fungus.

561
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,319
Comes from caterpillars.

562
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,321
Along with dimercaprol
chelation,

563
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,282
it's been shown to mitigate
bone marrow damage

564
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,034
from radiation poisoning

565
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,745
in monkeys.

566
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,668
Sorry. I was stubborn
and arrogant.

567
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,628
Self-recriminations
won't help her.

568
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,714
Nothing's gonna help her,
she's got polio.

569
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,479
There's no cure,
but there are treatments.

570
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,800
No, she's dying.

571
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,719
Yeah, every death's a tragedy.

572
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,345
Funny how you weren't
so depressed

573
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,672
when she was just dying because
me and Amber screwed up.

574
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,142
And I'm also self-centered,
thanks for clarifying.

575
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,144
Don't forget self-pitying.

576
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,607
Vitamin C.
Extremely high doses.

577
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,318
It was experimental treatment protocol
in the '50s...

578
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:19,652
And they haven't finished yet?

579
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,613
They lost funding.

580
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,502
That's because there's no logical reason
vitamin C would cure polio.

581
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,201
Well, someone
thought there was.

582
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,703
Someone thought black people
made excellent farm implements.

583
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,268
I'm not talking
about hurting anyone.

584
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,210
I just want to force-feed her
some orange juice.

585
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,835
You wanna throw in
some bacon and eggs as well?

586
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,171
If there's anything
you learned today,

587
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,590
it's gotta be that
you can be wrong.

588
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,310
John, can you hear me?

589
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,232
We're gonna start you
on an experimental treatment.

590
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,277
Tea?

591
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:05,198
It's a Chinese herb
which has been effective.

592
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,158
I'm dying, aren't I?

593
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,037
Probably.

594
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,631
We're gonna attempt
an experimental protocol.

595
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,342
- A new drug?
- An old one. Vitamin C.

596
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,427
Ultra-high doses
have been shown

597
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,430
to destroy the polio virus
and heal nerve damage.

598
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,432
She could regain use
of her legs?

599
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,017
It's unlikely.

600
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,187
But we're gonna try.

601
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,856
Don't give up.

602
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,958
Nausea's not as bad.

603
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,753
Radiation sickness
has a latency period.

604
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,591
You'll get better
before you get worse.

605
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,350
Wanna know what
I really did down there?

606
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,187
Only if it's interesting.

607
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,108
The women there,

608
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,320
during Carnival, they...

609
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,364
They do this dance.

610
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,035
They call it the devil dance.

611
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,913
Not interesting.

612
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,336
I spent the whole
40 days with this

613
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,757
attache to
the Minister of Defense.

614
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,055
The most buttoned-down woman
you'd ever meet,

615
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,935
except when she did this dance.

616
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:04,651
She agreed to tell me stuff.

617
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,412
Okay, you got
half a good story there.

618
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,415
Karma.

619
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,381
Best way to rid yourself
of that guilt is to confess your sins.

620
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:32,470
This pain, it's right.
It's comforting.

621
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:37,392
It makes me think that somehow
it all makes sense.

622
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,687
What do you mean 40 days?

623
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,481
When they found out

624
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,985
what she'd told me...

625
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:51,364
Carnival in Bolivia's
only eight days.

626
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,996
You have any idea
what a chestnut looks like?

627
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,586
You idiot!

628
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,380
Who are you calling an idiot?

629
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:12,343
Whoever knew that John was stationed
in Brazil, not Bolivia.

630
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,429
Brazil?

631
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,514
Well, then, I guess
I'm talking to you, idiot.

632
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,809
It's the same region.
It's the same parasites, same diseases.

633
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,061
But not the same language.

634
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,730
In Bolivia, chestnuts
are chestnuts.

635
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,232
Brazil, on the other hand,
has castanhas-do-péra

636
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,568
literally, chestnuts from Péra,

637
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:32,321
because it would be stupid for people
from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts.

638
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,158
So, he ate Brazil nuts.
Big deal.

639
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,618
No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts,
which is a big deal,

640
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,078
because they contain selenium,

641
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:42,790
which in high doses causes fatigue,
vomiting, skin irritation,

642
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,793
discharge from the fingernail beds
and hair loss.

643
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,962
Any of that sounding familiar?

644
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,632
Can you treat it?

645
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,303
We already started.

646
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,805
Treatment's chelation, the same as
for radiation sickness.

647
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,433
The only difference is
it works a lot better on nut poisoning.

648
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,060
So, what's the problem?

649
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,605
You're an idiot.

650
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,120
Why is she shivering?

651
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,581
Low serum calcium is a side effect
of the treatment.

652
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,500
I can give her
a calcium supplement.

653
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,043
My arm hurts.

654
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:30,379
The infusion rate has to remain high
for the treatment to work.

655
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,672
Is it working?

656
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,342
You feel that?

657
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,928
Yeah, it hurts.

658
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,390
It's working!
This is fantastic.

659
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,276
There's a lot you could learn
at my fellowship.

660
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,238
If you knew the procedures
I could teach you...

661
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,864
Of course, we'd need
a nurse to prep.

662
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,576
I know how to
kill a man with my thumb.

663
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,496
Actually, I was just trying to make
another euphemism for sex.

664
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,914
So was I.

665
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,125
Oh, God. How can you
flirt with this idiot?

666
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:11,796
He lied to us again and again.
He broke laws, ethical codes...

667
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,256
I was right.

668
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,425
That doesn't mean everything.

669
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,010
It means a lot.

670
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:24,892
Dr. Curtis, Dr. House.
I appreciate your help.

671
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,242
- Hey-
- Hey-

672
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,341
When you were dying,

673
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,343
you tried to infect me,

674
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,596
because you knew
I'd fight for you

675
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,097
if I thought I was dying, too.

676
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,429
Are you bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

677
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,186
I'm happy I changed jobs.

678
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,941
But I know I'll never
have that sort of

679
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,068
excitement.

680
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,554
You miss people
trying to kill you?

681
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,738
No.

682
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,576
I miss people doing whatever it takes
to get the job done.

683
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,959
I guess that's why
I'm having trouble giving it up.

684
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,964
I shouldn't have helped them
mess with your patient.

685
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,469
They had to screw with me.
I've gotten everything wrong.

686
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,389
I don't believe it.

687
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,184
You're not gonna
get everything right.

688
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,980
But you're never gonna
get everything wrong.

689
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,379
Morning!

690
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,090
Where have you been
the last two days?

691
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,258
- Overslept.
- We saved speed racer.

692
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:24,303
She had polio.
We cured it with vitamin C.

693
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:29,225
Yeah. I cured depression
with tonic water once.

694
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,230
Actually, I think
there was some gin in it, too.

695
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,729
A hundred and fifty grams
over six hours.

696
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:34,814
It worked.

697
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,774
No, it didn't.

698
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,112
I told you,
you can't cure polio.

699
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,281
It means either
she's not cured or she never had it.

700
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:48,828
Since she's walking out of here,
I tested her blood from admittance.

701
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,287
No polio.

702
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,248
Means Brennan
screwed up the lab tests.

703
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,791
Or you screwed up
your lab tests.

704
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,418
You must have. She got better.

705
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:58,713
So, it's relapsing
and remitting. Maybe porphyria.

706
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,841
Well, that's a stretch.

707
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:04,218
If she had porphyria,
you'd have seen purple urine.

708
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,263
You think it's more
likely he cured polio?

709
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,266
Well, they believe it.

710
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,060
Her symptoms fit perfectly.

711
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,313
Any alternative is
unbelievably convoluted.

712
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,359
Some doctor would have to poison her
with thallium so it looks like polio,

713
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,402
then fake a lab test,
then give her vitamin C

714
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:25,114
and stop the poison
so she magically gets better.

715
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,659
Actually, it is kind
of doable, right?

716
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,498
So, what do you think?

717
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:38,252
Shall we test her for thallium before
you contact Stockholm?

718
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,796
You poisoned her?

719
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,798
The really shocking thing

720
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,764
is that Foreman was right
about the heatstroke.

721
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:47,803
Vitamin C cures polio.
I've seen it.

722
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:51,057
Yeah. In some bush clinic.

723
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,476
You needed polio
in a place with a proper lab.

724
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:57,688
The only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

725
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:05,362
There is no money in finding cures for
diseases that only kill poor people.

726
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,866
This will make
them do research.

727
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,454
What do you care
if I faked a lab test,

728
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,331
if it saves
a few thousand lives?

729
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,500
I did what I had to do.

730
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,211
Isn't that what
you hired us for?

731
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,760
Which is why
I'm not gonna fire you.

732
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,554
You're gonna quit.

733
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,891
Go on, get out of here.

734
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,275
So, you're just gonna
let him go?

735
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,568
Absolutely.

736
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,572
And I'm gonna let him get as far away
as possible before you call the cops.

737
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:51,117
Guy's a nut job.

738
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:54,286
Who the hell
did I leave in charge?

739
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,538
Foreman.

740
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:59,208
There was a reason for that.
Next time, listen to him.

741
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:13,222
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.

742
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,099
Okay-

743
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:17,059
By the way,
one of my employees...

744
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,936
Either you're gonna have to
get someone from the CIA

745
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,396
to call and confirm your story,

746
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:24,608
or you're doing eight clinic hours
and Wilson is doing 16.

747
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,574
I was in the Hamptons.

748
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:36,912
I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk
treat his son's sniffles.

749
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,331
Fascinating as that sounds.

750
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,838
For your honesty,
I will forgive your hours.

751
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,465
Thank you.

752
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:52,887
No!

753
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,141
The only thing less likely
than you helping the CIA

754
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,810
is you helping some rich guy
in Long Island.

755
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,438
You're doing your hours
and Wilson's.

756
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,565
I know how to
kill a man with my thumb.

757
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,233
Who doesn't?

758
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,036
Hi.

759
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,412
Hi.

760
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,838
I'm gonna take
you up on your offer.

761
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,215
Yeah?

762
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:36,096
Well, I live a couple
of miles from here.

763
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:39,350
That's not the offer I meant.

764
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,229
I gave notice today.

765
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,273
You said you were happy
at the company.

766
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:47,650
I lied.

767
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,361
Doubt you'll
hold it against me.

768
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,994
I'll see you at 9:00 on Monday.
