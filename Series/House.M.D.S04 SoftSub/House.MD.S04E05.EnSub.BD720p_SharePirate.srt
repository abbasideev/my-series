1
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:10,762
Grandma's got some cash.
We could steal that.

2
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:13,723
What kind of creep are you?

3
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,476
We steal from strangers.

4
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,395
Hey, Grandma's not
gonna call the cops.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,771
Look.

6
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,774
Either you start doing this,
or you get a job.

7
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:27,862
That guy.

8
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:33,326
You're gonna remember that guy
for the rest of your life.

9
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,213
Hey. How you doing?

10
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:51,386
I said...
Hey, give me all your cash!

11
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:55,515
Why?

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,644
You want to buy yourself a pretty dress,
you little bitch?

13
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,648
- He ain't kidding, man.
- Where's your wallet?

14
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:07,485
On your sister's nightstand.
I forgot it after I paid her.

15
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,168
- Whoa, Tony...
- You want to die tonight?

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,782
I said where's your wallet?

17
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:16,953
I think he's sick.
Maybe you shouldn't.

18
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,037
He's faking.

19
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:21,249
Look, go in his pockets.
Grab his wallet.

20
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,840
Good. Let's go.

21
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,052
You all right, man?

22
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,472
He's fine. He's faking it.

23
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,938
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at Maple and Fourth.

24
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:47,108
There's a really sick guy.
I think he got mugged.

25
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,736
- What?
- Are you happy? Let's go!

26
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:31,736
Today, we're hunting for
the cat burglar of diseases.

27
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,198
Causes a healthy man's lungs to fail,
but leaves no fingerprints.

28
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,075
Respiratory distress,
could be asthma.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,451
No hyperinflation on the x-ray.

30
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,954
Food allergy. Could have eaten
shellfish or peanuts.

31
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,206
No hives.
No erythema on the skin.

32
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,333
Pulmonary embolism.

33
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,961
Embolisms don't
magically dissolve.

34
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,128
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,463
Laryngospasm..

36
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,340
Frosty fall air
hits his vocal cords,

37
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,134
they spasm shut, choke him out.

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,971
Good idea. You've been
tremendously helpful.

39
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,305
- You can leave.
- I just hired him.

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,099
Well, I fired him. To infinity.

41
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:02,912
You didn't tell him
I was coming back?

42
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,519
She did. I said no.

43
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,689
When your extended
job interview slash reality TV show

44
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:08,857
killed a patient,

45
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,859
you lost your veto power.

46
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,944
Everybody,
this is Dr. Foreman. He will...

47
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,905
Does this mean
there's one less slot for us?

48
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,119
It's still
Dr. House's department.

49
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,413
He decides who stays,
who goes...

50
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,414
Foreman goes.

51
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,835
But Dr. Foreman
will be my eyes and ears.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,546
You do nothing
without his knowledge.

53
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,591
Oh!

54
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,050
Just in case I need them

55
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,554
where exactly will Dr. Foreman
be keeping my balls?

56
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,809
If you wanna keep your jobs,
that never happened.

57
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,937
The only way to get the cat burglar is
to catch him in the act.

58
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,898
Give the patient
a methacholine challenge.

59
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,649
See if it sets off
laryngospasm.

60
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,095
You want us to
stop his breathing?

61
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,694
Well, only until
you can figure out why.

62
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,530
After that,
it would be irresponsible.

63
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,578
You and I should talk.

64
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:05,830
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:06,831
She didn't have
to do that publicly.

66
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,041
Yes, she did.

67
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,128
She had to establish her dominance
in front of them. Limit my power.

68
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,047
There's nothing we can do.

69
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,008
Well, that's not
the never-say-never Dr. Foreman I know.

70
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,092
There's lots we can do.

71
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,218
Not really, Cuddy...

72
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,971
I can make you miserable.

73
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,264
That's true.

74
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,808
Until you quit. Again.

75
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,535
So, why don't we just
skip the middleman?

76
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,728
I'm not quitting.

77
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:33,650
My God. Not everything's about you and
your little job and your little world.

78
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,027
This is about restoring
order in the universe.

79
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:37,153
I'm not quitting.

80
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,864
You're gonna be miserable.

81
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,991
I already am miserable.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,042
Cuddy obviously thinks
we're idiots.

83
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,044
She's not gonna let
House hire any one of us.

84
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,464
Tidal volume's holding at 1.2 liters.
Increase the dose.

85
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,966
So, which master do we serve?

86
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,851
Whose ass
do we have to kiss to get this job?

87
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,011
You really want
this job so bad?

88
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,097
How about you
try doing this job?

89
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:07,058
Double the dose
to 16 milligrams per milliliter.

90
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,395
My foot's tingling.

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,896
Is that normal?

92
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,898
No. What exactly does it...

93
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,234
And my stomach's killing me.

94
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,778
Could this test
cause that stuff?

95
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:19,988
No.

96
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:24,993
Test was a bust.

97
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,953
Amber has moved
down to even money.

98
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,663
We found two new symptoms.

99
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,456
Yep. Back to two to one.

100
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,542
- What's going on?
- You're the favorite.

101
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,669
- House's?
- To get fired.

102
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:39,048
You can bet against yourself.
Lovely parting gift.

103
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,050
- What's the limit?
- Isn't one.

104
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,468
Five hundred on Kutner.

105
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,345
A thousand on Amber.

106
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,180
Do you take checks?

107
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,390
No.

108
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:55,106
How do we connect abdominal pain and
numbness in the extremities

109
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,274
with respiratory collapse?

110
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,443
Dissecting aortic aneurysm.

111
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,987
Doesn't cover all three.
What else?

112
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,158
Carry on. He's the boss.

113
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,999
What about
a spinal cord lesion?

114
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,042
Would have to be
in the brain stem.

115
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,528
It still doesn't
explain the lungs.

116
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,503
Weird, though.

117
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,047
That he's the boss.

118
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,799
Didn't he quit recently?
Was it a money issue?

119
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,468
Lungs, stomach, numbness...

120
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,011
No, that wasn't it.

121
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,597
It was something else.

122
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,350
Was it bling account? Med plan didn't
cover tattoo removal?

123
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,061
We have to unify
these symptoms.

124
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,563
I remember.

125
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,565
You didn't want to
turn into me. Right?

126
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,400
You didn't want to become evil.

127
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,152
Can we stick to
the medicine, here?

128
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,320
Absolutely.

129
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,988
I'm just flattered.

130
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:48,993
In a few short weeks, seems like I've
just turned towards the light.

131
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,620
Either that,
or you sold your soul.

132
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,038
Multiple marantic
emboli could...

133
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,207
Did you get a raise?

134
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:55,666
Because then you're a whore.

135
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,544
Or didn't you?
Because then, you're a stupid whore.

136
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,006
Patient just crashed.

137
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,260
Can they go, boss?

138
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,104
- You're right.
- But?

139
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,732
No but.
You're right about all of it.

140
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,178
Then, I'll see you
at the reunion.

141
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,112
Seems I didn't get out
of here soon enough.

142
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:28,658
The world thinks I've been corrupted,
so no one will hire me.

143
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:33,704
I hate being here.
I'd love to quit, but I can't.

144
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,262
He's got a pulse.

145
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:50,596
Must be another
respiratory collapse.

146
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,140
Means this is our chance
to prove laryngospasm.

147
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,142
- We need to tube him and bag him.
- We will. Right after we...

148
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,768
If we just let him die,
it doesn't matter what he has.

149
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,770
Brennan, tilt his head
back so I can get a straight shot.

150
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,816
Okay. While you're killing him,
I'll get the intubation kit.

151
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:09,073
I decided you're right. You're obviously
in an impossible position.

152
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,950
There's no point
in me humiliating you.

153
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,076
Thanks.

154
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,703
So, I'm gonna humiliate Cuddy.

155
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,163
Until she fires you.

156
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,249
Guy's faking.
It's Munchausen's.

157
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,459
You notice the EMT run sheet?

158
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,379
Paramedic who brought him
in is also named Martin Harris.

159
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,678
If the name was
Attila Von Wienerschnitzel,

160
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,762
I'd say you might be
onto something.

161
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,265
Look, room 406, abdominal pain,

162
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,894
room 403,
left-sided numbness, 402, syncope.

163
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,647
He's copying his
neighbors' symptoms.

164
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,402
- No.
- Yeah.

165
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,113
Coincidence is much more
likely than you being a stubborn jerk.

166
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,657
Munchausen's patients
create symptoms, not names.

167
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,201
Munchausen's patients
have medical histories

168
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,703
they don't want us reading.

169
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:56,954
No laryngeal spasm.

170
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,248
Breathing's resumed
normal rate, without intubation.

171
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,209
You see?
Nothing's wrong with him.

172
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,044
He's in a lab coat.

173
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,882
Munchausens pretend
to be patients, not doctors.

174
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,844
He's got Mirror Syndrome.

175
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,471
Giovannini's?

176
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,641
Do you know another
Mirror Syndrome?

177
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,102
Brain's got no idea
who he is, where he is, what he is,

178
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,939
so it fills the holes
with whatever dirt's lying around.

179
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,191
He reads a name tag,
he's got a name.

180
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,402
Sees a doctor, he's got a job.
Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.

181
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,987
My explanation's simpler.

182
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,657
Well, if it's simple,
then we discharge the nutbar,

183
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:35,952
but if it's complicated,
then the nutbar has got brain damage.

184
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,746
So, we let him jerk them around
for a few days till we're sure?

185
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,332
No. We let him jerk you around.

186
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,044
There's a faster way.

187
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,926
Mind if we play through?

188
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,137
Sure. What could
possibly go wrong?

189
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,682
What's going on here, Martin?

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,310
- Operation?
- House?

191
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,478
Who is this guy?

192
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,272
Excellent question.

193
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,315
Who are you, Martin?

194
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,322
He just likes to
watch and do stuff.

195
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,159
Number 10 scalpel
for initial incision.

196
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,622
Glad you're here, House.

197
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,499
Of course you are.

198
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,458
It's lecture time.

199
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,835
Yeah. It is.

200
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,629
Stop worrying
about the power play.

201
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:33,009
Was that it? I think you can go
a lot deeper, here.

202
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,803
I mean, why am I so obsessed
by all of this?

203
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,931
You're threatened by Foreman
and feel the need to impress Cuddy.

204
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,017
The only thing that's relevant
is Foreman is a good doctor.

205
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,226
He can help you.

206
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,186
- Lighten the load.
- Good idea.

207
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,522
I'll have him sort my mail.

208
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,774
Sure.

209
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,027
Deflect.

210
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,739
Who is this guy?

211
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:55,948
I think we just found out.

212
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,576
It's all about Cuddy.

213
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,037
You've got to be the alpha dog.

214
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,789
You can almost smell
the pheromones now, huh?

215
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,708
I like him.

216
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,255
- Told you I didn't need you.
- House!

217
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,929
House, what is going on?

218
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:22,850
Ow!

219
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:28,856
Your blood's turned to sludge.

220
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,567
If we don't heat you up,
you're gonna die.

221
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,235
Can't fake that!

222
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:42,161
Mirror Syndrome patients
have no agenda, no ax to grind.

223
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,996
They can read you
because they have to.

224
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,708
Moods, attitudes, everything.
They're like mind readers.

225
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,073
Except they can read your mind.

226
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:49,919
Where are we going?

227
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,504
Unfortunately,
we have to cure him.

228
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,172
His hand wasn't black
when he came in.

229
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,757
The operating room was sterile.

230
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,385
Only thing different was the
temperature. Cold agglutinins means...

231
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,950
It's gotta be some
kind of infection.

232
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,180
No fever, so it's gotta
be a tiny infection, hard to find.

233
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,556
And you better find it fast.

234
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:07,645
This guy feels another cool breeze, his
blood turns to slop and he drops.

235
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,064
I need three ways
to pinpoint infection.

236
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,065
Blood cultures.

237
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,942
Blood's clumpy.
Nothing you can do with it.

238
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,403
Unless we soak him
in warm water before we draw it.

239
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,071
Good. What else?

240
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,948
Ultrasound his abdomen.
Look for an abscess.

241
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,575
Good. Ladies and gentlemen?

242
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,828
I have a regrettable
announcement.

243
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:24,995
Kitchen has just learned

244
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,832
that our annual shipment
of mayonnaise was improperly stored,

245
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,960
so anybody who ate,
well, the food

246
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,462
should head across
the lobby to the clinic right away.

247
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,089
Ask for Dr. Cuddy.

248
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,260
You're not punishing Cuddy. You're
punishing every doctor in the building.

249
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,929
It's her building.
Her doctors. Still need one more.

250
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,013
Well, we need to
find out his history.

251
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,379
Where he's been,
what he's done.

252
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,768
Yeah. He has no memory,
but his bio's tattooed to his rear?

253
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,813
The mayo is fine. You can stay
where you are. I'm a doctor.

254
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:55,192
Mail order. I've seen the diploma.
There's two N's in University.

255
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,404
Big Love was right.
History is the key.

256
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:03,617
No ID, no wallet, no missing person's
report filed for 100 miles...

257
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,077
The key is the key.

258
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,202
He had car keys in his pocket
when he was admitted.

259
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,488
Keep him in the isolation room

260
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,667
so he doesn't pick up Extreme Bitch
Syndrome from one of the nurses.

261
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,085
Run the ultrasound
and the blood cultures.

262
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,628
The cultures were my idea.

263
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,006
No one's keeping score.

264
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,048
You're losing.

265
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,302
Search the street where he was mugged.
Find the car and the registration.

266
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,471
There could be
thousands of cars.

267
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,763
Hey, why do
I get this assignment?

268
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,474
Because,
if you deal with the patient,

269
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,935
he's gonna wind up singing Osmond songs
and proposing to five nurses at once.

270
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,937
I'll go with Cole.

271
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:32,938
Ooh!

272
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,191
We have a love connection.

273
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,820
Make a fist.

274
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,907
Little pinch.

275
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,993
Wow. That's a strong pinch.

276
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,663
This thing works.
You're lucky you've got me.

277
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,125
My colleague
wanted to cook you in boiling water.

278
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,216
That's right, baby.
My blood's that good.

279
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,472
That's supposed to
be me, right?

280
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,640
No.

281
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,642
That's me.
I'm always right. Gotta be.

282
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,265
I don't think I'm always...

283
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,190
If they don't like you, you've gotta be
right, or you're not worth anything.

284
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:24,657
Infections can hide
deep beneath the skin.

285
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,700
This will find them.

286
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,744
Who was that last doctor?

287
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,957
Dr. Amber Volakis.

288
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,042
Don't really need her name.

289
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,632
Wait. You saying that you...

290
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,885
I want her?

291
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,930
Don't know what you want.
Don't care what you want.

292
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,265
I'm married.

293
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,933
So am I.

294
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:56,063
Even if I wasn't, she's a little
too aggressive for me.

295
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,440
Hey.

296
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:01,277
Aggressive is
never a bad thing.

297
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,156
Yeah. True.

298
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,457
I'm done.

299
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,751
You Okay?

300
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:18,877
Yeah.

301
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,672
We've gotta run
some more tests.

302
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,092
You can clean yourself up.

303
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,263
Lesion on the liver.

304
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,307
- Cystic or solid?
- Solid.

305
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,851
Well, you certainly
did the right thing by coming to me.

306
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,020
Yes.
I needed a smug oncologist to...

307
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,563
An authoritative oncologist.

308
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,607
I hate you. Tell me why.

309
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,776
I've been scanning literature.
Very interesting study in Sweden.

310
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,614
Apparently, Giovannini's patients mimic
whoever they think's in charge.

311
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,908
Any country with that low an age of
consent and that high a rate of suicide

312
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,368
isn't thinking straight.

313
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,954
I am in charge
of our relationship.

314
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,999
It was a surgery. You were the surgeon.
In that setting...

315
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,627
You would pick up my laundry
if I asked you to.

316
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:00,794
Go ahead. Ask.

317
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,088
I wouldn't do that to you.

318
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,146
I want all my personal
private doctors back right now!

319
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,814
Except for Foreman.

320
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,816
Your team, Foreman included,

321
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,779
is dealing with
the Great Mayonnaise Panic of 2007.

322
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,824
Frankly, I'm worried it might spread
to other continents.

323
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,831
Lesion on the liver.
Possibility.

324
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,876
Why are you doing a pelvic
for food poisoning?

325
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,045
She said her hoo-hoo burned.

326
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,259
Lesion on the liver. Ideas?

327
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,303
Start with a biopsy
to rule out cancer.

328
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,388
Could be an abscess.

329
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,806
Needle works for that, too.

330
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,974
Well, unless it's
a vascular hemangioma.

331
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,893
Aspirate that,
and he'll bleed out, we'll kill him.

332
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,437
If he bleeds out,
we know what he had.

333
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,314
Had?

334
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,024
Two diagnoses out
of three, he lives.

335
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,901
We do nothing,
three out of three he dies.

336
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:06,860
Go stick his liver.

337
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,145
Where's Foreman? We should...

338
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,364
You need him
to draft your letter of resignation?

339
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,529
You risking our patient's life
to get back at Cuddy?

340
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,077
What? No. That would
be childish.

341
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,079
This is what I'm doing
to get back at Cuddy.

342
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,374
Who here doesn't
have any health insurance?

343
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,793
Michael Moore was right.

344
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:27,923
MRis, PET scans, neuropsych tests,
private rooms for all these patients.

345
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,341
Fight the power!

346
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,807
Sorry. I missed.

347
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,810
I have to reposition
the needle.

348
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,438
You're gonna feel
another pinch.

349
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,065
You still with me?

350
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,525
I'm here.

351
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,861
You feeling faint?

352
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:49,987
No.

353
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,238
What's wrong?

354
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,823
It's personal.

355
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,827
You got personal problems?
You got no memory.

356
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:01,832
I'm in a hospital. I don't want
to be in a hospital.

357
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,839
You're sick, so...

358
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,007
I'm bored.

359
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,264
You ask what's wrong,
then you ignore the answer.

360
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,892
Just go on
with what you're doing.

361
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,937
You think everything's okay

362
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,691
as long as you don't think about it,
don't deal with it.

363
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,030
Is that blood?

364
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,115
I think it's pus from a fungus.

365
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,992
I have fungus in me?

366
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,870
If you've been in the tropics
in the last few months.

367
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,289
I saw this in
tsunami survivors.

368
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,542
Their skin grafts would ooze black pus
sometimes weeks later.

369
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:49,254
Traced the fungus back to the sand
in the tsunami tides.

370
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,965
That's so cool.

371
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,221
I think the black pus is fungal.

372
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,973
If I'm right, that's where
the cold agglutinins are coming from.

373
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,100
That's what's driving
his memory loss.

374
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,854
Amber's putting
him on amphotericin. It will cure him.

375
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,106
This makes no sense.

376
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,484
I'm doing blood tests to be sure,
but the sooner we get him on...

377
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,736
I'm not talking
about the infection.

378
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,574
I'm talking about you letting Tonya
Harding administer the treatment.

379
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,618
- I'm out of the game.
- Why?

380
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,787
A couple of weeks ago,
you named me Grumpy.

381
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,840
Said I didn't want to be here,
wanted to be back in the third world...

382
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,625
And you realized
I'm right just now?

383
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,669
I got a confirmation.

384
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,337
The patient's nuts.

385
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:33,590
The patient's unbiased.

386
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,969
- The patient has no ax to grind.
- The patient is nuts.

387
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,720
I miss my old life.

388
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,181
Helping people
who barely have clean water,

389
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,892
let alone the kind
of medicines we waste by the SUV-load.

390
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:49,022
You're nuts. You're gonna be miserable
at home, at work, somewhere.

391
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,733
The goal in life
is not to eliminate misery.

392
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,652
It's to keep misery
to the minimum.

393
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,737
Now, that's inspiring.

394
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,448
You said you came back
to get married.

395
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,741
What does your fiancée do?

396
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,326
She's a court reporter.

397
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,705
Uh-huh. Well, I'm sure
Thailand will have courts any day, now.

398
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,836
Someone's gonna be
miserable sometime. Accept it.

399
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,213
That's how I stay so happy.

400
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,925
Why do you care if I stay?

401
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,385
You're good.

402
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,014
Don't screw it up
just because you're miserable.

403
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,730
I'm gonna stay
until the patient's cured,

404
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,984
which should be
in about an hour.

405
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,868
- You okay?
- Not okay.

406
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,453
Which one of us
is he mirroring?

407
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,916
Well, if it was you, he'd be inflicting
pain on someone else, so...

408
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,336
I'd say he's mimicking
whichever one of us happens to be dying.

409
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,885
The heating blanket wasn't
keeping him warm enough.

410
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,179
Ordered a whirlpool,
got his blood flowing.

411
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,972
So far, it's keeping
his rash at bay.

412
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,309
Rash worse equals
cold agglutinins worse.

413
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,853
Means what was in
his liver wasn't fungus.

414
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,396
Yeah. Labs confirmed...

415
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:12,523
That it wasn't even pus.

416
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,359
It was just coagulated
blood caused by the cold agglutinins.

417
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:20,072
Which you mistook for a cool fungus
that you saw after the tsunami.

418
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,240
- Same consistency as...
- You saw what you wanted to see.

419
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,951
Not what was there.

420
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,578
Wait a second. Didn't you quit?

421
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,039
I spoke to my fiancée.
I'm staying.

422
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,666
Of course you are.

423
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,460
Because you're the exact
right amount of miserable.

424
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,171
Broad spectrum antibiotics
aren't working.

425
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,048
It's got to be viral
or exotic bacteria.

426
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,883
There are
a thousand microbes it could be.

427
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,128
We could repeat all cultures.
Maybe we just missed it.

428
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,805
Or we could get
an accurate history.

429
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,023
We're working on it.

430
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,026
Well, that'll be good
solace to the Widow X.

431
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,911
His car was towed,
and the tow gate's locked.

432
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,029
Guys must be out on a run.

433
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,447
<i>That's why I sent two of you.</i>

434
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,117
One of you breaks in,
the other posts bail.

435
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,160
Getting arrested
is not what I'm worried about.

436
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,747
Not a problem.
You know how to kill dogs, right?

437
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,505
So, we're back
to repeating all the cultures.

438
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,174
Or we get an accurate history.

439
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,900
Didn't we just rule
out that possibility?

440
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,804
You guys ever heard
any of my metaphors, yet?

441
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,434
Well, come on. Sit on Grandpa's lap as I
tell you how infections are criminals.

442
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,479
The immune system's the police.
Seriously. Grumpy, get up here.

443
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,148
It will make us both happy.

444
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,484
Anyway, cops don't
just let crooks run free.

445
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,611
They keep fingerprints,
mug shots.

446
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:45,157
The immune system does the same thing,
only it calls them antibodies.

447
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,451
We find out what diseases
he's had in his life,

448
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:51,079
good chance that'll tell us
where he's been in his life.

449
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,790
Alice.
Your turn through the looking glass.

450
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,000
I raw blood and ' F.

451
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,047
He)!' guys.

452
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,632
I haven't signed off on this.

453
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,315
You seem like a good guy,
Cuddy seems decent,

454
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,525
House doesn't.

455
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,445
It means either
you're gonna give in, or Cuddy is.

456
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,198
Either way, I'm sorry.

457
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,876
Your boyfriend
has me at even odds.

458
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,003
So talk to him.

459
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,006
I did. He said
he's just responding to market forces.

460
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,217
He is. I got 100 on you.

461
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,889
What do you care
what other people are betting on?

462
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,307
If he's trying to screw with me

463
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,976
'cause he's jealous Cuddy didn't ask him
to take this job...

464
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,143
Right. You're figuring
he's jealous of your misery.

465
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,021
He's messed up enough to...

466
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,273
The problem is
you're not miserable.

467
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,234
Then House has been
wasting a lot of time.

468
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,945
You've been humiliated.
Treated like crap.

469
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,988
You have every right
to be miserable, but you're not.

470
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:11,868
Because even though this job is insane,
and House is insane, you like it.

471
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,370
You always have.

472
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,539
You know what's worse
than a sanctimonious speech?

473
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,707
A sanctimonious speech
that's dead wrong.

474
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,334
See?

475
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,378
You belong with House.

476
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,634
We're gonna use your spinal fluid
to tell us where you lived.

477
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,802
Cool.

478
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:32,639
Not really. It's a poor substitute
for an actual history and without...

479
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,391
Nah. It's cool.

480
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,395
Yes. It is.

481
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,440
I need you to stay as still as possible.
Ignore the pain.

482
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,025
Bring the pain.

483
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,071
I'm not a masochist.

484
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,406
Neither am I.

485
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:54,244
I know. But I was responding
to you responding to...

486
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,871
Never mind.

487
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,875
I just like experience.
If it's new, it's interesting.

488
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,334
Yeah? Not me.

489
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,004
I don't just like new,
I gotta have new.

490
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,131
If it's not there,
I make it there.

491
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,966
Really, I'm just easily bored.

492
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,844
There are 300 million
people in this country.

493
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,929
If I'm doing exactly
what everyone else is doing,

494
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,306
then who the hell am I?

495
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,308
You know what I mean?

496
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,602
We're just about finished.

497
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,312
I like hot tubs.

498
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:23,440
They're nice.

499
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:30,739
You don't knock?

500
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,284
Are you putting
K-Y jelly on his phone receiver?

501
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,077
An exploding
snake in his drawer?

502
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,412
No.

503
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,625
I'm replacing
his Vicodin stash with laxatives.

504
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,961
- Don't. Don't stoop to his level.
- Why?

505
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:48,173
Because he's suddenly
gonna realize he's no longer 14?

506
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,883
Either I take
his garbage forever,

507
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,509
or I give him a reason to stop.

508
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:56,223
You don't have to make him miserable.
Just make him think that he's won.

509
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:57,724
I'm not gonna fire Foreman.

510
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,018
I said think he's won.

511
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,605
Find some other way to soothe his ego.
The thing's big enough.

512
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,942
You must be able to find
some corner to polish.

513
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,779
Where were you two hours ago?

514
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,907
Where were you?

515
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,998
- What do you have?
- High titres to histoplasmosis.

516
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,833
Probably lived in
the Ohio River Valley.

517
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,087
Also weakly positive
on Coccidiomycosis.

518
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,381
Weak means older.

519
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,217
Means he moved to Ohio
from the San Joaquin Valley.

520
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,052
Or he happened
to visit California.

521
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,804
He's also positive
for Chagas Disease.

522
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,347
Central America.

523
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,349
Or he kissed his maid from El Salvador.

524
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,811
Or he sat next to someone from Belize
on a flight to Weehawken.

525
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,313
- Or he ate lettuce from Honduras.
- Yes.

526
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,983
You're right, buzzkill.
This tells us next to nothing.

527
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,861
But since that's on the something side
of nothing, I thought we'd go with it.

528
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,946
His rash is back.

529
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,074
The hot tub isn't hot enough
to keep his body warm.

530
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,035
So, we take his body out of the picture.
Let's hit him from the inside.

531
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,954
Lipopolysaccharide.

532
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,006
LPS won't just
give him a fever.

533
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,049
He could hit 110.
Fry his brain.

534
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,052
Or make him just toasty enough
to keep his blood flowing free,

535
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,721
like my bowels.

536
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,306
You smell that?

537
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,266
It's not gonna get sweeter.

538
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,768
You nailed Brennan for seeing
what he wanted to see.

539
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,062
- You're no different.
- But you are.

540
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,605
You used to like this stuff.

541
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,942
You left here because you didn't like
what you were turning into.

542
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:31,901
Do you like who you are, now?

543
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,820
Do you like being
Cuddy's errand boy?

544
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,158
That was just a courtesy flush.
I'm not actually done.

545
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,247
- You want to induce a fever?
- Well, unless you're willing

546
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,791
to don a white T-shirt
and hop into the hot tub with him,

547
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,169
I need another way
to keep him warm or he dies.

548
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,463
- You could maim him.
- I could cure him.

549
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,628
I'm not letting you do it.

550
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,632
You gonna fire me?

551
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,885
No.

552
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,515
Wait a second.
What the hell was that?

553
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,643
You were won over
by my soaring rhetoric?

554
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,938
I basically just
threatened to hold my breath.

555
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,860
You never intended to stop me.

556
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,570
You just pretended to stop me,

557
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,530
so you could pretend
to fail to stop me,

558
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,991
so you could stroke my ego.

559
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,828
War doesn't end
until Foreman's gone.

560
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,663
Foreman's not going anywhere.

561
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:26,956
And

562
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,250
I know when my Vicodin
isn't Vicodin.

563
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:33,963
Do you know when your birth control
pills aren't birth control pills?

564
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,552
If we can keep your fever up,
we can get you back on dry land.

565
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,346
You feeling okay?

566
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,099
Surprisingly, yeah.

567
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,476
I feel pretty good.

568
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,396
That's not the way
fevers usually work.

569
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:54,609
Nothing around here
works the way it's supposed to work.

570
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,902
No kidding.

571
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,404
You're giving me a fever.

572
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,949
Doctors don't
give people fevers.

573
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,159
It was necessary
to keep your blood flowing.

574
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,577
Yeah.

575
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:07,747
It was necessary.

576
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,001
And that was all that mattered.

577
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,506
It's exciting, isn't it?

578
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,800
You're happy?

579
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,429
Why wouldn't I be?

580
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,268
Whoa. Hey. Hey. You with me?

581
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,521
I need help in here!

582
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,941
- V-fib. We've got to shock him.
- Get him out of the water.

583
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,067
How long's he been out?

584
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,236
Just a few seconds.

585
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,119
- He's dry enough.
- Not yet.

586
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,203
- Dry faster.
- Ten more seconds.

587
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,621
- He'll get brain damage.
- He needs...

588
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,081
- Kutner, you...
- Wait!

589
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,250
He's dry enough. Clear.

590
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,382
It worked.

591
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,260
For one of them.

592
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,976
Cardiac arrest. We were able to
shock him back to normal sinus rhythm.

593
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,686
And Kutner nearly into a coma.

594
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:17,942
So, now, you've electrocuted yourself
and set a patient on fire.

595
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,777
- I like the dedication.
- Thank you.

596
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,504
- It wasn't a compliment.
- Yeah, it was.

597
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,990
The insult comes now.
You're insane!

598
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,411
You either have an aversion to towels,
or you want pain. I think both.

599
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,038
I'm thinking it goes back
to high school gym.

600
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,706
Anybody think we should discuss

601
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,958
which infection is causing
the cold agglutinins

602
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,419
before they stop
his heart again?

603
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,962
Sure. Why not?

604
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:43,009
Until they find his car
we have to assume he's traveled

605
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,721
to Ohio, California, Central America
and possibly Weehawken.

606
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,431
- Nothing on the blood cultures.
- Do them again.

607
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,308
Quadruple run time.

608
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,270
We know the infection
is in his heart. We do a biopsy.

609
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,023
If we see polys, we've got bacterial.
Lymphs, we've got viral.

610
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,985
He just had a heart attack.
Ripping out a piece might kill him.

611
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,612
Yeah.

612
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,323
We biopsy his toe instead.

613
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:08,201
No. That's a terrible idea.

614
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:12,497
Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his
heart. Come on. I'll join you.

615
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,463
I got you a job.

616
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,424
Mount Zion Hospital in Boston.

617
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,511
They have a great
diagnostics department.

618
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,597
Gilchrist said
he'd take you, anyway.

619
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,934
That was very nice of you.

620
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,104
Oh, God.
Does everything have to be about you?

621
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,647
It's simple math.

622
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,482
I'm not gonna back down,
you're not gonna back down,

623
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,986
Cuddy's not gonna back down,
and no one's gonna be happy here.

624
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,489
- And Cuddy's gonna end up pregnant.
- What?

625
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:47,657
It doesn't matter.

626
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:48,825
Are you saying...

627
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,411
- What is you having sex with...
- Starts Monday.

628
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,538
I could help you pack.

629
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,542
I don't want the job.

630
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,171
Why not? You're miserable.

631
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,965
Apparently not.

632
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,967
Well, you're gonna be.

633
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,387
Are you smiling?

634
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,555
No.

635
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,434
Do your own stupid biopsy.

636
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,196
His name's Robert Elliot.
He's from Hamilton, Ohio.

637
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:31,159
Here's everything
he had in his trunk and his glove box.

638
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,832
No need for the heart biopsy.

639
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:41,753
I now know exactly
who he is and what he has.

640
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,338
- You saved his life.
- Really?

641
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:47,216
No, you idiot. It's VapoRub
and lunch receipts.

642
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,677
We have his name. We could find his
doctor, get his medical records...

643
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,348
It's 8:00 at night.
The biopsy will be faster.

644
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,185
Not fast enough to save him,
but that's hardly the point.

645
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,313
Thirteen.

646
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,734
Is your name Thirteen?

647
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,738
Why did you volunteer
to go streetwalking?

648
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:10,239
I thought I could
help that way.

649
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,700
A black Mormon
could help that way.

650
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,161
There's no reason
for you to want to be there.

651
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:18,164
Which means there's a reason
you didn't want to be here.

652
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,750
Didn't want to look
in the mirror?

653
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:35,515
Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you
to iron her shirts.

654
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,266
We'll take over.

655
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,353
Go ahead.

656
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,154
Talk to him.

657
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,908
You might feel a little tug
when the catheter's in the heart.

658
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,328
Come on.
Make him feel comfortable.

659
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,081
I've done this procedure
dozens of times. It's completely...

660
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,624
My God.

661
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,378
You are incredibly hot.

662
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,548
I'm not here. Deal with her.

663
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:11,050
Are you an idiot?

664
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,719
Do you not think she's hot?

665
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,930
I'm not the alpha here.
She is. She's my boss.

666
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,851
The rash is back.

667
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,688
Increase the drip.

668
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:27,066
If you think that's
the right thing to do.

669
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,319
This is so frustrating.

670
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,781
I don't think that's me.

671
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,873
Hey.

672
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,291
Get in there.
See how he's doing.

673
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,042
You were just in there.

674
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,712
Apparently, it's impossible
to see anything else when I'm in there.

675
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,590
I'm a blinding
white hot light of power.

676
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,428
Got it. Pink. Good size.

677
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,096
Nice specimen.

678
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,431
I'm scared.

679
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,602
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

680
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,396
No.

681
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:08,816
No, it's not.

682
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,404
I'm not interested
in how he's doing.

683
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,114
I'm interested in
how she's doing.

684
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,492
So, get in there and
tell me how he's doing.

685
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,077
You think he'll mimic her
if I'm in there with her?

686
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,830
You're a powerful,
dominating man, but who knows?

687
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,791
- So, I'm gonna get fired before her?
- Yes.

688
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,085
You're gonna get fired right now
unless you get in there...

689
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,046
Nothing on the biopsy.

690
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,631
And how is he?

691
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,882
His fever's at 106...

692
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,091
I know.

693
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:35,927
But how is he?

694
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,596
Bitter? Sexually frustrated?

695
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,056
He's delightful.

696
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:43,476
Loves the smell of freshly baked rhubarb
pie and isn't afraid to love.

697
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,019
Also, his rash is coming back.

698
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,022
He needs the meds and the tub.
Just to keep him stable.

699
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,273
Fine. Soak him again.

700
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,025
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.

701
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,027
No. You love hot tubs.

702
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,530
Find the rest of the gang. Tell them
to meet me at the lecture hall.

703
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,240
I hate hot tubs.

704
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,493
What did you say?

705
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,995
- I hate...
- He likes.

706
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,707
Who else was in there?

707
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,751
No one.

708
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,156
You didn't think
to mention that?

709
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:14,340
The guy likes warm, swirling water.
Didn't know that was diagnostic.

710
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,217
It's not.

711
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:20,221
What it is, is that water hit him,
and he had a thought.

712
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,515
Not about you, but about him.

713
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,853
We need to
splash him some more.

714
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,002
Do I know you?

715
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,840
You look familiar.

716
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,216
You, too.

717
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,094
My name's Robert Elliot.

718
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,639
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

719
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,559
Me, too.

720
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,438
What do you do?

721
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,065
Stuff.

722
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,275
Me, too.

723
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,282
What brings you to New Jersey?

724
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,367
Is it work or vacation?

725
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,499
Work.

726
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,253
What type of work?

727
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,632
I'm tired.

728
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,072
I eat out a lot.
A lot of restaurants.

729
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,577
The Knotty Pine,

730
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,206
Ritchies.

731
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,166
I know those places.

732
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,129
They're good, huh?

733
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,714
They're convenient.

734
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,049
For what?

735
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:22,134
They're on the road.

736
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,011
You on the road a lot?

737
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,180
No more than you, I suppose.

738
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,062
You ever use this stuff?

739
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,024
I use it all the time.

740
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,362
I use it all the time.

741
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,072
Yeah. I just said that.

742
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:49,453
You know, the cool thing about this
stuff is you can do a lot with it.

743
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:52,081
Soften your skin,
you can treat scrapes,

744
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,292
naughty stuff.

745
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,394
Why did you do that?

746
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,608
Because it doesn't
smell like dung.

747
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,157
You're saying
you like the smell?

748
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,451
Not really.

749
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,663
It just doesn't
smell like dung.

750
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,709
Something else does
smell like dung?

751
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,044
Yeah.

752
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,378
Dung.

753
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,594
You guys ready?

754
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:52,767
Now is the time that you stare
at me in slack-jawed amazement.

755
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,894
He sells farm equipment.

756
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,774
See? Pig lagoons. Pig farms.

757
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:04,195
And as every child knows, where you
have pigs, you have pig poo.

758
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,155
But as very few children know,

759
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,992
where you have pig poo,
you have eperythrozoon infection.

760
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,787
We'll start him
on clarithromycin.

761
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,998
This time tomorrow
he'll be back to his old self.

762
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,625
Whoever that might be.

763
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,293
It can wait.

764
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,003
He has a temperature of 107.

765
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,172
It can wait 15 minutes.

766
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,258
You know where Cuddy is?

767
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:32,014
Hi. I'm the Dean of Medicine.

768
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:35,684
Hi. I'm the guy
who saved your life.

769
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,603
So, what if it's House?

770
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,814
Then I take the job
at Mount Zion.

771
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,607
There is no job at Mount Zion.

772
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,443
- House said that...
- If House said it, it must be true.

773
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:48,155
I can fire him. I can fire him now.
I can fire him tomorrow.

774
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,907
- I don't even need a reason.
- She doesn't fire me.

775
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,534
She never will fire me.
Because she needs...

776
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:52,952
He's a good doctor, that's all.

777
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,620
I respect his expertise,
and I...

778
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,163
She's hot for me. Always...

779
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,415
Shut up!

780
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,920
Well, that could have
been either of us.

781
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,256
You have great yabos.

782
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,304
That still could have
been either of us.

783
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,933
You lose.

784
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:20,646
Seriously. I have always thought my
breasts were one of my best features.

785
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,731
Damn.

786
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,827
You all suck.

787
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:39,665
The two of you took
14 hours to find a car.

788
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:45,045
You forgot to mention
that a guy with no memory had memories.

789
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,341
If you keep on thinking
that insane guys have hidden wisdom,

790
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:52,887
you're gonna wind up
shooting people on a subway.

791
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:56,015
- Something.
- So,

792
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,435
which one of us sucks the most?

793
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,604
- It's a tie.
- Between?

794
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:02,855
All of you.

795
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,273
We're all fired?

796
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,358
None of you are fired.

797
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,204
That was nice of you.

798
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:20,372
Sure.

799
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,041
Why didn't you fire anyone?

800
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,043
- They're good doctors.
- Right.

801
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,420
Why didn't
you let Brennan quit?

802
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,546
He's a good doctor.

803
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,797
Right.

804
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,132
By not letting anyone go,

805
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:34,136
you made six people
happy and one person happy and rich.

806
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:40,226
Chase won every one of those bets. So
either you're just really nice or...

807
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,561
What's your cut?

808
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,647
Fifty percent.

809
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,899
How bad do you
want to keep your job?

810
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,026
I'll keep my mouth shut.

811
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,071
Hey.

812
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,116
You actually do
want to stay, don't you?

813
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:58,035
I think I do.

814
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,330
Every one of those idiots
got some insight about themselves

815
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,458
from the pig salesman, but not one
of them did anything about it.

816
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,670
People don't learn.
They don't change. But you did.

817
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,506
You're a freak.
