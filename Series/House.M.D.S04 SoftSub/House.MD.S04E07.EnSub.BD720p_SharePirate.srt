1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,547
We just arrived.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,384
Yeah. Kids okay on your end?

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,844
Good.

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,514
Yeah, yeah. He's very excited.

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,392
Hey, hey. Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.

6
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,726
Excuse me.

7
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,525
Get away. Get away.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,111
Sorry about that. Sorry.

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,239
What's wrong with him?

10
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,533
Excuse us.

11
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,697
I ought to go back
and kick the hell out of that guy.

12
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,538
She was old enough,
she didn't have to scream like that.

13
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,707
It's okay, Dad.
It didn't bother me.

14
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,376
For the first time,
none of these people bother me.

15
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,545
I just think, "36 more hours."

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,797
Thirty-six more hours?
How do you figure that, Kenny?

17
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:47,842
Tomorrow at this time,
I'm scheduled for surgery.

18
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:51,386
It's a 10-hour procedure,
throw two in there for prep,

19
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:54,472
thirty-six until
I'm just another face in the crowd.

20
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,383
Kenny has a frontonasal
encephalocele.

21
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,510
It's a midline deformity.

22
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,637
He's here to undergo
a facial bipartition.

23
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:35,972
And what does that mean?

24
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,433
Well, we have
five surgeons, four nurses.

25
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,727
He's going to require
six units of blood.

26
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:41,770
Will it fix him?

27
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,730
It'll repair a lot of
the damage done...

28
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:44,778
We need a sound bite.

29
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,859
Would you say,
"He'll be ready for the junior prom"?

30
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,236
Yeah, yeah.
That's probably true.

31
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,280
No, I mean,
I need you to say it.

32
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,490
<i>Dr. Chase,</i>

33
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,866
we got an issue.

34
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,827
Heart rate's skyrocketing,
he's over 180.

35
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,579
- He's in v-fib.
- Paddles!

36
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,830
Charge to 300.

37
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:01,915
Turn that camera off.

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,583
Is this a reaction
to anesthesia?

39
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,668
<i>Haven't given it yet.</i>

40
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,128
Clear!

41
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,756
Crank it to 360.

42
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,967
I said turn that
damn camera off! Clear!

43
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:50,672
A teenage boy with a cranial facial
deformity was about to undergo

44
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:55,468
a reconstructive procedure, when he had
an unexplained cardiac arrest.

45
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,845
Good.

46
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,055
Good?

47
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,724
I mean, go on.

48
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:06,354
We have the patient
on a pacing wire,

49
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,107
it's the only thing keeping
his heart going.

50
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,693
Yeah, we know. We're doctors.

51
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,379
Right, it was meant
to be just for them.

52
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,321
Just be yourself.

53
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:20,493
Until we are able to figure out exactly
what is causing the heart block,

54
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,788
the reconstructive surgery
is on hold, obviously.

55
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,416
That's "yourself"?

56
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,002
Fascinating case.

57
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,463
I will see you again
after I have saved his life.

58
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:34,757
Have a warm bath waiting.

59
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,388
Are you following me?

60
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,932
Darnell will be trailing you
throughout the case.

61
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,851
Pretend we're not here.

62
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,644
But if I do that,
won't I bump into you?

63
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,688
We'll stay out of your way.

64
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,648
No, it was a joke.

65
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,110
See, I became a doctor
because of the movie, Patch Adams.

66
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,072
Listen, do you wanna
get ahead of me and maybe back up,

67
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,825
I don't know, low down,
so I look more powerful?

68
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,619
That's perfect. Yeah?

69
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,413
Also, my eyes look
better in rooms with summer colors.

70
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,207
You know what?
It's black and white...

71
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,420
You think I like the cameras?

72
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:16,633
You think I want the whole world
watching you check out my ass

73
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,509
and question my wardrobe?

74
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:21,638
Would it be better if I checked out your
wardrobe and questioned your ass?

75
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:22,847
A little part of me...

76
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,265
There is no little part of you.

77
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,602
Thought that maybe
you would see

78
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,646
what great PR this could be
for the hospital

79
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,691
and not make me
force you to act like a human being.

80
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,486
You using force on me
is intriguing.

81
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,697
On the other hand,
cameras make people act.

82
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,783
Sometimes like human beings,
sometimes just weird,

83
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:44,577
sometimes they wear
open-tip bras.

84
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,746
It's cold in here.

85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,833
A less obvious point is that I need my
team to be unafraid

86
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,502
of the metaphorical fart.

87
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,463
That production company is covering
all the medical costs for this kid.

88
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,591
So either you let them
continue filming

89
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,636
or the kid goes home
with the same face.

90
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,019
Sorry about that. Private.

91
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,023
She waxes her moustache
once a month

92
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:18,403
and sometimes gets
some pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,124
So, did he hire you flat out or are you
competing for one of the spots?

94
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,625
I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,460
She's not competing.

96
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,755
She was handpicked by House.
She's safe, like Foreman.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,717
So that takes
three spots down to one.

98
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,640
- Where's Foreman?
- He's in the bathroom.

99
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,560
Good. Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

100
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,687
Walks look good on camera.

101
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,190
They give the illusion
of the story moving forward.

102
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,408
New patient.

103
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,995
Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree
infranodal heart block.

104
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,163
Post-arrest.

105
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,373
Any reports
of light-headedness or syncope?

106
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,738
Certainly not light-headedness.

107
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,959
Why did you hire her?

108
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,252
Not in front of the company.

109
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,754
Are we gonna be on TV?

110
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,963
I'm making a music video.

111
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,757
Come on. A little faster,
more energy.

112
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,759
Why are you glad
Foreman's not here?

113
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,595
Because he would object
to what I'm about to do.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,637
Oh!

115
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,518
Sorry.

116
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,439
Hey, buddy.

117
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:39,650
You stay in there, we'll be out here,
making sure he doesn't move again.

118
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,236
God! Finally
I hear myself think.

119
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,239
- Our patient has...
- Why did you hire her?

120
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,452
Because she has way
more diagnostic experience

121
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,954
than the other
swimsuit models I was considering.

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,334
Our patient has a frontonasal
encephalocele with a midline cleft.

123
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,547
Don't stare directly at it.

124
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,841
So what caused
"Big Head's" heart to stop?

125
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,635
Simple. His big head.

126
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,054
Increased intracranial pressure
would cause heart block.

127
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:12,058
Wrong. Sixteen years they've been
testing that insane noggin to death.

128
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,685
What about
a congenital heart defect?

129
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,251
He has a midline
anomaly on his head,

130
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:19,816
makes sense he'd have
a midline anomaly in his heart, too.

131
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,651
The 16 years of
testing didn't show?

132
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,070
Why did you bring her
in so late? It's not fair.

133
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,947
- The rest of us...
- Hey, hey, hey! You wanted fair,

134
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,574
you picked the wrong job,
the wrong profession,

135
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,867
the wrong species.

136
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:30,993
Forget the deformity.

137
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,788
Treat the patient like
he's any other really, really ugly kid.

138
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,873
Infection?
Could be endocarditis.

139
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,167
Well, since he doesn't have
a prosthetic heart valve,

140
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,545
I assume you're thinking
he's an IV drug user?

141
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,671
House said assume he's normal.

142
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,116
Dealers don't ask for ID
and don't care what you look like.

143
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,008
Nice. You're right
about the habit.

144
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:47,677
You're wrong about
the substance.

145
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:51,180
Blackened skin under the nose
equals frostbite from huffing Freon.

146
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,849
Freon's toxic,
it damages the heart.

147
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,476
Discoloration could
be acanthosis nigricans.

148
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,442
It's a common side effect
of these deformities.

149
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,730
There's also discoloration
on the cheeks and forehead.

150
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,065
Do a nuclear study.

151
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,652
If I'm right,
you'll see scarring of the heart.

152
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,702
I'm not part of
some game, am I?

153
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:16,497
I gave up a career
because I thought this was a firm offer.

154
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,457
Yes, this is a real offer.

155
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,924
I think she might be an idiot.

156
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,552
- Who?
- No, she can't be an idiot.

157
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,679
I mean, she was in the CIA,
for God's sake.

158
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,056
And the Bay of Pigs
was a daring triumph.

159
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,058
She had good ideas in Langley.

160
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,351
All your ideas.

161
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,770
She was able to identify
that they were good ideas.

162
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,439
Stab in the dark here,
is she pretty?

163
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,607
She's new.

164
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,012
- She's nervous.
- She's a C-cup.

165
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,735
She said one dumb thing
in a differential.

166
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,695
They all say dumb things
in differentials.

167
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,779
A D-cup?

168
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,323
If she's no good,
just fire her.

169
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,367
I can't. I just hired her.

170
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:55,828
She left a career.

171
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,706
Wow.

172
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,543
Either that's actual guilt,
or I have got to see this woman.

173
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,298
My son is not huffing Freon.

174
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:11,594
Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a
savant when it comes to diagnostics.

175
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:14,138
What's his genius theory?

176
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,892
Because Kenny's not normal,
he's doing drugs to deal with his pain?

177
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:21,896
Maybe the way to
look at this is that you are normal.

178
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,732
And what's that
supposed to mean?

179
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,403
You're like any other parent who thinks
his kid can't be doing drugs.

180
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,161
Doing this because
my dad thinks I'm on drugs?

181
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,406
I was doing drugs
behind my parent's back at your age,

182
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,832
and I had a lot
less reason to be.

183
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,919
Not that your life
must be miserable.

184
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:49,465
Not that I'm suggesting
that you should be doing drugs.

185
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,230
- How's school going?
- I'm home schooled.

186
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,552
Really? You're lucky.

187
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,346
Going to school was boring.

188
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,890
My dad took me out,
and it wasn't because it was boring.

189
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,976
I had a rough time
in school, too.

190
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:04,230
Maybe not like you, but, you know...
I don't mean to compare our situations.

191
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,858
Actually, I guess I am
comparing our situations,

192
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,695
but only to show you
how yours is worse.

193
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,864
You can edit that out, right,
so I don't look like an idiot?

194
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,076
Relax. Everyone acts like
an idiot around me.

195
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,620
Makes you think
it's not an act.

196
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,185
Can I have something
for my headache?

197
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,331
Yeah, is that new?

198
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,749
Sixteen years old.

199
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,043
Has the same birthday I do.

200
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,213
I'm gonna start the test now.

201
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,964
Study showed
no signs of scarring on Kenny's heart.

202
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,009
It wasn't drugs.

203
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,302
Well, then,
give me something better.

204
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,508
What's causing heart block?

205
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,971
It could be toxoplasmosis.

206
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,697
We should do an LP
to test for infection.

207
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,183
If it was toxoplasmosis,
we'd have seen enlarged lymphs,

208
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,470
and because you're not pretty enough to
be an idiot, you must know that already,

209
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,105
which means you just
said it because you want to do an LP

210
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,315
to look for
intracranial pressure.

211
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,840
Because it is
intracranial pressure.

212
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,276
Wait, I'm not done.

213
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,641
You thought
I wouldn't catch on,

214
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,696
which means you either think I'm
an idiot, which is flattering,

215
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,364
I've been doing
my hair differently...

216
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,783
The kid's got headaches. He's been
popping acetaminophen like peanuts.

217
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,535
How could you possibly
think that I was done?

218
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,746
I prefaced that with an "either."
It needs an "or."

219
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,706
Or, you are an idiot,

220
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,376
which is possible, I'm not great
at judging men's looks.

221
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,794
The OR?

222
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,796
And the MRI room.

223
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,382
Yes...

224
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,260
Dr. House frequently conducts

225
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,555
differential diagnoses
in a variety of places.

226
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,808
He feels that a change in venue

227
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,895
often leads to a change
in thinking processes.

228
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,859
I have to go take care
of something else.

229
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,694
Just let me do a CT scan,
see if I'm right.

230
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,019
The sooner we fix the problem,

231
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,906
the sooner we can get to
his reconstructive surgery.

232
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,575
Yeah. Who cares if you're dead?
It's how you look.

233
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,078
Well, since you've given me nothing
better, we're back to drugs.

234
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,288
The one thing we know it's not.

235
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,499
Decreased uptake
on the membranous septum.

236
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,125
Could be an artifact.
We can redo it, but...

237
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,795
Nothing's nothing.
Do an EP study.

238
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,132
EP study means
we have to stop this kid's heart.

239
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:58,094
I'll set it up.

240
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,056
House, do you have a minute
to be disemboweled?

241
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,093
I'm gonna thread this catheter

242
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,896
through different areas in your heart,

243
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:13,109
and once I've found the right pathway,
I'll apply some electrical energy.

244
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,902
It'll stop my heart?

245
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,363
It sounds
worse than it is. You'll be fine.

246
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,447
Is it gonna hurt?

247
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,324
There'll be some discomfort.

248
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,538
If you've done drugs,
I understand.

249
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,249
Being different's really hard.

250
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,633
Kenny, it's more important
for you to get better

251
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,511
than to worry about
getting in trouble.

252
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,139
If I did drugs,
that could explain my heart problem?

253
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,640
It could.

254
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,767
And then you could
do the surgery to fix my face?

255
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,644
That's why we're here.

256
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,483
You know how famous people,

257
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,654
everywhere they go
people are watching them, staring?

258
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,324
They never
have a chance to just be,

259
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,579
you know? And a lot of
them turn to drugs.

260
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,247
And people stare at them
because they're beautiful,

261
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,957
but, me they just stare...

262
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,793
You Okay?

263
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:16,755
I need to know what
kind of drugs, Kenny, and how much.

264
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,342
Coke, mostly. A lot of coke.

265
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:25,556
And then when I run out,
I usually go to LSD or acid.

266
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,767
Those are the same thing.

267
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,394
They are?

268
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,855
You don't do drugs, do you?

269
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,398
I drank from
my dad's liquor cabinet one time...

270
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,043
- We're not gonna do this test.
- No...

271
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,433
I need you to turn
on your side.

272
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,615
We need to intubate.
I need some help in here!

273
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,955
Too bad you guys
are going for a theatrical release.

274
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,208
Vomiting blood would have
made a great act-out.

275
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,459
Likely causes?

276
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,543
Mallory-Weiss tear.

277
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,212
No pallor, no melena.

278
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,963
Why are you wearing a tie?

279
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,841
I always wear ties,
I'm a doctor.

280
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,510
Please don't look
at the camera.

281
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:03,761
Sorry.

282
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,429
Nasal papilloma.

283
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,274
Hemorrhage could have
overwhelmed the heart.

284
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,599
Nice lipstick.

285
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:09,558
Thank you.

286
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,809
Bad idea.

287
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,895
The hemorrhage came
after the block.

288
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,397
House, let them do their job.

289
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,608
Is anybody here
more interested in the medicine,

290
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,610
a little less interested
in the paparazzi?

291
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,903
Upper GI bleed.

292
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,740
Could be something
he ate or drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.

293
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,617
Good.

294
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,912
Except no abdominal pain,
patient hasn't lost his appetite

295
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,997
and the last I checked,
the gastrointestinal tract

296
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,625
isn't connected to the heart.

297
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,669
Yeah, but other
than that, real good.

298
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,963
Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.

299
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,048
I just said
it wasn't a nasal tumor.

300
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,050
Stomach cancer.
Tumor causes bleeding,

301
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,719
body's reaction to the tumor causes
paraneoplastic syndrome,

302
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:46,720
which leads to heart block.

303
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,807
Finally, someone who is
not just a pretty face.

304
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,685
You and Taub,
run the scope, find the tumor.

305
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,312
Could be dangerous. If the bleeding
was caused by liver failure

306
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,647
as a result of the
intracranial pressure...

307
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:01,151
Liver is the one organ you can't
ascribe to intracranial pressure.

308
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,739
True.

309
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,371
Intracranial pressure
can cause liver problems.

310
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,496
It causes an increase in the cavernous
sinus pressure, which causes pressure

311
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,502
in the superior vena cava,
which shuts down the liver.

312
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,462
- Did you just think of that?
- No.

313
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,755
Then why didn't
you say anything in...

314
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,133
Think it would've
changed his mind? Not a chance.

315
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,509
House would have undercut me,

316
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,344
and forced me to do a procedure
I just argued against,

317
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,347
and then I'd look like a hypocrite
in front of the thousands of people

318
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,766
and potential future employers
watching this film.

319
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:37,438
If you're right, and we stick a scope
back down a kid with liver failure,

320
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,231
he could bleed again.

321
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,399
I know.

322
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,779
He just vomited blood.

323
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,240
Isn't that dangerous?

324
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,244
No. You're in good hands.

325
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,874
Okay. All right.

326
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,007
Well, it's great how he rebounded
from that setback.

327
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,176
What setback?

328
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,595
He didn't tell you about the...

329
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,388
Well, that's his right.

330
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,557
The records were sealed.

331
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,100
Personally, I think he was just
tapping his foot

332
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,894
and reaching for
the toilet paper.

333
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,396
Obviously it was a witch hunt.

334
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,149
You think
they singled him out because...

335
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,402
No. Literally, a witch hunt.
Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan.

336
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,529
It's a beautiful religion,
it's very caring.

337
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,783
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

338
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,079
You have an all-access pass
to the case, not my Fave 5s. Now, go.

339
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,623
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

340
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,420
I think I'm going blind.

341
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,631
Hairy palms, too?

342
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,635
She said something idiotic again
and I didn't even notice it.

343
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,553
Foreman had to point
out that it was idiotic.

344
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,888
She's making me an idiot.

345
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,515
It's cute. You have a crush.

346
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,141
No, I think
it's something systemic.

347
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,559
Thirteen's pretty.

348
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,061
You're obviously okay with her.

349
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,604
She killed a patient.

350
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,647
The bitch is pretty.

351
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,815
The bitch is a bitch.

352
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,359
- Ask her out.
- The bitch? She's a bitch.

353
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,046
No, the one that's
making you an idiot.

354
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,437
It's the story of life.
Boy meets girl. Boy gets stupid.

355
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,926
Boy and girl live
stupidly ever after.

356
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,618
- Pretty girl kill again?
- No.

357
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,705
Elephant boy just
vomiting up blood again.

358
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,352
No tumors in the
patient's stomach, so...

359
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,671
But the scope caused
variceal bleeding.

360
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,798
Took 20 minutes of banding
to stop it.

361
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,258
Taub was right about
the liver failure.

362
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,342
Yeah.

363
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,429
His craniofacial deformity is causing
intracranial pressure...

364
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,388
- No.
- ...which is causing...

365
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,516
Where are the nosebleeds?
Where's the labored breathing?

366
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,726
You were right
about me being wrong.

367
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,291
You were wrong
about you being right.

368
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,438
I need new ideas. Anybody?

369
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,087
Does it bother you that
this kid's gonna die

370
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,455
because you won't
put down that camera at all? You know?

371
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,290
Your people should
be extra motivated.

372
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,541
I'm sure they all wanna
look good in the film.

373
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,294
No, 'cause now they're too worried
about looking bad.

374
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,339
Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.

375
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,425
Maybe scleroderma.

376
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,845
Foreman? Does that make sense?

377
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,513
Not without
tight skin on the hands,

378
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,683
muscle weakness
and a 30-year-old patient.

379
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:24,188
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder.

380
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,525
Hey, say what she just said.

381
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,613
Liver failure plus heart block could be
a mitochondrial disorder?

382
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,671
Go look for signs of
retinal degeneration.

383
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,327
No, it's ICP.
You're only gonna see swelling.

384
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,914
Take him with you,
so he can see the degeneration, too.

385
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,167
So before you worked
here in the ER,

386
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,543
you worked for House, right?

387
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,711
Three and a half years.

388
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,670
Why did you leave?

389
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,214
Hey. I don't wanna be on TV.

390
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,379
I'm not signing a release.

391
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,549
We'll blur you out.

392
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,468
Take off your pants.

393
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,679
You gonna be able
to use any of this if I start swearing?

394
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,391
Did House treat you as badly
as he treats his current fellows?

395
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,434
Loaded question.

396
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,354
That's not even a word.

397
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,106
Fork!

398
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,316
Very clever.

399
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,652
I learnt how to be
a doctor from House.

400
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,363
Or at least a doctor who learnt
how to be a doctor from House,

401
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,614
if that makes any sense.

402
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,575
And you left his team
because you couldn't stand him anymore?

403
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,245
No, no. I love Dr. House.

404
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,831
Now, that's something
we haven't heard.

405
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,332
I mean...

406
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,960
What did you ask me again?

407
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,711
Why you um.

408
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:34,091
I loved being around him,

409
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,592
professionally.

410
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,679
You know, he was
always stimulating.

411
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:42,391
Not in an erotic
sense of the word.

412
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,686
Fork. They forked,
and then they spooned!

413
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,524
Lean forward, and place your chin
on the rest.

414
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,445
I can't reach it.

415
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,823
Scooch in a little.

416
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,951
I'll take care of it.

417
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,744
Just like last time?

418
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,916
Maybe we should try this
the old-fashioned way.

419
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,629
Okay, look up to the ceiling
and try not to blink, okay?

420
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,344
Okay, good. Now straight ahead.

421
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,561
There it is.
Swelling, no degeneration.

422
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,856
It's not mitochondrial.

423
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,733
Swelling proves there's increased
pressure in his brain.

424
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,984
Absolutely.

425
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,903
So, now we can schedule
the reconstruction?

426
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,529
Absolutely not.

427
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,114
Your test proved you wrong.

428
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,959
We found exactly what
I predicted we'd find.

429
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,076
Swelling means
there's increased pressure.

430
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,203
You get a gold Star of David
for proving,

431
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,496
yes, this kid has a big head

432
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,458
and big heads cause pressure.
Doesn't explain the liver.

433
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,751
Too much acetaminophen does.

434
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,629
JRA explains all of it,
including the liver.

435
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,173
One theory's better
than two. Treat with steroids.

436
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,884
If you're wrong, steroids are gonna mess
with his immune system,

437
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,553
put off his surgery for months.

438
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,016
You really wanna lose
this argument in front of the camera?

439
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,104
I'll speak to the father.

440
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,359
Dr. House believes
that Kenny has JRA.

441
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,319
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

442
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,529
We need to start
administering steroids.

443
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,366
Will the steroids fix it?

444
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,039
I don't think he has JRA.

445
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,416
I think Dr. House is wrong,

446
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,670
and that the steroid
treatment could be dangerous.

447
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,714
I think I can get House
thrown off the case,

448
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,759
and get Kenny
the facial surgery he needs.

449
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,433
The father refused steroids until
we're sure about the diagnosis.

450
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,685
I am sure.

451
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,311
It's JRA.

452
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,980
And why would
he even doubt that,

453
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,358
unless a former fellow of mine
was chirping in his ear?

454
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,735
The decision was his.
I merely voiced my concern.

455
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,695
Why did you take this job?

456
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,029
He's got a bulging cyst.

457
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,323
Perfectly good plastic
surgery practice, lots of money.

458
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,730
Fluids aren't
draining properly.

459
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,494
Temptation to come screw with me
just too much for you?

460
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,662
There's gotta be
a better reason.

461
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,372
He needs surgery to drain it.

462
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,001
Oh, and I think
I mentioned this earlier. You're fired.

463
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,216
What you did
was over the line. Get out.

464
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,597
But don't go anywhere.
You're not fired, yet.

465
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,353
No one is firing anyone
in the middle of this case.

466
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,758
Not while those
cameras are here,

467
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:38,859
and not while Taub is the only person
that this father trusts.

468
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,402
Where are you going?

469
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,987
To do what I always do
in these situations.

470
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,864
Treat my patient
behind his back.

471
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,282
That's one option.

472
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,201
Or you can do a CT scan
of the kid's head.

473
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,579
If there's no midline shift,
we know Taub's wrong

474
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:54,249
and you get your consent
to give the kid steroids.

475
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,168
Just a warning.

476
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:59,004
If we have to start getting consent
every time we do a procedure,

477
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:02,257
soon they'll be asking
for informed consent.

478
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,064
Didn't think
you had the guts to stage a coup.

479
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,268
Coup failed.
I'm scheduled for execution at dawn.

480
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,227
No, you're not.

481
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,604
No reprieve from the governor.

482
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,607
You're a test result
away from becoming House's front runner.

483
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,234
He doesn't care about what you said,
or what you did five minutes ago.

484
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,861
He just wants
the next good idea.

485
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,406
Show me 20 percent
magnification of the forebrain.

486
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:32,120
I look at our patient, as soon as I
saw his face, I saw a regular kid.

487
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,374
One thing about being a plastic surgeon,
you don't see what is,

488
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,834
you see what could be.

489
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,419
Talk like that around House,

490
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,839
doesn't matter how many
good ideas you come up with.

491
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,176
So,

492
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,346
tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

493
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,514
Gosh.

494
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,225
There's so many things.

495
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,229
Is Dr. Taub available?
Because he was very highly recommended.

496
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,189
Well, he's no longer
practicing with us,

497
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,649
but I've taken over
all his files,

498
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,942
so if you tell me
what needs work...

499
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,360
Do you know why he left?

500
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,154
He had personal issues
to deal with, so if we could just...

501
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,073
My goodness. Is he okay?

502
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,658
Oh, yeah, he's fine. He's fine.

503
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,828
Because my friend
had his ears done by Dr. Taub.

504
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,789
Should he worry that
they may pop back?

505
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,415
No, it wasn't
a professional issue.

506
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,459
I'm sorry,
I really can't go into more detail.

507
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,878
Shall we discuss your needs?

508
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,591
You know that toe next to the big toe?
Mine's bigger than my big toe.

509
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,302
Is there any way to shorten it?
Or make my big toe bigger?

510
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,388
Like, a toe-gmentation?

511
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,058
Did he lie, cheat or steal?

512
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,394
You're not here
for a consultation, are you?

513
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,563
What gave me away?

514
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,274
Was it my obviously
perfect feet?

515
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,407
Hi.

516
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:52,409
CT shows that...

517
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,577
Let's go.

518
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,541
What are you two doing here?

519
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,001
Skipping three scenes.

520
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,879
CT's back. He's gonna say that there's
evidence of an anomaly,

521
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,046
I'm gonna say, he's wrong.

522
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,674
He's gonna go back to the father
and we'll all end up here.

523
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,093
The defect is pushing
on the right frontal lobe.

524
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,720
This bend is a sign
of herniation.

525
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,182
Or, it's a sign
of increased pressure from JRA.

526
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,394
Dr. Taub would rather
distract you from the truth

527
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,731
with sparkly things,
like four karat diamonds.

528
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:23,899
House.

529
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,151
Your partner said
that you left for personal reasons,

530
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,569
but your wife said
you lost a patient.

531
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,446
You son of a bitch,
you spoke to my wife?

532
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,488
See, that confused me.

533
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,115
Why would
you give her a diamond

534
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,700
if you screwed
somebody else over?

535
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,036
If you screwed her over,
I mean, I could...

536
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,954
Get that camera out of here!

537
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,669
You say anything to her?

538
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:45,837
Just asked questions.

539
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,214
Get them out of here, too.

540
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,715
We're doctors.

541
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,347
I screwed around
with a nurse. It became a deal.

542
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,392
My partners found out
and I resigned.

543
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,311
There. Happy?

544
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,940
If you could be
a bit more descriptive, I'd be happier.

545
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,400
Some people pop pain pills,

546
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,778
I cheat.

547
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,780
We all have our vices.

548
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:21,539
Taub, I don't see it.
Stay away from the family.

549
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:25,418
House, start steroids
and stay away from his family.

550
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,265
Wow, you are ugly.

551
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,268
Wow, you're an ass.

552
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,144
I have a deformity.

553
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,105
I know, that's why you're ugly.

554
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,398
But you're a lucky boy.

555
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,923
Anywhere else
in the animal kingdom,

556
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,068
your parents would have
eaten you at birth.

557
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,487
Your son needs steroids.

558
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,571
Dr. Cuddy agrees.

559
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,990
Does Dr. Taub?

560
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,452
He's not a real doctor.
He's a plastic surgeon.

561
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,289
All he cares is
that your son looks good in his coffin.

562
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,582
So, I'm supposed
to believe you?

563
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,959
The doctor who cares.

564
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,794
You shouldn't care if I care.

565
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,963
I don't trust you.

566
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,300
Because I don't think
the surgery's important?

567
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:17,304
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

568
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,515
You're willing to take chances to risk
his life for something he doesn't need?

569
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,975
I do need it.

570
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,440
I can't have
real relationships.

571
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,608
I can't even have
a real conversation.

572
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,610
Not even with my dad.

573
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,907
Dad.

574
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,536
I know you love me.

575
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,497
But you don't treat me normal.

576
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,083
You're always protective.

577
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,086
The world
can always go to hell.

578
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,506
But you never yell at me.

579
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,051
Even when I screw up.

580
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,513
I wanna be normal.

581
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,728
Take your steroids,
and you get to live.

582
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,773
Then you can do your surgery.

583
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,651
But it'll only
change your face.

584
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,364
It won't change
who your face made you.

585
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:24,662
We're gonna get caught.

586
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,164
Not on film.

587
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,292
All their camera
equipment's in here.

588
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,086
Where did you get those keys?

589
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:33,004
Blue, the janitor.

590
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,548
What?

591
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,218
That's his name.

592
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,221
His name's Lou.

593
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,057
Owe him an apology.

594
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,685
Just watch 20 minutes
of this stuff,

595
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:48,812
tell me if I'm out of my mind.

596
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,272
Finally, we have
video evidence.

597
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,901
Dr. House, heart block
plus liver failure

598
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:55,985
could mean autoimmune.

599
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,779
Maybe scleroderma.

600
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,781
Foreman? Does that make sense?

601
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,408
Not without
tight skin on the hands,

602
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,786
muscle weakness
and a 30-year-old patient.

603
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,788
Can I see that again?

604
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,332
What did you miss?
She screwed up, I didn't...

605
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,834
No, just the part
where she leans forward.

606
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,795
I think you can
see through her dress.

607
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,466
Upper GI bleed.

608
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,678
Could be something he ate or drank.
Maybe a peptic ulcer.

609
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,971
Good.

610
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,015
You thought
that was a good idea?

611
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,308
What am I gonna do?

612
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:28,768
Just enjoy.

613
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,605
I'm gonna keep her around,
because she makes me an idiot?

614
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,066
Well, you're protected,
Foreman seems immune.

615
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:36,609
You think he's gay?

616
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,903
Did he become an idiot
around Chase?

617
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,436
I just said it's not a nasal...

618
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,200
Wait a minute, rewind that.
Was that Thirteen?

619
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,329
Wow.

620
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,457
I can't believe I'm that guy.

621
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,417
Every guy is that guy.

622
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,626
I'm not every guy-

623
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,170
What is this? Semantics here?

624
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,297
Okay, all guys are that guy.

625
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,382
I'm not all guys!

626
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,719
Cameron was smart.

627
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,680
You know, I'm beginning
to doubt that.

628
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,396
I wanted to clarify
something I said earlier.

629
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,773
"I love Dr. House,"

630
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,694
and then I qualified it,
which, after thinking about it,

631
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,447
I didn't really need to do.

632
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:25,283
I did love being around him.

633
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:29,412
I guess, I just
wanted to qualify

634
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,541
what I qualified before.

635
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:36,753
I'm looking defensive,
aren't I?

636
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,964
No, no. I think that's great.
Clears everything up.

637
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,764
It's no big deal, really...

638
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,895
There's a mass lesion
in the left anterior temporal lobe

639
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,064
surrounded by oedema.

640
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,858
Did you just insult me
in Pig Latin?

641
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,693
Dr. House, please.

642
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,947
Will you just take
a look at this?

643
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:09,285
The defect is causing
this nodular shadow here, you see it?

644
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,498
You're right,
I didn't see that before.

645
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,043
Come on, let's go.

646
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,672
Hey.

647
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,592
I know you think you're feeling better,
on account of feeling better,

648
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:29,097
but this trusted family doctor
thinks that he's found a mass lesion,

649
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,183
so if you could lie back down
and struggle to breathe...

650
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,601
Okay-

651
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,229
You were right.

652
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,982
I'm thrilled I'm wrong.

653
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,109
This is great, Kenny.

654
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,736
You're gonna
get your surgery now.

655
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,073
First person I'm coming
back to see is you,

656
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,784
because compared to me,
you're gonna look like butt.

657
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,202
Hey!

658
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,162
What, no comeback?

659
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,457
Look at that.

660
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,417
What?

661
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,295
His little finger,
it's twitching.

662
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,340
No, it's not.

663
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:07,051
Just give it a second. There.

664
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,511
And?

665
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,597
He's not better.

666
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,933
What's wrong?

667
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,518
My diagnosis.

668
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,938
I don't know what he has.

669
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,441
Cancel the surgery.

670
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:32,535
New symptom.
Involuntary muscle movement.

671
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,078
Twitching finger is a symptom?

672
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,580
The body doing something
it's not supposed to do

673
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,373
is the definition of a symptom.

674
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,043
Kid's about to have
a life-changing operation. He's nervous.

675
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:41,127
Or he's not.

676
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,378
Or you were right.

677
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,464
Kid got better
when we put him on steroids.

678
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,716
This is JRA and
it's under control now.

679
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,260
Or the steroids
have just tempered his condition.

680
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,429
He got a haircut,
but he's still got bad hair.

681
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,388
What about Lyme disease?

682
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,558
It explains everything,
the heart issues, the internal bleeding,

683
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,123
even why he'd get
better on steroids.

684
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,646
On the other hand,
if he has Lyme disease,

685
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:03,232
there'd be other subtle clues
like a huge target-shaped rash.

686
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,484
But thanks for playing.

687
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,736
Why can't you just
accept the fact that you cured this kid?

688
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:09,197
You want to stop his surgery!

689
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,240
You're not normal.

690
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,534
So you don't want anyone
also to be normal.

691
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,662
You don't think
normal's healthy.

692
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:23,878
Could be rheumatic fever.

693
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,588
Also explains why
the steroids helped.

694
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,131
It's a similar
inflammatory disease.

695
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,175
Rheumatic fever
doesn't explain liver failure.

696
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,010
Taub thinks that
acetaminophen does.

697
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,595
Fine. Let's test your theory.

698
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,013
Remove his pacing wire.

699
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:36,516
If he's better,
his heart will be just fine on its own

700
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,227
and then he can have
his operation.

701
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,439
If I'm right,
his heart will stop.

702
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,568
Kutner, have the
paddles on standby.

703
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,113
Another chance
to blow someone up.

704
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,199
There'll be
some minor discomfort

705
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:56,327
and you'll feel a slow,
steady pulling sensation.

706
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,121
Are you sure his heart
is ready for this?

707
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,622
Absolutely.

708
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,999
He's convinced he's sure.

709
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,794
Whereas I care about your son,

710
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,632
and have therefore brought
a professional defibrillist.

711
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,762
We're not gonna need those.

712
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:20,143
Dad, I feel fine, and my finger
hasn't moved in a while.

713
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,650
Okay. Take him off.

714
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,777
Here we go.

715
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:55,261
Heart rates 85 beats
per minute. BP 110 over 70.

716
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,637
Is he okay?

717
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,681
I feel the same.

718
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,894
He's fine. You're fine.

719
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,521
Thank God!

720
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,316
What do you mean, thank God?

721
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,651
God's the guy
who gave it to him.

722
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,578
Thank you. Thank you.

723
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,587
Can you tell us
about the procedure?

724
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:15,049
We have to use both an extra
and intracranial approach

725
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,553
to get enough exposure
to reduce the encephalocele cyst

726
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,596
and do the bony reconstruction.

727
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,729
And how are you
participating in this procedure?

728
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,269
She's not.

729
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:30,648
They don't want me here because they
think the kid's cured. I don't.

730
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,692
And what do you think the problem is?

731
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,277
I wish I knew.

732
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,446
I just know that if Dr. House is right,
something's gonna go wrong.

733
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,283
Dr. House doesn't
think he's right.

734
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:43,202
Well, then I'll just
waste a few hours watching a surgery.

735
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,580
See, the danger is,
we have to reconstruct

736
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,832
all the way down
to the cranial base,

737
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,418
and there are some
big vessels down there.

738
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,420
So, what we'll do
is we'll work our way down to here...

739
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,172
When were these pictures taken?

740
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:58,384
Well, about three weeks ago.
Why? What do you see?

741
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,429
Well, the acanthosis
nigricans was already there.

742
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:04,557
It's been there a lot longer than that,
probably his whole life.

743
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,559
What about around his hairline?

744
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,936
What? There's no discoloration.

745
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,563
There is now.

746
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,616
I have a new theory.

747
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:25,494
Their bad ideas don't indicate
a lack of intelligence,

748
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,455
they indicate an open mind.

749
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,250
The willingness
not to be trapped by conventional...

750
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,752
You've got a problem.

751
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,128
Tell me something I don't know.

752
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,548
You hire beautiful girls, enslave them,
force them to be around you

753
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,550
because you don't know
how to have an actual relationship.

754
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:43,262
If they're qualified, keep them.
If not, fire them and ask them out.

755
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,724
You do realize that, "Tell me something
I don't know" is just an expression?

756
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,643
- Thirteen...
- You think that just because

757
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,144
she is as beautiful, ergo,

758
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,812
you think that because she
hasn't had a decent idea...

759
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,399
No. My point is she's about to enter
your office, so you should shut up.

760
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:59,654
You were right
about the diagnosis.

761
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,531
Yes, it was JRA.
I'm very proud.

762
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,825
No, I mean you were right about
being wrong. He's got Lyme disease.

763
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,078
It explains everything.

764
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:12,041
Could you just hold up some fingers
so I can see if I'm literally blind?

765
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,293
We ruled out
Lyme disease hours ago.

766
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:15,419
All the symptoms fit.

767
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,545
I am so ashamed.

768
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,911
Is she really
that good looking?

769
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:18,881
Apparently.

770
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,126
How many lives have been lost
because of pretty girls?

771
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,094
The target rash is hiding.

772
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,138
No one ever looked at
him closely enough.

773
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,556
She's getting uglier
by the second.

774
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,225
We can try and pretend
we're above it

775
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,893
and we can try
and intellectualize it away,

776
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,480
but ultimately, shiny, pretty,
perky things are good

777
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:21,986
and ugly, misshapen,
teenage boys are repulsive.

778
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,407
The question was, do you resent.

779
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,368
Dr. Cuddy's interference
in your practice?

780
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,328
Oh.

781
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,374
Well, then I guess my answer
wasn't very helpful, was it?

782
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,552
"Mini-stud", stand up.

783
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,769
I spoke to your other partner.

784
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:55,940
After Cuddy told you...

785
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:58,064
No, I stayed away.
Did it all over the phone.

786
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:01,275
I asked for a reference. Said you were
applying for a plastic surgery job.

787
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,651
Oh, God!

788
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:03,736
Yeah.

789
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:08,324
He went nuts.
Apparently you signed a non-compete.

790
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:09,825
Now, why would
you agree to that?

791
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,660
I don't wanna practice
plastic surgery.

792
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,663
You sign a contract
because someone's making you.

793
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,229
Someone's getting
something from you.

794
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,292
What did they give you
in return?

795
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,046
They agreed to keep
their mouths shut.

796
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:26,133
So you gave up your chosen career
just so they'd be quiet?

797
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,222
I love my wife.

798
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:40,481
You risked this job
with nothing to fall back on.

799
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,068
I thought you were wrong.

800
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,658
Sit back down.

801
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:53,994
You're keeping him
because he's a philanderer?

802
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,121
Where do I sign up?

803
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,999
Ask the Mormon. I'm keeping him
because he's interesting.

804
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,170
Dr. Terzi, would you
please stand up?

805
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,470
Nice.

806
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,015
I have treated you unfairly.

807
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,309
Pre-judged you.

808
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,187
And for me
to be a better person,

809
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,107
I have to
rectify that situation.

810
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:24,400
You're fired.

811
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,825
You wanna grab some dinner?

812
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,743
Maybe a movie?

813
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:37,788
Seriously.

814
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,637
Just days ago, with Kenny's
condition worsening,

815
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:57,349
it was Dr. Gregory House
reassuring Kenny and his father.

816
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,852
I care about your son.

817
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:02,855
The charming House,
who happens to be a film buff

818
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,233
with a soft spot in his heart for
children told us how he got his start.

819
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,777
See, I became a doctor
because of the movie, Patch Adams.

820
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:11,739
Determined to save
the boy's life, as well as...

821
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,532
The horror.

822
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,410
Well, it's nice of them
to send us an early copy.

823
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,871
Not so much sent as stolen.

824
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:23,375
It was Dr. Gregory
House who served as not only a doctor,

825
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,586
but a rock for Kenny
and his father.

826
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,964
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

827
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,841
House, one of
those rare doctors...

828
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,092
God!

829
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:33,719
Who wears his heart
on his sleeve.

830
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,181
I was saying
that was a stupid thing to do!

831
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:38,933
It's difficult not to be moved.

832
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,351
Oh, stop it.

833
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,938
Suddenly, I don't feel I can
trust Michael Moore movies.

834
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,522
Where are you going?

835
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:49,109
Kittens to get out of trees?
Deaf kids to read to?

836
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:53,822
I owe it to the world to make sure this
evil never sees the light of day.

837
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,287
Is there anything else?

838
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,626
Thank you, Dr. House.

839
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,420
Thank you.
