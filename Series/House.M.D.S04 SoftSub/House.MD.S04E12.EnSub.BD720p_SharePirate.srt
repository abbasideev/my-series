1
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:23,525
I don't know about you, but I'm nervous.

2
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,036
<i>Maze! Tov!</i>

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,383
<i>Maze! Tov!</i>

4
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:49,551
Many children.

5
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,553
This is a great thing, Roz.

6
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,513
I am so happy for you.

7
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:55,014
Thank you, Mrs. Silver.

8
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:58,810
Yonatan is a good man,
from a good family.

9
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,525
I know you chose well for me.
I've been blessed.

10
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:54,050
Cross-species mating.
I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.

11
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,010
Amber and I
have a lot in common.

12
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,514
She's a Cutthroat Bitch,
you cry over Dark Victory.

13
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,517
Bette Davis.
Another strong, assertive woman.

14
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,185
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

15
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,895
You like needy.

16
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,106
She's not dying, is she?

17
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,399
Yes. Go away.

18
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,237
I give it two months.

19
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,700
Hundred bucks.

20
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,621
It's not really fair.
You're not objective.

21
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,123
But, I'm all about
the teaching, so...

22
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,166
We're at four months.

23
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,253
You hid this from me?

24
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,588
I was wrong. Okay?

25
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,172
I thought you'd be upset.

26
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:35,675
I thought you'd
track me down in hallways...

27
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,719
I shouldn't have
discounted the sex.

28
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:40,763
She's obviously limber enough
to put off the meltdown for two months.

29
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,349
She's not needy.
I don't need needy.

30
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,602
She's scary.
Why does scary need pathetic?

31
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,978
Are you going to talk to her?

32
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,564
I don't see
that I have any choice.

33
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,445
You're all right with that?
No impulse to save her from me?

34
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,448
I've broken the pattern,
House, which is why this has a chance.

35
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,326
I know you're too suspicious to accept
that without getting out your ruler

36
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,370
and your calipers
and your scanning equipment, so,

37
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,332
go ahead.
Get it out of your system.

38
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,550
Thirty-eight year old female
with loss of bladder control,

39
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,346
blood in her urine and a broken leg
from collapsing at her wedding.

40
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,349
Ampicillin for the UTI,
shiny cast for the leg.

41
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,268
You guys know
Wilson's dating Amber?

42
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,312
- No.
- Wilson and Amber?

43
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,730
I knew.

44
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,192
I asked her out. She said
she'd just started seeing someone.

45
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,487
Cultures were negative for UTis.
No signs of previous trauma or STDs.

46
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:38,446
Kidney cancer.

47
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,211
CT was clean for tumors
and kidney stones.

48
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,325
- I thought Amber scared you guys.
- She does.

49
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,285
But she also has legs
that go all the way up to Canada.

50
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,450
So do Canadians. It doesn't mean
I want to date one.

51
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,873
Her sodium's low. Could be endometriosis
in the bladder.

52
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,502
Low sodium could also be from low food.
Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.

53
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,297
Or sodium was absorbed
by a toxin already in her system.

54
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,134
Was it just the legs, or did you
detect something resembling a soul?

55
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,386
She grew on me.

56
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,305
If there's a toxin in her,
it could be carbolic acid.

57
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,556
I'm talking about
the patient now.

58
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,393
That much carbolic acid,
someone would have had to poison her.

59
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,352
Could have been a Cossack.

60
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,187
If this was 18th-century Poland

61
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,272
and Cossacks were
into household cleansers.

62
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,109
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

63
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,527
Suicide's a sin.

64
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,321
Corollary of, "People lie,"
is, "People sin."

65
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,532
And in my
world, "People" includes Jews.

66
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:23,491
She was getting married.

67
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:24,742
Hasidic women marry young

68
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,412
so they can start
pushing out little "Hasidlings."

69
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:28,577
Thirty-eight means a woman

70
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,957
not on anyone's hot list
being pushed onto a guy

71
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,042
who's not on anyone's hot list.
No way out. No way out.

72
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,007
Endometriosis fits better than an
epiphany that her life is meaningless.

73
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:40,049
We should start her on Als
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

74
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,012
Fine. Check her innards for bad cells
and her home for bad karma.

75
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,805
The carbolic acid should be on the shelf

76
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,224
right next to the
regret and the self-loathing.

77
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,476
These people are crazy.

78
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,186
Yeah. She should be self-hating.

79
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,271
I'm not self-hating.

80
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,982
I hate religious people who
are out of touch with reality.

81
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,747
You only marry someone
you met three times

82
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,569
if they're carrying
your little mistake.

83
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,903
What's their divorce rate?

84
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:04,699
Cleaners are all organic.
Nothing with carbolic acid.

85
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,075
You like how they hook up?

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,120
Romance is just
emotional foreplay.

87
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,830
Candlelight meals, flowers...

88
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,915
It's as much a ritual
as anything these people do.

89
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,210
Why not go with someone who's
pre-vetted, shares the same values?

90
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,295
Cut to the quick.

91
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,297
Values may give
you the big picture,

92
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,008
but time together
gives you the little picture.

93
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,551
Does she chew
her food too loud?

94
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,517
Will she leave you alone
during the Final Four?

95
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,835
You commit to something deeper.

96
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,972
You let the little
surprises slide.

97
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,140
Surprises kill,

98
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,705
which is why you only commit
when there are no more surprises.

99
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,937
And you have
no more surprises for your wife.

100
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,357
Do you think this came up
on date number two?

101
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,110
You ever heard
of a Hasidic Jew into hard rock?

102
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,447
She's listed as
a producer on all of these.

103
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,326
Where there's
rock and roll and sex,

104
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,204
usually, there's drugs.

105
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:58,002
I'm Baal T'Shuvah. I became Hasidic
about six months ago.

106
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,172
And before six months ago?

107
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,675
Music business isn't exactly
known for its holiness.

108
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,803
Heroin.

109
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,015
But I've been clean for months.

110
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,561
Yonatan knows

111
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,315
in the broad strokes.

112
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,110
He never actually
asked the details.

113
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:27,115
Says what's important is the person that
I am now, not the person I was then.

114
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,616
How do you go
all the way from...

115
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,701
I just took a class.

116
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,453
Then I took another class.

117
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,124
And you just completely
left the music business?

118
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,751
Pop music
is considered frivolous.

119
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,755
Same reason we don't
watch TV or go to movies.

120
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,092
Your drug use
may have caused some long-term damage.

121
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,137
We're going to need to take
a hair sample to test for latent toxins.

122
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,098
So, you can never
watch Star Wars again.

123
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,825
You figure that I'll hire you,
if you promise to dump Wilson.

124
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,995
- How did you...
- Wilson had a key.

125
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:17,540
You figure that I'll make
your life hell at first,

126
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,084
but I'll eventually see
how good you are and keep you.

127
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:24,839
It's a good plan, don't you think?
Perfectly tailored to your personality.

128
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,346
No, it's not.
You know it's not.

129
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,100
Means you just want to
stay in my orbit,

130
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,227
because you figure I'll eventually
realize that I made a mistake

131
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,271
and you'll be able
to rub my face in it.

132
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,232
I can't wait.
It's going to be awesome.

133
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,070
No, it's not.
And you know it's not.

134
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,364
'Cause you know that
even if I made a mistake,

135
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:53,242
I'd never admit
that I made a mistake.

136
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,456
Which means that you're just toying
with Wilson to toy with me.

137
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,211
Your goal is pure
feral vengeance.

138
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:07,673
Innocent bystander,
but there's a greater good.

139
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,259
No, that's not it.

140
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,097
Because a bag of flaming poop
bypasses the bystander.

141
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,893
So, which is it, House?

142
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:24,148
Am I in this for you?
Or am I in this for him?

143
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,278
Give him back his sweatshirt.

144
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,156
Pit stains don't become you.

145
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,418
Treatment had no effect,
rules out endometriosis,

146
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,587
and her hair sample
was negative for residue drugs.

147
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,631
This woman lived
in the fast lane till six months ago.

148
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,591
- Maybe we're missing something.
- She admitted drug use.

149
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,219
Doubt she's holding out
on her days as an asbestos miner.

150
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,471
Cryoglobulinemia
might account for the symptoms.

151
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,931
Except for the one you missed.

152
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,141
Well, there's no change
in her condition.

153
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,393
I'm not talking
about a new symptom,

154
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,353
I'm talking about one
that presented six months ago.

155
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:06,524
Look, she's nuts. But we can't just give
her 10 cc of atheism and send her home.

156
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,154
Religion is a symptom of irrational
belief and groundless hope.

157
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,450
Altered mental status, on the other
hand, is a symptom of porphyria.

158
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,578
She didn't develop uncontrollable anger,
crying, anxiety,

159
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:21,205
she just decided
to go to Temple.

160
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,083
The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher.

161
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,379
She went directly to the extremes of
Hasidism and a life of stringent rules.

162
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,630
She became a masochist.

163
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,340
She didn't like her old life,
so she changed it.

164
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,509
People don't change.

165
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,262
They might want to,
might even need to, but...

166
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,973
Taub gave up a six-figure
plastic surgery career for this job.

167
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,975
That mean he has porphyria?

168
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,479
He switched jobs to save his marriage.
He did it to avoid change.

169
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,901
He's right. You don't suddenly choose
crazy without suddenly being crazy.

170
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,862
No. No.
If she walked away from everything,

171
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,387
to go base-jumping
or live with apes

172
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,698
we wouldn't be
having this discussion.

173
00:10:55,823 --> 00:11:00,244
We would if she was also tinkling blood
out of her over-excited bladder.

174
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,123
Pump Hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

175
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,504
Bloodletting?

176
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,798
Porphyria is a rare
genetic disorder

177
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,963
that causes an over-production
of a certain protein.

178
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,052
Draining the blood relieves...

179
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,598
A hair test for damage from drugs showed
she has a rare genetic disease?

180
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,184
Not exactly.
We're testing her now to confirm.

181
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,102
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

182
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,396
Blood test results
take 24 hours.

183
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,275
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

184
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,694
Dr. House has a theory.

185
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,404
A theory based on what?

186
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,400
We'd like a different doctor.

187
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,660
I assure you that
Dr. House is our best...

188
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,037
Then we will settle
for second best.

189
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,040
Someone who doesn't think my wife
is sick just because she's religious.

190
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:50,336
If you prefer, I can give your wife
my second-best diagnosis.

191
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,408
Did you know
Wilson's dating Amber?

192
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,634
I have reviewed the chart.

193
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,261
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

194
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,972
that cryoglobulinemia
also fits the symptoms.

195
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,392
Yes. It fits many
of the symptoms.

196
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:08,270
My wife's body is sick.
Her mind and soul are fine.

197
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,941
You live according to God's
600 commandments, right?

198
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,359
Six hundred thirteen.

199
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,985
Do you understand them all?

200
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,529
It takes a lifetime
of learning.

201
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,072
But you follow the ones
you don't understand,

202
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,597
because the ones you do understand
make sense and you believe

203
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,035
that the guy who created them
knows what he's doing.

204
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,994
Of course.

205
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,665
So, you will trust my diagnosis,
and you'll let me treat her,

206
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,668
because in this Temple,
I am Dr. Yahweh.

207
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,797
I want a new doctor.

208
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,928
I'm starting her on indomethacin
for the cryoglobulinemia.

209
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,638
People don't change.

210
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,766
For example, I'm going to keep
repeating, "People don't change."

211
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,186
So, alcoholics that successfully
go through treatment don't exist.

212
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,813
They're still alcoholics.

213
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,523
If they never take
another drink as long as they live,

214
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,489
it's only because
they didn't live long enough.

215
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,610
If you're dissatisfied with your life,

216
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,655
changing it is
a symptom of mental health.

217
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,325
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

218
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:11,333
O2 sats are 85. She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate.

219
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:14,837
What's wrong with her?

220
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,755
Well, it's definitely
not cryoglobulinemia.

221
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,383
Better ask him.

222
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,680
We kept her on oxygen overnight.

223
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,809
Her respiratory rate's stabilized
and her O-sat's back up to 95.

224
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,895
I saw Amber drop off
Wilson this morning.

225
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,731
Yes. The male always
drives the female.

226
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,816
So what caused
the breathing problem?

227
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,651
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

228
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,986
She kiss him or he kiss her?

229
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,697
I missed it. The lab tech
with the tongue stud also pulled up.

230
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,824
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

231
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,452
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

232
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,413
Actually, we've been trying to ignore
that part of the white board.

233
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,292
I wrote it in black.
I'm always serious when I use black.

234
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,503
- Lupus would explain...
- Maybe she didn't change.

235
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,004
Are you agreeing with me,
or are you making a point?

236
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,088
I'm making a point.

237
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,465
That's going to take longer.

238
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,801
How do we know that the real Roz isn't
who she is now and who she was then?

239
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,929
Can't we say
that her previous life was true,

240
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,639
without making her present one a fraud?

241
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,474
The "life is messy" argument.
Nice.

242
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,351
Explains everything
without explaining anything.

243
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:13,812
If it's lupus, there's a heart problem
we don't know about yet.

244
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,732
Run her through a stress test.
If she has a heart attack, I'm right.

245
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,359
Or we could wait, hope that...

246
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,610
You're afraid to give her
a heart attack.

247
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:20,856
Of course we're afraid to...

248
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,404
No reason to be afraid.

249
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,782
Unless you think I'm right.

250
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,784
It's Wegener's.

251
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,747
But we'll have
the crash cart, just in case.

252
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,296
Oh, my God!
What are you guys doing here?

253
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,885
I had a sudden yen for fusion.

254
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,097
I put a different restaurant in my
date book. I'm firing my assistant.

255
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,182
That's okay. Hi, Greg.

256
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,395
And I call you "Greg"
because we're now social equals.

257
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,607
I call you "Cutthroat Bitch."
Well, <i>quad</i> erat demonstrandum.

258
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,820
And I speak in Latin, because I don't
try to hide what an ass I am.

259
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,697
I assume you'd like to join us?

260
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,783
It will be easier to observe our
interaction if you're at the same table.

261
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,618
If we ever get seated.

262
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,578
Excuse me.

263
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,579
No, no. I...

264
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,498
We've been waiting for...

265
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,211
Any minute now, she's going to hit him
in the face with your testicles.

266
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:23,257
She tends to treat...
She tends to treat every event

267
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,259
like it's the last
'copter out of Saigon.

268
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,971
She's the anti-Wilson.
She's a force for evil.

269
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,807
She has an annoying quality.
Perhaps even two.

270
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,852
If I was perfect,
I would date perfect.

271
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,860
You like that.

272
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,029
It's annoying,
but she's good at it.

273
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,864
Wait a second.

274
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,576
This isn't just about the sex.
You like her personality.

275
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,994
You like that she's conniving.

276
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,330
You like that she has
no regard for consequences.

277
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,916
You like that she can humiliate someone
if it serves...

278
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,545
Oh, my God.

279
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,922
You're sleeping with me.

280
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,978
<i>I need you to go faster, Roz.</i>

281
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,398
<i>A little harder.</i>

282
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,817
I am going harder, damn it.

283
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,325
What if Dr. House was right?

284
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,661
And Roz did make
a radical change.

285
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,122
Lupus is chronic,
but treatable.

286
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,958
And with the treatment,
it would undo the change?

287
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,544
She'll be the way she was
before I knew her?

288
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,630
I don't think it's likely.

289
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,509
Then you don't know for sure.

290
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,849
You'd find someone else.

291
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,061
There isn't someone else.

292
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,355
You've had three dates.

293
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,733
How long have you been married?

294
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,693
Twelve years.

295
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,319
And is she the one?

296
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,238
We wouldn't still
be together if she weren't.

297
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,948
I love her as much now
as the day...

298
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,617
Well, you should love her more.

299
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,414
The more you know someone,
the more you should love them.

300
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,630
Okay. That's enough, Roz.

301
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,261
Your heart's as strong
as a battleship.

302
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,786
Does this mean Dr. House was wrong?

303
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,140
Oh! Oh, my leg!

304
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,440
Heart's strong
enough to prove you wrong

305
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,775
about the change in mental status.

306
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,736
Only proves this isn't lupus,

307
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,863
just as the leg pain
proves it isn't Wegener's.

308
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,783
Leg pain could be from nerve entrapment.
We're thinking blood clot.

309
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,412
Do an MRI to look for the clot.
Then do an FMRI.

310
00:17:58,537 --> 00:17:59,663
An MRI alone will detect...

311
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,948
If the clot hasn't dissolved.

312
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,459
An FMRI could show signs
of a near-ischemic stroke

313
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,335
in post-ischemic
parts of the brain.

314
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,587
Give me 10 bucks.

315
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,172
- No.
- I missed lunch.

316
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,508
- I thought you went out with...
- I missed lunch.

317
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,308
Good symmetrical activity
in both hemispheres.

318
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:23,479
Caudal structures look okay.
She hasn't changed?

319
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,814
Sex, drugs, rock and roll

320
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,979
and the 600 rules of God
are all in there somewhere.

321
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,445
We oversimplify people.
It's how the human mind works.

322
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,823
Everything's on or off.
Everything's got a category.

323
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,785
You don't like it.

324
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,537
You don't want to be
over-simplified.

325
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,457
Roz, move your right leg.

326
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,542
No one can describe
themselves in 10 words.

327
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,387
Why would we want to hear
anyone else do it?

328
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,964
So you keep it a mystery.
No categories if no one knows anything.

329
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,883
Do you think maybe you're
over-simplifying me, now?

330
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,009
No.

331
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,554
I'm sure you have many reasons
to keep yourself a mystery,

332
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,349
besides the fact
that you're bisexual.

333
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,687
A denial would have worked
before the long vacant stare.

334
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,689
Roz, move your left leg
just an inch.

335
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,780
People who have a problem with boxes
are people who don't fit in them.

336
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,032
You've been working
for House for a long time.

337
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,326
No need for name-calling.

338
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,788
I would ask if this was going to be
lunchtime gossip, but lucky for me...

339
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:23,872
I don't give a damn.

340
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,837
How's our mental Yentl?

341
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,215
MRI shows no sign of clots,
FMRI shows no problem areas.

342
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,592
- Go restart her IV.
- What's wrong with it?

343
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,511
Nothing. But like so many
of the procedures

344
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,180
we put patients through, it hurts,

345
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:43,600
which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

346
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,644
This is why you wanted an FMRI?

347
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,649
It showed she didn't have a blood clot,
which is diagnostically relevant.

348
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,484
And it can show that she's become a
masochist. Also diagnostically relevant.

349
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,611
And it will be cool.

350
00:19:56,488 --> 00:20:01,243
Either explain which part of my analysis
didn't make sense, or go do it.

351
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,246
It isn't cool.

352
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,919
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,098
Heavens.
Look at her limbic system.

354
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:27,019
Her pleasure centers
are lighting up like a Hanukkah bush.

355
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,022
Foreman must have
a touch like an elephant.

356
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,190
Okay, Roz,
we've got what we need.

357
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,612
Yes. It was impressive.

358
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,035
Roz? You all right?

359
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,039
Oh, sorry. I was praying.

360
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,874
All through the procedure?

361
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:53,587
No, when Dr. Foreman apologized, I knew
something bad was going to happen.

362
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,300
She was praying.
Could explain the brain activity.

363
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,939
BP and heart rate are dropping.
She's crashing.

364
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,531
She's stabilizing.

365
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,914
Get her up.

366
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,752
All the way up. On her feet.

367
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,351
Make her do that again.

368
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,483
We've started her on
fludrocortisone and ephedrine.

369
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,110
<i>It's Planet of the Apes.</i>

370
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,820
The apes are the humans.
Humans are the apes.

371
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,613
It's Wacky Wednesday,
opposite day.

372
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,199
When you stand up, your BP and heart
rate are supposed to go up. Not...

373
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:09,496
Got it. So, what causes bloody urine,
loss of bladder control, leg pain,

374
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,333
altered mental status and pressure-blood
in direction-wrong?

375
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,793
Pheochromocytoma?

376
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,294
Low catecholamines in the urine

377
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,588
means no pheochromocytoma
in the Jewess.

378
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,550
- Could be systemic sclerosis.
- Mental status.

379
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:22,592
She was praying.

380
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,429
She was in pain.
You no longer think she's crazy?

381
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:29,016
I can see why
she'd be attracted to that life.

382
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,643
You drank the
Manischewitz-flavored Kool-Aid.

383
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,229
I'm not saying I agree.
I'm just saying...

384
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,398
That there's a rational basis
for the irrational.

385
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,191
They have something
that we don't have.

386
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,568
Imaginary friends.

387
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,778
If the toaster's not working,
wiring could be bad.

388
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,655
Which debate is that metaphor
supposed to help us with?

389
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,073
Electrical problem
in the heart.

390
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,825
Arrhythmia messes
with her blood flow when she stands,

391
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,326
causes low BP and heart rate.

392
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,705
Could also impact
mental status, everybody's happy.

393
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,421
Run an EP study of her heart.
Find where the wiring's verklempt.

394
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,801
I went by your hotel this morning.
They told me you moved out.

395
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,766
You moved in with CB?

396
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,679
No. Apparently,
I moved in with you.

397
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,474
The very fact that you're resisting
my insight proves to me that...

398
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,809
House. You're right.

399
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:16,438
Why not?
Why not date you? It's brilliant.

400
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,689
We've known
each other for years,

401
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,067
we've put up with all
kinds of crap from each other,

402
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:23,070
and we keep coming back.
We're a couple.

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,821
Are we still
speaking metaphorically?

404
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,407
Amber is exactly what I need.

405
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,202
And you would agree
if you weren't mired in self-loathing,

406
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,037
topped with a thin crust
of megalomania.

407
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,874
Hey. That's my best friend's
girl you're talking about.

408
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,210
I was wrong.

409
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,503
House. You're right.

410
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:44,591
She's not me. Well, she is me.
But, that's not why she's attractive.

411
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,469
She's a needy version of me.

412
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,806
It's hard to imagine
such a mythical creature.

413
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,475
You started seeing her
right after I fired her.

414
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,560
I started seeing her
four months ago.

415
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,354
She told Kutner
it was four weeks.

416
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,857
You lied to me.
There was money on the line.

417
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,743
Because I knew how you'd react and I
knew you wouldn't pay me, anyway.

418
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,529
You knew that I was right.

419
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:09,616
She wasn't needy.
She was in a bad situation.

420
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,409
There's a difference.

421
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,161
Not to your libido.

422
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,334
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Why are you doing this?

423
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,129
Every time I agree with you,
you find a new argument.

424
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,381
What are you trying to avoid?

425
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:31,972
Well, if you'd looked at me with those
flashing eyes before I was involved...

426
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,682
C'est <i>Ia vie.</i>

427
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:38,270
And I use the French
because you're an ass.

428
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,694
Right atrium normal,
no arrhythmia.

429
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,614
You can become a D'har Master.
Does that require further explanation?

430
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,366
Right ventricle normal.

431
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,535
In college,
I was really into science fiction.

432
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,829
Not like the guys
with the $600 prosthetic ears,

433
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,035
who could swear in Romulan.

434
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,683
That was embarrassing to the rest of us

435
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,625
who just thought
it was good, smart literature.

436
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,043
I went to one convention.

437
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,838
By senior year, I was D'har Master in
the Klingon Empire.

438
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,203
I'm not going
to become Hasidic.

439
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,634
I'm not even going to become
slightly more Reform.

440
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,303
Coronary sinus normal.

441
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,430
You can't have your eyes
opened to something and not act on it.

442
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:18,768
I haven't had my eyes opened. I just
don't think they're crazy anymore.

443
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,688
Then they have
something to offer.

444
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,066
She's living proof that sane people
can make radical changes, but House...

445
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,484
He thinks that he can bully...

446
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,738
I'm sorry?

447
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,623
I think she's telling you
to stop deflecting.

448
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,453
Evil tongue. Gossip.

449
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,289
It's okay. Thanks to the sedative,
you won't remember it.

450
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,333
Words are permanent.

451
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,420
Someday, you'll say something
that you wish you could take back.

452
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,676
Hiss bundle is normal.
Pathways are all clean. No arrhythmias.

453
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,262
If the toaster doesn't work
and the wiring in the house is fine,

454
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,181
problem's got to be
in the city's power grid.

455
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,683
Autonomic nerve disorder.
Could be Riley-Day Syndrome.

456
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,268
Congratulations
on your wedding.

457
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,813
You have a rare
and incurable degenerative disease.

458
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll set her up for
a thermoregulatory sweat test.

459
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,402
She's bisexual.

460
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,404
What?

461
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:15,158
I could hear them talking
from inside the MRI.

462
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,285
Hear who? I heard the word sex.

463
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,995
It was interesting.

464
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,956
- What was interesting?
- It doesn't matter.

465
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,681
We're doctors, we never know what's
going to matter. She said sex.

466
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,586
If she wants to tell you,
when she wakes up...

467
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,298
Yeah. These people aren't
going to change you at all.

468
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,427
I need you
to sleep with Wilson.

469
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,887
Good morning.

470
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,974
He's involved with
an inappropriate woman.

471
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:42,894
His people are sheep herders,
and Amber's are cattlemen?

472
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,729
He's combined two
of his worst qualities.

473
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,481
His love
for me and his love for need.

474
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,149
And as administrator
of this hospital,

475
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,485
you have to save
your star oncologist.

476
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,444
Wish I could help.

477
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,281
But as administrator, there are
some people in accounting

478
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm scheduled
to sleep with first.

479
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,495
Wilson has a pattern
with women.

480
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,582
He saves them, then he betrays them,
which then causes guilt,

481
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,751
which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

482
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:11,339
For example, a hospital bureaucrat
nearing 40 who has no personal life.

483
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,924
I suggest you go braless.

484
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,012
I get that "sleep with" is your way
of saying I should talk to him...

485
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,596
No, I really mean "sleep with."

486
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:22,642
You're not worried this relationship
will fail, you're worried it'll succeed.

487
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,604
That Wilson will no longer
be at your beck and call 2417.

488
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,565
That your best friend
will change.

489
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,484
People don't change
just because they wish they could.

490
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,571
And it bugs you
that he wishes he could.

491
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,198
You'll never lose
your friend, House.

492
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:40,452
You're the long-distance
runner of neediness.

493
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,082
As the chamber heats up, Roz's
body temperature should also rise,

494
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,002
making her sweat and turning
the powder purple.

495
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,046
No change in color
means no sweating,

496
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,466
which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

497
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,092
I shouldn't see her like this.

498
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,428
We could have a diagnosis
as soon as she comes out of the chamber.

499
00:27:58,553 --> 00:27:59,637
It might be better
if you stayed.

500
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,639
It's disrespectful.

501
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,516
I'm sure she imagined

502
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,227
the first time her husband
would see her bare like this,

503
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,396
would be celebrating
their marriage.

504
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,065
Given the circumstances,

505
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,693
I think Roz would
sacrifice modesty to have you with her.

506
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,780
Please. Don't do that.

507
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,699
What? I think it's nice
that you're here.

508
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,826
- I think...
- You think it's sweet

509
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,079
that I care for her modesty,

510
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:27,123
but that it's archaic
and ultimately irrelevant.

511
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,418
Our traditions aren't
just blind rituals. They...

512
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,214
They mean something.
They have a purpose.

513
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,678
I respect my wife.

514
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,808
And I respect her body.

515
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,104
Her body temperature's
stopped climbing.

516
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,063
What's going on?

517
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:52,565
She's having a seizure.
Need a crash cart!

518
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,734
Blankets, too! She's freezing.

519
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,573
She was supposed
to sweat. And she froze.

520
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,034
<i>Return to the Planet of the Apes.</i>

521
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,078
Hypothermia caused the seizure.

522
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,413
What caused the hypothermia?

523
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,789
Could be infection.

524
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,416
Her white blood cell count was fine.

525
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,543
When she was admitted.
She could have picked something up here.

526
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,670
A complication
on a complication?

527
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,797
Her body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

528
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,757
Her body is Wilson.

529
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,008
How do we respond to that?

530
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,593
We accept that he's happy.

531
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,761
We do the opposite.

532
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,888
So, you want us to what?
Send the patient home?

533
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:27,684
An infection means that something's
been added to the body.

534
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,979
Something that should be expelled.
What's the opposite of that?

535
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,691
Something missing from the body.
Could be an enzyme or a hormone.

536
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,734
Cortisol. Could be Addison's.

537
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,027
It fits.

538
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,488
Every symptom.

539
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,907
I'll run a cortisol
stimulation test.

540
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,625
Are you sure she doesn't want to just
take you back to her lair,

541
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,962
hang you upside-down,
and deposit her eggs in you?

542
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,756
Excellent disguise, House.

543
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,926
You two are really
that serious?

544
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,346
She's pretty. She's funny.
Maybe she's a little more...

545
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,306
Evil?

546
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,183
Aggressive than
you'd expect for me.

547
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:12,854
But, I'm happy. Can't I just enjoy
what that feels like for a while?

548
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,397
How many people
have looked at you trustingly

549
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,316
while you gave them
a fatal prognosis?

550
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,028
But you knew it was kinder
to tell them the truth.

551
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,198
Amber compulsively
looks out for number one.

552
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,034
You compulsively look out
for the person that you're with.

553
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:30,747
Your needs are going to feed
her needs until all that's left

554
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,833
is a Wilson chalk outline
on the floor.

555
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,213
Sorry.

556
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,968
Wow.

557
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:50,850
That cortisol stuff is great.
Does it work on everything?

558
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,215
I take it
you're feeling better.

559
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,896
Still weak, but, yeah.

560
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,693
You must be so tired.
You should go home and get some sleep.

561
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,237
I'll stay.

562
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,574
I never told you,

563
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:10,161
but you are much better looking
than Mrs. Silver led me to expect.

564
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,810
She never liked me.
When I was eight,

565
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,790
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

566
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,126
Your abdomen's
a little swollen.

567
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,628
Is it serious?

568
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:21,256
It's hard to say. Sometimes
it can mean a liver issue.

569
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,216
We'll have to test.

570
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:27,095
Oh. Oh, dizziness is getting...

571
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,306
She's going into shock,
I need another liter of saline!

572
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,558
Type and cross two units!

573
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,685
What's happening to her?

574
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,186
She's bleeding internally.

575
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,609
She's saying the Sh'ma.
She thinks she's dying.

576
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,824
The MRA
shows you're bleeding internally,

577
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,576
but not where it's coming from.

578
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,370
The blood can only
keep you stable for so long.

579
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:56,124
Our best option
is to open you up and search.

580
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,250
But you can fix it.

581
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,127
If we find the leak.

582
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,298
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

583
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,800
No.

584
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,218
But it could keep you
alive long enough

585
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,179
so Dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

586
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,686
No.

587
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,815
I don't want to have
the surgery.

588
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,818
It's the only chance
you've got.

589
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,447
I don't want to have
the surgery until after sunset.

590
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,909
I'm probably
going to die, anyway.

591
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,872
I just want to share
one Shabbat with my husband.

592
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:46,049
Roz, please.
The Torah commands us to preserve life.

593
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,262
I waited 38 years to find what I wanted.

594
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,516
I can wait another eight hours.

595
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,190
And I'll leave the rest
to God, okay?

596
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,991
I had her rabbi call.
She's adamant.

597
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,620
She's not a masochist.
She's suicidal.

598
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,538
Nice work, Chase.

599
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,167
Yeah, I should have
had twin rabbis call. Can I go?

600
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,627
We need you.

601
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:28,257
So, instead of a few days, we now have
a few hours to figure this out.

602
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:30,176
- Nice work, Chase.
- Why do you need me?

603
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:34,180
Saying, "Nice work, Chase"
when you're not here is pointless.

604
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,265
Seriously. We need you.

605
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,156
We should X-ray for
malformations of the rib

606
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,630
that could cause arterial twisting.

607
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,733
Malformations don't
cause bloody urine.

608
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,318
She's not suicidal.

609
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,612
She made a commitment
to a new life with her husband,

610
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,699
and she wants
one meaningful experience in that life.

611
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,866
She just met the guy.

612
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,452
Taub just met her and he's already
so in love he's ready to let her die

613
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,977
and take her back
to the home planet

614
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,290
for a burial in
the lava sea of Tormiad.

615
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,084
It's who he might be.

616
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,920
She's connecting with all the years
she's not going to have.

617
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:09,799
A better way of connecting to those
years is to actually have them.

618
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,344
You want more time?

619
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,015
Joshua got God to make
the sun stand still.

620
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,600
No reason
God can't speed it up.

621
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,148
And by God,
I, of course, mean you.

622
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,902
Told you we needed you.

623
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,612
It's sundown, Roz.

624
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,426
We're taking you back to your room
for your candlelight dinner.

625
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,452
Ready? One, two, three.

626
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,039
It's too early.

627
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:45,835
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

628
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,812
<i>Good shabbos, Roz.</i>

629
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:09,984
So, you pray, scarf down some challah,
then we can do this?

630
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,125
You wanted to see me?

631
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,338
And you came.

632
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:34,175
I feel pretty confident
it'll be something interesting.

633
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,347
Solve this case
and the job is yours.

634
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:42,892
Is there a "Drop Wilson"
clause attached to this?

635
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,978
Standard contract
all employees sign.

636
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:59,242
Why do you have to believe
I have an ulterior motive?

637
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:04,497
For the same reason I believe a crack
whore is going to have sex for crack.

638
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,877
All my life,

639
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,714
I thought I had
to choose between

640
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,217
love and respect.

641
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,886
And I chose respect.

642
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,098
And with Wilson,

643
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,977
I know what it's like
to have both.

644
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,816
And that beats a fellowship.

645
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,085
Could be DIC.

646
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,925
You've changed.

647
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,176
I hope so.

648
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:04,891
Normal platelet count
rules out DIC. Good try, though.

649
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,308
I read that
a hydatid cyst could...

650
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,685
Would affect the lungs,
not the bladder.

651
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,022
I tested her
white cell count again. Normal.

652
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,190
How long till we get
to cut her open?

653
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:57,109
When I left, he was still singing
Eshet something.

654
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:01,697
It's the husband's blessing of his wife.
He calls her Eshet Chayil.

655
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,158
Woman of Valor.

656
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:08,704
"Strength and honor are her clothing.
She laughs at the future."

657
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,248
Because she's an idiot.

658
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,211
Volvulus of the small intestine
could cause bleeding.

659
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,838
She would have
had constipation.

660
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,927
Her value isn't beyond pearls, either.
Because dead people have no value.

661
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,220
Polycythemia vera.

662
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,180
RBC count would be higher.

663
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:29,350
I need to bring
the light to my face.

664
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,485
Thrombocytopenia.
If it's autoimmune...

665
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,736
Titers were normal.

666
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,530
Parkinson's would
explain the hypothermia.

667
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,241
Not the bloody urine.

668
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,412
The woman's not just a masochist,
she's a hypocrite.

669
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:52,790
The commandment to preserve life
comes before all others.

670
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,335
Actually means she's not a masochist.
She's not following all the rules.

671
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,795
Just the ones that please her.

672
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,215
Right. She walked in crazy and explained
how ritual trumps living,

673
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,980
and you decide
it's a beautiful lifestyle.

674
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,802
I know. She's wrong,

675
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,554
but, if there's nothing more...

676
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,305
Then, the only meaning is here.

677
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,516
But if she thinks
God is there for her,

678
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:14,311
if she lives her life
believing that God is there...

679
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,063
Then, she dies.

680
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:24,321
Things aren't where we want them to be,
just because we want them to be there.

681
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:32,621
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

682
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:36,625
Hey. Stop that Jew.

683
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,589
Chase hates working on shabbos.
I'm going to make this easier for him.

684
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:42,757
Stand her up.

685
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,091
She doesn't do
so well on her feet.

686
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,260
Neither do I. Stand her up.

687
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,155
You can tell all the ladies
at the Mikvah about this.

688
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,202
What did you do?

689
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,164
What are you doing?

690
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:20,544
Put your hand here. Press hard.

691
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:34,350
You have nephroptosis.
Also known as "floating kidney."

692
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,060
The kidney is like
a chandelier.

693
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:39,188
It's attached to a ceiling
of intestines and blood vessels.

694
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,065
But your contractor,

695
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,193
I think you know who he is,
he hung it with a cheap chain.

696
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,195
It's been hanging
sloppy for years.

697
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,655
Finally,
something shook it loose.

698
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,199
After that,
every time you stood,

699
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:52,284
your kidney dropped
a few centimeters.

700
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,536
That caused all
of your symptoms.

701
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:54,995
None of the scans picked it up.

702
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:57,164
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

703
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,130
She would have been lying down
in surgery, too.

704
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,668
They'd never have found it.

705
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,919
Good chance
she'd never come out.

706
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,045
She'll be all right?

707
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,421
Ultrasound to confirm.

708
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,174
Then, tell Chase to put the kidney
back on the shelf.

709
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,218
The bleed will be nearby.

710
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,554
That's it?

711
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:13,681
<i>Maze! Tov.</i>

712
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:14,932
Couple hours surgery,

713
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,726
you'll be ready to push out
those 14 children.

714
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,233
You do it both ways, right?

715
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,193
- What?
- The ultrasound.

716
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,279
You do it standing up
and lying down.

717
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,324
What else would I mean?

718
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:52,469
I've decided you could do worse
than a female proxy for me.

719
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,611
So, you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

720
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,487
- No.
- You think I've changed

721
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,489
- or Amber's changed?
- Nope.

722
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:14,116
Then, you've changed.

723
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,119
If you do change, can it be the part
of you that chases me down halls

724
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,913
trying to change me?

725
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,456
Do you know what this means?

726
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,292
That you made
one good dating choice.

727
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:26,337
The fabric of the space-time
continuum could unravel.

728
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,216
My world could expand.
I could form

729
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,594
a long-term connection,
that isn't with you.

730
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,097
And since you put the darkest possible
construction on everything,

731
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,600
you could end up
losing a friend.

732
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,519
You've thought of all this.

733
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:47,316
And yet, you're going
along with it.

734
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,238
Are you being self-sacrificing?

735
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:56,367
I'll sacrifice a lab rat.

736
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,035
I'll sacrifice a fly.

737
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,247
I'll sacrifice $200
on a mudder at Monmouth Park.

738
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,374
I don't sacrifice self.

739
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,460
Shabbat shalom, Wilson.

740
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,214
<i>Shabbat shalom, House.</i>
