1
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:02,754
<i>Previously on House.</i>

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,005
<i>I don't know how I got here.</i>

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>I saw a symptom
before the crash.</i>

4
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,509
Why was I taking a bus?

5
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,804
<i>Medical hypnosis can bring
the brain to a Class 2 Theta state.</i>

6
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,847
You're taxing
an already injured brain.

7
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,433
Someone's dying
because I can't remember...

8
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,477
It was Amber.

9
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:18,895
She was on the bus with me.

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,772
She's the one who's dying.

11
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,443
Her heart won't stop racing.
No idea what's causing it.

12
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,445
Sure it wasn't the bus
that landed on her?

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,488
It's not trauma.

14
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,032
She was stable post-op.
This didn't start until an hour ago.

15
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:31,991
My God.

16
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:33,535
Delayed reaction to the trauma.

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,495
She lost both her kidneys
in the bus crash,

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,871
ripped up her femoral artery.

19
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:40,250
We fixed the artery,
got her on dialysis for the kidneys.

20
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,544
Whatever's doing this to her heart,
it isn't from the crash.

21
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:43,795
- Check her potassium?
- Of course.

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,963
Why didn't you call me?

23
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,382
She's been under the whole time.
She had no ID.

24
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,134
- Pushed adenosine?
- And verapamil.

25
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,677
And floated a Swan an hour ago.

26
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,095
Coronary angiography?

27
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,660
Three critical patients
ahead of her.

28
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,182
We'll have her in
within the hour.

29
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,907
We're fifteen minutes away
from Princeton-Plainsboro by ambulance.

30
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,854
You want to move her?
Her heart rate is 130.

31
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,148
She's hemodynamically stable.
We're moving her.

32
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,734
You're not her doctor,
you can't make that decision.

33
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:09,863
Her husband can.

34
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,824
Right?

35
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,077
Move her.

36
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:19,330
If the trauma
didn't damage her heart...

37
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,749
Why was she on the bus?

38
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:21,791
I don't know.

39
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,418
If she had
any underlying condition,

40
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,919
the accident could
have exacerbated it.

41
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:25,962
Why were you with her?

42
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,046
I don't know.

43
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:29,090
I'm not hiding anything,
I just don't remember.

44
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,050
What else could
damage her heart?

45
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,262
Wilson. Don't get lost.

46
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,473
I'm barely coherent.
I need your help right now.

47
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,351
V-fib.

48
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,564
Charging-

49
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,774
Okay. Okay.

50
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,276
- Clear!
- Wait. Wait! Wait!

51
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:50,904
Protective hypothermia.

52
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,072
You want to freeze her?
Her heart's not beating.

53
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,407
Her heart's already damaged.

54
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,853
You restart it,
it'll keep racing,

55
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,911
shoot off free radicals
and kill her brain.

56
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:01,873
We ice her down, put her on bypass
until you've diagnosed her.

57
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,919
This is not a solution.
All you're doing is pressing pause.

58
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,546
It gives you more time
to find the diagnosis.

59
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,465
House. This is Amber.

60
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,053
Please.

61
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,223
Cold saline solution.

62
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,298
Core temperature down to 90.

63
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,637
Bypass circulating.

64
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,308
She's stable.

65
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,854
Why are we doing this?

66
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,107
Bought us time to think.

67
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,786
The trauma must have stimulated
a pre-existing heart condition.

68
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,580
Auto-immune,
congenital anomaly,

69
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,498
blood-clotting disorder,
lead poisoning...

70
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,458
Could be anything.

71
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,293
Great. Let's explore that.

72
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,711
Quick, get her on panacea.

73
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,547
We can narrow it down
by looking for arterial blockages.

74
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,215
How? On an echo?

75
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,101
Can't see wall motion
when there's no motion.

76
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,345
EKG? Nope, heart's in
the off position.

77
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,305
Thallium uptake scan?
Useless on a cold heart.

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,390
Yeah, we get it.
Her heart's not beating.

79
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,683
It's gonna make it
harder to diagnose.

80
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,977
On the other hand, she's not gonna die
while you're whining about it.

81
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:28,937
What else?

82
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,397
There is another way
to narrow it down.

83
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,442
If you really did see
a symptom in Amber before the crash,

84
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,278
physostigmine
helped your memory last time.

85
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,406
Why not cyanide?
He's a mess, he needs to sleep.

86
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,742
I had a heart attack
this morning.

87
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,369
I can't do
any more drugs till lunch.

88
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,163
Get her an angiogram. It could
show damage even in a stopped heart.

89
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,706
Rest of you,
search her apartment.

90
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,750
Toxins, heavy metals, drugs...

91
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,086
Anything that might
make her heart race.

92
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,649
I need to know
if there's anything medically relevant

93
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,734
that you couldn't
share publicly.

94
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,363
Is this
a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?

95
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,031
You were obviously
drinking last night.

96
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,117
Maybe you took Amber to a bar?

97
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,202
I left here on my motorcycle.
Alone.

98
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,080
You ended up drunk on a bus.
Together.

99
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,540
Maybe you met Amber in the bar?

100
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,583
I was not having
an affair with her.

101
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,086
You can't really say that
if you don't remember.

102
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,171
I lost four hours,
not four months.

103
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,841
Maybe it was the first time.

104
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,178
If you drank together,
any chance you did any drugs?

105
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,935
I'll run a tox screen.

106
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,495
You coming?

107
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,582
Correspondence.
Letters to patients.

108
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,709
She could have caught something
from one of them.

109
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,836
Copy it to a thumb drive.
Let's get out of here.

110
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,839
Travel. Do you know if she's been
out of the country recently?

111
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:23,217
It's just video clips.
Maybe she narrates where they are.

112
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,055
<i>And action!</i>

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,223
Looks like
she didn't travel very far.

114
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,184
<i>- You look beautiful.
- You look nervous.</i>

115
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,311
<i>I've never done this before.</i>

116
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:36,272
<i>I have. Trust me.
You'll love it.</i>

117
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,320
- Hey.
- Not even close to relevant.

118
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,975
As long as we don't know
what's wrong,

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,456
we don't know what's relevant.

120
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,584
Yeah, maybe they're having sex
on a pile of asbestos.

121
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,794
Go watch it.

122
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,878
If we were in
a stranger's house,

123
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:00,129
you'd be watching the video.

124
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,840
You altered your behavior
because you're friends with her.

125
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,926
Are you okay?

126
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,719
We shouldn't be
treating her at all.

127
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,431
I'm gonna search her bathroom.

128
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,666
Are you okay?

129
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,879
Can't really say "yes"
when it's a hallucination asking.

130
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,132
Don't worry,
you're just dreaming.

131
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,176
What symptom did I see in you?

132
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,638
- A myoclonic jerk.
- Boring.

133
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,475
An incredibly rare
neurological symptom is boring?

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,435
Am I in someone else's
subconscious?

135
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:59,772
What did we do last night?

136
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,911
Was I meeting you for a drink?

137
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,580
Is that all it was?

138
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,878
A man thinks
a woman is beautiful,

139
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,755
admires her intelligence,

140
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:29,594
admires the way she has to get
whatever she wants.

141
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,722
The things he likes
about himself.

142
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:40,104
And maybe she always had
a little thing for him.

143
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,317
His mind, his blue eyes.

144
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:49,155
But someone gets between them.

145
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:53,159
So they decide
to meet one night

146
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,328
at an out-of-the-way
little bar...

147
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,247
Does that sound familiar?

148
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,880
Do I feel familiar?

149
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,261
What do you feel?

150
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:17,850
Electricity.

151
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,148
Electricity.

152
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,942
I know I saw the symptom.

153
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,278
I know the memory is locked in my brain,
now I know how to get it.

154
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,780
No.

155
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,406
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

156
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,991
You need to rest.

157
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,246
I have yet to hear about any study
linking electricity and rest.

158
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,997
Deep brain stimulation.

159
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:40,998
It's been proven.

160
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,334
Electrical impulses
applied directly to the hypothalamus

161
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,580
can evoke detailed memories.

162
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,586
My mistake.

163
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,629
Drilling a hole

164
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:50,174
and shooting lightning bolts into an
already cracked skull is very restful.

165
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,717
It's not fatal at all.

166
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,511
She's right. You need to sleep.

167
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,431
Brain activity spiked.

168
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,058
Amber?

169
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,686
Amber? It's me.

170
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,771
Random spikes are common.

171
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:04,730
Shut up.

172
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,609
It's gonna be okay.

173
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,446
I'm here with you.

174
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,867
The team has found something.

175
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,161
Can you ask her
if we can be excused?

176
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,377
What?

177
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,758
The coronary angio
was negative.

178
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,302
So was the tox screen.

179
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,804
That's what you found?
Negative tests?

180
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,181
I could have told you
she doesn't do drugs.

181
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,519
I found these in her apartment.
Sorry.

182
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,647
Prescription diet pills,
SSRis, amphetamines.

183
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,650
Diet pills cause structural damage
to the mitral valve,

184
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,277
could explain the tachycardia.

185
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,528
She'd have to be an addict

186
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,739
to take enough for her
to damage her heart. I'd know.

187
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:57,158
Did you know she was hiding them
in her vitamins?

188
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,409
We have to warm her back up,

189
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,578
get her heart beating
so we can do a CT to confirm.

190
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,288
No. We've been over this.

191
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,914
Starting her heart
could cause brain damage,

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,709
could burn out
the heart muscle.

193
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,753
Test her heart
without starting it.

194
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,464
Crack her chest open. Reach
a finger inside the pulmonary vein,

195
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,215
run it across the valve.

196
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:14,884
That's the safer course?

197
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,302
It is if we're wrong.

198
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,596
When did we start assuming
we're wrong?

199
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,390
If this were
any other patient...

200
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,893
If the valve is calcified,
that's our answer,

201
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,436
that's our cure. Go.

202
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,485
Thirteen.

203
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,864
Who found the diet pills?

204
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,324
Kutner.

205
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,035
You didn't even go
in the bathroom, did you?

206
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,954
You're suddenly mute
in the differentials.

207
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,915
A blow-up doll
would be more useful.

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,999
And yes, that's the first time

209
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,127
I've ever implied something negative
about a blow-up doll.

210
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,337
It's Amber. I don't...

211
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,671
Normally, I'd be fascinated.

212
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,215
Today, don't care.

213
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,717
Get over whatever it is
and do your job.

214
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,234
Wait. Look at her eye.

215
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,487
She's jaundiced.

216
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,738
Her liver's not working.

217
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,782
Diet pills
don't kill the liver.

218
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,785
Put her back in ICU.

219
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,859
Liver failure means
whatever this thing is, it's spreading.

220
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,235
Despite the fact
that she's frozen.

221
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,170
Hepatic and heart failure
could mean anti-trypsinase deficiency.

222
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,047
We can stick
a needle in her liver.

223
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,507
We see fibrosis, she's right.

224
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,300
Does Amber drink sherry?

225
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,970
Nocardia fits just as well,

226
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,555
but there's no way we can tell,

227
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,265
since we can't
take her temperature.

228
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,518
I had a dream
she was pouring me a glass.

229
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,771
And since I'm a scotch, beer,
gin and rum man...

230
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,066
If we warm her back up, we should be
able to tell if she's got an infection.

231
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,443
Yes, we can get a diagnosis

232
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:58,571
by letting the disease
run rampant until it kills her.

233
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,948
If it's spreading,
we need to slow this even more.

234
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,451
We've got to
cool her down further.

235
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:10,708
I know you love her
and you're scared she's going to die.

236
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,753
But just making her colder
and colder isn't a cure.

237
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,590
It's not dealing
with the reality.

238
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,176
Sherry means something.

239
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,844
Amber doesn't
even drink sherry.

240
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,721
House, can we get back to...

241
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,932
If she did drink sherry, it would
mean nothing, but since she doesn't,

242
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,602
my subconscious is obviously
trying to make some other point.

243
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,688
There's a Sharrie's Bar on Third,
right off the bus route.

244
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,157
Wilson's right.
We need to make her colder.

245
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,618
Putting more ice on her
is just delaying the diagnosis.

246
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,913
Not on, in.
Fill her lungs with slurry.

247
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:49,872
Where are you going?

248
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,916
Taking Wilson out for a drink.

249
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,302
Is this the place?

250
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,386
Maybe.

251
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:10,476
Hey.
I assume you are here for these.

252
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,565
Did you see me here
with a tall, blonde woman?

253
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,361
Yeah, I think she joined you
after scotch number seven.

254
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,612
Did she seem sick?

255
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,322
She sneezed.

256
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,115
I gave her a napkin.

257
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,450
Did you see
the color of the sputum?

258
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,619
I assume sputum means snot.

259
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,829
Look, I see lots
of drunk chicks in here.

260
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:34,542
I didn't have time to stop and analyze
the color of your girlfriend's boogers.

261
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,418
She's not
my girlfriend, genius.

262
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,296
She was hot,
you seemed into her

263
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,673
and she bought you drinks.

264
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,508
Last night,
she was your girlfriend.

265
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:52,685
Blood in her sputum. It could
mean parasites. Any recent travel?

266
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,395
You seemed into her?

267
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,147
If he had a brain,
he wouldn't be tending bar.

268
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,774
Sneezing's a new symptom.

269
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,402
Let's assume the runny nose
means an infection.

270
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,030
What did House have to say?

271
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,991
He told me
I was raised by wolves,

272
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,077
and that's why I use the same hand
for my fork and knife.

273
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,495
Whoa.

274
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,872
Not that one. The slurry tube.

275
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,171
I know this is different.
But it's not.

276
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,132
Everyone dies.

277
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,134
She's not dead.

278
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,928
You're reacting this way
because she might be soon.

279
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,514
Yeah. I am. Why aren't you?

280
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,142
I'm an Indian guy named Kutner.

281
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,103
Ever wonder
what happened to my parents?

282
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,069
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- I was six years old.

283
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,108
I used to like helping out
in my parent's store after school.

284
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,568
A guy walks in
to rob the place,

285
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,111
ends up shooting them both.

286
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,696
Wasn't fair.

287
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:50,117
Took years, but I had to accept
that's just the way it was.

288
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,455
So, you gonna help me
fill her lungs up, or not?

289
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:10,137
Tell me the liver biopsy
showed infiltrates, minor inflammation.

290
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,472
Yeah. How...

291
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,433
Snot on a napkin.

292
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,018
Add the heart,
the infiltrates...

293
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,478
Hep B.

294
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,190
Start her on IV interferon.
I'll go tell Wilson.

295
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,232
Good idea.

296
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,985
And I'll go nap,
because I was concussed last night

297
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,862
and had a heart attack
this morning.

298
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,114
I'll tell Wilson. You go sleep.

299
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,219
Hepatitis B
is a lame diagnosis.

300
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,806
Oh, God, I get less rest
when I'm asleep.

301
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,018
I rise from the dead
and that's reaction I get?

302
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,186
I'm sorry. If I had known,

303
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,814
I would have started
a breakaway Jewish sect.

304
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,399
Hep B fits.

305
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,485
Why are you doing that?

306
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,779
Because Hep B doesn't fit.

307
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,709
Turn her over.

308
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,914
We're about to start
her second course of interferon.

309
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,964
Which she might not need
once you turn her over.

310
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,013
The small of her back.

311
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,850
She's bruised.
Why is that significant?

312
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,727
Look closer.

313
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,312
A rash.

314
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,232
How'd you know
what was on the small of her back?

315
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:49,903
Well, either I'm still asleep,
or I'm starting to remember.

316
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,162
Looks like an influenza rash.

317
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,372
The flu wouldn't be killing
the organs one by one.

318
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,749
Dermatomyositis.

319
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,417
Wouldn't speed up her heart.

320
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,128
Maybe it's an allergic reaction
to the interferon?

321
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:10,174
Yes, the symptom I saw on the bus
was a rare interferon allergy

322
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,051
that flares up
two days before you take it.

323
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,930
How'd you see
the rash down there?

324
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,975
I don't know.
Maybe she leaned over.

325
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,853
Maybe it's not a rash at all.
Could be an abscess.

326
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,299
Thirteen,
stick a needle in there.

327
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,689
If there's pus,
Foreman's right.

328
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,149
Ultrasound is safer.

329
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,318
I'm not asking you to stick
a needle all the way through her.

330
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,320
- Taub, you do it.
- No. Wait, I can do it.

331
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,363
No, apparently, you can't.

332
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,581
It's not fluctuant.

333
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,668
Clear, it's not pus.

334
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,378
Means it's vesicular.

335
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,297
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

336
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,802
We had dinner with a friend last week.
We walked their dogs.

337
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,137
I guess she could've
gotten a tick.

338
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,181
It's treatable, doxycycline.

339
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,642
Allow eight hours
for the antibiotics to take effect,

340
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,769
then we warm her up,
shock her heart.

341
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,145
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

342
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,310
If we're wrong,
restarting her heart could kill her.

343
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,607
Run blood cultures first.

344
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,400
Fastest way
to test is to treat.

345
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,046
If we're wrong, still should give us
time to try something else.

346
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,157
We are not starting her heart
until we're 100% certain.

347
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,535
We're never 100% certain.

348
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,290
Run the blood cultures.

349
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,836
After we get confirmation,
we'll restart her heart.

350
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,340
He's wrong.
And you know he's wrong.

351
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,718
You can't change your mind just because
a family member starts crying.

352
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,053
They're always scared.

353
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,931
I said run the blood cultures.

354
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,826
Sorry. Wide stance.

355
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,247
You're right.

356
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,457
I'm screwing up.

357
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,167
Why are you screwing up?

358
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,419
I didn't even like her.

359
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,004
Did you hate her?

360
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,422
Not enough to want her dead.

361
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,633
So it's not guilt.
That just leaves fear.

362
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,970
A young woman dying.

363
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,974
A young doctor dying, in fact.
That sound familiar?

364
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,189
Yeah, I'm at risk
for Huntington's.

365
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,149
I've dealt with it.

366
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,317
By not getting tested.

367
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,778
Dealing with it
by not dealing with it.

368
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,280
It's clearly
working beautifully.

369
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,908
You're the champion
of not dealing with your problems.

370
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,076
My grandson gave me a mug
that says that.

371
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,246
Okay. Enough hand-holding.

372
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,833
Deal with it, get back in there,
or pack up your stuff.

373
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,210
You're screwing up this case
worse than I am.

374
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,109
House is gonna
kill the patient.

375
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,076
What are you...
What are you doing?

376
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,995
She's up to 80 degrees.

377
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,413
We're gonna restart her heart.

378
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:10,372
No, you're not.

379
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,874
There's still time to undo this.
Cool her back down.

380
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,440
You weren't taking
the safe approach.

381
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,503
We've got to know
if the antibiotics are working.

382
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,296
Her EEG's slowed.

383
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,632
Amber.

384
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,509
Amber.

385
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:26,722
Well done.

386
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:27,681
We still don't know what it is,

387
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,891
but you've just let it spread
to her brain!

388
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,772
This is exactly what I said
would happen. It's in her brain now.

389
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,816
The brain involvement
gives us a new symptom.

390
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,461
That wouldn't be there
if you hadn't...

391
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,070
It's where the disease was going.
We needed to know that.

392
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,556
This was not
your decision to make!

393
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,866
You went behind my back.
You went behind House's back.

394
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,117
Inside voices.

395
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,785
House wanted to warm her up.

396
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,747
You just quilted him
into changing his mind.

397
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,668
Heart, liver, rash
and now her brain.

398
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,506
Auto-immune fits best.
Crash trauma could've set it off.

399
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,676
Start her on prednisone,
then we'll warm her up again.

400
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,137
House, if this is
some other infection,

401
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:10,265
the steroids will
trash her immune system.

402
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,438
He's the attending.
You're the family.

403
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,440
Go spend more time
with the patient.

404
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,326
You can't do this.

405
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,578
That's not a good argument.

406
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,456
It's not an argument at all.
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,778
Cuddy's right.
I was afraid to do anything.

408
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:08,865
I thought if everything just stopped,
it would be okay.

409
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,742
And it's gonna be.

410
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,619
Taub's starting treatment,
we're doing everything...

411
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,870
Not everything.

412
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,333
Before you warm her up...

413
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,462
You said you wanted to try
deep brain stimulation.

414
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,089
But there's no reason.

415
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,423
We know the symptom.
We know what I saw.

416
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:26,591
What if it's not the rash?

417
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,802
What if you saw the rash
in the ambulance,

418
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,470
or when we were
putting her on bypass?

419
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,683
What if there is still something else
stuck inside your head?

420
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:45,318
You think I should risk my life
to save Amber's.

421
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,688
I'm inserting the IPG probe
into your ventral hypothalamus.

422
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,274
Give me 3 volts.

423
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:34,701
<i>I can't hear him.</i>

424
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:35,744
<i>Can't hear who?</i>

425
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,662
Everything's
in black and white.

426
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,497
Who was talking?
Ls Amber there?

427
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,751
You're supposed to be jolting
my hypothalamus. Not petting it.

428
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,045
- We don't want to overload it.
- As long as I'm risking my life,

429
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,880
I might as well
be watching a talkie.

430
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,594
Increasing from 3 to 5 volts.

431
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,596
Sending impulse.

432
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,351
You're not getting them back.

433
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,280
Hey! You take my keys,
you gotta give me a phone call.

434
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,792
Who are you calling?

435
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,424
Dial-a-Wilson.

436
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,510
I was on call.

437
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,936
Amber was home.

438
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,190
I told her to find you,
have you pick me up.

439
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,042
I said to find Wilson.

440
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,085
He's working.

441
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,838
And I'm willing to suffer this indignity
on his behalf.

442
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,340
Does she seem sick?

443
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,884
Not yet.

444
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,428
Come on, time to go.

445
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:22,267
Need another round and a drink
for what passes for a lady around here.

446
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,145
- What's your poison?
- Nothing. We're leaving.

447
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,773
We're leaving, leaving, leaving.
Cosmos.

448
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,526
I remember Wilson
buying cranberry juice.

449
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,612
I'll have another,
and she'll have a Cosmopolitan.

450
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,823
The obstinate drunk thing
is not flattering.

451
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,450
Come on, you called for a ride.

452
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,580
Drink your drink,
or I'll drink them both.

453
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:49,336
One, and you leave voluntarily.

454
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,178
Let's go.

455
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,638
Hey! Need another Cosmo, here.

456
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,434
She sneezed.

457
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,311
What color is it?

458
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,645
Thanks.

459
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:17,113
Looks like snot.
Seems like a cold.

460
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,909
Nothing else?

461
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,370
No.

462
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,880
Where are you going?

463
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,256
You think I paid?

464
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,134
House, what are you doing?
You can barely walk.

465
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,553
Go home. I'll take the bus.

466
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:44,432
Hey, someone's gotta pay for this.

467
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,731
Hi.

468
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,319
You forgot something.

469
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,115
Boy, you don't give up, do you?

470
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,117
Yeah, I'm an idiot that way.

471
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,995
You doing this for me,
or for Wilson?

472
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,747
For Wilson.

473
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,750
Well, then,
it's even more impressive.

474
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,174
Damn. Do you have a Kleenex?

475
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,676
I got a sleeve.

476
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,302
I got two, actually.

477
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,764
Gonna need more than that.
I'm getting that nasty flu.

478
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,230
Is that it? The flu?
Is there any rare complication?

479
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,610
No. It'll explain the rash,
but nothing else.

480
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,488
Unless...

481
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,574
What?

482
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,587
Don't do it.

483
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,847
It wasn't the flu.

484
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:10,435
It's what she did for it.
She has amantadine poisoning.

485
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,396
The crash destroyed
her kidneys,

486
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,939
her body couldn't
filter the drugs,

487
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,693
she ODs on amantadine,
explains the heart, the liver...

488
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,489
We just need to start on her dialysis
and flush the drugs out.

489
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,367
What? What's wrong?

490
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,915
Amantadine binds with proteins.

491
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,584
Dialysis can't clear it
out of the blood.

492
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,633
There's nothing we can do.

493
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,264
I'm so sorry.

494
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,565
Amber.

495
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,073
Amber.

496
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,329
He's seizing. Wilson!
I need help, here.

497
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:16,876
House suffered
a complex partial seizure.

498
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:21,756
The violent shaking widened his
skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.

499
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,509
<i>We won't know
if there's any cognitive impairment</i>

500
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,177
<i>until he's out of the coma.</i>

501
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,222
<i>He was right about
the amantadine.</i>

502
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,308
<i>Amber's body
couldn't filter it out.</i>

503
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,229
<i>That's what caused her heart
to beat too fast for too long.</i>

504
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,690
<i>It caused irreparable
structural damage.</i>

505
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:43,111
<i>Didn't matter if they shocked her
or froze her or...</i>

506
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,782
<i>Her heart was dead
once it stopped in that ambulance.</i>

507
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,994
What about a new heart?
Transplant?

508
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:55,164
All of her organs are damaged.
She can't qualify.

509
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,794
There's nothing we can do.
Nothing we could have done.

510
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,056
We should call time of death.

511
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,060
Technically, she's still alive.

512
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,896
Could probably survive
a few more hours on bypass.

513
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,775
We could wean her off anesthesia.
Wake her up.

514
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,821
Give you a chance to...

515
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,737
It'd be cruel. Don't...

516
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:31,284
Wake Amber up. See her again.

517
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,912
Tell her what she means to you.

518
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,124
Wake her up to tell her
that she's...

519
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:48,009
You are waking her up so that
you can both say goodbye to each other.

520
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,637
She would want it.

521
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,564
Hey.

522
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,857
Hey.

523
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,196
You're in the hospital.

524
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:57,036
I'm on bypass.

525
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,414
Yeah.

526
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,126
Do you remember what happened?

527
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,919
I got on the bus.

528
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,303
I shouldn't have gotten
on the bus.

529
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,598
No. No. It's not your fault.

530
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,726
It's not your fault.

531
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,269
How bad?

532
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:27,692
You had tachycardia,
complicated by complete renal failure.

533
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:36,325
The tachycardia degenerated into V-fib,
followed by hepatic failure.

534
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:51,966
The flu pills...

535
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,679
Yeah.

536
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:02,685
I'm dead.

537
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,065
I love you.

538
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,445
I love you, too.

539
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,921
We should say goodbye.

540
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,048
She didn't even like us.

541
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,132
We liked her.

542
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,176
Did we?

543
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,595
We do now.

544
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,015
What do we say?

545
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,809
We don't need to say anything.

546
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,020
I'm tired.

547
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,862
I think it's time
to go to sleep.

548
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,031
Just a little longer.

549
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:45,037
We're always gonna want
just a little longer.

550
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,167
I don't think I can do it.

551
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,174
It's okay.

552
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,134
It's not okay.

553
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:01,554
Why is it okay with you?
Why aren't you angry?

554
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:10,396
That's not the last feeling

555
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,441
I want to experience.

556
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,747
BP stable.

557
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:11,791
Still non-responsive.

558
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,751
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

559
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:16,045
Heart rate's normal.

560
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,093
<i>Respiratory rate is...</i>

561
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,194
You're dead.

562
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,488
Everybody dies.

563
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,116
Am I dead?

564
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,748
Not yet.

565
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,209
I should be.

566
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,168
Why?

567
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,005
Because life
shouldn't be random.

568
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:03,551
Because lonely, misanthropic
drug addicts should die in bus crashes,

569
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:07,221
and young do-gooders in love
who get dragged out of their apartment

570
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,099
in the middle of the night
should walk away clean.

571
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,685
Self-pity isn't like you.

572
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:17,231
I'm branching out from
self-loathing and self-destruction.

573
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,193
Wilson is going to hate me.

574
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,281
You kind of deserve it.

575
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,079
He's my best friend.

576
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,372
I know.

577
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,460
What now?

578
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:41,213
I stay here with you.

579
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:42,840
Get off the bus.

580
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,387
- I can't.
- Why not?

581
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,306
Because...

582
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,439
Because it doesn't hurt here.

583
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:03,736
I lied.

584
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:08,282
I don't want to be in pain
and I don't want to be miserable.

585
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,453
And I don't want him
to hate me.

586
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:20,044
Well...
You can't always get what you want.

587
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,330
Hey. I'm here.

588
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:00,167
Blink if you can hear me.

589
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,590
No. Don't try to talk.

590
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,843
Just rest.
