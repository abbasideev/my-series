1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:08,968
You okay?

2
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,261
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,222
Thinking's not gonna
get you to the top.

4
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:13,765
Mom, you're supposed
to be encouraging me.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,600
No, I'm supposed
to be coaching you.

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,725
The slower you go,
the more tired you're gonna get.

7
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,904
There's a hold
about a foot above you on the left.

8
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,988
I know.

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,660
Nice grab!

10
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:36,266
Keep going.
You're almost there, babe.

11
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,706
I can't. My calf's cramping.

12
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,991
You need to get off your toes.

13
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,638
- Get on the ball of your foot.
- I can't.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,129
Yes, you can.
You can get all the way to the top.

15
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,845
It's okay. I got you.
You all right?

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,804
Looks like you were wrong.

17
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,724
Yeah. But you did awesome.
That's the highest you've gotten.

18
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:56,808
I'm proud of you.

19
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:57,976
I don't feel so good.

20
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,853
Okay. Come on down.

21
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,439
Mom?

22
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,567
Mom, are you okay?

23
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,366
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,664
Whoa!
Did you see that? You all right?

25
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,469
- My arm. I think I broke it.
- Don't move.

26
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,792
Oh, Jane, I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,002
What happened?
Did the rope break?

28
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:28,089
No. My hands,
I can't move them.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,005
She's been to an ortho,
two neuros and an immunologist.

30
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,049
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

31
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,717
- You think it's over?
- It's getting worse.

32
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,094
Last neurologist found
intermittent numbness in both arms

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,429
as well as the hand paralysis.

34
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,723
I meant the game. You think
he's gonna keep all four of us?

35
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,810
He said he would. No sign
of upper motor neuron involvement.

36
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,102
He lies.

37
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,771
My ears are burning.

38
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,899
Tell him you're
done firing people.

39
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,194
Well, if I lie,
that would be little reassurance.

40
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,489
Dr. Kutner, who told you
that it would be a good idea

41
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:38,159
to put up superficial representations
of a hypocritical season

42
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,119
celebrating a mythical figure?

43
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,204
It wasn't me.

44
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,122
He lied.

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,584
Homey knows better,
Hymie doesn't care,

46
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,711
and Huntington's
would have done a better job.

47
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,046
I don't have Huntington's.

48
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,651
- That you know of.
- Why would you...

49
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:54,717
Because I got sued
when I called you "honey buns".

50
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,969
Am I fired if I put up...

51
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,428
The point of the game
was to scare us.

52
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:59,055
Telling us it's over isn't scary.

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,599
Therefore, he has no reason
to say that unless it's true.

54
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,229
Good.
Then, can we do a Secret Santa?

55
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,650
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
when you were afraid for your job.

56
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:11,651
So, who's sick?

57
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,611
35-year-old single mom.

58
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,363
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.

59
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,948
- Is there any history of drug use?
- No.

60
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,700
She says there's no history.

61
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,493
She's not a liar.

62
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,704
Okay.
This is gonna be a tough case.

63
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,707
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

64
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:28,084
Everyone lies.
But there's an exception to every rule.

65
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,253
Actually, there isn't.
That's kind of what makes it a rule.

66
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,505
The patient's mother died
of breast cancer when she was seven.

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,070
She never even
knew her mom was sick.

68
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:37,427
She promised herself she would never
hide anything from her own daughter.

69
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,597
Oh. I didn't know
she'd promised.

70
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,599
And we're not her daughter.

71
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,184
The patient inherited
the BRCA1 mutation from her mom.

72
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,562
She had a prophylactic
double mastectomy 10 years ago.

73
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,521
She lied about it.

74
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,481
She told her co-workers.
She told her kid.

75
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,025
She lied to the world.

76
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,550
Reconstructive surgery
is designed to convince people that...

77
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,237
She didn't get
reconstructive surgery.

78
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,115
Okay.
We can rule out breast cancer.

79
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,368
Actually, I was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.

80
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,371
Even the best surgeon can't remove
every cell of breast tissue.

81
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:12,670
MRI what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.

82
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,964
I'm gonna go re-do
the patient history.

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,640
Your mom tell you
about all the drugs she does?

84
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:27,143
She smokes pot once in a while,
but not in a long time.

85
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,311
What about you?

86
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,646
How would that make her sick?

87
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,022
Are you a doctor?

88
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,523
I'm 11.

89
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,653
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.

90
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,697
Drinking?
You ever sneak a drink?

91
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,784
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.

92
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,620
I understand
why you don't want your mom to know.

93
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,247
- But I'm her doctor, so...
- No, I would tell my mom.

94
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,416
- And I would tell you.
- Why?

95
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,835
Because she would
never lie to me.

96
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,131
What's her favorite way
to have sex?

97
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,677
I don't get what sex has to do
with breast cancer.

98
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,970
Are you a doctor?

99
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,639
Did you go to med school
since the last time I asked?

100
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,404
You just think we've
got to be lying to...

101
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,059
- White lies?
- What are those?

102
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,104
Those are lies we tell
to make other people feel better.

103
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,313
I don't lie.

104
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,357
- Rationalizations?
- What are those?

105
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,609
Those are lies we tell
to make ourselves feel better.

106
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,445
- No. We don't...
- Lies of omission?

107
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,825
Saddle, bronc or doggie?

108
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,452
That's sex talk.

109
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:33,042
She used to like being on top,
but now she likes to be on her stomach.

110
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,923
That way she doesn't have to see them
looking at her scars.

111
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,932
It's child abuse.

112
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,392
Honesty?

113
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,812
There's a reason that everybody lies.
It works.

114
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,377
It's what allows
society to function.

115
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,274
It's what separates
man from beast.

116
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,942
Oh, I thought that
was our thumbs.

117
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,228
You want to know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

118
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,573
I'm sorry. I missed rehearsal.
Am I taking the truth-is-good side?

119
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,409
- Don't you usually take that part?
- Lies are a tool.

120
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,244
They can be used
either for good...

121
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,288
Wait. I've got a better one.

122
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,622
Lies are like children.

123
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:14,959
They're hard work but they're worth it
because the future depends on them.

124
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:19,630
You are so full of
love or something.

125
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,635
- When you care about someone...
- You lie to them.

126
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,264
You pretend that their constant,
ponderous musings are interesting.

127
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,590
You tell them they're not losing
their boyish good looks

128
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,726
or becoming worn out and...

129
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,188
I stand corrected. And may I say it's
been a real pleasure chatting with you.

130
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,899
Axilla is clean.
Surgical margins look clear.

131
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:42,028
No lymphadenopathy, no masses,
no nothing. It's not cancer.

132
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,864
We need a new theory.

133
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:45,948
You catch her lying?

134
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:46,949
Not yet.

135
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,743
Wouldn't no have been
a shorter answer?

136
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,871
Wouldn't you not talking
have made this a shorter conversation?

137
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,122
Kid says Mom's a slut.

138
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,082
She called her mom a slut?

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,625
No. I called her mom a slut.

140
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,877
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

141
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,880
Not that I'm judging, here. Given her
medical history, I'm actually impressed.

142
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,091
Maggie already admitted
to having multiple sexual partners.

143
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,051
Which is why we
already tested for, and ruled out,

144
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,428
syphilis and any other STD
that could have caused her symptoms.

145
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,264
STDs aren't the only risk
in risky sex.

146
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,351
The problem in sleeping
with strangers is, they're strange.

147
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,077
We'll follow up
with any recent partners.

148
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,730
Send Foreman and Taub.
They're better liars.

149
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,690
More likely to
get to the truth.

150
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,158
You think I drugged her?
Use a coaster.

151
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,912
We're not cops. Legally,
we don't care one way or another.

152
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,747
But we need to know the truth
so we can help her.

153
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,553
I'd known her for less than an hour
and she offered to take me home.

154
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,001
There was no need to drug her.

155
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,338
Not that I would.

156
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,883
She's gonna be okay, right?

157
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,220
As long as she doesn't
have to pick up or hold anything, yeah.

158
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,557
Sorry. I just had
the floors done. Reclaimed pine.

159
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,896
You always this thirsty?

160
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,606
I don't know.

161
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,900
Water's supposed to
be good for you, right?

162
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,945
Dehydration, anxiety, aggression.

163
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,155
I'm not aggressive.

164
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,657
Spastic chorea
in his right hand.

165
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,450
- What about my hand?
- How much do you weigh?

166
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,411
- About 180, 190?
- 180. What is this?

167
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,913
If you took what she did,
it could take longer to hit you.

168
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,832
It might affect you differently.

169
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,209
But you didn't
give her anything, right?

170
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,046
She was really drunk.

171
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:27,925
I just gave her some E
to help enhance things.

172
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,260
Have any of it left?

173
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:32,638
Is my hand gonna be okay?

174
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,640
There's nothing wrong with it.

175
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,350
We lied.

176
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,858
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

177
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,943
My stomach's also
been bothering me.

178
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,778
I think my glands are swollen.

179
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,282
Saint Nicholas?

180
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,659
Patron saint of children.

181
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:57,663
Also seamen, merchants,
archers, prostitutes and prisoners.

182
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,416
Mmm. He must have been
pretty hard working.

183
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,002
Or just a credit hog.

184
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,462
Open wide.

185
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,089
- Say, "Ah."
- Ah.

186
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,300
You have strep.

187
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,219
Is it contagious?

188
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:14,764
Only for the next 24 hours,
as long as you take the antibiotics.

189
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,182
How contagious?

190
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,934
Take a personal day.

191
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,602
I can't.

192
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,355
I'll write your pimp a note.

193
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,522
My pimp?

194
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,775
You get tested for AIDS
every three months.

195
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,485
And your necklace.

196
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,820
Prostitutes wear religious symbols?

197
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,156
I think they just
like kneeling.

198
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,118
You don't have the skin of a seaman,
the fingers of an archer,

199
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,913
the clothes of a merchant
or the attitude of an ex-con.

200
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:40,456
So, that just leaves one left.

201
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,583
Mmm, two, actually.

202
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,462
But I'm not a child, am I?

203
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,101
You owe me 50 bucks.

204
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,853
Then you owe me
half a lap dance.

205
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:05,606
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.

206
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,068
I got the memo last year.
I want to hire 40 more fellows.

207
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,861
You already fired
the ones you hired?

208
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,530
They work better
when they're scared.

209
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,573
You were right.
Guy slipped her Ecstasy.

210
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,368
- He have any symptoms?
- No.

211
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,294
Kutner's starting the patient
on hemodialysis,

212
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,830
and Thirteen's in the lab
trying to figure out

213
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,040
what the guy put in the drugs.

214
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,586
See? Clear, simple statement of facts

215
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:31,215
describing their cooperation
with absolutely no attitude or fear.

216
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,717
Something's got to be done.

217
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:33,926
Oh, yeah.

218
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,596
How are you feeling?

219
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,390
I still can't move my hands.

220
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,685
It will take a few more hours to cycle
all your blood through the machine.

221
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,770
What just happened?

222
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,897
Nothing. What's wrong?

223
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,358
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.

224
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,943
Didn't they?

225
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,653
What did you do?

226
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,738
Is this from the drugs?

227
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,323
Most of the drugs
should be out of your system by now.

228
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,574
- And our drugs wouldn't...
- I can't see.

229
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:57,616
Do something!

230
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,868
I can't see!

231
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,495
I can't see!

232
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,337
Nothing in the Ecstasy
except Ecstasy.

233
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,713
Well, that never hurt anybody.

234
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,923
Can't make them
blind days later.

235
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,718
Do you spell "Homey"
with a "Y"?

236
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,762
I want to be respectful.

237
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,221
You're actually
gonna let us do Secret Santa?

238
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,432
Not just you guys-

239
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,267
I like presents, too.

240
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,896
Pick a name.

241
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,022
Why are you doing this?

242
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,566
See, this is why
no one likes your people.

243
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,485
The notion of picking
one time of the year

244
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,362
to be decent to other people is obscene

245
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,988
'cause it's actually
validating the notion

246
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,740
of being miserable wretches
the rest of the year.

247
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,265
So, you think this is
the part of the year that's screwed up?

248
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,537
On the other hand, you are now a team.
You've got to work together.

249
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,343
And the simple fact is, giving
people crap makes people like people.

250
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,793
So, spend 25 bucks.
Learn to love.

251
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,879
Blindness could be a complication
from the hemodialysis.

252
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,799
No, the dialysate composition
was within range.

253
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,551
- Sweet.
- Interesting.

254
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,136
The dialysate composition
just indicates...

255
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,098
Indicates nothing. I was referring
to his reaction to the name he got.

256
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,058
I was pleased.
I thought it'd be fun to buy for...

257
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,103
Means there's someone here
it wouldn't be fun to buy for.

258
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,814
I wonder who. Pick a name.

259
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,652
Then go check out
the patient's house.

260
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,154
Interesting.

261
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,073
We're wasting time
going to the home.

262
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,033
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome
fits the symptoms.

263
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,285
No family history of Kearns.
Go to their house.

264
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,538
She would have told us if there were
any other drugs. You met her.

265
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,623
- She couldn't have been more candid.
- You're absolutely right.

266
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,376
- Go to their house...
- MS or a vascular problem fits better.

267
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,961
They could affect
hands and eyes.

268
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,381
Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS.

269
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,759
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.

270
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,805
Oh, and whoever goes to their house,
get me their computers.

271
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,682
You talk to your kid about sex

272
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,017
so she'll think
you're being open about everything.

273
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,687
It keeps her from asking questions about
things you don't want to talk about.

274
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,690
That's right. Her honesty proves
just how dishonest she is.

275
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:56,652
Yes! Exactly who I wanted.
This is gonna be fun.

276
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,453
The dye may sting
when it enters your bloodstream.

277
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,121
Are you scared, Mom?

278
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,622
Yeah.

279
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,541
- Are you?
- Yeah.

280
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,876
Are they?

281
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,421
They don't look scared.

282
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,882
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

283
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,425
We're confident.

284
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,261
Okay if I shift you a bit?
I need to get you into position.

285
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,854
Your boss is weird.

286
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,772
Yeah, he is.

287
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,568
He thought he'd get information
you may not have been telling us by...

288
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:38,903
Being a jerk?

289
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,988
You'd be surprised
how often it works.

290
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,448
Choroidal flush looks good.

291
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,659
Why would people lie to a doctor?

292
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,370
Dozens of reasons to lie.
Only one reason to tell the truth.

293
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:51,248
You're never even tempted?

294
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,337
I mean, lies do sometimes
smooth things out, make life easier.

295
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,589
Yeah? Your life easy?

296
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,925
Not even close.

297
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,054
Dye's reached the retinal capillary bed.
No leakage.

298
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,307
That's good, right?

299
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,893
It means it's not
a vascular problem.

300
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,938
- But?
- A vascular problem we could fix.

301
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,736
They look worried now, Mom.

302
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,533
What's with the Secret Santa?

303
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,034
You trying to
bring them together?

304
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,827
Want to drive them apart.

305
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,621
With gift giving?

306
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,186
Conflict's built
right into the name.

307
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,125
Santa's about sharing.
Secret's about withholding.

308
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,879
Aside from the Trojan horse,
gifts don't usually...

309
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,424
What did you get your wife
for your final anniversary?

310
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,552
- Uh, a sweater.
- She hated it.

311
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:45,636
She loved it.

312
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,304
Then you didn't buy it.

313
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,392
I gave her some cash and...

314
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,397
Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly
how little we know about a person.

315
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,023
And nothing pisses off
a person more

316
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,150
than being shoved
in the wrong pigeonhole.

317
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,236
Nice.

318
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,969
I'm thinking of spending
a few extra bucks on my Secret Santa.

319
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,157
Bad idea.

320
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,743
You mind if I tell House you asked them
for the key instead of breaking in?

321
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,288
- Yes. I do. Just another 5 bucks.
- 5 will be 10.

322
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,039
The key's proof
she doesn't have anything to hide.

323
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,604
The key is proof I didn't do exactly
what House told me to do.

324
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,002
And what do you care
if it's another 15?

325
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,421
I'm gonna tell him.
Who are you so anxious to please?

326
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,089
Not you.

327
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,425
You really think you're gonna prove
people are capable of honesty

328
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,677
using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

329
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,305
I'm not the one who's based
his entire worldview on the proposition.

330
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,391
If I'm wrong, so what?
If he's wrong...

331
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,354
- So, you've got Huntington's?
- Nope.

332
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,359
But House said that...

333
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,600
If I wanted to talk about it,
why didn't I bring it up?

334
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,904
Fluorescein angiogram was clear.
No leaks. No lesions.

335
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,824
Definitely not a vascular problem.

336
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,077
Someone get their birthdays
out of the file.

337
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,871
Have you tried
leaving it blank?

338
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,960
Tough to get into the head of someone
who actually trusts people, huh?

339
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,673
Found both computers in an office
on a desk they share.

340
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,967
No sign of macular degeneration
or optic neuritis.

341
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,385
Her eyes are completely normal.

342
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,137
Except she can't
see out of them.

343
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,431
So she says.

344
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,766
You find anything on the MRI?

345
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,726
No sign of plaques.
It's not MS.

346
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,561
We haven't found anything abnormal
on any tests.

347
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,480
Except she can't see
or move her hands.

348
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,648
So she says.

349
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,067
You can't lie about
flaccid paralysis.

350
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,196
Maybe she's not lying.
Her brain is.

351
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,490
What if it's
a conversion disorder?

352
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,575
Lacks personal boundaries.

353
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:37,122
Promiscuous. Inappropriate obsession
with truth telling.

354
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,208
Certainly sounds like a psych case.

355
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,295
Cool. I'll set up a psych consult
and start her on anti-depressants.

356
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,713
No.

357
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,676
Her mind is tricking her body.

358
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:51,470
We need to trick her mind.

359
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,640
Or even better...

360
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,561
- You don't need her.
- I know.

361
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,438
Then this serves
no medical purpose.

362
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,400
You have a genetic defect,
choose to ignore it.

363
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,193
This woman has
a genetic defect,

364
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,487
chooses to butcher herself
to be safe.

365
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,199
Yet, what you claim
to be fascinated by is her honesty.

366
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,450
Interesting.

367
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,452
You claim to want the truth.

368
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,706
And then you screw with people
who actually live by it. Pathetic.

369
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,999
Hey, I gave you credit
for interesting.

370
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,380
You're protecting her because you're
jealous she did what you couldn't.

371
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,424
I need you.

372
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,427
I'm not lying to her.

373
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,721
Fine. Keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.

374
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,140
If it doesn't work,
you've got to hold the kid down

375
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,559
until someone else
finishes lying to Mom.

376
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,811
That does actually serve
a medical purpose.

377
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,360
Jane.

378
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,697
I have to lie
because she trusts me?

379
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,576
If you show doubt,
the placebo treatment won't work.

380
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,495
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

381
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,788
There are a lot of
great medications.

382
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,417
Why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?

383
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,711
Because we might be wrong.

384
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,671
Those medications
take a long time to work,

385
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,215
and since
your mom's condition's declining,

386
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,260
there's a chance the drugs won't tell us
anything until it's too late.

387
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,805
My mom's not depressed.

388
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,474
Maybe she's hiding it from you.

389
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,933
No.

390
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,394
- She wouldn't.
- She's doing what every good mom does.

391
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,439
Protecting her child from bad news
that she can't do anything about.

392
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,982
My mom's never lied to me.

393
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,609
If you don't know how to lie,

394
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,779
you don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

395
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,076
Maybe you're right.

396
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,953
- I know I'm...
- I was lying.

397
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,623
I know how to lie.

398
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,293
I just won't do it
to my mother.

399
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,759
You like foosball?

400
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,514
Until the treatment of your
infectious paraparesis takes effect,

401
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,182
Jane can't come back
into the room.

402
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,467
I've already been inoculated.

403
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,976
Can she have it already?

404
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,395
Don't worry.
It's a very effective treatment.

405
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,190
You should be feeling better
in a matter of minutes.

406
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,404
Don't you think
Jane deserves a few secrets?

407
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,323
Some personal space?

408
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,451
Room to make her own mistakes?

409
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,995
She makes plenty of mistakes.

410
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,248
Only difference is I'm there
to help her through them.

411
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,667
But she's got to know
you're looking over her shoulder.

412
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,876
It's got to stifle her.

413
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,461
I think the world would
be a better place

414
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,798
if everybody always acted like their mom
was looking over their shoulder.

415
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,563
- I want to go see my mom.
- She's sleeping.

416
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,147
Why don't we just
double the amount we can spend?

417
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,108
- Nope.
- Can't afford another 25?

418
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,277
If we allow people 50,
people will spend 60.

419
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:54,945
Ah! So, you can't afford
another 35.

420
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,531
- You must really like who you got.
- Or really dislike.

421
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,785
My mom always gives
the best presents

422
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,745
to the teachers
I get along with the worst.

423
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,249
- No.
- No.

424
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,713
How do you know no?

425
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,673
I know you didn't get House.

426
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,926
I know he didn't get House.

427
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,388
- You gave them all your name?
- Mmm-hmm.

428
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,684
I figured I could sow some dissension
and get a few ties and sweaters.

429
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,352
What happens
when they find out?

430
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,979
It's Secret Santa.

431
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,316
What happens
when they find out?

432
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,319
They'll argue about what to do
with that information.

433
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,446
The ties are less important
than the dissension.

434
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,651
- We still have to buy him something.
- Not a chance.

435
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,867
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.

436
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,244
He's not supposed
to put his name in there five times.

437
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,622
He wants presents. It's sad.

438
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,457
It's pathetic.

439
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,918
I'm still buying him a present.

440
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,628
No, you're not.

441
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,297
Fine.

442
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,350
What's wrong?

443
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,559
I think it's getting worse.

444
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,812
I can't breathe.

445
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,940
I need a nurse in here!

446
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,670
Her lymph nodes are cutting off
her airway. We've got to intubate!

447
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,252
The swollen lymph nodes
were cutting off Maggie's airway.

448
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:37,005
We shrunk them with alcohol
and she's breathing on her own now.

449
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,799
Well, that sucks.

450
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,259
Four thousand, three hundred
saved emails

451
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:45,263
and not a single mention
of "lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "mangina."

452
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,683
Swollen lymph nodes
means it wasn't psychological.

453
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,935
Who's that from?

454
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,021
Santa, obviously.
As you know, I worship him.

455
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,358
Oh, wait. I meant Satan.
I always get them confused.

456
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,072
What is an "alpine butterfly"?
And why is she learning how to do one?

457
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,408
House, we already have a full history.
You don't need to waste time...

458
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,660
- It's just a climbing knot.
- But what does she use it for?

459
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,370
Try "bondage."

460
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,454
I did once.

461
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,331
But she just tied me down and whined

462
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,208
about how hard it is
to be Dean of Medicine.

463
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,793
Gyms aren't exactly pristine.

464
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,129
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously, who's it from?

465
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,575
No fever.
No elevated white count.

466
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,176
That's funny. Friend sent her
a Garfield cartoon.

467
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,178
That cat sure does love lasagna.

468
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,640
House, stop obsessing.

469
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:34,104
If it weren't for my obsessions, we
wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.

470
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,816
Eighteen months ago,
she sold her Stairmaster.

471
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,109
It was only two months old.

472
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,610
Now, either she needed the cash,

473
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,113
or climbing stairs
was getting more difficult.

474
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,283
Twelve months ago,
she canceled a hiking trip.

475
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,618
Now, either she just
wanted to sit home and watch TV,

476
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,454
or walking was
getting more difficult.

477
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,874
She's been suffering joint pain
for the last two years.

478
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,293
Pull my ribbon.
If you know what I mean.

479
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,046
ACE levels are too low
for sarcoidosis.

480
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,673
That's not what I meant.

481
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,675
Could just be
an inactive phase.

482
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,721
It's not Christmas yet.

483
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,012
I remembered.
I'm not a Satanist. I'm a Druid.

484
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,305
- No lung involvement.
- Yet.

485
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,599
We'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage
to confirm it.

486
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:14,853
That's a shame. I was gonna surprise her
with one for Christmas.

487
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,189
Wow!

488
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,276
Now, either that cost
more than 25 bucks,

489
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,529
or I'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve Jobs' business strategies.

490
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,824
Thanks!

491
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,747
Last round of saline, Maggie.
One more big breath.

492
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,167
You've got to get the liquid
to go all the way into your lungs, okay?

493
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,293
Here we go.

494
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,922
The gift could be
from a patient.

495
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,591
Who sent it to
the wrong doctor?

496
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,436
House obviously
gave the present to himself.

497
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,601
They're arguing right now.

498
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,394
I've been looking
for this all morning.

499
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,063
Did you look
in the box on my desk?

500
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,816
Oh, by the way, your mom called.
Your dad's dead.

501
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,693
You left the present
sitting on your desk?

502
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,571
It wouldn't have been as effective
sitting in a closet in my home.

503
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,948
- They're gonna know it's from you.
- No.

504
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,658
They're gonna guess
that it was from me.

505
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,284
They might even be 90% sure
that it was from me.

506
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,829
But all that means is
they're 10% percent sure

507
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,123
that one of the other guys
is screwing them over.

508
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,793
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers to,

509
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,462
I don't know,
bring peace to the Mid-east?

510
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,880
I couldn't do that.

511
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,924
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up.

512
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,552
Yeah. That's more
where my powers lie.

513
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,138
- The gift could be from Wilson.
- It's House.

514
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,806
Why do you have a problem
with him speculating?

515
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,475
Because that's what
House wants us to do.

516
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,854
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.

517
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,149
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?

518
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,693
A little harder.

519
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,529
Great.

520
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,534
Maggie? Open your eyes.

521
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,333
Why aren't you saying anything?

522
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,713
What's wrong?

523
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,924
Maggie tested negative
for sarcoidosis.

524
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,468
But she's bleeding
into her eyes, now.

525
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,887
Have her platelets dropped?

526
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,722
Plummeted.
New labs show they're under 40.

527
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,765
She'll bleed out of every orifice
if we don't find the cause.

528
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,934
Could be splenic sequestration,
tuberculosis.

529
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,477
Gaucher disease, TTP.

530
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,605
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,
sepsis, lupus...

531
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,357
Listing all the possible causes
is only impressive

532
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,318
if you can do it
reverse alphabetically.

533
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,778
We need to know
why her platelet machine is broken.

534
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:32,282
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.

535
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,210
I'm your Secret Santa.

536
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,130
You're not supposed to tell.

537
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,715
But you got a present already,

538
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,259
which means you have more
than one Secret Santa.

539
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,596
Or somebody else
wants to make me happy.

540
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,392
Merry Christmas.

541
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,871
On the one hand,
you should be in bed.

542
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:23,541
On the other hand, I told you to rest.
So, I see your dilemma.

543
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,294
Hey, I don't think
resting is the problem.

544
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,880
Can strep cause this?

545
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,049
Clap on.

546
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,218
Trust me, first place I went.

547
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,722
No rash on my labia.
Do you need to take a look?

548
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm saving my money
for a Red Rider BB gun.

549
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,730
Darker shade of lipstick?

550
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,607
I'm not wearing any.

551
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,698
You tell your mother
what you do?

552
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,574
It doesn't matter. I'm curious.

553
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,453
I don't need to break her heart
just so I can feel righteous.

554
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,170
Do you do a donkey show?

555
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,841
I'm not curious. It matters.

556
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,721
It's a donkey or a mule.

557
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,558
I can never remember.

558
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,103
Wow. That is a creepy smile.

559
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,856
I bet the donkey's
is even creepier.

560
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,525
- Do I have to explain...
- Nope.

561
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,901
That's my job.

562
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,445
Contagious ecthyma.

563
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,907
Any contact can cause
rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.

564
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,409
Has there been

565
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,660
contact?

566
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,124
Okay. Antibiotic cream for you

567
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,710
and a love glove for Francis.

568
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,754
You'll both be fine.

569
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,802
You should come and see the show.
I think you'd like it.

570
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,638
Sorry. I hate Westerns.

571
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,445
So, they really never lie?

572
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,738
Doesn't seem like it.

573
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,864
Admirable.

574
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:18,948
You tell Cameron everything?

575
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,909
No.

576
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,577
You think she keeps secrets?

577
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:26,456
If I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.

578
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:30,251
People have a right to a little privacy,
even from the people they love.

579
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,341
Did you buy House a present?

580
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,718
- Why would I?
- To screw with me.

581
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,220
Then, I'm gonna say yes.

582
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,223
No, wait. Stop. Stop.
What's that smell?

583
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,435
The bone is smoking.

584
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,398
Her bones are harder
than the drill?

585
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,697
We ran a full body bone scan to find
the cause of hardening in the hip.

586
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:00,990
No hot spots anywhere.

587
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,659
Tracer could
have been inactive.

588
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,160
So, I screwed up the test?

589
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,870
There are so many ways
that could have happened.

590
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,705
Maybe it was inactive,
maybe it didn't fully circulate...

591
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,957
It circulated.
The camera picked up.

592
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:13,336
Hey, hey. It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?

593
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,065
Why do you think
there are no hot spots?

594
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,425
I did not screw up.
The density is consistent.

595
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,970
Just means the density was consistent.
Doesn't mean it was cold.

596
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,806
It's possible
all she has are hot spots.

597
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:28,309
It's consistent because
her entire skeleton is turning to stone.

598
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,356
Good for an aspiring superhero.

599
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,317
Fatal for a human
hoping to make it to Kwanzaa.

600
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,987
It's got to be from
a carbonic anhydrase type 2 deficiency.

601
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,197
It has free will. It doesn't have
to be anything it doesn't want to be.

602
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,033
I meant if it's not CA-2, well,

603
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,953
none of the other causes
of osteopetrosis are treatable.

604
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,084
You're right. It's got to be.

605
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:57,046
Go run her blood and hope that
your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.

606
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,224
They accused Kutner of screwing up
a test because they hate him.

607
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,267
You're surprised?

608
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,477
That's the sort of crap
that happens

609
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,312
when you mess
with people's heads.

610
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,063
One day, he will
screw up a test.

611
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,025
And if they don't accuse him of that
because they like him,

612
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,401
someone could die.

613
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:23,406
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere. I just know it hurts you.

614
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,580
CA-2 deficiency's a genetic
disorder that scrambles proteins.

615
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:34,250
If the blood test is positive,
you'll need a bone marrow transplant.

616
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,420
"Transplant" sounds like
a euphemism for "slim odds."

617
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,632
Slim but not none.

618
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,011
We're gonna need to
test Jane for a match.

619
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:46,763
Don't you have donor banks?

620
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,014
Jane is your best bet.

621
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,059
The procedure is perfectly safe.
There's no risk.

622
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,601
No risk?

623
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,979
- Any surgery has...
- Then, don't tell me there's no risk.

624
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,316
You're gonna tell me
there's no pain, either?

625
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,400
The testing will hurt a little.

626
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:00,818
I'll be fine.

627
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,742
If she doesn't do this
and you don't make it,

628
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,037
she's gonna spend
the rest of her life blaming herself.

629
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,876
Mom, please.

630
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,006
Find someone else.

631
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,426
Let someone else take the risk.

632
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,231
Donor bank turned up
a 49-year-old man in Cleveland

633
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,358
who's a five out of six
HLA match.

634
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,568
First flight out of
Cleveland leaves at...

635
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:45,238
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man
a closer match than her daughter?

636
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,699
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.

637
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,493
- Why not?
- Pain, danger, risk of...

638
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,370
Only reason to give
multiple reasons

639
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,831
is you're searching
for what the person wants to hear.

640
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,794
House.

641
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,929
You're wrong about sainted Mommy.

642
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:13,808
Don't care. You can forget the donor
bank. There's no CA-2 deficiency.

643
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,852
Best we can do is
make her comfortable.

644
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,065
Is that from Taub?

645
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:22,859
Yes.

646
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,777
Yes, it is.

647
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,450
Merry Christmas.

648
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,703
Who's gonna tell the patient
she's dying?

649
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,081
I will.

650
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:41,210
And nobody leaves here
until we find out what killed her.

651
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,303
Whatever she has is fatal.

652
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:54,223
Makes no difference
if it's disease number 58 or 907.

653
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,144
Are you guys mad at me?

654
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,647
No. You had no choice.

655
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,232
Of course I had a choice. You had
no choice once I made my choice.

656
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,443
And now, I'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

657
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,402
Why?

658
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,321
Because it will
drive House nuts.

659
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,284
Do you think that will make
your lives better or worse?

660
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,915
I told my mom
I don't care what she thinks.

661
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,875
I want you to test my marrow.

662
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,799
I can't be dying.

663
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,008
Sure you can.

664
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,009
You're wrong.

665
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,804
You don't even know
what I have.

666
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,849
What you have is
one last Christmas with your daughter.

667
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,227
One last chance
to give her a present.

668
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,230
The truth.

669
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,149
It's inexpensive, highly valued.

670
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,902
Never have to stand in line
to return it the day after Christmas.

671
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,445
What are you talking about?

672
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,156
A mother who's going to die

673
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,326
doesn't refuse a donor test
because it might hurt.

674
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,705
She refuses when she knows
it won't match.

675
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,873
Which tends to happen

676
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:04,836
when mother and daughter
aren't mother and daughter.

677
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,595
I can do DNA tests
if you'd rather keep lying to me.

678
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,686
I never wanted kids.

679
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,899
I loved them,
but with my genes...

680
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,737
I knew this woman, a drug addict.

681
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,617
She got pregnant,
didn't want to have an abortion.

682
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:41,205
But she also didn't want her daughter
to ever know who her real mother was.

683
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,208
What she was.

684
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,212
I promised never to tell.

685
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,804
A promise to an addict is worth more
than a promise to your daughter?

686
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,598
It'd be cruel to tell her.

687
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:02,852
Right. She lives a lie.
You get to die a hypocrite.

688
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,777
Mom? The doctors told me
what's happening.

689
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:13,196
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

690
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,989
I promise you.

691
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,366
Doctors can be wrong.

692
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,704
- There's still a chance I can beat...
- You really believe that?

693
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,419
I do.

694
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:32,715
No, Mom. You're dying.

695
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,885
Nobody can help you.

696
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,182
It's not gonna be okay.

697
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,205
That was cold.

698
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,040
Yeah.

699
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,939
What did you get for Christmas?

700
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,650
I got a watch, a vintage LP,

701
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,069
and a second edition Conan Doyle.

702
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,239
And if that wasn't bad enough,
my patient's dying.

703
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,659
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.

704
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,744
No one ever wants to go in
the patient's room.

705
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,290
Even the candy stripers
leave them alone.

706
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,834
But I saw something amazing.

707
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,254
Pure truth.

708
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,507
She told her mother
that she was dying.

709
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,718
Stripped her of all hope.

710
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,554
That sounds horrible.

711
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,849
It was like watching
some bizarre astronomical event

712
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,517
that you know
you're never gonna see again.

713
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:10,521
You tell people the cold, hard truth
all the time. You get off on it.

714
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:11,981
Because I don't care.

715
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:13,900
She cared.

716
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,569
And she did it, anyway.

717
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,530
She did it because she cared.

718
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:25,244
The angels of Christmas have finally
given House a present he can appreciate.

719
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,245
Oh, don't ruin it.

720
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,956
Don't pin this on Christ.
He's got enough nails in him.

721
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,362
- Patient had to die...
- Why don't you take off that hat?

722
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,753
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.

723
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,963
It's a moose, on a Jew.

724
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:37,965
Who cares?

725
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,261
Things have their place.

726
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:45,097
You wouldn't hang dreidels
from a Christmas tree.

727
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,183
You could.

728
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,977
Things don't care.

729
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,484
No, they don't.

730
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,781
Happy solstice, House.

731
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,409
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen.</i>

732
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,954
<i>Let nothing you dismay.</i>

733
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,998
<i>Remember, Christ, our savior.</i>

734
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,501
<i>Was born on Christmas day.</i>

735
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,003
<i>To save us all
from Satan's power.</i>

736
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,881
<i>When we were gone astray.</i>

737
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,800
Have you people
no holiday spirit?

738
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,635
Bring me the eggnog
of good cheer.

739
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,480
House, if you have
something to say, say it.

740
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,847
If you don't, give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

741
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,432
Scrooge.

742
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,476
Give the patient risperidone.

743
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:33,229
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying. She's not crazy.

744
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,691
I am gonna perform
a Christmas miracle.

745
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:41,862
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort and joy.</i>

746
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:45,783
You said all the other causes
of osteopetrosis are fatal.

747
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,578
Except for the one we discounted early
because it was impossible.

748
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:53,374
When a fetus forms,
it's just a mass of cells.

749
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:57,003
Breast tissue covers
extensive portions of the body.

750
00:38:57,128 --> 00:39:00,464
As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes

751
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,050
remaining only
in the fun places.

752
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,386
But sometimes, extra breast tissue

753
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,972
is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.

754
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,766
Risperidone does a lot of things.

755
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,645
One is it makes breast tissue swell
so we can find it more easily.

756
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,440
You're telling me
I could have breast cancer?

757
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,650
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.

758
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,695
Taub's parents
have a winter condo in Florida.

759
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,946
They're still New Yorkers.

760
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,906
- Actually, my parents...
- Don't care.

761
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,074
I told a parable.

762
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,245
Now, I'm gonna raise the dead.

763
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,582
Give me that syringe.

764
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,542
That's got to be a fat deposit.

765
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,210
Yes, I could be wrong.

766
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,297
If I am, she's dead.
So, shut up.

767
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,595
What's that?

768
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,265
Risperidone also
causes galactorrhea.

769
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,561
What's that? Galactic?

770
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,605
Open your mouth.

771
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,774
Relax. You've had it before.

772
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,275
I am not...

773
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,529
Milk?

774
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:06,489
Ew!

775
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,329
We'll cut out your mom's tumor
and start her on chemo.

776
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:16,207
All the rest of your symptoms
should go away.

777
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,590
I love you.

778
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,552
I know.

779
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:40,314
Have a wonderful life.
