1
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,072
Doc! Help! Doc!

2
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,214
It stopped bleeding.
It stopped bleeding.

3
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,968
That's because your blood is freezing
as it's hitting the air.

4
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,679
Here. Apply pressure on it.

5
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,264
I think my leg is frozen.

6
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:39,851
That's the least of your problems.
The blade severed your femoral artery.

7
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,030
Am I going to lose my leg?

8
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,406
Frostbite's not too bad.

9
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,534
But I've got to fix your artery now.
This is going to hurt.

10
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,918
Are you going
to put that in me?

11
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,796
Glue's the best way to repair your
artery at this temperature.

12
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,633
It looks okay.

13
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,968
Here. Tear off some pieces.
I have to check your foot.

14
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,895
Blood flow looks good.
Your leg should be okay.

15
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,356
I thought I was done.

16
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,359
Yeah, like I'd let
anything happen to you.

17
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,404
You're the only one
who could fix the generators.

18
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,740
Okay. One, two...

19
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,537
Cate. Cate, are you okay?
Are you okay?

20
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,165
Hey.

21
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,757
<i>I</i> need help.

22
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,843
Who am I supposed to get?

23
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,812
Why do I even
give you an office?

24
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,481
New case. Psych department
asked for you personally.

25
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,767
The patient's a crazy person?

26
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,234
You're a crazy person.

27
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,652
The patient's a psychiatrist.

28
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,654
There's something wrong
with coma guy's cable.

29
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,240
He seems fine with it.

30
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,368
Your patient is an adjunct faculty
member here, but currently...

31
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:09,542
The budget committee voted to charge
for cable in the patient rooms.

32
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,211
Slippery slope.

33
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:15,006
Today, we withhold porn.
Tomorrow, it's clean bandages.

34
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,508
Talk to Carlson in Denn,
he runs the budget committee,

35
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,260
after you look at this.

36
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,804
After you
talk to Carlson, maybe I'll...

37
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,349
The patient is trapped
at the South Pole.

38
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,443
Any possibility
of evacuating her?

39
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,861
Well, that wouldn't be any fun.

40
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:41,574
And for the next two months, winds make
it impossible to fly anything in or out.

41
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,701
Could be appendicitis
or a gallstone.

42
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:44,953
Or a kidney stone.

43
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,871
That wouldn't be any fun.

44
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,166
If it's appendicitis down there,
her appendix ruptures, she dies.

45
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,543
There's nothing we can do.
If it's a stone, she takes pain meds,

46
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,504
stone passes.
There's nothing we need to do.

47
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,506
Could be a struvite
kidney stone.

48
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,549
Most kidney stones
are calcium and benign.

49
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,593
Why would you
suspect a struvite stone?

50
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,804
Because he said
kidney stones were boring.

51
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:05,682
It's possible.
She's on birth control.

52
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,850
Lots of sex could lead
to urinary tract infection,

53
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,561
which could lead to an infection-laced
struvite kidney stone.

54
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:12,772
Excessive Antarctic drilling,

55
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,358
bad for the environment
and the ladies.

56
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,402
If it's a struvite stone, she
needs to break it up quickly

57
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,112
before the infection
shuts down her kidneys.

58
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,780
This is where it gets fun.

59
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:25,743
These are the supplies and medications
she has available.

60
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,751
Nothing here that could
break up a kidney stone.

61
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,570
What else do they
have down there?

62
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,127
I just said...

63
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,853
I don't mean medical stuff. Other stuff.

64
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,215
Some geological equipment
breaks ice and rock

65
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,758
the same way
we break kidney stones.

66
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,849
Discovery Channel.
I like watching them blow stuff up.

67
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,517
Who doesn't?

68
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,145
That reminds me.

69
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,814
Coma guy needs cable.

70
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,423
Women's billiards is the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

71
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,944
I'm sure Carlson will be moved
by his plight.

72
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,321
Carlson won't listen.
He says I hit on his wife.

73
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,657
- You knew?
- God, no.

74
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,492
I thought I was hitting
on his daughter.

75
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,287
Look, you're on the committee.
He'll listen to you.

76
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,081
I'm an avid reader of Committees
with Hotties message boards.

77
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,833
Amoxicillin,
500 milligrams, IV.

78
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,335
Studies conducted
at major hospitals indicate

79
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,838
that happy patients recover faster.

80
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,799
Studies conducted in my apartment
show that TV makes people happy.

81
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,343
Premium channels
have a particularly striking effect.

82
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,305
Charging patients for cable is bringing
in 13 grand a month.

83
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,560
Until this injustice is righted,
I am going to waste 13 grand a day.

84
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,356
That's $2.49 down.

85
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,068
Get an EKG
and a cardiac enzyme.

86
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:43,029
If those check out, discharge him,
and tell him to get a snow-blower.

87
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,533
How much is 13 grand
divided by 4 cents?

88
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,244
I am not giving you cable.

89
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,169
You're gonna have to somehow survive
with the broadcast networks alone.

90
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,374
I'll be fine on Tuesdays.

91
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,695
If sound waves
from the flaw detector break the egg,

92
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,006
it should safely dissolve
your kidney stone.

93
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,806
<i>This isn't going to work.</i>

94
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:10,973
Well,
there's no reason it shouldn't.

95
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,392
Sound waves are sound waves.
Stones are stones.

96
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:16,562
<i>Some are bigger than others.
Some are inside me.</i>

97
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,773
How's it going, Team MacGyver?

98
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,191
Oh, great.

99
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,694
I can't get cable, but I can get
the South Pole on high-def.

100
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,071
We're almost ready
to start the test.

101
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,740
Test? Did Ford test the Edsel?

102
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:33,287
Did Coke test New Coke? Did Shakespeare
test his final play, Snow <i>Dogs?</i>

103
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,790
<i>I'm guessing you're Dr. House?</i>

104
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,877
<i>I was wondering
when you might drop by.</i>

105
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,629
Could she see me?

106
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:42,839
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

107
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,633
You think Jagger shows up
for the sound check?

108
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,848
Okay, roadies, off the stage.

109
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,433
Go help Cameron in the ER.

110
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,894
Why? No way you're just
doing her a favor.

111
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,729
ER is standing room only.

112
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,189
Which means Cameron's bound
to make a mistake.

113
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,941
Find it so I can blackmail her.

114
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,443
As far as you know,

115
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,114
this is way more than just some silly
battle over cable.

116
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,496
<i>Ready.</i>

117
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,191
You might wanna
dial it down a smidge.

118
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,403
<i>I am not doing this.</i>

119
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,948
<i>Your kidney stone theory hinges on me
having sex, but I...</i>

120
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,576
Let me guess. You're as pure
as the driven snow.

121
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,703
<i>Only if the snow
likes to be on top.</i>

122
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,873
<i>But I am here doing
psychological research.</i>

123
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:01,834
<i>Generally not a good idea to swap fluids
with your subjects.</i>

124
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,421
Struvite stones are possible
in people who don't have sex.

125
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,548
They're certainly possible
in people who claim not to...

126
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:11,177
I've had no UTI's,
no pain on urination.

127
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,763
You do realize that only one of us
is a real doctor.

128
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,724
<i>You do realize only one of us has any
control over my actions.</i>

129
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,730
Dr. Milton, are you able
to run a CHEM-7?

130
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:23,773
Yes.

131
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,524
Well, that'd tell us if her kidney
function is declining.

132
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,401
If it is, he's right.

133
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,737
Struvite stone's
the most likely explanation.

134
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,656
If not, she's right.

135
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,247
Sorry. I know how you like to avoid
avoiding confrontation.

136
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:43,709
While we're waiting for that test to
prove me right, start IV cefuroxime.

137
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,295
Keep the infection in the stone from
wiping out your kidneys.

138
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,631
<i>I'll send the CHEM-7
results when I'm done.</i>

139
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:57,265
She's a great psychiatrist.
One session, I've got shrinkage.

140
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,768
House wants us
to spy on you, report back.

141
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,313
And you're
telling me this because...

142
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,815
We don't want to do it.

143
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,108
I don't see a problem so far.

144
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,111
If our choice is between pissing
House off or pissing you off,

145
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,696
that's not much of a choice.

146
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,365
So unless I give House cable,

147
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,242
you're gonna make
my life miserable.

148
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,785
Yes.

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,871
And you're telling me this so you won't
feel as guilty when you do it.

150
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,208
Yes.

151
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,253
Accommodating House's
every whim is not my job anymore.

152
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,088
But it is ours.

153
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,049
House will get what he wants.

154
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,183
Maybe we should just pay for it
ourselves and tell him she folded.

155
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,686
No.

156
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:50,192
Your CHEM-7 results showed
your kidney function is declining.

157
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,736
Sounds like
a kidney stone to me.

158
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,237
<i>The decreased function</i>

159
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:57,241
<i>could be from dehydration caused by
vomiting due to a gallstone.</i>

160
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,745
You agreed that the CHEM-7 would decide
if it was a struvite stone.

161
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,498
I agreed to do the test. The results are
up for interpretation.

162
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,043
I'll re-do the test in an hour
when I'm re-hydrated.

163
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,713
Have you noticed any improvement since
starting the cefuroxime?

164
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,159
<i>Not really. Pain's
about the same.</i>

165
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,884
While you're waiting, we should run
another test with the geology equipment.

166
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,510
You're not taking
the cefuroxime.

167
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,929
She's right-handed.

168
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,807
Means she would put
the <i>N</i> in her left arm.

169
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,601
Catheter in the arm
makes it hard to bend the elbow,

170
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,269
the way people do
when they drink.

171
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,731
We have a limited supply of medication,
and I am not about to waste it.

172
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,900
Last I checked you had
a limited supply of doctors.

173
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:35,613
<i>Right before I got sick, one of my crew
members severed his femoral artery.</i>

174
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,114
<i>He needs the cefuroxime.</i>

175
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,574
<i>Right. He called dibs.</i>

176
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,745
His need is definitive.
Mine is speculative.

177
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,622
You're breathing fast.

178
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,415
<i>It's because I'm pissed off!</i>

179
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,460
Lift up your chin.
Show me your windpipe.

180
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,131
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

181
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,341
It's deviating to the left.

182
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,906
Because her right lung
is collapsing.

183
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,636
Cate, is anyone there with you?

184
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,346
- Sean went to the <i>mess.</i>
- You need to call someone.

185
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,515
There's no time.
Get a syringe and a needle.

186
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,280
- Why am I doing that?
- Shut <i>up</i> and <i>look.</i>

187
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,728
She could pass out.
She needs to...

188
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,188
She needs
to re-inflate that lung.

189
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:11,857
Okay. Now, pull out
the plunger.

190
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,783
I want you to stab yourself
in your right side

191
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,695
between the second and third rib,
in the midclavicular line.

192
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,138
By the time we get someone else there,
you'll have suffocated.

193
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,369
<i>Just do it.</i>

194
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,995
See all the good stuff that happens
when you listen to me?

195
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,430
<i>Means it's not a kidney stone.</i>

196
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,359
<i>Right side pain, vomiting,</i>

197
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,612
<i>and now a lung that gets traumatized
without any trauma.</i>

198
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,364
<i>Sounds odd. Probably is odd.</i>

199
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,241
<i>We should discuss this,
then call her back.</i>

200
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,245
No, it's fine. I made sure we got
the South Pole long distance plan.

201
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,622
Her latest kidney
function test shows...

202
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,249
<i>I know what it shows. I ran it.</i>

203
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,252
The more you interrupt, the longer my
grandstanding is going to take.

204
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,130
Since when do you let patients
participate in differentials?

205
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,820
Since the patient and her doctor happen
to be the same person.

206
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,010
<i>Your kidney function
is still declining.</i>

207
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,052
<i>Means
you have a kidney problem.</i>

208
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,639
But not one that needed antibiotics.
Makes us equally wrong.

209
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,976
No.
Makes us both wrong. Not equally.

210
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,895
You were at least six wronger.

211
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,772
They run a PPD
before you shipped out?

212
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,774
<i>On me and everybody else here.
It's not TB.</i>

213
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,651
<i>Excuse us a second.</i>

214
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,821
Cancer explains her symptoms.

215
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,033
A tumor in her lung or kidney that threw
a clot to the other organ.

216
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,578
And you're worried the tumor might
overhear, realize we're on to it.

217
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:51,040
Cancer's a hard diagnosis for patients,
even when they're not in the South Pole.

218
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,209
We should figure this out,
maybe bring Wilson in.

219
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,258
<i>Obviously, you two think
I'm in bad shape.</i>

220
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,594
- Only if you count the tumor.
- House.

221
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,095
Probably in your abdomen.

222
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,598
<i>But you don't have any advanced
imaging equipment.</i>

223
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,403
<i>You also don't have
a surgeon to biopsy it,</i>

224
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,227
<i>any stains to use on the slide,</i>

225
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,229
<i>or an oncologist to analyze it.</i>

226
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,856
<i>I'm too far away
to hold her hand.</i>

227
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:17,900
<i>I have cancer?</i>

228
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,610
Possibly.

229
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:23,989
Since the only imaging equipment you
have is x-ray, let's start there.

230
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,158
X-ray your entire body.

231
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,327
<i>I'll upload the images
when I'm done.</i>

232
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,916
Good for you.

233
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,861
She's annoying.

234
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,657
Refused to take the antibiotics because
other people might need them.

235
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,451
She said she cares
about other people?

236
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,786
What a poser.

237
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,830
KUB is clean.

238
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,000
You don't like her
because she's a psychiatrist.

239
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,336
Mmm, I'm a complicated man.
I loathe her for many reasons.

240
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,380
Never before has a profession
been so decried

241
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,465
by someone who
needed it so badly.

242
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,802
You talk a lot of smack
about tranny hookers.

243
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,637
Enlarged mediastinal node.

244
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,805
- Lymphoma?
- Probably,

245
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,890
but we can't confirm it
without a biopsy.

246
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,517
We can't analyze
a biopsy without a stain.

247
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,852
We can't biopsy.

248
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,688
Since they don't have stains down there,
we need a substitute.

249
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,317
She can't biopsy that node
without a surgical team and an OR.

250
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,695
Anything with a strong color
could work as a stain.

251
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,906
Printer ink,
food coloring, coffee.

252
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,033
No, thanks.

253
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,869
I'll find a node closer to the surface.
One she can biopsy.

254
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,495
That makes sense.

255
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,622
That makes sense?

256
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,998
I said it first.

257
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,292
In a shockingly calm manner.

258
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,212
After I've just been
jerking you around for 30 seconds

259
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,923
without you complaining
or analyzing said jerking.

260
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,216
I was being mature.

261
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,510
In a lavender shirt.

262
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,513
You, for some reason,
are happy.

263
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,307
How dare you.

264
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,517
The x-rays don't show
any other abnormal nodes.

265
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:19,772
Abnormal nodes can be felt
before they can be seen on an x-ray.

266
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,149
You're wearing
that shirt for someone.

267
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,568
The Health Department.
They frown on topless oncology.

268
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,111
You're gonna do a physical?

269
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,490
Have to. You and Foreman are going
to be here looking for a stain.

270
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,871
I can do the physical.
There's no reason you need to watch.

271
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,332
I can think of at least
three reasons.

272
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,833
<i>One of them is medical.</i>

273
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,919
Where are you?
Not in your office.

274
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,046
You're not in the hospital.
No reason for me to be.

275
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,257
I'm not undressing for you
in your apartment.

276
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:48,509
<i>You're not in my apartment.</i>

277
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,637
You're three quarters
of a world away.

278
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,514
<i>I promise not to get fresh.</i>

279
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,099
I'm not taking off my clothes.

280
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,226
One of us has to.

281
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,274
Show me your place.

282
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:10,406
It's got walls, a floor,
and in some places, a roof.

283
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,701
<i>I am not exposing myself
without some reciprocity.</i>

284
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,411
It's my apartment.
It's not my soul.

285
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,459
<i>Living room.</i>

286
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,461
Slow down.

287
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:26,463
<i>Huh!</i>

288
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,633
Lots of books.
I'm betting all medical.

289
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,345
<i>Only if you count Jenna Jameson's
autobiography as a gynecological text.</i>

290
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,180
Fiction is a waste of time.

291
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,099
Unless you can laugh at it?

292
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,393
<i>I love to laugh. Moving on.</i>

293
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,438
Back up.

294
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,482
<i>How bad is the insomnia?</i>

295
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,901
<i>Let me quantify that.</i>

296
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,990
<i>Do you drink two or three scotches
before passing out in front of the TV?</i>

297
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,075
You are so far off.

298
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:56,869
<i>It's bourbon.</i>

299
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,205
<i>No photos anywhere.</i>

300
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,291
Family and friends
aren't important?

301
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,793
Well, you're sick.

302
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,046
You have 20 people down the hall,
and you've had exactly one visitor.

303
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,339
<i>I don't want to panic anyone.</i>

304
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,801
You don't like people.
You hide on that ice cube, so...

305
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:18,557
<i>Stop projecting. You're antisocial,
so you assume I'm antisocial?</i>

306
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,976
How about
if I just get naked, and you shut up?

307
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,854
<i>If I thought I could get you naked,
I would have led with that.</i>

308
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,191
<i>You'd rather show me
your soul than your leg.</i>

309
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,528
Great. You got me
all figured out.

310
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,822
You going to try
and fix me now?

311
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,117
<i>I never said you needed fixing.</i>

312
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,080
He's letting her take part
in the differentials.

313
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,708
Of course he is. He likes her.

314
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,462
Big shock. Spaghetti sauce doesn't work
as a lymph tissue stain.

315
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,715
I'll try the coffee.

316
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,843
He's annoyed by her, doesn't respect
her as a doctor,

317
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,512
constantly insults her.

318
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,473
That's House's version
of courtship.

319
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,434
Oh, God. He's been wooing me
for years.

320
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,228
She's the perfect
woman for him.

321
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,833
Willing to literally go to the end
of the earth for her career,

322
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,691
making her unavailable
for a real relationship.

323
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,110
And she's afflicted
with a mysterious illness.

324
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,321
Soy sauce is a no-go.

325
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,573
We're gonna be here all night.

326
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,470
How long
does it take you to get naked?

327
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,286
<i>It's the South Pole.</i>

328
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,315
I wear a lot of layers.

329
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,459
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

330
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,461
I saw socks.

331
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,838
That's not naked.

332
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,363
Have I mentioned
it's freezing here?

333
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:36,844
<i>When they discover lymph nodes in feet,
I will take off my socks.</i>

334
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,721
Use your right hand
to palpate the nodes.

335
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,308
Any node you can feel
is the one we can biopsy.

336
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:47,145
Let's start with your breasts,
move down to the ass, then...

337
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,274
<i>I was thinking go from the neck
and work my way down.</i>

338
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,317
We could,

339
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,821
but I'd never forgive myself if we found
something before we got to your breasts.

340
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,491
I'm starting with
the anterior cervical nodes.

341
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,165
Turn your head.

342
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,459
Locate the SCM muscle.

343
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,296
<i>I know how to find
my lymph nodes.</i>

344
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,425
Did they teach you that before or after
the class on fondling your inner child?

345
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,388
<i>No swelling.
No tenderness. And...</i>

346
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,807
<i>I can hear that, House.</i>

347
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,684
<i>Just thought
it might help you relax.</i>

348
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,813
Anything in the axillary nodes?

349
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,566
All clear.

350
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,234
Both sides.

351
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,155
Now slide your hand
to your sternum.

352
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,994
Probe for nodes
moving slowly downward.

353
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,455
<i>Down to what, House?</i>

354
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,666
<i>Sorry. Can't hear you on account
of your heavy breathing.</i>

355
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,793
<i>I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.</i>

356
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,592
Hold it.

357
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:02,137
Your fingers didn't go quite as deep.
Feel that node again.

358
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,599
<i>It's swollen.</i>

359
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,394
Looks like you're
doing a biopsy.

360
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,575
<i>It's pretty numb.</i>

361
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,372
Okay. Take a deep breath and
insert the needle into the node.

362
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,460
Come on, Cate.
Let's get this over with.

363
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,297
You used her name.

364
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,301
Just trying to move
things along, Bob.

365
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,853
Okay. I'm in.

366
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,064
You need to pull back
on the syringe.

367
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,402
You need to pull harder.

368
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,330
You Okay?

369
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,416
Yeah.

370
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,086
"Are you okay? u."

371
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,421
It's a valid medical question.

372
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,007
I have never heard you
ask a patient that question.

373
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,216
You've never asked me
that question,

374
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,137
and you've seen me fall down
a flight of stairs drunk.

375
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,347
You've slept with her.

376
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,516
She's 9,000 miles away.

377
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,893
And while a certain part
of me, unfurled...

378
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,353
No, I...

379
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,024
Somehow, you've been
intimate with her.

380
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,525
Why are you following me?

381
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,683
I thought you were
following me.

382
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:42,154
No. You are definitely
following me.

383
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,759
- Where are you going?
- Out to lunch.

384
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:44,990
You never go out to lunch.

385
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,575
Which means there's a reason
you're going out to lunch.

386
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,368
I assume that reason
is a human being.

387
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,786
Or a sandwich.

388
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,038
Sandwiches can come here.

389
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,456
So can human beings.

390
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,374
And yet, she's not,
which I find interesting.

391
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm leaving, now.

392
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,419
Small world.

393
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:01,006
Are you going to
follow me into my car?

394
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,300
It's got two doors.

395
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,928
Okay, look, the reason
I haven't told you is...

396
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,312
Call off your dogs, House.

397
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,064
Your little helpers
are interrogating my patients,

398
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,357
swiping my charts, intercepting
prescriptions.

399
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,604
Why would you think that I...

400
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,902
Because I'm not a moron.

401
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,321
You had to be pulling
the strings, here.

402
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,572
You think that because
they make me miserable,

403
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,115
I'm going to give you cable.

404
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,159
Let's assume that's true,

405
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,036
and it certainly sounds
like it might be.

406
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,641
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

407
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,498
I resigned from
the budget committee.

408
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,918
I only joined the committee to help the
hospital. You made me a liability.

409
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,713
I now have zero influence over
the hospital's cable policy.

410
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,100
Well done.

411
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,060
It didn't work. There's nothing more
that we can do...

412
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,603
Put these up.

413
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,397
"Free Rottweiler puppies."

414
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,609
"Please call after 11:00 p.m.
and before 5:00 a.m."

415
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:03,894
Is this Cameron's home number?

416
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,737
I'd love a new puppy-

417
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,198
My last one
was delicious, very tender.

418
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,741
There's no point
in torturing her.

419
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:13,620
If she can resign, she can un-resign.
Go to DEFCON 1.

420
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,625
Forget waiting for a mistake.
Make her make one.

421
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,125
You want us to sabotage
another doctor,

422
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,919
possibly harm a patient,
all so you can have cable.

423
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:25,173
Harm suggests permanent damage.
Get her to screw up, then fix it.

424
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,466
Oh! And this time,

425
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,671
don't tell her what you're gonna do
before you do it.

426
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:36,268
So, how long do I let the lymph node
marinate in the red wine?

427
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,478
It should be ready, now.

428
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,152
Try increasing
the magnification on the camera.

429
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,238
<i>You know, I emailed a couple of
colleagues at the hospital about you.</i>

430
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,990
You're checking up
on me? Not House?

431
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:55,871
Yeah, well House is straightforward,
brilliant and an ass.

432
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,456
Two out of three good qualities.
Clear majority.

433
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:02,252
Whereas you, on the other hand,
have a perfect score.

434
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:06,173
You are responsible,
nice, human.

435
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,258
And yet, you're House's
best friend.

436
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,634
<i>Hold there.</i>

437
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,596
Makes you think
he's secretly nicer than he seems?

438
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,183
<i>Makes me think that you're secretly
a lot less nice than you seem.</i>

439
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,726
<i>Do you always insult
your doctors?</i>

440
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,563
It's not an insult. Indiscriminate
niceness is overrated.

441
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,566
No wonder he likes you.

442
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:31,156
Based on this slide
you do not have cancer.

443
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,492
Oh!

444
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,619
Thank God.

445
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,787
I do see some inflammation,
which could mean...

446
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,499
Cate? You all right?

447
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,501
My left side. It hurts.

448
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,464
It's the same pain
that I had on the right.

449
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,632
Your other kidney.

450
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,885
No. I hope it's, it's something,
it's maybe...

451
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,180
I'm screwed.

452
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,523
<i>The bad news is you're O for two
in the kidney department.</i>

453
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,277
Is there good news?
You're back at home.

454
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,655
Of course. There's cable.

455
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,283
<i>- And freedom to work pant-free.</i>
- That is good news.

456
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,912
Wilson found signs of inflammation
in your biopsy.

457
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,374
That, plus the two failing kidneys,
points to autoimmune disease.

458
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,710
Probably SLE or vasculitis.
Treatment for both is prednisone.

459
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,451
Start with
a hundred milligrams.

460
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,172
Autoimmune is just
your latest theory.

461
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,133
Like cancer before that,
and a kidney stone before.

462
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,762
<i>Take the prednisone. You'll get better.
That will be your confirmation.</i>

463
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,181
You practice medicine
like it's a fire sale.

464
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,642
You've wasted
antibiotics, x-rays...

465
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,894
That was not a waste.
We've ruled out...

466
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,659
We have a crew member here
who has asthma.

467
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:48,650
If he has an episode after I've used up
the prednisone, he'll die.

468
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,616
There's a good chance
he's going to die anyway.

469
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,112
Since there won't be
a doctor there to help him.

470
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,573
<i>Show me proof
that it's autoimmune,</i>

471
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,285
<i>and then I'll take
the prednisone.</i>

472
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,750
We should send her outside.

473
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,837
Right. Let's just tell her to head north
until she runs into a hospital.

474
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,048
Autoimmune diseases are basically
inflammation running wild.

475
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:16,011
Extreme cold has been used as treatment,
like putting ice on a sprained ankle.

476
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,014
She starts to feel better outside,
we know it's autoimmune.

477
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,515
Is that my wallet?

478
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,975
You can have it back.

479
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,260
I've already been through it.

480
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,437
I like your
ice on the sprain metaphor.

481
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,522
Makes it seem
like we're not killing her.

482
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,327
She'd only need to be outside
five minutes.

483
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,736
Without her mittens. Mom told me
that was a bad idea.

484
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,281
Especially that winter. It was 70 below,
and I had dual kidney failure.

485
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:40,827
This is a good idea. It's perfect
for you. Experimental, risky.

486
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,495
Wilson's right.
You care about...

487
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,290
You didn't touch the cash,
but you took the receipts?

488
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:53,006
A hundred and ninety dollar restaurant
tab. That's dessert, probably booze.

489
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,215
It means you lingered.

490
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,427
Means it's at least
a third date. Means...

491
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,429
- Where are you going?
- To talk to the people I pay

492
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,889
to come up with medical ideas.

493
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,974
There are no ideas.

494
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,726
The test for autoimmune is ANA.

495
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,770
Unless penguins poop immunoanalyzers...

496
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,521
Before ANA testing,

497
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,107
people had autoimmune diseases.

498
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,442
How did they know?

499
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,402
- C3.
- Before that.

500
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,073
LE Prep. But she doesn't have any
controlled pore glass beads.

501
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,075
You don't need them.

502
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,271
<i>When you shake the test tube,</i>

503
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>the paperclip will damage
some of your blood cells.</i>

504
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,502
<i>If you have
an autoimmune disease,</i>

505
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,254
<i>your immune system will gorge itself
on the damaged cells.</i>

506
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,728
They'll get big and fat so that you can
see them under a microscope.

507
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:38,510
How you doing?

508
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,054
<i>No change.</i>

509
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,849
<i>So, how long should I give the cells
to fatten up before I check them?</i>

510
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,476
A couple hours.

511
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:48,978
Or you could stop being a hypocrite
and take the prednisone now.

512
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,815
<i>Not bending to your will
makes me a hypocrite?</i>

513
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,027
If your psych patients demanded lab
results you'd never make a diagnosis.

514
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,112
So, I'm wrong.

515
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,448
You sleep like a baby.
Your life is unfolding as you dreamed.

516
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,492
Everyone is miserable.

517
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,702
You don't change that
because people don't change.

518
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:05,829
You want to believe that

519
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,554
because then you're freed
from any responsibility for your misery.

520
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,999
Oh, shut up.

521
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,419
I get enough of this
from Wilson.

522
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,064
And yet, you keep
hanging out with him.

523
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,632
<i>And, from what I hear,</i>

524
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,094
<i>you have spent more time with me
than with any other patient.</i>

525
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,349
Sorry about that.

526
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,018
Call me when you get
the results.

527
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,318
How's your patient?

528
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,821
She has an autoimmune disease.

529
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,906
Tell the psych department
she's in denial.

530
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,035
I had to fire Cameron.

531
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,204
What? What happened?

532
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,875
A sixty-five-year-old man came
into the ER with a hip fracture.

533
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,960
Cameron gave him Demerol.

534
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,420
The guy was on an MAOI.

535
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,005
Put him into
a hypertensive crisis.

536
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,757
- Is he going to live?
- Taub caught the error in time.

537
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,051
If she'd just admitted
the mistake,

538
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,387
maybe I could have just
suspended her, but...

539
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,599
She's packing up.
If you want to say goodbye.

540
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,018
We should be hearing from the South Pole
in a few minutes.

541
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,811
That's it?

542
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,022
There's nothing to be done.

543
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,066
She screwed up. She's got
no one to blame but herself.

544
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,030
I've got to go talk to Cameron.

545
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,573
Cuddy wouldn't can her
for one screw-up.

546
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,700
And if she did,
she wouldn't come to me.

547
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,077
And if she did, she wouldn't open with,
"How's your patient?"

548
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,913
- And if she did...
- Why would she lie?

549
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,998
Timeless question.

550
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,834
In this case, she conspired
with your co-workers to teach me

551
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,045
that some things
are more important than cable.

552
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,170
I'm going to have to teach them
that they're wrong.

553
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:42,258
Come on. South Pole really
should be calling.

554
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,973
LE Prep test was negative.
It's not autoimmune.

555
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:53,520
You're basing that on a test done with
a paper clip. Just take the prednisone.

556
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,065
Either find another diagnosis,
or find another test.

557
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,067
There is one way.

558
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:04,155
You can take this experimental drug
called prednisone.

559
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,157
<i>If your kidneys
start working...</i>

560
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,117
<i>There is another test.</i>

561
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,789
I think Foreman may have just
broken up, there.

562
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,792
What he actually said was,
"There is no other test."

563
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,238
<i>If you have
an autoimmune disease,</i>

564
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,963
exposure to the cold should decrease
your kidney pain.

565
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,007
<i>If I go outside,
we'll have our answer?</i>

566
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:24,926
<i>And you knew about this?</i>

567
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,637
I rejected it because
if you're frozen solid,

568
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,639
<i>it's hard to get the needles
into your arms.</i>

569
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,224
How long do I need to stay out?

570
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,392
At least five minutes.

571
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:35,186
Eight minutes outside
would kill a healthy person.

572
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,146
<i>And healthy people
don't suck on oxygen masks.</i>

573
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,565
<i>Healthy people can pee.</i>

574
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,608
I'll go get Sean,
have him come with me.

575
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,027
Just take the prednisone.

576
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,153
<i>Once I come inside,</i>

577
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,990
if it's autoimmune.

578
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,954
Are you all right?

579
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,291
Oh, I'm sure she's just fine.

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,418
Cate?

581
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,839
Do you know if there's anyone down there
who has a cell phone?

582
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:21,232
It took the station mechanic
20 minutes to respond.

583
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,262
She'd already slipped
into a coma.

584
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,403
Started her on prednisone,
but no improvement.

585
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,114
Means it's not autoimmune.

586
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,992
Good thing she's in a coma.

587
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,661
- Or we'd have to listen to her gloat.
- And where are we going?

588
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,622
To find the useful
members of my team.

589
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,027
You're letting them
off the hook?

590
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:40,877
You happy? Because of you, I'm not gonna
be able to watch Law <i>& Order</i> in Korean.

591
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,045
Why am I here?

592
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,756
Because I want to ask you
about your girlfriend.

593
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,383
I must know who she is,
or you'd have told me her name.

594
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,762
She doesn't have a name.
It's some sort of birth defect.

595
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,972
There's only about
12 people we both know.

596
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,724
And I can't remember
five of their names,

597
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,977
so we're down to Cuddy,
your ex-wives.

598
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,646
Your mama.

599
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,857
You need to run
a kidney function test.

600
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,110
Yes. If only she wasn't in a coma, we
could get her to run a test

601
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,695
to find out why
she's in a coma.

602
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,156
The results
would likely be paradoxical.

603
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,159
It can't be Cuddy, because you're
straight. It can't be...

604
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,286
We could talk the mechanic
through the test.

605
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,913
Too complicated.

606
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,918
Unless he's thirsty.

607
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,047
Drink her urine?

608
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,882
If it has a strong,
concentrated taste,

609
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,634
it means the problems
are in her kidneys.

610
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,594
<i>Watery taste means
it's her brain.</i>

611
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:36,599
- And then you can fix it?
- Let's say, yeah.

612
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,394
<i>How do I get
the urine out of her?</i>

613
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,853
Take a straight catheter
and insert it...

614
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,563
Those are your only questions?

615
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,525
Not, "Is it safe?"

616
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,860
<i>Or, "ls there another way?"</i>

617
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,071
Or, "Are you
out of your minds?"

618
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:51,906
You wouldn't ask me if...

619
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,533
Wait a second.

620
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,910
You're in love with her.

621
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,123
That explains why you're so eager to get
her naked, then have a drink.

622
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,333
Because most guys like to go
the other way around.

623
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,085
Why do you care
how I feel about her?

624
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:10,007
Because now I know that I can get you
to do anything to save her.

625
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,178
Tell him how to tap the keg.

626
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,560
You got Cameron fired.

627
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,186
Cuddy wasn't supposed
to find out.

628
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,980
No kidding!

629
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,775
Get me cable. How tough can that be?
You cost a woman her job.

630
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,320
There's only one thing
you can say to keep me from firing you.

631
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:34,198
- Cameron wasn't fired. We...
- Wrong.

632
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,618
- You know?
- We're still fired?

633
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,455
That should be a hint
as to what you're supposed to say.

634
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,415
- We're sorry.
- Wrong.

635
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,875
I love you.

636
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,710
Wrong.

637
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,046
This is a game? First, we have to screw
with our co-worker,

638
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,215
now we have to try
to figure out what you want us to say?

639
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,050
This is insane.
I'm not playing.

640
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,136
Right.

641
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,181
You should have said this
two days ago.

642
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,142
Do not play games with me.

643
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,395
Number one, you are going to lose.
You're just not ready.

644
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,857
Number two, the game was to force you
to stop playing games.

645
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,568
I need you to stand up
to me. Challenge me.

646
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,029
I need you to stop worrying
about getting fired.

647
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,281
And go pay for my cable.

648
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,033
No!

649
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,660
I didn't mean on this.

650
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,079
Seriously. I need cable.

651
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,549
Milk, milk, lemonade.

652
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,138
It tastes kind of watery.

653
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,474
That's bad news.

654
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,601
Either increased
intracranial pressure

655
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,062
or something's wrong
with her hypothalamus.

656
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,667
<i>How do you figure out
which one it is?</i>

657
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,649
We don't do anything.

658
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,569
You're gonna drill
a hole in her skull.

659
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:59,283
<i>If she regains consciousness,
it's increased intracranial pressure.</i>

660
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,198
And if it's the other thing?

661
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,746
She'll die.

662
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,791
But if it's the hypothalamus,
she's dead, anyway.

663
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,003
If the problem is the pressure
in her brain, and I fix it,

664
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,328
is she going to be all better?

665
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:15,800
No, but it'll give us more time
to figure out what's wrong.

666
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,011
<i>I have to get someone else.
I can't do this.</i>

667
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,015
You love her.

668
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,060
You'd do anything to save her.

669
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,353
Not this.

670
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,397
I can't do this.

671
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,399
If she dies because of something
that I did, then I...

672
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,067
Listen. Listen.

673
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,153
I am not going
to let you hurt her. Okay?

674
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:40,283
Now, please. This is
her only chance.

675
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,082
Okay-

676
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,800
That was easy.

677
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,431
Okay. Her head is stabilized,

678
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,559
and the drill bit is sterile.

679
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,854
Place the drill bit against the upper
left part of her forehead,

680
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,219
about an inch above the temple.

681
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,374
It's not going anywhere.

682
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,126
Bone's harder than wood.
Lean into it.

683
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,337
<i>The skull is only
a quarter inch thick.</i>

684
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:37,298
Once you're midway through,
drill in shorter bursts.

685
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,463
<i>If you come out the other side,
you've gone too far.</i>

686
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,513
Okay. Now, what? Now, what?

687
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:45,973
Let the fluid drain.

688
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:00,975
She's waking up.
She's waking up.

689
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,333
Sean?

690
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,628
What's going on?

691
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:21,217
South Pole doc
is out of her coma,

692
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,344
and now we have a new symptom.

693
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,180
Increased intracranial
pressure.

694
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,140
Why are we out here?

695
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,850
That's the patient room.

696
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,938
ICP plus kidney problems
plus lung collapse equals...

697
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,273
The most likely suspect
is a tumor throwing off clots.

698
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,608
We ruled out cancer.

699
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:38,985
But not clots.

700
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,778
What causes blood clots?

701
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,154
Bacterial endocarditis.

702
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,364
Not without a fever.

703
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,616
Deep vein thrombosis
plus an existing PFO.

704
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,703
PFO would have been discovered on her
pre-South Pole physical exam.

705
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,068
What if the clots aren't clots?

706
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,333
Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up
on the arterial walls.

707
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,545
Pieces break off, block blood flow.
Explains everything.

708
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,632
She has zero risk factors.
Forget fat. Think clots.

709
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:02,842
No.

710
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,304
- You're standing up to me?
- Maybe.

711
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,099
Just to clarify, you should do that
when you're right.

712
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:11,851
Sorry for the confusion.

713
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,686
- How could a clot...
- Could be a different kind of fat.

714
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:15,396
Fat emboli.

715
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,775
It's a perfect fit. Except it's
completely impossible.

716
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,237
Fat emboli requires
an un-repaired bone breakage.

717
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,781
Between the x-ray
and the exam, I've seen her entire...

718
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,125
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

719
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,796
<i>Take off her socks.</i>

720
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,382
I can... I can do it.

721
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,759
No. I got it.

722
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,021
Your toe is broken.

723
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,899
Oh, my God.

724
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,985
<i>Bits of bone marrow have been
leaking into your bloodstream.</i>

725
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,448
<i>Those fat emboli have caused blockages
in your kidney, lungs, and brain.</i>

726
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,283
It doesn't even hurt.

727
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,243
<i>Cold numbs everything.</i>

728
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,954
Does a particularly great job
on the extremities.

729
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,416
You'll need to close the break to stop
the marrow from leaking.

730
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,959
This one you will feel.

731
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,545
<i>Will you do it?</i>

732
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,091
He drilled a hole in your
skull after drinking your pee.

733
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,550
<i>I think he's up for this.</i>

734
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,435
Grab the tip of her toe
with your right hand.

735
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,346
Hold the break with the other.

736
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,931
On the count of three,
pull hard.

737
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,226
<i>One, two,</i>

738
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,936
three.

739
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,614
Splint your toe.
You'll be fine.

740
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,496
Thank you, House.

741
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,251
Don't thank me.
He's the one who saved your life.

742
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,488
He likes her.

743
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:41,500
A bottle of the Bordeaux
and some sparkling water.

744
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:50,718
Well, you didn't pick her up,
which means she's coming from work, too,

745
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,803
which means you're
comfortable enough to meet her.

746
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,014
Damn. I thought I lost you
when I walked backwards

747
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,473
through my own
footprints in the snow.

748
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,643
I think I've got it narrowed down
to three possibilities.

749
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,729
Better leave. If you see her,
it'll be cheating.

750
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,147
It's not one of your ex-wives.

751
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,398
Because they hate me.

752
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,568
They don't. They should,
but they don't. I called them.

753
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,237
It's someone new,
but someone I know.

754
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,239
Did you ever consider
being happy for me?

755
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,616
Briefly.

756
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:16,118
You ordering the wine
before she got here...

757
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:20,289
Girls are good, House,
and you know it.

758
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:23,042
You solved your case
because you cared about that girl.

759
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,337
You're demonstrating
the illusion of manly confidence,

760
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,380
which means you haven't
closed the deal, yet.

761
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,633
I closed the deal.
I just like her.

762
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:31,884
Still?

763
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,428
You knew your patient
hated having cold feet,

764
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:38,098
because you did a physical exam,
because you liked her.

765
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:42,519
Your theory is I cared,
therefore I let her keep her socks on.

766
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,189
If that's what love is, then I don't
wanna have anything to do with it.

767
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:48,067
It starts with warm feet,
but leads to other things.

768
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,860
Your mom and I will explain
when you're older.

769
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:53,113
If I'd made her take them off like I
should have, I'd have seen the toe

770
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,399
and solved the case days ago.

771
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,950
But you don't care about her.

772
00:42:56,075 --> 00:43:00,162
Of course not.
House doesn't care about anyone.

773
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,250
Hi.

774
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,584
Sorry I'm late.

775
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,463
Cutthroat Bitch?

776
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:14,260
I call her Amber.
Was she on your list?
