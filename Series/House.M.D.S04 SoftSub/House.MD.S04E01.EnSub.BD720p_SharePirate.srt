1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,006
Yeah, I said I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling too hot.

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,509
You're sneezing.
You could do that in a movie theater.

3
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:09,344
Yeah, and I'll be
in a nice soft chair when I collapse.

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,470
I'm exhausted, babe.

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,013
<i>Oh, come on.
We're gonna be late.</i>

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,015
Episode Four never comes
to the big screen.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,017
This is the pre-Lucasized version,
remember?

8
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,703
<i>None of that Greedo
shooting first crap.</i>

9
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:18,645
Go without me.

10
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,851
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,898
<i>You love Star Wars.</i>

12
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,233
Don't you?

13
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,526
Ben?

14
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,735
<i>Since when?</i>

15
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,030
Since just before
I started pretending I loved it.

16
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,326
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be supportive.

17
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,036
Fine. I'll go alone.

18
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,009
Baby, I'm sorry. <i>Me, too.</i>

19
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,886
I'm so woozy
I can hardly think.

20
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,054
We'll hang out at home.

21
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,514
No, you should go.

22
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,059
Did you just feel something?

23
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,519
Feel? Like what?

24
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,688
- Is there an earthquake?
- In New Jersey?

25
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:02,939
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

26
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:06,109
I think I'm,
like, hallucinating.

27
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:12,991
Call 911.

28
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,619
Twenty-six year old female,
gas main exploded under her building,

29
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,539
she was pulled out of the rubble
after six hours.

30
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,925
Two surgeries
for multiple fractures and burns.

31
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,510
I'm thinking the broken bones

32
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,429
are a response to the building
falling on her head.

33
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:03,518
And the fever?

34
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,229
She's the only collapse victim
whose body temperature was...

35
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,981
Put her on antipyretics.

36
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,154
Already have.
The fever is holding at 104.

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,364
Fluctuating consciousness.

38
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,783
Can't take the case.
I don't have a team.

39
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:19,951
So hire a team.

40
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,953
What for? I don't have a case.

41
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,538
Have you even
interviewed anybody?

42
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,290
You test-d rive a car
before you buy it.

43
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,815
You have sex
before you get married.

44
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,003
I can't hire a team
based on a 10-minute interview.

45
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,005
What if I don't like
having sex with them?

46
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,808
You've spent the last two weeks
doing absolutely nothing.

47
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:44,767
Concert is over.

48
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,020
In what twisted universe

49
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:50,189
does mastering Eddie Van Halen's
two-handed arpeggio technique

50
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,400
count as "absolutely nothing"?

51
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,944
Take the case,
or you will spend the next month

52
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,197
helping the collapse team
change bandages.

53
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:04,746
I diagnose her alone, by the end
of the day, you go away for a week.

54
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,249
Done.

55
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:15,798
It's not gonna work.

56
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,634
If he solves the case,
we cure the girl.

57
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,177
And prove
he doesn't need a team.

58
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,062
He's not gonna solve the case.
Not that fast.

59
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,181
- Why not?
- Because he needs a team.

60
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,507
- And this will prove to him...
- Wanna change his mind?

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,603
You need a more convincing argument
than "you promised."

62
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,856
Fever?

63
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,735
Non-responsive to antibiotics,
antipyretics.

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,738
Fluctuating consciousness.

65
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,906
Go!

66
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,119
You talking to me?

67
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,916
Yes.

68
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:55,129
Imagine that the roof
of the storage closet

69
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,049
collapses on your
favorite floor buffer,

70
00:04:58,174 --> 00:04:59,334
which then starts overheating.

71
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,943
Why would I have
a favorite floor buffer?

72
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,639
Okay-

73
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,100
Maybe the electrical works
got banged up in there

74
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,851
from stuff falling on it?

75
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:10,353
Hmm. Interesting.

76
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,190
Brain damage, leading to
hypothalamic dysregulation.

77
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,651
Nah.

78
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,296
If you're brought in covered in rubble,
it's all about the MRls.

79
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,990
We'd have seen that. Come on!
Gotta earn that fiver.

80
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,617
Or stuff leaked in the holes,
messing it up.

81
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:28,037
Lacerations lead
to multiple portals for infection.

82
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,122
Bacterial would have responded
to the antibiotics.

83
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,041
It's too high for viral.

84
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,210
Parasites or fungus
is possible.

85
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,586
Or maybe lupus?

86
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,175
My grandma has lupus.

87
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,722
Okay. Auto immune, I'll run
a lupus panel. Infection fits best.

88
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,850
A complete history
would be helpful,

89
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,144
which leads to the worst
part of the job,

90
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,604
dealing with the
floor buffer's family.

91
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,985
We talked every
couple of weeks.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,737
But Ben would
know better than I.

93
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,822
No farms,
no travel anywhere weird.

94
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,449
You get that, Dr. Buffer?

95
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,076
No travel, no farm.

96
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,122
The file says she was sick
before the building collapsed.

97
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,608
Yeah, I figured
it was just a cold.

98
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:13,905
Why, do you think it's related?

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,420
Her being sick and her being sick?
Often is.

100
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,505
She was unconscious
when I found her.

101
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,425
We'd been fighting.

102
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,677
I just want to...

103
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,512
Just tell me
she's gonna be okay.

104
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,598
I'm not even sure
if you're gonna be okay.

105
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,065
We're gonna
make her all better.

106
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,484
Show off.

107
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,944
You ought to be
nicer to people.

108
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,905
Where are we going?

109
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,657
You know how the laughter
of little children is infectious?

110
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,035
Well, parasites and fungi
are even more so.

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,412
We're gonna find out which one
is making her brain bubble over.

112
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,371
Where, the building?

113
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:55,166
EPA's doing that job for us,
they say it's clean.

114
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,419
Which means we're making a pilgrimage
to Castle Blackberry.

115
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,047
Her name's Bradberry.
I should've asked them for keys.

116
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,342
No need, I'm sure we can find
a large rock somewhere.

117
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,762
I'm not breaking
into somebody's house.

118
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,140
I got principles.

119
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,436
I got some loose change here
says you don't.

120
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,272
I'm not doing this

121
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,399
for less than $50.

122
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,697
Where's the restaurant?

123
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,157
What restaurant?

124
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,368
The one you said
you were taking me to for lunch?

125
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:31,828
Oh! Uh...

126
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,287
This one's homier.

127
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,290
Dibs on the cold pizza!

128
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,090
I'm sure it looked
easier on YouTube.

129
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,807
Oops.

130
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,646
Yeah. You don't need a team.

131
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,773
You can't even
get arrested without company.

132
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,902
You're right. Only one solution,
never replace them, ever.

133
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,446
Do you need help?

134
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,241
Yeah, yeah.
Patronize the poor cripple.

135
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,576
Ow.

136
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,286
- Let me get that.
- I got it.

137
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,164
Will you just let me get it?

138
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,504
I'll check the bedroom.

139
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,428
There's some
interesting mold on the windowsill here.

140
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,680
It's gonna take me a while.

141
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,849
I'll cover the bathroom.

142
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,764
She had a secret diary.

143
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,641
Is there any other kind?

144
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,601
What are you doing?

145
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,062
There's a sale on liquid Tide.

146
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,397
If you're broke,

147
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,066
I could lend you a tiny bit
of the money I owe you.

148
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,693
No, no.
I wouldn't put you in that position.

149
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,278
What does the diary say?

150
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,781
Basically a list
of her sexual encounters,

151
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,617
boys, girls,
vibrating appliances...

152
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,911
If it was, you'd be quoting,
not summarizing.

153
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,372
It's just a parade
of sad banalities.

154
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,500
"I can hardly get out of bed.
Feeling blue."

155
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,128
Then, three months ago,
turns into a parade of happy banalities.

156
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,923
"It's starting to turn the corner.
Job's looking up."

157
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,884
We can stop swabbing.
Her cliches are getting healthier.

158
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,721
Or she's less depressed.
Aren't there pills that do that?

159
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,014
Anti-depressants
don't cause fever.

160
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,518
Not on their own. But the ER didn't know
she was on MAO inhibitors,

161
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:03,688
so they gave her Demerol,
that's a nasty combo.

162
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:06,023
So, all you have to do
is convince this kid

163
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,109
that his girlfriend had
a secret doctor,

164
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:11,320
and a secret stash
and a secret life.

165
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,490
It's been a while since a patient
took a swing at you. Can I watch?

166
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,701
I only have to
convince the mother.

167
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,497
Actually,
I don't have to convince anyone.

168
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,710
This is total crap. If she was seeing
a psychiatrist, I'd know.

169
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,420
If she was on drugs, I'd know.

170
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:31,048
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the forms
so we can start the dialysis.

171
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,218
But why anti-depressants?
I don't understand.

172
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,014
Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the forms
so we can start the dialysis.

173
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,223
Stop saying that.

174
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,185
Dr. Buffer, what is going on?
What aren't you telling us?

175
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,813
He's a janitor?

176
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,982
More significantly,
a blabbermouth.

177
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,400
House, shut up.

178
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:56,449
I am very sorry how Dr. House handled
this. It is completely unforgivable.

179
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,204
Except if he's right.
Dialysis will filter her blood.

180
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,456
There's nothing to filter.

181
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,957
Save her life.

182
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,292
She wasn't depressed.

183
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,336
I'm miserable around Ben.

184
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:14,842
Not me, I like Ben.
February 12th.

185
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,721
Either she's depressed
or she just thinks you're a jerk.

186
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,222
Neither suggests
that you should be the one

187
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,683
directing her
medical treatment.

188
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,353
Does the diary say
my daughter's taking these drugs?

189
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,312
No, but medically...

190
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,897
Did you find drugs
in their home?

191
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,149
She's probably hiding them
in her purse.

192
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,194
I thought it'd be rude to go searching
under a thousand tons of rubble.

193
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,880
This was months ago.
We were in a fight.

194
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:35,946
It doesn't mean she's depressed

195
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,156
and it doesn't mean
she doesn't love me.

196
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,033
Fine.
Maybe the diary proves nothing.

197
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:42,411
On the other hand,
half the country's on anti-depressants

198
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,164
and it fits
her symptoms perfectly.

199
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,130
No ring on your daughter's finger
means you make the decisions.

200
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,302
I'm not sure that I know her
well enough anymore.

201
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,098
You really wanna risk her life
on how well he knows her?

202
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,730
Wilson, you idiot.

203
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>Listen
carefully, and no one will get hurt.</i>

204
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,777
<i>You must follow
the instructions.</i>

205
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,949
Any attempt to contact the FBI
or other law enforcement agencies,

206
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,702
or Cuddy,
will be met with the...

207
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,747
And a large Coke, no ice.

208
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,293
- Give it back.
- What happened?

209
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,464
Did someone kidnap your guitar,

210
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,301
a $12,0001967 Flying V
or something?

211
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,510
Where'd you hide it?

212
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,722
I'm flattered you would consider me
this bold and brilliant.

213
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,807
Yeah. It takes a...

214
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,144
It takes a criminal mastermind

215
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,272
to pull off a heist from an unlocked,
unguarded room down the hall.

216
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,399
What do you want?

217
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,026
Me? Nothing.

218
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,654
But I'm sure the kidnapper wants
whatever a kidnapper wants.

219
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,949
To see you interview five to seven
well-qualified fellowship candidates.

220
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,534
I don't need a team.

221
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,870
You were bouncing ideas
off a janitor.

222
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,663
And solved the case!

223
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,129
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.

224
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,090
If you can hear what I'm saying,
blink once.

225
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,387
You can't talk right now.
You have a tube down your throat.

226
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,974
And try not to move your head.
You've been in a terrible accident,

227
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,685
but it looks like
you will have no permanent injuries.

228
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,438
You've had a bad fever,
but it's gone now.

229
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,774
I've been here the whole time, honey.
Okay? I'm not leaving.

230
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,234
This is very important.

231
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:22,363
I need you
to blink one for yes, twice for no.

232
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,199
Were you seeing a psychiatrist?

233
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,746
Were you on MAO inhibitors,
the anti-depressant?

234
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,751
Megan, it's okay.
It doesn't matter, okay? I love you.

235
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,796
Honey? Honey, what's wrong?

236
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,130
Megan, are you all right?

237
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:41,257
What's happening?
Are we upsetting her?

238
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,502
Heart is beating too fast.
Get the family out of here.

239
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,718
Megan?

240
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:45,886
- Megan!
- Charging to 200.

241
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,721
Meg. Meg! ' Megan!

242
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,558
Clear!

243
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,361
We shocked her back into sinus rhythm,
but she's still tachycardic.

244
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:06,657
Fascinating. Equally fascinating is,
why are you here?

245
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,784
I was gonna leave you alone
if you won the bet.

246
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,827
But you lost.

247
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,871
I explained the fever,
which is all we were talking about.

248
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,333
She confirmed
the anti-depressants.

249
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,627
Go bet with someone else
if you wanna explain the heart problems.

250
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,254
She confirmed them by winking.

251
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,059
Maybe there was a cute guy
across the room.

252
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,758
She got better when I treated her.
Even I'm not that cute.

253
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,011
Two unrelated symptoms.
Just a coincidence?

254
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,470
Or you're grasping at straws

255
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,598
to avoid admitting
you can't do this on your own.

256
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:31,974
Fine.

257
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,935
What explains the fever
and persistent tachycardia?

258
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,521
It could be anything.
Endocarditis?

259
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,440
No. Fever, no infection.

260
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,110
- Um...
- Keep going, you're doing great.

261
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,033
You win.

262
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,701
- I don't believe you.
- I'm not gonna play this game.

263
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,703
Just give me the damn résumés.

264
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,166
And my guitar.

265
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,877
I don't have it.

266
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:05,382
Although I did hear some plangent
strumming from under that couch earlier.

267
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,349
Wow.

268
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,852
This kidnapper isn't just bold.
He's diabolical.

269
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,689
I guess he realized he probably
shouldn't give it back to you

270
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,108
until after you've had
the interviews.

271
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,169
Huh!

272
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,921
You didn't write anything.

273
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,257
So, what you're saying is,
you didn't find that one big explanation

274
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,843
'cause there isn't one. Clever.

275
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,471
Well, let's just say
your anti-depressant theory

276
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,764
does explain the fever.

277
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,350
What about the heart?
And don't say a building fell on her.

278
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,811
Okay.

279
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,896
- A structure collapsed...
- Shut up.

280
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,733
Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature
releases potassium, causes V-tach.

281
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,653
You'd think she'd get crush syndrome
after she was crushed,

282
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,862
not two days later.

283
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,158
Microvascular occlusions, takes
that long for the blood to reperfuse.

284
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,664
She'd have a baggy heart.
Echo it to confirm.

285
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,839
Ls crush syndrome good or bad?

286
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:27,965
Does it sound good?

287
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,425
I mean, compared
to the other things it could be.

288
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,030
There are no other things
it could be.

289
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,594
Then why are you testing her?

290
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,513
Excellent question.

291
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,436
What? What is it?

292
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,313
The heart's fine.

293
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,232
Why is she sweating?

294
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,984
Her fever's back.

295
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,318
Why would her fever be back?

296
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,030
- I can't say.
- You don't know?

297
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,284
Well, I know. I just can't say,
'cause you'll hit me.

298
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,620
Let's discuss this
in front of witnesses.

299
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,789
The DT's?

300
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,249
So, she's an alcoholic now?

301
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,210
Her first fever was from
the medication for her depression.

302
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,336
Or you're wrong.

303
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,715
The second fever was from
the self-medication for depression.

304
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,716
This is insane.

305
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,469
You don't think I would have noticed
her being constantly drunk?

306
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,388
You were practically living with
Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that.

307
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,890
Tone it down or I will hit you.

308
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,850
Fine. I'll do
liver enzyme tests.

309
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,729
Liver enzymes can also be elevated
from musculoskeletal trauma.

310
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,231
They'd be there whether she had
a drinking problem or not.

311
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,485
They don't know that.
Just pretend to confirm.

312
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,486
What's the treatment?

313
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,945
She's not an alcoholic.

314
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,448
Hair of the dog. IV alcohol.

315
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,949
Taper it off after a few days.

316
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,785
She's sick and traumatized
and half dead,

317
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,620
you wanna make her drunk?

318
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,413
Just do it.

319
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,374
You can't do this. We lived together.
We were gonna have kids.

320
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,751
You barely even know her.

321
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,212
Apparently, neither did you.

322
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,739
<i>Hello?</i>

323
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,408
Hi, can I speak to
Trevor Kaufman?

324
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,452
<i>Yo, yo. This is Trev. What up?</i>

325
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:24,581
This is Dr. Gregory House.
Can you come in tomorrow to interview?

326
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,626
<i>House? Are you serious? Awesome!</i>

327
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,991
<i>Hey, I got the House interview!</i>

328
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,797
<i>Oh, look at me,
I got the House interview!</i>

329
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,132
<i>- Shut up! Would you shut up?
- I'm so cool.</i>

330
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,092
<i>Hey, give me the phone back.</i>

331
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,469
<i>Give the phone back, seriously, man.</i>

332
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,225
I got a page.

333
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,309
No, you didn't.

334
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,561
They called a code.

335
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,854
No, they didn't.

336
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,651
You got a page,
but not from us.

337
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,499
Did you ever see
<i>Raid</i> on Entebbe?

338
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah.

339
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,210
In the end
they release the hostages.

340
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,962
<i>How's that working for you?</i>

341
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,505
The Ugandans played fair.

342
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,258
They didn't move the hostages
on the Israelis.

343
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:21,013
Once again, I'm in awe
of the kidnapper's tactical brilliance.

344
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:25,684
What is El <i>Fuego</i> Del Amor,
and why do you need 10 of them?

345
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,605
It's a telenovela.

346
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,273
I'm learning Spanish.

347
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,233
<i>Say adios.</i>

348
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,902
Are you erasing my TiVo?

349
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,070
House, not the season finale!

350
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,489
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

351
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,576
<i>I smoke them out
of their hidey-holes.</i>

352
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,203
Do you know what terrorists do
when you don't negotiate?

353
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,788
They terrorize.

354
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,666
Bring it on.

355
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,299
Fever's down. Sweating is abated.
Heart's working fine.

356
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,011
I guess House was right, again.

357
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,804
That's good news, right?

358
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,847
It is good news.

359
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,692
So, what does this mean,
she's an alcoholic?

360
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,059
There's no other explanation?

361
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,896
No, sorry.

362
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,731
It doesn't make any sense.

363
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:16,276
Dr. Cuddy, she's doing this thing
with her mouth again.

364
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,406
It's been on and off
for the last couple of hours.

365
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,408
Is she trying to talk?

366
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,119
No.

367
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,789
I think she's screaming.

368
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,506
Morning.

369
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,840
Huh!

370
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,384
Where did you come from?

371
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,303
Apes, if you believe
the Democrats.

372
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,389
I heard you were there
when I was proven right.

373
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,914
The alcohol treatment
took away the heart and fever problems.

374
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,560
Yes, I was also there
when you were proven wrong.

375
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,563
She'd been silently screaming
for two hours.

376
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,526
Amylase and lipase are through the roof.
She has pancreatitis.

377
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,528
IV alcohol could cause pancreatitis.

378
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,280
Okay-

379
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,488
You're not gonna argue with me?

380
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,624
No.

381
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,709
You think I'm right?

382
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:14,835
No.

383
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,878
- Why not?
- No.

384
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,673
That's not really
a yes or no question.

385
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,884
Which is why
I'm not answering it.

386
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,178
If it's not
the IV alcohol, it's gotta be...

387
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,930
Not interested.

388
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,599
If I'm wrong,

389
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,518
she's gonna die.

390
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,353
Are you sure you're still
Dean of Medicine?

391
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,482
I'm not interested in arguing because
I'm not interested in enabling you.

392
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,737
You need someone to bounce ideas
off of. You need a team.

393
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,116
Don't follow me.

394
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,623
MAO inhibitor caused the fever,
alcohol caused the pancreatitis,

395
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,752
alcohol withdrawal
caused the V-tach.

396
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,672
Your logic is irrefutable.

397
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,382
You're wrong.

398
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,343
Well, who are you gonna believe?
A classic toy,

399
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,804
or a woman who,
if she had any confidence in her ideas,

400
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,766
wouldn't feel the need
to distract you with a water bra?

401
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,811
Are you really just gonna treat
the pancreatitis?

402
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:14,978
Are you here to enable me?

403
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,647
I don't want her to die
because you're stubborn.

404
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:20,942
Wow. So, you can enable and rationalize
at the same time.

405
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,319
Guess you are still
Dean of Medicine.

406
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,237
If you're right, then this guy,

407
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:28,658
who's not an ass, who's not
a workaholic, who's not a sociopath,

408
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:32,704
has somehow missed both
her depression and severe alcoholism.

409
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,916
Yes. Imagine that,
a couple with secrets!

410
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,126
Why would she lie?

411
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,838
Okay, alcoholism,
you don't wanna advertise, but...

412
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,137
If you're right, there'd be
an abnormality on the pancreas.

413
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,139
At least do an MRI to confirm.

414
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:15,205
Oh, my God!

415
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,167
This guy means business.

416
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,754
Or guys, could be multiple guys.

417
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,840
Or gal. Who knows?

418
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,927
All I can say is,
this reeks of boldness.

419
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,013
Lam not hiring a team.

420
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:38,770
You ever tighten a guitar string
really, really slowly?

421
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,606
Past the point
it can handle the strain?

422
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,734
It makes this weird sound,

423
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,654
almost like a scream.

424
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,616
I thought
this was gonna be fun.

425
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:07,549
I mess with you, you mess with me,
eventually you give in.

426
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:12,512
But you've shown a startling
lack of humor, which got me thinking.

427
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:13,722
Oh, God.

428
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,099
What's the real reason
you won't hire a team?

429
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:17,809
I told you.
I don't need a team.

430
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,936
Then hire three people
and let them sit on their asses.

431
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:20,982
That wouldn't be right.

432
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,857
Three years ago, you hired a team.
What's changed?

433
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,194
I've become a man of principle.
I've gotten smarter.

434
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,070
What answer will make
Socrates shut up?

435
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,907
What's changed is,
you hired a team.

436
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,701
You connected with a team,
you worked with a team

437
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,995
and you lost a team.

438
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,580
Damn.

439
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,749
There's no abnormalities
in her pancreas.

440
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:45,253
You fall in love. You get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.

441
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,130
Hiring employees
can be even tougher,

442
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,841
because you know, eventually,
they're gonna leave.

443
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,094
There's increased T2 signal
on her hepatic capsule,

444
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,679
if you know what I mean.

445
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,184
You got hurt. Get over it.

446
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,605
Now, if you'll excuse me,

447
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,484
my patient's about to start bleeding
out of her mouth and anus.

448
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,830
Internal bleeding.

449
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:24,292
Not anymore.
Now it's all over the place.

450
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,585
Why are you here?

451
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,296
That's my patient down there.

452
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,839
You're here because I'm here.

453
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,302
I am done enabling you.

454
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,304
I know.

455
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,232
The alcohol didn't cause the
pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.

456
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,858
The question is,
what caused the internal bleeding?

457
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:49,985
I hate myself.

458
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,028
You do know that the patient had
a building lying on her.

459
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:52,988
Four days ago.

460
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,406
Bleeding can start at any time.

461
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,824
She's bleeding
from five different sites.

462
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,709
Do you think they synchronized
their watches?

463
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,661
She got Warfarin
after her hip surgery.

464
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,163
It's designed
to mess with bleeding patterns.

465
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,040
Fever, heart and bleeding.

466
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,366
Three problems,
three completely different explanations.

467
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,628
She must be the unluckiest woman
in the world.

468
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,839
I only cling
to this crazy theory

469
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,044
because it's been proven right
every step of the way.

470
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,259
Each treatment worked.

471
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,261
Yes. She looks
perfectly healthy.

472
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,848
This much bleeding
is a symptom of something more.

473
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,058
And you need a team,
because you're wrong

474
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,810
and you're gonna
kill this woman.

475
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,404
If I had a team,
this patient would be dead,

476
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,323
because they'd be here
instead of me

477
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,409
and they wouldn't notice the size
of this woman's uterus.

478
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:49,336
Hi. How's it going?
Mind if I observe?

479
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,922
Got a big room up top
with a big window just for that.

480
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,299
Stop that.

481
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,053
You wanna look at vaginae,
there are websites for that.

482
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,804
You think I'm made of money?

483
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,807
Can you get him out of here?

484
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:07,395
Enlarged uterus means
that she was recently pregnant.

485
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,483
She's a good liar, but I doubt she can
hide a baby from her boyfriend.

486
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:19,074
Scraping in the uterus
indicates that she had an abortion,

487
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,201
and nothing
in her medical history.

488
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,786
Only one reason
to hide an abortion.

489
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,579
Boyfriend wants babies,
she doesn't.

490
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,744
She's bleeding everywhere.

491
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,750
Unless the guy was performing
an abortion with a shotgun...

492
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,210
<i>Stop enabling him.</i>

493
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,129
It's not the abortion,
it's what she did after.

494
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,881
The boyfriend would have
noticed condoms,

495
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,217
he would notice abstinence.

496
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,886
He would not notice the pill,

497
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,807
which means
I don't need a team!

498
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:52,023
Hey, where's your mother
in common law?

499
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,859
Dr. House,
this is Doug McMurtry.

500
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,320
His girlfriend
was working with Megan when...

501
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,073
She's dead?

502
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,449
She passed this morning.

503
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,203
Well, then why
are you still here?

504
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,333
I need the old lady's consent
to do some treatment.

505
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,210
What'd you find out?

506
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,547
I wish I could tell you,
but since you're not legally related...

507
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,549
What the hell did you find out?

508
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,638
Your girlfriend
had an abortion.

509
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,685
See why I didn't tell you?

510
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,940
I'd be insane to also tell you
that she's on the pill.

511
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,527
No, she's not.

512
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,112
If they'd known she was on it,

513
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,157
they wouldn't have given her
a blood thinner after her hip surgery.

514
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,367
The combination caused the bleeding.

515
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,744
It's good news. It's treatable.

516
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,270
Just give her Tamoxifen,
which is normally a breast cancer...

517
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,707
That's not true.

518
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,877
We wanna have kids.

519
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:55,837
Hmm.

520
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,966
See, I already did
the blood tests.

521
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:05,305
And either she lied to you,
or her blood lied to us.

522
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:16,399
Tell Megan I'm glad
she's gonna be okay.

523
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,618
How're you doing?

524
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,245
I got cancer.

525
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,082
You're on an oncology ward.
Everybody's got cancer.

526
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,292
You want sympathy,
you ought to try

527
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,461
the hardly-anything-
wrong-with-me ward.

528
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,589
In fact,
why don't I take you there right now?

529
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,841
How sick are you? Can you walk?

530
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:42,926
Are you a doctor?

531
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:46,221
Admitted today.
First day of a five-day chemo course.

532
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,348
Yeah, you can walk.
Come on, let's go.

533
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,266
Does Dr. Wilson
know you're here?

534
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,604
Well, if he didn't,
this would be really stupid.

535
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,564
'Cause then he wouldn't know
where his patient was.

536
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,442
He might think
he'd been kidnapped.

537
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,819
Now the room upstairs
is bigger, it's got cable,

538
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,280
better-looking
sponge bath nurses.

539
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,242
If you feel sick,
you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

540
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,203
He's getting his last sat
of hormone shots.

541
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:23,049
You put her on Tamoxifen?
An anticancer drug?

542
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,592
It blocks estrogen receptors.

543
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,804
Does it also block breathing,
and kidney function?

544
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,722
She's crashing.

545
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,560
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

546
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,607
This is Dr. Marvin. We're bringing
this patient over now. Thanks.

547
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,609
Anybody here a doctor?

548
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,156
Kidney failure, spiking fever,
breathing difficulties.

549
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,408
Any theories?

550
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:54,414
Am I in an
M. Night Shyamalan movie?

551
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,292
You're House, right?

552
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,336
Okay, I assume you know me

553
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:04,340
because I once insulted you,
your patient, or your relatives.

554
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,843
If that's so, I apologize.
I was drunk that day.

555
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,387
Patient initially presented
with crush injuries.

556
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,556
I know you because Dr. Cuddy
issued a memo.

557
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,978
Telling you
to cooperate fully with me?

558
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,187
No.

559
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,899
Figured that was a long shot.

560
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,319
Anybody here not get that memo?

561
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,371
Fungal infection.

562
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,333
Don't you have a patient?

563
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,543
She shot herself in the leg
while high on meth.

564
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,920
Wouldn't hurt her
to be in pain for a little while.

565
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,381
Fungal infection
would be in her eyes by now.

566
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,382
Haemophilus?

567
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,009
Doesn't explain the remitting fever.

568
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:52,096
You've heard that I've got
a job opening, right?

569
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,223
I just care about people.

570
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,434
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

571
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,354
ARDS doesn't explain anything,
except the breathing.

572
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,397
If you care about people,
you're not getting the job.

573
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,983
I was lying. Crush syndrome.

574
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,987
Doesn't explain the breathing.

575
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,672
- What was the problem with ARDS?
- Only explained the breathing.

576
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,983
- The crush syndrome?
- It didn't explain the breathing.

577
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:15,453
Are you a fan of symmetry?

578
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,497
- Sure.
- Weird.

579
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,291
'Cause your eyes are lopsided,

580
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,834
and by eyes I mean breasts.

581
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:30,134
ARDS and crush syndrome,
both reactions to severe trauma.

582
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,511
Why can't she have both?

583
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,096
Because...

584
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,142
Because then,
there's nothing we could do.

585
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,897
Boy, you remind me of someone.

586
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,857
Send me your résumé.

587
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:48,069
I'll put it on top of the pile
that I'm never gonna look at.

588
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,037
I couldn't leave.

589
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,792
You don't seem like the type of person
who would give up on giving up.

590
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,044
I love her.

591
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,421
You loved somebody.

592
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,757
Somebody who didn't drink,
wanted to have babies

593
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,134
and wasn't miserable.

594
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,719
I know she lied, but...

595
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,305
What are you doing?
Why are you saying these things to him?

596
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,436
The woman you love doesn't exist.
This woman is dying.

597
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:25,982
She has Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome and crush syndrome.

598
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,775
Her body's basically giving up.

599
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,988
We can keep her on supported dialysis
and hope for the best.

600
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,788
Never mind.
She has a lump in her arm.

601
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,833
Does that mean you're wrong?

602
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,794
Well, that'd be
good news for you guys.

603
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,421
We'll know after a biopsy.

604
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,803
Which patient is that?

605
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,890
- Megan...
- House's patient.

606
00:34:59,015 --> 00:34:59,932
Yeah.

607
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,018
- Didn't you get my memo?
- Sure.

608
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,853
Got both memos.

609
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,646
Both.

610
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,901
And the second memo said
to ignore the first memo.

611
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,403
Yeah, seemed odd.

612
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,447
I did an MRI and...

613
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,615
Of course you did.

614
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,451
What'd you find?

615
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:19,660
It's kind of freaky.

616
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,370
She's got growths
all over the place.

617
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,752
She's got tumors?

618
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,170
Not exactly.

619
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:32,673
The growths are
eosinophilic granulomas.

620
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,135
They are usually
from allergic reactions,

621
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,637
so I'm putting her on steroids.

622
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,264
Allergy to what?
She doesn't have allergies.

623
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,225
We don't know.

624
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,602
Unfortunately, the only drug
she's had enough of

625
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,771
to have this kind of reaction
is cephalosporin.

626
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,272
And why is that unfortunate?

627
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,817
'Cause she was on it two months ago.
That's what you mean, right?

628
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:53,694
She took it for strep throat
so she can't be allergic to it.

629
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,821
It would seem so.

630
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:57,031
What is this hospital
doing to her?

631
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,451
She has had
three separate medical disasters,

632
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:04,497
and now she's dying of an allergy
she can't possibly have?

633
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,109
Mr. Lee.
I just have to check...

634
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,280
Sam? Are you okay?

635
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,580
What are you doing here?

636
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:46,914
I was taking a nap.

637
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,583
Where's my patient?

638
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,796
You stole my patient.

639
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,132
You kidnapped my guitar.

640
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:57,258
Give him back.

641
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:58,968
Only when you give her back.

642
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,469
It's a she?

643
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,430
It's certainly not a dude.

644
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:05,349
It's a guitar.
You took a human being!

645
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,727
Now who doesn't have
a sense of humor?

646
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,563
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

647
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,608
What, are you listening
for the distant sound of screaming?

648
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,026
The nurses know to call me.

649
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,694
They don't know who he is!

650
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,822
His name's right there on the chart.
Now go away. I'm working.

651
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,825
They give him the wrong meds, who
the hell knows what's gonna happen?

652
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,996
House!

653
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,209
Bad things would happen.

654
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,964
He's in Room 318.

655
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,272
What are you giving Megan?

656
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,732
Megan? Nothing.

657
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,694
Nothing? What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

658
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,613
Her? Nothing.

659
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,365
Then why are you giving her drugs?

660
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,951
Just some amphetamines
to wake her up.

661
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:08,704
Everything could be explained
by her lying to you.

662
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,874
The anti-depressants,
the drinking, the pill,

663
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,085
until now.

664
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:18,172
Now she's allergic to something
the chart says she's not allergic to.

665
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:23,302
That's not her lying, that's the chart
lying, which doesn't make sense.

666
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,433
You know Liz Masters?

667
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,019
- No.
- Yeah, she worked with Megan.

668
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,313
That was her boyfriend
you met outside the morgue.

669
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,648
Mmm.

670
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,858
This is her chart.

671
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,906
She's on MAO inhibitors for depression.
She's on the pill.

672
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,283
She had an abortion a month ago,

673
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,202
and she's allergic to cephalosporin.

674
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,997
What's going on here?
What, are you saying this isn't Megan?

675
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,050
Yes.

676
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,927
Ben?

677
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,303
<i>Since when?</i>

678
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,681
Since right before
I began pretending I loved it.

679
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:12,143
She's the same size as Megan,
the same build, the same hair color.

680
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:15,104
<i>They were both
horribly injured, unrecognizably.</i>

681
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,356
EMT teams do not second-guess

682
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,276
family members' identifications
at accident scenes.

683
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,572
No. Liz died yesterday.
This isn't Liz.

684
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,577
I know Megan.

685
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:35,082
I know her hair,
I know her hands, I know her smell.

686
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,296
What's your name?

687
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,886
Liz.

688
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,223
On, God!

689
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,400
Your girlfriend never lied to you.

690
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,408
Oh, God.

691
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,081
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

692
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,668
You talking to me?

693
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,087
Go away.

694
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:14,598
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

695
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,851
How'd you know it was me?

696
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:20,271
There's a scent given off
by wounded feral cats.

697
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,148
You were wrong.

698
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,401
I got everything right,
just treated the wrong...

699
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,194
They had a good relationship.

700
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,571
He couldn't even identify her.

701
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:31,907
And you were wrong about needing
a team. She almost died.

702
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,451
So, I almost need a team.

703
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:37,997
You were content with
your "people are idiots" theory.

704
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:39,915
But Cameron would
never have accepted

705
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,376
that this guy knew nothing
about the love of his life.

706
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,130
And as soon as you claimed
it was multiple conditions,

707
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,632
Foreman would have done anything
to prove you wrong,

708
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,260
and then Chase would have done anything
to prove you right.

709
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,181
Any one of them
would have solved this days ago.

710
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:58,684
Hire a team.

711
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,979
I don't care how you do it.

712
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,357
Just do it.

713
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,739
<i>Sometimes I am wrong.</i>

714
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,659
I have a gift for observation.

715
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:21,373
For reading people and situations,
but sometimes I am wrong.

716
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,211
This will be the longest
job interview of your life.

717
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,171
I will test you in ways

718
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:32,635
that you will often consider
unfair, demeaning and illegal.

719
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:35,137
And you'll often be right.

720
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,681
Look to your left.

721
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:40,017
Now look to your right.

722
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,437
By the end of six weeks,

723
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:45,981
one of you will be gone,

724
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:49,652
as will 28 more of you.

725
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:53,364
Wear a cup.
