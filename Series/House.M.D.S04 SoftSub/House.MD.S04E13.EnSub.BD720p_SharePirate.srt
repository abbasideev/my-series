1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,343
Whoever thought walking in a circle at
two miles an hour would be draining?

2
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:11,137
Fresh air, exercise.

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,306
You know, some things
do have their negative sides.

4
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,517
Our income just
got cut in half.

5
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,061
And we get to spend
twice as much time together.

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,647
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour is over.

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,818
Out of my way.

8
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:27,612
We have a legal right
to hold you up for 15 seconds.

9
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,072
Fifteen, fourteen...

10
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,198
One.

11
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,866
Eleven, ten...

12
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:33,785
Ow!

13
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:37,330
Just trying to do my job.

14
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,127
Hey, relax.
Three more seconds and you can go.

15
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,465
Are you telling me what to do?

16
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,300
It's okay.

17
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,970
Just take a breath.

18
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,055
Get the hell off me!

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,558
I think it's been 15...

20
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,188
You Okay?

21
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,652
Oh, my God. Jeff?

22
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,439
Standby.

23
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,160
Place is a mess.

24
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:00,079
Welcome to a world without nurses.
Here, you can start with these.

25
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,457
It's not my fault.
I don't use nurses.

26
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,459
Cuddy was looking for you,
said she would send you down here.

27
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,377
I know. That's why I'm here.

28
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,671
Because Cuddy
hasn't found you yet.

29
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,842
She's going to look everywhere
except the place she wants me to be.

30
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,358
- Hey.
- I've got an aortic dissection here.

31
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,735
What's with the idiot?

32
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:35,573
Fainting spell
and a recent history of dysgeusia,

33
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,367
everything tastes like
lemon meringue pie.

34
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,785
You want to take him?

35
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,911
No.

36
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,583
Si...

37
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,294
Why do you have two
lunches in front of you?

38
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,380
Been here for two meals.

39
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,507
- And you're happy with that?
- No.

40
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,926
I just don't see much
use in complaining.

41
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,719
Seriously?

42
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,014
It's a pretty useful tool.

43
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,767
You complain,
make people miserable.

44
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,728
Then they do what you want,
to make the misery go away.

45
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,731
We probably should say something.
Maybe I can call one of the doctors...

46
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,775
They're doing their best.

47
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,905
Ow!

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,699
What the hell?

49
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,994
I'm sure it was an accident.

50
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,121
Is he Canadian?

51
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,998
He's a low priority.

52
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,125
Is that a yes?

53
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,461
- He's just...
- Happy-

54
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,798
I've got to stop this,
before it spreads.

55
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,135
You guys are done.

56
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:43,349
Could be a metabolic disorder,
toxic exposure,

57
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,853
carcinoma of the tongue metastasized
to the brain, epilepsy, M.S.

58
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:50,148
Or it could be the flu
and we should all be back in the E.R.

59
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,901
No, you're ignoring
the big symptom.

60
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:57,530
What if we were looking at both the flu
and decent parenting.

61
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,909
Okay, you two
are perfectly healthy.

62
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,119
This guy wasn't pandering.
He wasn't vanilla nice.

63
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,788
He was nice without any
aspiration of personal gain.

64
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,665
I'm thinking genetic defect.

65
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,959
Niceness is a defect?

66
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:14,797
Three cavemen see a stranger
running towards them with a spear

67
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:19,010
one fights, one flees, one smiles
and invites him over for fondue.

68
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,970
That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

69
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,932
And how long has the
patient been suffering?

70
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,351
At least as long as his wife
has known him, eleven years.

71
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,811
The chances of him having an undiagnosed
pathology for that long...

72
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,146
What are you saying?

73
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,481
Evolution is wrong?

74
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,109
Where do you think
we are? 21st century America?

75
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,695
He's saying that
statistics are true, too.

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,364
The world is a bell curve,

77
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,699
most of us fall within
the standard deviation.

78
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,034
But there are outliers.

79
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,454
And if we believe in the existence
of extreme jerkiness,

80
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,290
which I suspect that we do,

81
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:54,170
then we also have to accept the
existence of the opposite extreme.

82
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,632
You want it to be a symptom,
because then we're supposed to be jerks,

83
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,051
which means you don't even
have to try to be nice.

84
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,222
Okay, maybe I am biased.
Let's take a vote.

85
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,891
Who thinks that niceness
is not a symptom?

86
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:11,562
And who thinks that
their vote counts?

87
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,195
You two, check out his home
for toxins. Taub and 31...

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,363
31?

89
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,950
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that
either way was good with you.

90
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,287
Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors,
EEG for nerve damage

91
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,207
and test whatever comes out of him
for everything else.

92
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,514
Too much axis tilt.

93
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,352
Don't release until your thumb's
at the bottom of the ball.

94
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,438
I assume Wilson was busy.

95
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:54,981
Again.

96
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,996
No axis tilt.

97
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,334
With Amber?

98
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,419
Again.

99
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:20,048
Still. It was nice of you
to invite me. This is fun.

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,302
No, it wasn't. No, it isn't.

101
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,187
I didn't invite you to
be nice, I invited you

102
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,099
because bowling isn't one of the two
things guys do by themselves.

103
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,851
What's the second thing?

104
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,020
Other hand.

105
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,486
Well, if people are incapable of being
nice, why bother having the word?

106
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,072
The ontological
proof of niceness.

107
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,450
The existence of the word proves the
existence of the concept.

108
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,536
Look out for those minotaurs
on your drive home.

109
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,707
And I thought motives didn't matter,
only results mattered.

110
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,126
So what are you gonna do?

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,796
To screw up Wilson's relationship
so you don't have to listen to me

112
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,464
while you bowl.

113
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:06,594
I wish the best for them,
and their tragically deformed children.

114
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,306
She's good at being bad.

115
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,226
You might not be
able to destroy her.

116
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:17,105
As long as I give it my best shot,
I can hold my head high.

117
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,941
Cameron had this
one insufferable friend.

118
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,236
She wasn't going to get rid of her,
and I sure wasn't going to join them.

119
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,405
So I just said,
"See her on Thursdays."

120
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,200
I know it's not as exciting
as an exploding birthday cake,

121
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,871
but, hell, I don't want to hang out
with her every night anyway.

122
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:38,334
That's amazing. Cameron only has
one insufferable friend?

123
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,812
Joint custody.

124
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,355
Of Wilson?

125
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,858
Unless we have
another love child.

126
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,693
Deal with him.

127
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,820
He needs a mother figure.

128
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,864
I'm not saying you're not entitled
to spend time with him.

129
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,116
I'm just saying
I'm entitled, too.

130
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,245
I don't know how to deal with him
when he's being reasonable.

131
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,706
This is reasonable?
This is crazy.

132
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,958
You're not a child,
you can make your own plans.

133
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,128
No. Crazy is what House
would normally do in this situation,

134
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,297
swap your lubricant
with super glue.

135
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,464
The man knows me.

136
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,051
This is his way
of accepting us.

137
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,887
It's actually a very
touching moment.

138
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:35,016
I'm proposing I get every other
day and every other weekend.

139
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,272
I have Yoga Wednesdays,
you can have him then,

140
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,108
but you have to have
him home by 11:00.

141
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,571
We can swap weekends.

142
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,865
Mondays and Wednesdays.
And midnight.

143
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,671
If he's not home till midnight,
we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.

144
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,078
Wilson, make a ruling.

145
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:58,956
No.

146
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,210
You two are like dogs circling
each other in the park.

147
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:05,171
And I say that
with all the love in the world.

148
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,376
You need to sniff
each other's butts, bare your teeth

149
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,217
and arrive at some
strange détente.

150
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,636
Otherwise you'll
end up biting each other's eyes out.

151
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,598
Again, with all the
love in the world.

152
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,227
I'll let you sniff first.

153
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,562
Take my deal or get
out of my apartment.

154
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,650
Take my deal or I move in.

155
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,700
This guy worked for Habitat
for Humanity in Costa Rica.

156
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,619
And coaches handicapped kids.

157
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,454
You think we should do a work up,
on the other coaches?

158
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,206
It is possible
he's too perfect.

159
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,458
I'm not saying he's perfect,
I'm saying he's trying to be.

160
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,585
It's what people do.

161
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,088
What?

162
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,506
That's not what people do.

163
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:52,218
People usually suck, but they
want to be good, want to be nice.

164
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,678
House?

165
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,763
Exception that proves the rule.

166
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,765
What sort of argument is that?

167
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,933
Bad one.

168
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,981
That might be relevant.

169
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:09,819
Hydrofluoric acid. Lowers his calcium,
causes the fainting and taste issue.

170
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,029
But not the niceness.

171
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,614
Wouldn't that be nice?

172
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,577
You are King Solomon.

173
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,872
If you want us to cut him in half,
we're cool with that.

174
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,834
My boyfriend's too much of a wuss
to make the call for himself.

175
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,336
And I mean that with
all the love in the world.

176
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,923
I'm gonna piss off one of them.
And they both scare me.

177
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,651
"Your treatment of patients
is reprehensible."

178
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,902
You're reading his
performance review?

179
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:54,530
I'm busy. We have
a nurses' strike.

180
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,450
"Your management of employees
borders on abuse."

181
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,160
Let's go.

182
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:02,371
No, I... I want to hear it.

183
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,249
"You are overtly contemptuous
of hospital hierarchy."

184
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,168
And covertly.

185
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,004
But I suppose, you
didn't know about that.

186
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,841
"Your attitude towards supervisory
personnel is disrespectful."

187
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:17,178
"And a disturbingly large proportion of
your comments are racist or sexist."

188
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:20,681
That top makes you look
like an Afghani prostitute.

189
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,975
Would be an example of that.

190
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,686
Sign this.

191
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,855
- House, I got the...
- It can wait.

192
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,191
I will sign if you
will give us a ruling.

193
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:34,195
I will give you a ruling
if you do the reviews on your team.

194
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,035
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

195
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,996
- What did you offer him?
- 00,

196
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,042
and alternate weekends.

197
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,875
00, and alternate weekends.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,837
Yes! Wednesday nights
are Ladies' Nights at Cheetah's.

199
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,173
Calcium's normal.

200
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,008
Wow. It really could wait.

201
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,927
- Everything's normal.
- And you thought it wouldn't be?

202
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,221
He's a carpet cleaner, he's got
a home full of hydrofluoric acid.

203
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,931
Doesn't mean his
calcium should be low.

204
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,456
Yeah, actually, it kind of does.
HF causes lower levels of...

205
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,519
- Lower, not low.
- Lower than normal.

206
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,354
Lower than yesterday.
Yesterday might have been high.

207
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,356
What's lower than high?

208
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,984
He actually has hypercalcemia,

209
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,945
which is being lowered
to normal by the HF.

210
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,614
So what gives us elevated calcium,
bad taste and fainting?

211
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,032
I take it you know.

212
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,326
Get the team.
This is gonna be fun.

213
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,874
Hello, again.

214
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,586
These people think
you're not too nice.

215
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,713
Too nice? For what?

216
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,800
For life as we know it to have evolved
without an intelligent designer.

217
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,927
I'm going to prove them wrong.

218
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,096
Your wife is very ugly.

219
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,097
Get out of here.

220
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,140
Deb...

221
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,227
He's obviously
trying to prove a point.

222
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,982
I think I just did. You're either
perfect or you're sick.

223
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,948
And in my experience,
sick is much more common.

224
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,777
He's not sick. He's nice.

225
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,864
Nice in the sense that your toaster
is nice for making you breakfast.

226
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,199
It's the only thing his
wiring will let him do.

227
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,034
He has Williams Syndrome.

228
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,621
Your husband is missing
the genes that make him suspicious.

229
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:08,914
You're wrong, he's...

230
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,916
Relax, there's no cure.

231
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,210
He's gonna go right on
tasting lemon meringue pie,

232
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,962
fainting and being a sap.

233
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:16,964
What about the other symptoms?

234
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,382
He has no other symptoms.

235
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,633
But Williams does.

236
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,760
He's got the teeth,
the glasses...

237
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,721
Williams cuts IQ by 20...

238
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,931
He doesn't work in
the physics department,

239
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,100
except when they spill
a black hole on their carpet.

240
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,019
Elfin appearance?

241
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,606
Yeah, he's more Legolas
than Keebler.

242
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,484
Bet you he can still crack
off a batch of Pecan Sandies.

243
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,776
Perfect pitch?

244
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,653
You love to karaoke, right?

245
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,615
- I suck.
- Modest.

246
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,075
- Another symptom.
- No, he really does suck.

247
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,870
Give us a warble.
Know any Cher?

248
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,206
No, but I know Bread.

249
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,250
<i>Baby,</i> I'm-a <i>want</i> you.

250
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,045
<i>Baby, I'm-a need you.</i>

251
00:13:56,587 --> 00:14:01,425
<i>You're the only one
I care enough to hurt about.</i>

252
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,260
<i>Maybe I'm-a...</i>

253
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,767
What's the matter?

254
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,686
He's stroking!

255
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,860
Not a moment too soon.

256
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,665
You were wrong.

257
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:36,877
Why do people say that with such
pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know.

258
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,672
It means the patient gets to keep
being nice. Why does that offend you?

259
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:40,923
It's the way he said it.

260
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:45,678
He wasn't relieved, he was excited.
He was also wrong.

261
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,805
And I say that with
no sense of pleasure.

262
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,370
Patient tested
negative for Williams,

263
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,559
which means the stroke
and everything else wasn't caused...

264
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:55,688
You have a friendly demeanor
but you sometimes get too involved.

265
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:58,566
You relate well
to your peers and patients

266
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,735
and you complete tasks
in a timely manner.

267
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,821
Please sign.

268
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,239
- What the hell was that?
- I have to give

269
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,449
each of you
performance reviews.

270
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,536
Plenty of other conditions
can cause debilitating niceness.

271
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,788
How is that supposed
to help him?

272
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,249
I don't know,
how was it supposed to help Wilson?

273
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,002
Cross out Wilson's name and the date
and then fill in your own.

274
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,629
The point of a review
is to give feedback to help...

275
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,548
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.

276
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,551
Wouldn't show up on the MRI
without contrast.

277
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,888
I'll go run the tests.

278
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:39,273
He doesn't think it's syphilis, but
he's gonna go run those tests anyway.

279
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,151
Because he doesn't know,
that's why we do tests.

280
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,862
Because he's a wimp.
Because he's afraid of you.

281
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,615
You want me to intimidate him
into not being afraid?

282
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,783
- Not sure I know how to do that.
- Reviews make a difference.

283
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:51,493
People have to listen,
so they have to learn...

284
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,828
I don't think the right time

285
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,914
to tell the dog not to pee
on the rug is semi-annually.

286
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,833
You don't want to
do the paperwork.

287
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,419
I am concerned
about the rain forest.

288
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,714
I'll do it.

289
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,923
I know.

290
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,972
I don't have syphilis.

291
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,515
You don't know.

292
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,143
How many ways
are there to get it?

293
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,687
You can know who you had sex with,
you can't know who she...

294
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,897
I do.

295
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,273
Not for sure.

296
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:26,987
It's a waste of time. I had a stroke.
You can't keep wasting time.

297
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,280
We were tested
for the Peace Corps.

298
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,698
Ten years ago.

299
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,326
You haven't been with
your wife every minute of every day.

300
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,536
You think I'm naive, don't you?

301
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:37,539
I think you're... Yeah.

302
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,874
I know my wife.

303
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,084
She's not perfect.

304
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,045
I'm not perfect.
But she loves me.

305
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:50,135
And she's always loved me.
Every minute, every day.

306
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,027
You're 15 minutes late.

307
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,116
Have you heard the good news?

308
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,493
Miley Cyrus is playing
a third night at the Spectrum?

309
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,495
Happiness is possible.

310
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,789
And not just in this life
but in the next. Where you can...

311
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,876
Oh, you're selling religion! I'm sorry,
I bought some Islam yesterday.

312
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,713
Well, it's where your light
showed signs before mending...

313
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,172
Have a good evening.

314
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,007
- You're late.
- Fifteen minutes.

315
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,301
Sixteen minutes.
My sixteen minutes.

316
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,054
So keep him an extra
sixteen minutes.

317
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,681
You hear that?
She doesn't care.

318
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,726
You're going mini-golfing, what's it
matter? You've got a tee-off time?

319
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,103
It matters because you don't
get to decide what matters.

320
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,022
It was my fault.
I had to take a shower.

321
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,734
Which was my fault.

322
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,152
I have to take a dump.

323
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,864
Anything else I don't need
to know before you leave?

324
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,745
Have fun on your play date.
You've got mommy's numbers, right?

325
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,831
Daddy needs a drink.

326
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,216
I was thinking, if we discount
the niceness issue...

327
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,676
Sit down.

328
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,600
- I think it's a heart defect.
- Nothing on the echo.

329
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,561
Could be a patent foramen ovale.
Explains the stroke and the syncope

330
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,022
and a PFO wouldn't show up
on a routine echo.

331
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,356
I'm going to do a bubble test.

332
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,150
You got a minute, first?

333
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,944
Sure.

334
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,115
I think you've shown remarkable strength
in a difficult situation.

335
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,910
Are you giving me
a performance review?

336
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:38,994
A good one.

337
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,039
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

338
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,501
There was enough blood left over from
his admission work up to run the VDRL.

339
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,460
You doubted your patient?

340
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,797
No, what I thought
didn't matter.

341
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,716
House said he wouldn't let us go on
until we ruled out neurosyphilis.

342
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,802
It's not neurosyphilis,
it's a PFO.

343
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,347
It's neurosyphilis.
The tests were positive.

344
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,533
It's always the same conversation.
They tell you you must be mistaken,

345
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,028
which is why I always run the tests
twice. Then they blame the other guy.

346
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,696
Which makes sense
if they're innocent.

347
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,406
But, obviously,
half of them aren't.

348
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,827
They don't seem to get that they're
busted. Scientifically proven.

349
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,662
Unless your spouse
cheated, too.

350
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,498
Exactly. That's what you're praying for
in that moment, that she cheated, too.

351
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,625
And then, if she doesn't kill
you, you know that she did.

352
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,126
You'd know she betrayed you.

353
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,713
And then you realize
that that sucks worse.

354
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,929
The test must be wrong.

355
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,931
I ran it twice.

356
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,434
Not that test. The one
I took 10 years ago.

357
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,938
What other explanation
is there?

358
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,908
He really sees no
other possibility.

359
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,910
Did you have an affair?

360
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:02,870
No.

361
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,746
Then why aren't you
angry with him?

362
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,587
You ever know anybody
who's just too nice?

363
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,672
- No.
- It's annoying.

364
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,340
Then you realize it's annoying

365
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,759
because they remind you
of what you're not,

366
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,971
that you'll never be
as good as they are.

367
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,600
And then you think,
why can't I?

368
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,352
And before you know it,

369
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,314
that naive idiot you laughed at

370
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,610
has made you a better person.

371
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:42,200
You really think I've been in love
all these years with a symptom?

372
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,870
If syphilis caused
lesions in his brain,

373
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,915
and the lesions
caused personality changes...

374
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,710
You may notice a change in him,
as his condition improves.

375
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,923
I know my husband.
He's not going to change.

376
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,051
You should get yourself tested.

377
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,264
So much for the bell curve.

378
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,808
How can House be an ass
without it being an illness,

379
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,810
but niceness is
a biological crime?

380
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,771
You got five bucks?

381
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,272
Yeah...

382
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,779
Niceness just cost you five bucks,
being an ass generally turns a profit.

383
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:22,866
Kutner, could you excuse us?
I need to do Taub's review.

384
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,660
You can stay.

385
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,371
I think it'd be better
if this was done privately.

386
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,872
This isn't going to be done.

387
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,832
What is it with you guys?
I've given you advice before.

388
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,292
Not as our boss.

389
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,503
What's the difference?
Advice is advice.

390
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,254
Fair enough. I'll go first.

391
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,592
"You demonstrate a great air of
confidence,

392
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,052
which is really pissing me off."

393
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,929
- House authorized me to...
- How long have you known him?

394
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,472
- He's using you.
- I volunteered because.

395
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,473
- I knew he wouldn't...
- He could care less

396
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,892
about the paperwork. He's using
you to screw with you.

397
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,478
He knows it'll annoy us,
we'll stand up to you,

398
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,896
which will force you
to confront the fact that

399
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,272
even though you think
you're our superior,

400
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,607
you're no different from us.

401
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:59,069
He gave you authority,
to keep you in your place.

402
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,407
- It's true.
- Thanks.

403
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:04,532
Not him. What did he say?

404
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,951
Nothing. What's true?

405
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,786
If there's something
wrong with this guy,

406
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,998
it means there's something
wrong with House.

407
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,965
Are you trying to get me drunk?

408
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,594
- What time is it?
- 10:30.

409
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:26,888
She'll kill you.

410
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,433
I'll get you home
before lights out.

411
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:35,105
Great, then she'll kill me.
If I get any more drunk...

412
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,401
It might not work.

413
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,572
If you know what I mean.

414
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,574
Really?

415
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:49,578
You'd think one or more of your ex-wives
would have mentioned that to me.

416
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,955
They told you? Wait.

417
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,666
Why do you want
to get Amber angry?

418
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,084
Because I'm your friend.

419
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,128
No, no, no, you said
you approved.

420
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,088
You said
you were taking the high road.

421
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,923
For how long, the first exit?

422
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,303
Hello, and thank you from saving me
from being righteous to death.

423
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,679
<i>Patient's vomiting blood.</i>

424
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,964
Hematemesis could indicate...

425
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,807
<i>Don't put it on the board.</i>

426
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,975
You don't think it's a symptom?

427
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,061
I think it's my marker.

428
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,896
<i>He has syph and what?</i>

429
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,482
And syph. It can
cause hematemesis.

430
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,193
<i>Not everyone agrees.</i>

431
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,611
How could you...

432
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,571
<i>Because if you all thought
it was just syph</i>

433
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,937
you wouldn't have woken me up
in the middle of the night.

434
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,700
If it was just syph,
he wouldn't be getting worse.

435
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,993
<i>He's already on penicillin.</i>

436
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,620
The bleeding's probably
from liver damage,

437
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:35,373
probably caused by ethanol in
the cleansers or the penicillin.

438
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,210
Two more probablies
than I like to hear.

439
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,754
Liver test and serologies,
are going to take a full day.

440
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,464
Full night, actually.

441
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,049
<i>Guy might not
make it to brunch.</i>

442
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,639
Yes, I knew about
your issue with alcohol.

443
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,808
Yes, I intentionally
got you drunk

444
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,734
to provoke an argument,
between you and Amber.

445
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,604
And why I'd do such a thing
is an interesting question.

446
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,565
But what's more interesting
is that you knew as much as I did,

447
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,778
and you're the one who's pouring down
the drinks. Why?

448
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,656
Because I thought I was out
having fun with a friend.

449
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:11,034
I didn't know the
drinks had subtext.

450
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,162
I gotta get home.

451
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,835
GGT's normal,
that rules out alcohol.

452
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,336
What about serum protein?

453
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,546
It's positive.

454
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,673
Kind of assumed he had protein.

455
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,800
It's how much protein
he has that we care about.

456
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,718
He's positive for syphilis.

457
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,513
Do you mind if I give you
a performance review?

458
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:36,601
Not the patient. House.
He has syphilis.

459
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:45,569
<i>What happened?</i>

460
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,157
<i>Every time I searched my soul,
I found Anna.</i>

461
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,826
<i>Are you going to tell Marie?</i>

462
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,494
<i>I have to.</i>

463
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,954
<i>It will destroy her!</i>

464
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,665
<i>Will it be any worse...</i>

465
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,502
Yes?

466
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,838
You might want
to turn off the TV.

467
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:09,217
I'm multitasking.
Also doing my taxes. And Cuddy.

468
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,635
What did you find out?

469
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,721
Patient has hepatitis.

470
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,724
I assume from your omission of the word
"viral" before the "hep"

471
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,684
that it's not another STD.

472
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,687
Put him on steroids and test him for
sarcoid before the liver failure

473
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,523
becomes liver failed.

474
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,859
We're all doing this.

475
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,154
There's more?

476
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,448
You have syphilis.

477
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,867
<i>Love lasts forever.</i>

478
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,916
No, I don't.

479
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,709
One of us found a vial of your blood
in the lab from when we...

480
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,544
Which one of you?

481
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,171
It's treatable.

482
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,550
We filled a prescription.

483
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,935
You Okay?

484
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,627
So, this is why
he is who he is.

485
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:26,753
We don't know.

486
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:29,756
We know. It's not just
a coincidence.

487
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,299
Wilson says he's
always been a jerk.

488
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,509
But he got worse.

489
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,718
After his leg.

490
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,428
The leg was a coincidence.

491
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,056
Did you sleep with him?

492
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,689
So what's going to happen?
What's gonna change?

493
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:46,773
Maybe he'll be less of a jerk.

494
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,525
Or less of a doctor.

495
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,068
You gotta be a jerk
to be a good doctor?

496
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,778
I don't know. Maybe House does.

497
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,405
Why aren't you answering me?

498
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,907
Because it's none
of their business.

499
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,827
It's none of your business.

500
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,497
I think the STD makes
it my business.

501
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,002
Humans are complicated.

502
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,378
Humans are simple.

503
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,304
A million different things
make us who we are.

504
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,382
You change one,
you change everything.

505
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:16,011
If Mozart was better adjusted,

506
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,306
decides to play catch one day,
maybe there's no <i>Magic Flute.</i>

507
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,188
You did, didn't you?

508
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,610
Something I need to tell you.

509
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,779
You returned him drunk.

510
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,033
- On time.
- Drunk.

511
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,410
On time. No tag backs.

512
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,829
The purpose of the time
was to give me time.

513
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:43,997
So you didn't have sex...

514
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,249
- I like sex.
- You can have it tonight.

515
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,917
<i>The L Word is on.</i>

516
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,712
You don't get to
decide what matters.

517
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,591
Either you're genuinely afraid
I'm gonna make him miserable,

518
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,845
or you're afraid I'm gonna make him
happy, or you simply can't stop screwing

519
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,930
with anything that moves. It doesn't
really matter because,

520
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,223
whatever the reason,

521
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:08,021
you'll only get worse.
Until either I stop seeing Wilson

522
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,565
or I stop you.

523
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,987
What do you think
I'm going to choose?

524
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,112
If you terminate the agreement, that's
not gonna bring peace to the Mideast.

525
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,242
I'm not terminating
the agreement.

526
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,079
I'm amending the agreement.

527
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,790
I'm adding penalty clauses.

528
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,502
Fine. Whoever violates it
gets their finger cut off.

529
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,379
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

530
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,755
You want people to drive safer,

531
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,841
take out the airbags and attach a
machete pointing at their neck.

532
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,302
No one will drive over
three miles per hour.

533
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,678
- I'm not cutting...
- We'll figure it out.

534
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,514
On your time.

535
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:58,279
You know she's certifiable,
right? I got forms in my desk.

536
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,408
Where is she wrong?

537
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,078
What were you going to tell me?

538
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,621
Nothing.

539
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,040
You're punishing me?

540
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,628
I needed to tell you
something privately.

541
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,463
I'm not gonna tell her.

542
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,716
You'll tell her. She's your girlfriend.
You should tell her.

543
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,301
You're my friend.

544
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,428
It's not the same.

545
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,597
Don't sulk.

546
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,518
Where am I wrong?

547
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,316
"Your management style
is counterproductive."

548
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,986
"You gave me authority over the team
just so they could undercut..."

549
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,822
Critiquing the clap-addled?

550
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,449
Sort of tasteless.

551
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,243
I don't feel like waiting
until your genitals cleared up.

552
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,537
You need to formalize
my authority over the team.

553
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,080
No, I don't.

554
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,915
You don't think I'm qualified?

555
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,792
Compared to those three?

556
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,711
You want to punish Cuddy
for hiring me without...

557
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,713
I like Cuddy.

558
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,715
Parts of her.

559
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,550
You want to crush the team,
by crushing me?

560
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,886
I want to empower them.

561
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,556
Those three idiots
need to respect you.

562
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:09,893
They should respect you.
They should be afraid of you.

563
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,478
So I have to humiliate you.

564
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,643
See, if the team fears you,
they won't question you,

565
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,231
if they don't question you,
they won't get any answers,

566
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,567
if they don't get any answers,
they're useless.

567
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,027
Mocking me saves lives?

568
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,738
Hospital will probably build
you a statue one day.

569
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,115
You know, with a "kick me"
sign, on the back.

570
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,992
So when you think about it,
the more I mock you,

571
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,744
the more it shows
that I have respect for you.

572
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,372
Or you made up that B.S.
because you like humiliating me.

573
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,875
Wouldn't rule that
out completely.

574
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,126
YOU busy?

575
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,586
Almost done.

576
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:43,134
So just remember, the rabbit goes around
the tree and jumps down the hole.

577
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,930
Negative for sarcoidosis.

578
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,975
Run him for everything
you can think of.

579
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:55,855
Lepto, schisto, hemo and the fourth
Marx Brother nobody ever heard of.

580
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,108
You bitch!

581
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,155
I just went to get us some
lunch. You were asleep.

582
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,074
You moved my book!

583
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,702
Jeff, calm down,
it's just the drugs.

584
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,455
The drugs didn't move my...

585
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,083
Jeff?

586
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,171
My husband's having a heart attack!
Can somebody help me, please?

587
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,008
Somebody help me, please!

588
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,727
She saved his life.

589
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:38,690
Or she scabbed.
Depends on your point of view.

590
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:43,278
So, what do we think? New symptom?
Or just a wife beater?

591
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,488
Hey.

592
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,158
Time for you to take
this baby for a spin.

593
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:56,291
We loaded him full of prednisone
to try to fix the liver.

594
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,586
Good news is, he's running out
of organs to fail.

595
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,881
Prednisone could cause roid rage,
which could cause hypertension,

596
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,049
which results...

597
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,759
Roid rage after six hours?

598
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:10,054
That rate, by sundown,
he'll have eaten most of us.

599
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,560
Still could be the penicillin,
allergic reaction.

600
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:16,978
How does a fried liver
put him into a rage?

601
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,480
It's not frying his liver,
it's frying his syphilis.

602
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,317
The penicillin's working.
The real patient's emerging.

603
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:26,070
So syphilis prevents
domestic violence.

604
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,489
I'm gonna be even more
attractive to the ladies.

605
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:30,896
I was going to test for a heart issue
before the syphilis.

606
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,410
PFO could explain
the heart attack,

607
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:36,331
and reduced blood flow to the brain
could explain the rage.

608
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,125
Well, they're all good ideas.

609
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,501
Okay. Let's take a vote.

610
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,379
How many think
it's the roids talking?

611
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,507
And who's for the penicillin?

612
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,636
And how about
whatever she said?

613
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,515
Someone hasn't
raised their hand.

614
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,394
Whatever I decide?

615
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,938
You're setting me up.

616
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,274
Why would I do that?

617
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,403
PFO.

618
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:10,823
Have it.

619
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:16,287
I just hope the bubble test is positive.
Or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

620
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,760
We gave van Gogh chelation therapy.
Turned him into a house painter.

621
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:35,181
Maybe not.
Maybe we just put Hitler on Ritalin.

622
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,600
Are you comparing
House to Hitler?

623
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:38,768
Oh, God.

624
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,230
Just because I don't think he's Hitler
doesn't mean I slept with him.

625
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:45,525
I don't sleep with everyone
who's better than Hitler.

626
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,404
Maybe Taub's right.
Maybe this is good.

627
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:50,780
This is not good.

628
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:55,535
He respected our opinions, he mocked
himself, he was civil, he shared.

629
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,245
He didn't care.

630
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,204
He never cares.

631
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:02,083
He didn't vote. He always cared
about one thing,

632
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,584
solving the puzzle.

633
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,296
But he was irrelevant in that diagnosis,
he had no opinion of his own.

634
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,883
He now cares about nothing.

635
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:15,346
You had no choice, you had to treat him.
What's done is done.

636
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:28,151
You know that thing I was going
to tell you? I gotta tell you.

637
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:32,321
I gotta tell someone.
You have to swear not to tell C.B.

638
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,408
- Whatever.
- That's not swearing, that's shrugging.

639
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,452
It's actually the
opposite of swearing.

640
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,203
I won't tell Amber.

641
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:48,546
My team thinks
that I have syphilis.

642
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,048
- Do you?
- Not yet.

643
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,342
Why do they think you do?

644
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,179
Because I knew they had access to
an old blood sample.

645
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,431
I knew they'd test it
sometime for something.

646
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,076
Why would you swap your blood?
What are you afraid they'll find?

647
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:05,313
Shut up, you're missing the point.
Now they think that I'm on penicillin.

648
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:09,525
Is this some clever practical
joke that I'm not aware of?

649
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,070
And as I get better,
I get nicer.

650
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:19,660
That's brilliant.

651
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,413
Foreman thinks I actually
value his opinion.

652
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:25,958
Thank God he said PFO
or I'd have had to do some dancing.

653
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,293
You got time for bowling?

654
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,340
Come on, it's work hours.

655
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,675
I'll get my shoes.

656
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,472
- So we don't need to talk about...
- No.

657
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,117
- You're gonna keep screwing...
- Yeah.

658
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,519
And you're gonna keep talking about it.
We are who we are.

659
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,438
I'll get my shoes.

660
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:53,069
Okay, got a good
view of the heart.

661
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:59,158
What if we lower House's
dosage? Maybe stabilize him?

662
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,410
He doesn't get worse,
he doesn't get better.

663
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:04,664
Quite the line to walk. If we're wrong,
he dies of neurosyphilis.

664
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,415
If we don't, other people die.

665
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,501
Other people
who aren't our boss.

666
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:09,877
People.

667
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,880
This sucks. The guy
had a gift. I killed...

668
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,552
- Hi. What...
- House doesn't have syphilis.

669
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:19,512
He switched the blood samples.

670
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,305
How do you know that?

671
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,557
House told Wilson.

672
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,518
I wanted to ruin
House's day. See you.

673
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,480
- We're idiots.
- We're not idiots.

674
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,274
Positive blood test
means positive blood test.

675
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,692
Apparently not.

676
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,486
There they are.
Let's see if they...

677
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,738
What are you doing?
We're not done.

678
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,490
He doesn't have syphilis.

679
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,325
I know.

680
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,919
Patient tested
positive for syphilis, right?

681
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:53,921
Is this some sort of recap?

682
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,632
But why did he test
positive for syphilis?

683
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,759
Oh, oh, I know this.

684
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,928
Either, one, he has syphilis.

685
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,138
I was gonna say that.

686
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,265
Or two, the test
was wrong twice.

687
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,768
Or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

688
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,277
- Who?
- Amber.

689
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,617
Get that idiotic smile out of my face,
I gotta go on a killing spree.

690
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,704
Or four, he has something that tests
positive for syphilis.

691
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,840
- It's not Chagas.
- He worked in Costa Rica,

692
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,958
before he was married.

693
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,753
Is two a spree or do
I have to kill you too?

694
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,838
Chagas wouldn't
explain the niceness.

695
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:40,217
I've heard of remote tribes that
actually practice acts of kindness.

696
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,970
Or the Chagas
caused encephalitis.

697
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,221
The MRI showed no signs...

698
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,099
Until we started him on steroids,
compromised the immune system

699
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,517
and let the infection flare up.

700
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:52,188
I did another one.
It's not much.

701
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,817
It's plenty.

702
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:01,864
You figured this out
because I don't have syphilis?

703
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:04,659
Damn.

704
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,746
It should have
been my epiphany.

705
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,043
Good news and bad news.

706
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,880
Good news is,
we know what you have,

707
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,717
it's treatable,
and you're going to live.

708
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,136
Really?

709
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,346
What's the bad news?

710
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:28,849
The cure is a grueling
course of pills.

711
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:30,059
It's like

712
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:33,479
one a day for a month.

713
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:35,648
Now you're just trying
to make me laugh.

714
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,733
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

715
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,360
You have Chagas disease.

716
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,530
It's a parasite. It's been
asymptomatic for 10 years.

717
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:45,741
Not quite. Your brain's been
swollen, not enough to see,

718
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,410
but enough to alter
your personality.

719
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,661
We're back to that?

720
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:51,205
He screamed at you,
you don't think he can change?

721
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,958
That was because of the drugs.

722
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:57,294
So you think drugs
are more powerful than parasites?

723
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,214
I mean, the ones we're gonna give you to
treat the parasites obviously are,

724
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,843
but I stand by the principle.

725
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,767
I'm not worried.

726
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:12,893
Neither am I.

727
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,190
Neither am I. But that's
because I don't care.

728
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,124
Reviews?

729
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:37,960
It was brought to my
attention that, on occasion,

730
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,212
I am not respectful
of hospital hierarchy.

731
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,465
The word was "contemptuous."

732
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,849
Well phrased, thoughtful...

733
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:58,105
identically phrased.
These are all the same.

734
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,651
Because underneath it all,
we are all the same.

735
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:06,113
And Foreman refused
to type his up.

736
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,531
Well, it's more
than I expected.

737
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,242
There's an extra one in there.

738
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:23,339
"Your treatment of patients
is nonexistent"

739
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:27,134
"because you're not a doctor,
you're an administrator."

740
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,678
Foreman convinced me
that these could be helpful.

741
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,722
"Your management
of employees is,

742
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:35,142
well, let's face it, they're
outside carrying signs."

743
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,979
The strike ended. The nurses have been
back for two shifts already.

744
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,274
You'd think I'd have noticed.
What exactly did they do around here?

745
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:52,618
"You act like employees should fear and
respect you, but your eyes tell us..."

746
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:55,663
"Actually your eyes tell us nothing,
because we're looking at your boobs,"

747
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:57,748
"which tell us that you're desperate
to have someone jump on you"

748
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:01,502
"and tell you they love you one grunted
syllable at a time."

749
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:05,131
"What you want, you run away from.
What you need, you don't have a clue."

750
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:09,510
"What you've accomplished
makes you proud."

751
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,595
"But you're still miserable."

752
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,390
Please sign.

753
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,644
I got a call from Amber today.

754
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,897
Says there's been
a violation your contract.

755
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,817
You've been seeing
Wilson on her time.

756
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:26,402
She breached confidentiality.

757
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:29,655
You can let it slide,
Officer, we're even.

758
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,159
Yes, you are.
You're both losing fingers.

759
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,038
Look what I found.

760
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:39,165
Nice.

761
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,087
They think you might be able
to come home tomorrow.

762
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,922
Yeah? That's good.

763
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,218
What's the matter?

764
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,680
The ketchup. There's something
wrong with that.

765
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:01,228
Tastes fine.
Is there anything else?

766
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,063
Everything else is great.

767
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:07,443
I just, I don't know, I guess
I don't like ketchup anymore.

768
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,905
Wonder what else I don't like.

769
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,507
Roll over.

770
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,012
We need a tougher punishment.

771
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,890
You want to come over
to the poopy side?

772
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:42,102
So where are you two
going Friday night?

773
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,145
Dinner at L'Auberge.

774
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,193
You're lying.

775
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,277
Of course I am.
