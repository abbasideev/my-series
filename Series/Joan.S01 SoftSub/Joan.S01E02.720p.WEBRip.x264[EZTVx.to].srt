1
00:00:00,821 --> 00:00:03,077
I know Gary's done a
big job. He's in trouble.

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,717
You keep your trap shut.

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:07,021
What could I say? I don't know anything.

4
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:14,261
Where is he?

5
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:19,517
Kelly, wake up. Come on, love.

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,917
So, you've just been made homeless,

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,517
and you want to put your
daughter in emergency care?

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,381
I don't want to, obviously.

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,837
Is Kelly in danger?

10
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,517
Come here.

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,061
Don't go, mummy. Please don't go.

12
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,917
Where's Kelly? I have to keep her safe.

13
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,061
I wanna see Kelly.

14
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:57,477
Sirens door slams

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:01,157
I fully intend on getting a job and
a place of my own to support us,

16
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:04,181
I just... I just need a chance.

17
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,437
It's been a tough day.

18
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,741
Yeah, what do you do?

19
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,997
I'm a thief.

20
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,357
'It's just work.'

21
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,037
and it's just one job.

22
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,501
Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,797
If you rip me off, I'll kill you.

24
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,101
Snap.

25
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,021
Rain pours.

26
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:57,741
Ringing.

27
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,837
'Hello?'

28
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:17,597
Kelly, it's me. How are you?

29
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,517
'I've started riding lessons.'

30
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,517
I have to wear a hat.
The pony's called peanuts.

31
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,861
I miss you.

32
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,437
When am I coming home?

33
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:30,357
I'm just finding us a new place.

34
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,157
It... it won't be long now, I promise.

35
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:35,677
'Are you still coming on
Thursday? You can meet peanuts.'

36
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,237
phone beeping course I'm coming.

37
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,181
I'll see you on Thursday,
Kelly. I love you, kel. Mummy?

38
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:46,261
Ok. Come on.

39
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,101
Rain pours.

40
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:18,501
Not a single chip on this,
mint condition. Incredibly rare.

41
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,941
Now, you see the gilding
here? That's all hand painted.

42
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:29,541
Look at that coral pattern. So.

43
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,061
Just delicate. Slip moulded.

44
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,957
Yeah, circa 1840.

45
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:38,421
How do you know?

46
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,597
My new assistant, learning the ropes.

47
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:47,981
Cos, Joan, prior to that,
they didn't indent the saucers.

48
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,941
200 for the set?

49
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,157
I'll give you 50 for the teapot.

50
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,421
No. No, no.

51
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,677
Can't break up the set.
It's miraculous it's complete.

52
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,277
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

53
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,117
I thought you said you
were very good friends.

54
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,877
But I do have some charming delftware,

55
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,637
if you're looking to economise? No.

56
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,397
150 for the whole set?

57
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,461
160, cash.

58
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,517
I'll throw in a free gift wrap.

59
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,101
Pick it up four o'clock.

60
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,901
Beautiful yellow sapphire. Burmese.

61
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,181
Thank you so much. Thank you.

62
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,941
All right, take care, I'll see you later.

63
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,181
Not bad for a night's work.

64
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:48,237
So, where do you get it from?

65
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,157
Just my warehouse,
where I keep all my stock.

66
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:52,581
Where's that, then?

67
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,261
No. My whole life's in there.

68
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,021
You don't trust me.

69
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,901
So, where are your stones, Joan?

70
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,421
I see you're ready to start work.

71
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:13,677
Right, I've got the perfect job for you.

72
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,917
What is it?

73
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,661
First, we've got to clean
up after the last one you did.

74
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,421
Look at him.

75
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,381
Bloody perv.

76
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,661
Go on, then, in you go.

77
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,941
I told you, a good thief
always covers their tracks.

78
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,277
If you disappear into thin air,

79
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,637
he'll suspect it's you

80
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,077
when he discovers his stones are gone.

81
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,741
He'll give your name to the police.

82
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,461
And our next job will
be ten times more risky.

83
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,837
I like risk.

84
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,781
Well, I can't work with an amateur so...

85
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,341
Fine.

86
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,061
Never had it in you anyway.

87
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,917
Poke me in the eye, then. What?

88
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,541
Fine, I'll do it myself.

89
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,141
What? I've gotta look the part.

90
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:33,141
It's my dad. Lung cancer.

91
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,741
Joan.

92
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,541
I am... so sorry.

93
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,517
I don't wanna let you down,
but I have to go to him...

94
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,661
In Scotland.

95
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,637
You don't give it another thought.

96
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,181
Family is everything.

97
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,341
Thank you. That's very kind.

98
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,621
By the way, is... Is Linda all right?

99
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,157
What do you mean?

100
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,837
She's got terrible money problems.

101
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,661
Credit cards, all sorts.

102
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:20,181
What about this one, boisie? A tenner?

103
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,637
Or this one?

104
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,437
You know I don't buy rubbish.

105
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,357
What? I thought you liked old shit.

106
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:27,861
Just a cheque book, like I said.

107
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,957
Didn't put you down as
a kite. Not for me, is it?

108
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,237
Here y'are, 60 quid. 100.

109
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,741
70, cos I'm in a good mood.

110
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,981
All right, mate? All right, boisie?

111
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:59,197
"First-class employee, picked
up the business in no time".

112
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,757
And I can have my job
back whenever I like.

113
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:02,941
That might be useful.

114
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:05,821
No, I'm never going back.

115
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,597
I'm impressed, Joan.

116
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,661
So, come on, tell me,
what's this job, then?

117
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,277
It's a job of two halves.

118
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,901
The first half is preparation.

119
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,221
Shopping time.

120
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,237
But I wanna Nick jewels,

121
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,277
not shoplift with a dodgy cheque book.

122
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,357
Yes, yes, all in good time.

123
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,837
I'm only doing this one job.

124
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,357
And this is the first part of it.

125
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,837
So, what am I nicking? Clothes.

126
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:36,197
Here, practise.

127
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,317
Mrs r Hamilton.

128
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,341
It's just squiggles. It doesn't matter.

129
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,277
What do you think the r stands for?

130
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,917
Whatever you like.

131
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:48,781
Rachel? Rebecca?

132
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:53,341
Roxy. Call me rox.

133
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:56,837
Ok, right.

134
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,957
We gotta go down the high
street, get some photos done.

135
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,397
What? Why? You need a passport.

136
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,101
Once you've nicked the gear,
we're going to Spain tomorrow.

137
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,997
Spain? My god.

138
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:13,957
Kelly... I've gotta be
back Thursday afternoon.

139
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:16,637
That's all right, we'll fly
back early that morning.

140
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,981
Plenty of time.

141
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:22,197
The second part of the job is
we need to courier some jewellery.

142
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:26,597
Three high-value pieces lifted
from a house in Mayfair last week.

143
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:28,557
My mate albie sells it out in Spain,

144
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,557
where the pigs aren't looking for it.

145
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:33,677
We take it over, he pays us on delivery.

146
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:36,117
So, we're gonna take a regular flight,

147
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,517
pose as a wealthy couple.

148
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,901
That's why you need the
clobber. You have to look the part.

149
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:46,517
Roxy will need to look classy.

150
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,157
Choose three of four outfits.

151
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,901
Day and evening wear. Nothing too flash.

152
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:56,757
When you're in the
store, stay calm. Enjoy it.

153
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,637
You're just a filthy rich woman

154
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,797
doing your last-minute holiday shopping.

155
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,157
Would you like me to put those
in the changing rooms for you?

156
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,981
Yes, please. Thank you.

157
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:12,197
Clears throat roxy... Rox, roxy Hamilton.

158
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,661
All right in there, madam?

159
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,557
You look smashing.

160
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,117
Is it for a special occasion?

161
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,757
I'm off to Spain.

162
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:25,781
You lucky thing. I know.

163
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,077
'When you get to the till,

164
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:38,077
'they're gonna ask for a
cheque guarantee card.'

165
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,821
there you go. Cheque guarantee card?

166
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:47,917
Er, I'm sorry, I... 'Ride it out. Trust me.'

167
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,397
I'm so sorry.

168
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,957
I... Left it at home?

169
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,397
Yeah, what an idiot.
Done the same myself.

170
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,037
Just write me out three
cheques - 50, 50 and 45.99.

171
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,317
Thanks.

172
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,037
'Once you've got your outfits,

173
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,597
'get out of the store sharpish.'

174
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:04,677
have a good day. You too.

175
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,861
'Don't get distracted, Joan.
Come straight back to my flat.'

176
00:13:57,221 --> 00:14:00,621
Where's the ladies room?
Through the door on the left, madam.

177
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:31,077
Soft music plays phone rings door opens

178
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,917
didn't expect to see you again so soon.

179
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,661
Me neither. Got an unexpected haul.

180
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,397
Right.

181
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:46,597
You've been busy, love.

182
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,557
Yeah, she's a right proper talent.

183
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,461
If not something of a loose Cannon.

184
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,037
Give you a tenner each item.

185
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:07,517
No, they're all at least 40 new.

186
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,501
There's no price tags.

187
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,957
I wrote the prices down.

188
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,381
Ha...

189
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,821
You've got a right one
here, mate. £1,000, the lot.

190
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,221
700. Eight. Take it or leave it.

191
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,501
Yeah.

192
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,861
Suits you.

193
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,101
Impressive work, love. See you again.

194
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,597
Leave the price tags on next time.

195
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:24,477
Punters like to know
how much they've saved

196
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,837
when he's selling round the pubs.

197
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,437
Well, there won't be a next time.

198
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:30,581
Spain, then I'm done...

199
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,701
What do you really want, roxy?

200
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,597
Right now, 380 quid.

201
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,397
Half the profits minus 20 for the wig.

202
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,421
But I only told you to
Nick the clothes, so...

203
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,597
Ok, well, I don't always do what I'm told,

204
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,837
especially if I have better ideas.

205
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,717
I introduced you to the fence.

206
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:54,061
And, er... I, er, bought
the cheque book, so...

207
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,597
Yeah, I reckon we're about even.

208
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,197
Are you fucking kidding me?

209
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,861
Maybe.

210
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,901
Yeah... maybe I am.

211
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,781
Come on, then. Hand it over.

212
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:15,461
Come and get it.

213
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:20,981
Come on.

214
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,221
Pay roxy her half.

215
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,037
Or what?

216
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:31,437
She'll walk out, and
you'll never see her again.

217
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,581
You like walking out, don't you?

218
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,781
Do you wanna know what
roxy wears under her dress?

219
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,477
And what else?

220
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,101
Nothing.

221
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,861
I watched something on
telly once about clean freaks.

222
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,901
You're not a psychopath, are ya?

223
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,421
No.

224
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,837
You iron as well?

225
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:38,261
Only my bank notes.

226
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,381
What?!

227
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:44,021
Who do you learn to
clean off? Your mum?

228
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,661
Who then? Big sister?

229
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:51,901
Prison.

230
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:54,501
Learned everything there, really.

231
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,821
Yeah, but not antiques. Yeah, I did.

232
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:03,477
I picked up a book from
the library. Got really into it.

233
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,877
Ordered another one.

234
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:06,317
Why?

235
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:07,541
Dunno.

236
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:12,701
All the hallmarks, the
categories. Everything has a value.

237
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:20,501
Right. To work.

238
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:33,237
For you. The gear's inside.

239
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,477
If I carry an attache
case with ladies' jewels in,

240
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,357
it'll look dodgy. So...

241
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:41,077
So, you want me to take it
on the plane, bear all the risk?

242
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,781
You've got the balls, haven't you?

243
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,517
Course I have.

244
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,261
The passport's a good forgery.

245
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,141
I believe in you, Joan.

246
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,597
Yeah, but... what are you paying me?

247
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,421
Grand. Two grand.

248
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,341
So, when's the flight? Midday.

249
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:12,021
Better get ready, then.

250
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:37,317
I reckon amateurs carry their
gear in shiny, new attache cases.

251
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:39,381
Professionals wear 'em.

252
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,461
Then let's go to Spain.

253
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,677
Please stow your hand luggage

254
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,237
either in the overhead compartments,

255
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,277
or underneath the seat in front of you.

256
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,557
It's a full flight today,

257
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,637
so we appreciate your
co-operation. Good morning.

258
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,117
It's all right, Joan, we're
through security now.

259
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:08,421
Hi.

260
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,277
Lovely, thank you. Thank you.

261
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:12,557
Hi. Hi.

262
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,717
Mrs Hamilton. If you could step
aside and wait for my colleague

263
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:17,141
from passport control.

264
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,997
Ok.

265
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,517
What's the, er, issue?

266
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,437
Er, if you could just
wait here. Thank you.

267
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,557
Hi. Good morning.

268
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:28,141
Thank you. Lovely, thank you.

269
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,581
Thank you.

270
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,317
Excuse me, please. Coming
through. Thank you very much.

271
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:36,157
Thank you. Excuse me.

272
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,261
Mrs Hamilton?

273
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,821
You left it on the counter.

274
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:47,381
Thank you. Sorry, my
wife's a very nervous flyer.

275
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,557
I thought you'd flown before.

276
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,757
Do I look like I've fucking flown before?

277
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:57,661
Hold my hand. I said
hold my bloody hand.

278
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:00,381
Ooh...

279
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,677
Yeah. Are we in the air? Yeah.

280
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:05,997
Yeah? Yes.

281
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,901
Ha-ha. Whoo!

282
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,781
'Begin the beguine' by Julio iglesias.

283
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:15,437
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

284
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,877
It's so beautiful.

285
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,757
Gasps can we go to the beach?

286
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:21,797
All in good time.

287
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:23,661
We need to drop the
gear off with albie first.

288
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,461
So, we'll swing by his club.

289
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:30,677
You need to act dumb
around his missus, all right?

290
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,197
Pretend you're my bird. Because?

291
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,661
She doesn't know about business.

292
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,021
Better take the gear off
before we get there also.

293
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,061
You'll love him.

294
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,597
Is he into antiques as well?

295
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:47,077
No.

296
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,197
No, he's nothing like me.

297
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,717
How do you meet?

298
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,421
Inside. He was my cell mate.

299
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,101
Come on, let's get paid.

300
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,997
Have you finished
with that? Yeah. Yeah?

301
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,437
We'll go in a minute.

302
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,877
Albie. Morning, mate.

303
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,837
Never better. Chuckles

304
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,837
hi. Joan. Hi, I'm val. This is jonny.

305
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,597
Hi, jonny.

306
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,261
So, how's the big smoke, Boise?

307
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:28,981
Business all right? Good,
yeah. Yeah, very good.

308
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,637
Joan's started working for me.

309
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,597
So do you know all about antiques then?

310
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:35,917
I'm teaching her.

311
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,757
All right, let the girl
speak for herself, boisie.

312
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:40,597
Thank you!

313
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,837
Er, yeah, I'm learning the trade.

314
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,117
But in my own way.

315
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,197
How's that, then?

316
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:47,821
Well, I won't let a man boss me around.

317
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,301
Ooh... Joan chuckles

318
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,517
must be nice growing up out here.

319
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,117
Not really.

320
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,637
He hasn't got any friends
here. That's not true.

321
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:00,637
How would you know?
You're never around.

322
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:03,717
Someone's gotta earn the bread,
especially at the rate you spend it.

323
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,061
Children, children.

324
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:08,797
Never have kids, Joan.

325
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,717
No end of bloody trouble?

326
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,037
We should be getting off, albie.

327
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:14,581
I just need a word with Boise.

328
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,197
You know, you're the first
girl he's brought out here.

329
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:31,317
I think he just wanted
company on the flight.

330
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,781
Chuckles

331
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,917
so, what kind of work is albie in?

332
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,917
Importing stuff. This and that, you know?

333
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,197
What kind of stuff?

334
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,461
I don't really get involved.

335
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,117
Right, val, jonny, vamos.

336
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:48,877
Er, you're about
tomorrow, aren't you? Yeah.

337
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,517
Yeah, we're staying at hotel rondo. Yeah.

338
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,317
See you there. Boisie clicks tongue

339
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:54,597
come on, babe. Joan.

340
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:56,157
Nice to meet you, Joan.

341
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,101
Bye. Bye, jonny. Bye.

342
00:27:02,061 --> 00:27:03,861
Two grand. Your cut.

343
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:09,077
Count it. I trust you.

344
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,101
Always count the money, Joan.

345
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:21,821
'Club tropicana' by wham!

346
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,357
Welcome back, mr hannington.

347
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:33,957
Good to see you again. Thank you.

348
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,341
Your key, mr hannington.

349
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:52,261
Muchas gracias.

350
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:58,237
Que tenga UN buen dia. Cheers.

351
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:20,581
Here you go. Cheers.

352
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:38,197
So, why do you think albie
keeps everything from val?

353
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,861
She knows, deep down she does.

354
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,461
Yeah, that's how I was with Gary.

355
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:48,781
Albie's solid, Joan.

356
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:52,517
First night in an adult Nick,
I was put in a cell with him.

357
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:55,261
He told me who to
befriend, who to avoid.

358
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:59,581
He looked out for you. Yeah.

359
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,837
Then I taught him how
to play backgammon,

360
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:04,077
took a load of money off him,

361
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:06,021
he's been trying to get over it ever since.

362
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:14,461
I'm never gonna be like val again.

363
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:19,541
I need to run my own life.

364
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:32,797
Come on. You said you would.

365
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:35,501
I can't swim. Nor can I.

366
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:38,901
Come on. It's warm.

367
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:44,637
Come on! Why are you being like that?

368
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:45,861
Oi!

369
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:31,581
So, they just give you
all this stuff for free?

370
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:41,221
What's this? Shoehorn.

371
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,517
That's useful.

372
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,877
Right, what about this little packet?

373
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:49,541
Sewing kit.

374
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:54,661
I mean, who does
sewing on their holidays?

375
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,101
Move in with me, Joan.

376
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,997
What?

377
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,421
When we get home.

378
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:10,477
Are you taking the
piss? We've only just met.

379
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,701
I like you.

380
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,861
I think we make a good team.

381
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,621
I can't. I need to get my own flat.

382
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:29,181
For me and Kelly.

383
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:35,301
'Give it up' by kc and the sunshine band.

384
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:44,301
He's gonna bloody love
you. You are so cute.

385
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:53,861
Boisie. It's me. Wake up.

386
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:59,341
Say hello. Isn't he sweet?

387
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:02,997
Have you lost your mind?

388
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,477
You can't take a fucking dog on a plane.

389
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:09,501
It's for jonny. He needs friends.

390
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,701
He chuckles

391
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:21,117
it's not fucking funny, boisie.

392
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:23,581
'Just an illusion' by imagination.

393
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,997
Jonny loves the dog. He's made up.

394
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:33,557
Did you give him a name yet?

395
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,877
What? Name?

396
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:38,077
Er, Arnie. What?!

397
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,437
Like the Terminator. His idea.

398
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:46,037
'Poison arrow' by abc
come on. Come on.

399
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:49,717
He deserved it, trust
me. He really did. Did he?

400
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,061
There they go.

401
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:54,141
I'm smitten, albie.

402
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,021
Can you blame me? Look at her.

403
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,901
What you got her doing,
selling on in the shop?

404
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:09,381
She's a thief.

405
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,437
She already nicked a
load of stuff on her own.

406
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,877
Toasters and tellies?

407
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:19,397
Diamonds... Loose.

408
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,101
She swallowed 'em from her work.

409
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:25,757
Business and pleasure all
in one cute, little package.

410
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:27,381
Yeah.

411
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:31,181
Yeah, no, I reckon we'll make
a good team, she's a natural.

412
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,557
Is that your dick talking?

413
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,341
Married life getting you down?

414
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,301
Laughs you chose to leave London.

415
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,677
Come back if you're bored. Or broke.

416
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:06,701
Boisie... he's smitten.

417
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,901
Treat him good, yeah?

418
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:16,557
We worked together for
years, I still look out for him.

419
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,461
You're his baby-sitter, are ya?

420
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:22,277
Been asking about you, Joan.

421
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:25,301
I found out your ex did a
job for me back in the day.

422
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:28,837
You've spoken to Gary?

423
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:32,317
Says you was a right nightmare...

424
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,037
Ran off with his kid.

425
00:35:34,061 --> 00:35:36,957
Well, Gary's a bloody liar.

426
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:39,101
You're sexy when your blood's up.

427
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,621
Fuck you. Hey, Joan, I'm just joking.

428
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:56,757
'Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, this is the flight deck.

429
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:59,117
'I have just been informed
by air traffic control that,

430
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,917
'due to unforeseen circumstances,

431
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,797
'our departure has been delayed
by approximately 60 minutes.'

432
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:04,837
shit.

433
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,077
'I apologise for this delay
and the inconvenience'

434
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:10,157
boisie, did you hear that?
It's all right, calm down.

435
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,917
You promised I'd be back.

436
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,917
You never said it could
be late. How can it be late?

437
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,757
It's not like there's any traffic up there...

438
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,597
It's only an hour. Only?! Yeah.

439
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:20,637
If I'm an hour late for Kelly,
and the social find out...

440
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:23,341
What? The world's gonna end?

441
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:26,797
You really don't get it, do you?

442
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,277
I just think you're over-reacting.

443
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:31,037
Cos you don't have a kid,
you don't understand family.

444
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:33,917
That's not fair. I think it is.

445
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,437
I mean, who are you?

446
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,757
Why do you even bring me
out here? Can you cut it out?

447
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,957
You could have done
the job on your own.

448
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:44,037
You could have put the
gear in your own bag? Shh.

449
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:45,677
Isn't that what you normally do, Boise?

450
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,997
I've been looking for a
partner since albie left,

451
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:50,277
and I want us to work together.

452
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:52,557
What, so this whole
thing was just a test?

453
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:55,837
Seeing if I'd obey your
little rules, steal to order,

454
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,837
have the bottle to go through customs?

455
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,517
Calm down.

456
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,357
I'm really fucking calm

457
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,437
I've got my cash, counted
it, thanks for the tip.

458
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:05,157
I'm gonna go get my daughter.

459
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,581
Joan...

460
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:13,997
'Scuse me? I need to get
off. I need to call my sister.

461
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:17,101
My daughter's waiting
for me, and she's only six.

462
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:19,421
Sorry, it's not possible.

463
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,477
'Ladies and gentlemen
this is your captain again.

464
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,397
'We will shortly be starting
our descent into London.

465
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,437
'I do apologise, once
again, for our late departure.

466
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:41,741
'We should have you on the ground
90 minutes later than scheduled.

467
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:46,101
'Flight crew, please
prepare the cabin for landing.'

468
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:01,341
Thank you. It's melting already.

469
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:09,341
My baby! Mummy!

470
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:15,421
Thank you.

471
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:23,237
God. Sweetheart. Let
me see you, come on.

472
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:27,197
Gasps you are growing
up way too fast, missy.

473
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,957
Look at your hair. Beautiful.

474
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,877
You having fun? Yeah.

475
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,261
Give me a cuddle.

476
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:46,317
How was it? It was great.

477
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:49,941
I can't wait to get her
back. Sorry if I was a bit late.

478
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,237
Kelly's doing really well, Joan.

479
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:58,357
She's missing you, of course, but,

480
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,757
she's forming a healthy
relationship with the ashburys.

481
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:04,277
And they've enrolled
her in a fantastic school.

482
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,901
Just until you're ready for her.

483
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,141
But I'm... I'm ready. I'm ready now.

484
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,957
We need to make sure
that you're on an even keel,

485
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,837
properly settled.

486
00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:19,477
But I... I am settled. I'm...
I'm working in a jewellers.

487
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:20,981
I'm living with my sister.

488
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,957
We tried calling you yesterday.

489
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:27,901
Nancy said you'd moved out.

490
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:30,861
Have the two of you fallen out?

491
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:35,357
No. No, I... I

492
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:38,061
Nancy suggested we
try your place of work.

493
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:42,117
Look, I had to leave,
the boss was a perv.

494
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:45,157
Have you got another
job? Yeah, course I have.

495
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:47,301
Doing what? What is
this, 20 fucking questions?

496
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:52,221
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just.

497
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:58,077
I'm-i'm-i'm... I'm ready
for Kelly, I'm all set.

498
00:39:58,101 --> 00:39:59,397
Er, er, if you don't believe me,

499
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:02,861
look, I've got the deposit
for a flat, right here, look.

500
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:05,901
See, there.

501
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,157
We ran some other checks.

502
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,941
The police told us you stole a car.

503
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:14,637
But...

504
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:18,477
But I had no choice, I... I was
so desperate to see kel and...

505
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,157
And I've got a suspen... Look,
please, just give me a chance.

506
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:25,141
Our only concern is for Kelly's welfare.

507
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,677
And where she is right
now, she has security...

508
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,357
Yeah, a posh school and ponies.

509
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:35,637
It's true that the ashburys
have a regular source of income,

510
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:40,117
but they also offer Kelly
a stable, loving home.

511
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:44,101
And... until you can provide that.

512
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:48,941
I'm afraid we think that
she's better off where she is.

513
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:57,941
And we've obtained a court order
formally placing Kelly in our care.

514
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,501
It's not forever, Joan.

515
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,477
We'll put a plan in place

516
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:14,677
and arrange regular meetings
to assess your progress.

517
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:15,877
And over time...

518
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:19,101
It'll get harder. You're
making it too hard for me.

519
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:25,781
You just need to prove to us that
you're a good, reliable mummy.

520
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,677
You've got a lovely colour, Joan.

521
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,701
Have you been away somewhere?

522
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,261
It's fake. It's all fucking fake.

523
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:58,821
Vodka and orange, please. Sure.

524
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,397
Keep the change. Thanks.

525
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:18,021
'Kayleigh' by marillion.

526
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,821
Thanks for bringing my stuff.

527
00:42:58,181 --> 00:43:00,581
Well, I'd buy you a drink,
but it looks like you're sorted.

528
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:06,581
How is Kelly?

529
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:11,301
Yeah, yeah, she's good.

530
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:14,861
But, I, er.

531
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:18,141
Can't get her back just for a bit.

532
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:22,757
I've gotta prove myself to the social.

533
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:24,701
I'm sorry.

534
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,261
Yeah, me too.

535
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:31,061
So, are you looking
for somewhere to stay?

536
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:39,421
Come on.

537
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:43,061
Come on.

538
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,581
Come back with me.

539
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:50,301
You still want that?

540
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:01,781
If I'm gonna get Kelly
back, I need money.

541
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,317
Course you do.

542
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,877
No, I mean proper money.

543
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:11,117
I wanna buy a house, six bedrooms,

544
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:14,397
books in all the shelves, horse outside...

545
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:16,237
Fuck it, two horses.

546
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,901
I mean money, money.

547
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,261
Know what I mean?

548
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:23,861
Yeah, I reckon I do.

549
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,677
What are we waiting for?

550
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:57,301
