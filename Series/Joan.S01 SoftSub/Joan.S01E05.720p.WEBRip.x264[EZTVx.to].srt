1
00:00:00,581 --> 00:00:02,957
What can I do you for? Ds Harris.

2
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:06,117
You heard anything about
an art theft in Sussex?

3
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,501
Tyres screech

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,957
we've gotta get rid of that painting.

5
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,541
Can't sell it now, can we?
Just Chuck it in the river.

6
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,717
I can't fight Kelly's adoption
with the police sniffing around.

7
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,181
What do you suggest,
Joan? We go straight.

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,757
Do you know him well
enough? I do, yeah.

9
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,661
We can say anything to one
another. There's no secrets.

10
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:37,877
Can you think of any unusual suspects?

11
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:40,677
The Irish. They've always
got money to spend.

12
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,557
I've found a buyer for the stubbs.

13
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:44,357
We agreed that you'd
Chuck it in the river.

14
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:46,837
A work of art is not going in the river.

15
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,557
That's the woman involved.
That robbery in Sussex.

16
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:53,781
All you've gotta do is work
for me. I'm not a grass, Tom.

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,797
You've organised a sale with
the ira, and you didn't tell me?

18
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,637
Jessica Cunningham
to see Hugo saxton.

19
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,157
When Jessica confirms she's
happy with what she sees,

20
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,677
I'll call Michael, he'll give you the cash.

21
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,077
We had a deal.

22
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,837
Leave, while you still can. I really do...

23
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:15,477
Police! Get down! Urgh, argh!

24
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,237
Have you been following
me the whole time?

25
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,517
I'm sorry. I tried to offer you a way out.

26
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,797
Pigs. You're all the same.

27
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:24,597
Shouting I'm truly sorry,

28
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,837
but I think it's better if
you don't speak to Kelly

29
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,021
while you're in your current environment.

30
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,941
There's nothing left.

31
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,797
Everything I've worked for...

32
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,037
The Irish have destroyed it all.

33
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,981
You know, how'd they
even find the warehouse?

34
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,181
You tell me.

35
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,781
You're gonna need to warn Joan.

36
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,717
When's that ever stopped the ira?

37
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,477
Don't let her do a deal, boisie.

38
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,341
Shit.

39
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,021
When? Two nights ago.

40
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,917
Bloody hell. Everything?

41
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:06,397
Everything. Art, books.

42
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,701
My stones?

43
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:10,717
It's all ash.

44
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,661
Fucking hell.

45
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:18,181
I've got less than what I started
with. I've got nothing. Snap.

46
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,381
So, what you gonna do?

47
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:30,741
I'll start again. I've done it before.

48
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,677
But... you need to watch your back

49
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,277
in case they try and send
you a message as well.

50
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,397
What? In here?

51
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,517
Just lay low, hide. How?

52
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,197
There's nowhere to fucking go!

53
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,061
It's just a couple of days,
until your bail hearing.

54
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,437
So, what is it? A punishment
for bringing the pigs to their door?

55
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,037
Or a warning. You
know, not to make a deal.

56
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,221
What? With the law? Been done before.

57
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:11,717
But it would open a whole can
of worms for me and albie as well.

58
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,717
You're not worried that
I'd do that? Course not.

59
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,437
Buzzer

60
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:21,397
I need to see my brief,
all right? Joan... get him in.

61
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,061
I left photos for you.

62
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:00,581
Do you know her?

63
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,861
No. She seems to know you.

64
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,741
Ira.

65
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,677
So, your bail hearing's on Monday.

66
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,637
All being well, you'll be
released until your trial.

67
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,757
And then?

68
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,077
I'll contact you when
we get a date for court,

69
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:47,101
should be in about four to six months.

70
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,517
The most important thing you
can do between now and then

71
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,357
is to stay out of trouble.

72
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,357
But you think I'll get off, yeah?

73
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:56,717
I mean, my husband
said that it'll probably be

74
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:01,261
I'll try my best, mrs
hannington, that's all I can do.

75
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:04,621
What if your best isn't good enough?

76
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:08,421
You're looking at a long stretch.

77
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,701
Worst-case scenario.

78
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,317
Ten years.

79
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,957
You wouldn't necessarily serve it all,

80
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,117
but you do have multiple
juvenile convictions.

81
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:25,141
And I see you stole a car... In... April.

82
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,117
They have strong evidence - a witness

83
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:31,037
that links you to the armed robbery

84
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,797
where the painting was stolen,

85
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:35,157
so it's not simply the
fraud at the London hotel,

86
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,197
it goes much further
than... No, no, no, no, no.

87
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,301
I can't do ten years. I can't.

88
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,637
You'll adapt. People do.

89
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,197
I'll lose everything. Everything
that I've ever fought for.

90
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,397
My daughter. She's only six.

91
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,301
Then might I make a suggestion?

92
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:57,861
Make a deal?

93
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,997
If you help them to land a bigger
fish, one of your associates...

94
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,701
No. No. Not a chance, no. Then
you'd get to see your daughter grow up.

95
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:13,061
Shouting outside.

96
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,501
Chatter.

97
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,461
I'm Joan.

98
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,581
We've mutual friends.

99
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:23,597
Tell 'em I had no idea
the law was following me.

100
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,981
I don't know what you're talking about.

101
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:32,517
What I'm saying is I'm
not your enemy. Ok?

102
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,741
I don't want any trouble.

103
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:39,877
How about you crack on and
let me get on with my dinner?

104
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,341
Sit down.

105
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,021
Trying to rip off the ra?

106
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,421
You'd better be tougher than you look.

107
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:04,661
If you touch me, I'll get you
put in seg so fucking fast.

108
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,637
What?

109
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,597
I just had a right moment
with that girl from the ira.

110
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,381
Yeah.

111
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:02,301
Door locks, clattering.

112
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,621
Can I get you something? Water?

113
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:26,381
She winces, sighs shit.
That looks bad. Yeah.

114
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,221
At least she didn't smash up my face.

115
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,381
I know a lass can get you codeine.

116
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:39,861
No, I don't want anything from anyone.

117
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,757
Joan sighs

118
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,597
I need a clear head for my
bail hearing in the morning.

119
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:49,221
Hope you get out.
Not safe for you in here.

120
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,381
See you at the trial. Be good.

121
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,381
All right?

122
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,181
What happened?

123
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:17,861
Did something happen?

124
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,901
You'll feel better after a bath.

125
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:41,021
Wash the smell of prison off you.

126
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,077
It's ok. You're home now. Ok?

127
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:54,581
Yeah. I can look after you. When
have you ever looked after me?

128
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:00,117
We go to Spain, I carry the gear
through customs. That's not fair.

129
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,637
You agree to go straight,
you send me to the ira.

130
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:04,917
I didn't force you. I was
in the room with them.

131
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,077
And I was right next door. She sighs

132
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,477
you're always next door.

133
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:12,317
We'll work something out. We always do.

134
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:14,077
What?

135
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,477
Boisie, what?

136
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,141
Well, I don't know yet.

137
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:21,317
If I make a deal, the ira kill me.

138
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,901
If I don't, I'll get ten years.

139
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,877
I have to get away. Away, away?

140
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:32,621
Yeah, we have to run.
Start a new life abroad.

141
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,677
Look, I get where you're
coming from... all right.

142
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:40,397
Right, but it's not that simple.
You're facing a serious charge.

143
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,557
Thanks, I forgot

144
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:45,957
and I've got everything here.
You've lost all your stock.

145
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,541
Still, I can't... What?
Pack up your fucking shop?

146
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:52,741
How do we even pay for it?

147
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,077
I'll do a job.

148
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:57,397
Nicking a ring ain't gonna be
enough for a whole new life.

149
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,381
Then I'll do a bigger job.
Like what? I don't know yet.

150
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,357
No, I really think we need to
take our chances with the courts.

151
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,797
"We"? How many times?
There is no fucking "we".

152
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,117
It's me facing the stretch.
Me the ira came after.

153
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:13,741
They came after me an' all!
Destroyed everything I had.

154
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,901
You're telling me we got the same?

155
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,381
Joan.

156
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,621
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:43,181
If I did come up with a job.

158
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,981
Would you at least think about it?

159
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,181
He sighs

160
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:01,237
he sighs you can spend
a lifetime on your own

161
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:03,221
and tell yourself you're happy, but

162
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,421
I'll do whatever you need, Joan.

163
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,221
This is all very mysterious.

164
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:52,621
I can't go to jail. I
wanna relocate to Spain.

165
00:14:55,061 --> 00:15:01,397
No extradition treaty yet, so
the cops won't come. Exactly.

166
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:05,397
Can you set us up? Well,
is that you or you and Boise?

167
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,157
Does it make a difference?

168
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:10,277
Anything's possible.

169
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,197
But it won't be cheap.

170
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:15,197
You got the Irish in. You owe me.

171
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:20,317
Look, I... I can't just magic
up cash for a new life.

172
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:22,037
Right? There's papers, tickets, a motor,

173
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:23,637
and that's before you get to the villa.

174
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,197
You need capital to live off.

175
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:29,437
Spain's all corrupt as hell.

176
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,917
It's all backhanders. I can get money.

177
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,477
You know Boise lost
everything in the fire?

178
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,197
I'm gonna do another job. What, on bail?

179
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:42,501
She scoffs I've got nothing left to lose.

180
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,261
Gonna need to Nick a bloody big rock.

181
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,477
Yeah.

182
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,901
You better get thinking,
then. Come up with a plan.

183
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,261
I'll be on it my end.

184
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:09,301
Door opens, Joan clears throat

185
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:15,661
door closes, footsteps approach.

186
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:20,517
Joan?

187
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,717
Mr Jones.

188
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,757
Now, now. You know it's Bernard.

189
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,061
How lovely to see you.

190
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,461
How's your father?

191
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,021
I am so sorry, lovey.

192
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,717
Hi.

193
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,317
My usual, please, but, er, I'll eat in.

194
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:42,757
Yeah, ok.

195
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:46,557
Egg and cress on brown,
no salt, lightly peppered.

196
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,597
You remember. I'm
touched. Joan chuckles

197
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,957
well, you were always so good to me.

198
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:54,237
Took a chance on me
when no-one else would.

199
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,781
What are you doing back here?

200
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:59,877
Just moved to the area.

201
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:01,517
I suppose I do get a bit lonely,

202
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:06,917
but... I haven't really felt up
to trying for a new position.

203
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,101
No. Working for a boss
I don't know, a stranger.

204
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,837
I, er... She laughs

205
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:17,957
I must admit, I was
trying to bump into you.

206
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:21,237
Hoping that you'd be good
on your word and take me back.

207
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:24,477
Joan, I'm sorry, but I
replaced you straight away.

208
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,061
Kirsty. Fine young lass.

209
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:29,621
God.

210
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:34,861
Sorry, how silly of me. Sorry.

211
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:37,901
But.

212
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:41,397
Round about the time you left,

213
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,477
we had a bit of an issue
with another member of staff

214
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,757
miss foley.

215
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,957
Issue?

216
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:50,277
Remember you told me she
had, er, money problems?

217
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:53,717
Dimly, yeah, yeah.

218
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:57,597
Well, she only went and
stole five stones from the safe.

219
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:02,037
I know. Can't prove it's her,
but I had to give her the boot.

220
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:03,861
Did you get the police in?

221
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:08,701
Didn't want anyone digging in the books.

222
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,637
Here you are.

223
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:15,237
Can I buy you lunch?
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

224
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:17,541
No, you don't wanna
ruin that lovely figure.

225
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,701
So, in fact, we are a little short-staffed.

226
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:30,221
And, er... He chuckles ..i miss that smile.

227
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,061
What is it?

228
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:43,821
Bernard's, where I used to work.

229
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,141
What do you mean?

230
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:54,117
I mean go for quantity, not quality.

231
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:57,757
I mean clear the place out.

232
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,917
All the stones from the safe,

233
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:04,477
every gold and platinum wedding
band, necklaces, bracelets,

234
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,437
earrings for mum, cuff links for dad,

235
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:09,077
christening mugs, Valentine's gifts.

236
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,157
I mean every single piece

237
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:14,061
of that fucked-up, fucking
"premier collection".

238
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,701
Now, that would buy us a new life.

239
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:22,621
You're bloody brilliant, Joan.

240
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,181
So, you think we can pull it off?

241
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:33,101
I think you can do.

242
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,741
Anything.

243
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:56,037
I was thinking we should
bring albie into the job

244
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,757
as well as sorting the flit.

245
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:59,757
We're gonna need a driver, right?

246
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,677
And he's done jobs to
this kind of scale before.

247
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,261
This is gonna take some planning.

248
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:10,237
But this job, I mean,
it's just for us, yeah?

249
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:14,117
Joan, we're moving to Spain
together and never coming back.

250
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:18,021
Does it get more "us" than that? Ok.

251
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,597
Can we get a villa with a pool? Yeah.

252
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,477
And a view of the sea?
And a view of the sea.

253
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,957
She gasps and a terrace?

254
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,117
And a terrace. And a lemon
tree in a little, fucking pot?

255
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,301
Lemon tree in a little, fucking...

256
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:38,317
You know what I've always wanted?

257
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,557
Diamond tiara?

258
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,461
She laughs what?

259
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:45,637
It's a pet. Yeah.

260
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:50,757
She giggles a baby tiger. For god's sake.

261
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,397
I mean, we can give it
back when it gets big.

262
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:56,837
Joan hannington, I'm sorry, I
draw the line at a baby tiger.

263
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:59,477
All right, just a cat,
then. You don't like cats.

264
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,701
Yeah, but Kelly will love it.

265
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,957
What? Kelly.

266
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,797
We've never stayed
anywhere you can have pets.

267
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:07,981
But Kelly's not coming.

268
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:11,781
Of course she is.

269
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:15,781
That's the whole bloody point.

270
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,181
You never said...

271
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:21,837
You... you just assumed that...

272
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:24,157
That you knew me? Yeah.

273
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,797
That you'd know that
she was the reason.

274
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,837
That I'd never leave her behind.

275
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:32,077
Joan. Jesus Christ. What?
It makes no difference.

276
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,157
Are you serious? We
can't take a kid on the run.

277
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,197
We have to. I have to. You know I do.

278
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:40,261
No, no, no. It's far too
risky. It's not fair on her.

279
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:44,477
I'm doing it for her. For you.

280
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,557
For both of us. We have to be together.

281
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:49,597
Boisie, please, it has
to work. No. I'm sorry.

282
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:51,341
If Kelly comes, you're on your own.

283
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,917
What's fucking new? Joan, wait.

284
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,381
I'm not going without her.

285
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,181
I had an idea.

286
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:41,261
We go on our own, and
I'll come back for her.

287
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:45,517
When?

288
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,101
Once we're settled in a safe area.

289
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:54,797
Nice villa, swimming
pool and a lemon tree

290
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:56,421
and a school nearby.

291
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,061
Like a proper family home.

292
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,341
You'd come back for Kelly?

293
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,077
Risk that for me?

294
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:13,541
Yeah, once we're sorted.

295
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,421
Well, how long's that gonna be?

296
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,397
Couple of months. Year, Max.

297
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,821
It'll probably be less.

298
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:29,741
Look, you'll be together in
the end. Isn't that what matters?

299
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:39,181
It's the only way.
Surely you can see that?

300
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,581
Well?

301
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:49,661
Ok.

302
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,701
Sure?

303
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:17,301
With you in a tick.

304
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,501
He groans

305
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,781
welcome, Joan.

306
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:33,141
Welcome back. Glad to be back.

307
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:38,517
And you're sure you're
ready? Yes. Raring to go.

308
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:42,477
I just hope I haven't forgotten anything.

309
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:46,141
All the days of the deliveries,
all the locks and whatnot.

310
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:51,541
It's been a bit of a tough time. Of course.

311
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:56,357
And I've had to up the
security since the Linda issue.

312
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:57,557
More cameras?

313
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,717
And a panic button...

314
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,261
Straight through to the police.

315
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:08,317
When were you thinking? During
the stock-take next Thursday.

316
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,917
He likes to close for half a day now,

317
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,757
so one o'clock.

318
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,341
You wanna plan a heist
during broad daylight?

319
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:17,837
Are you bloody crazy?

320
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:20,037
Well, you can't see inside
the shop from the street.

321
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,077
The doors'll be bolted.

322
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,797
As long as we're quiet,
proper quiet, no-one'll know.

323
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:27,237
What about security?

324
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:30,237
There's cameras everywhere, so
you will need to wear balaclavas.

325
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:32,637
And false plates for a Van.

326
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:35,157
There is a panic button
that goes straight to the pigs.

327
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,597
It's connected under a cabinet.

328
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:39,077
So, I'll cut the wires, and
then once we've closed up,

329
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:41,037
I'll lead Bernard into the safe room.

330
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:44,597
Well, how? Believe
me, I can arrange that.

331
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,797
You ok with that, mate?

332
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,717
It's me that needs to be ok with it.

333
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,941
And I am.

334
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:55,757
You know the first people
the police are gonna suspect

335
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,397
are gonna be employees,
Joan, husbands of employees.

336
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:00,957
We'll be on our way to Heathrow
before the police even arrive.

337
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:03,357
As soon as they do, they'll
fax an alert to all the airports.

338
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,797
You'll never leave the country.

339
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:07,877
And you're on bail, so you're
looking at 15 years, not ten.

340
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:09,397
Ok, then we'll get a ferry.

341
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,237
Can't we find a quiet
port, slip through the net?

342
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:15,397
I've got a mate who works
at newhaven. It'll cost, though.

343
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,957
I'll look into it.

344
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,477
Right, it's agreed. We'll leave by boat.

345
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,477
Back to Bernard's. Access
through the alley here.

346
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,317
There's three windows, one in
the toilet, two in the back room.

347
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:28,701
Or the window on the
back door. We'll recce.

348
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:33,037
You'll need to play the innocent victim.

349
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:34,397
Yeah, act brave,

350
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:37,237
like you don't wanna give me
the safe code straight away.

351
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:38,357
Of course.

352
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:41,717
After we've cleared the safe,
we'll start on the shop front.

353
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:42,757
Where's Bernard?

354
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:45,797
He has to stay in the back
while Joan and I strip the place.

355
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,557
We'll need another man to watch him.

356
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,797
Why can't you do it? I'm driving.

357
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,741
You must know someone.

358
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:56,381
Well, what about Paul mills? Who's he?

359
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,117
Best there is. Total pro.

360
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,557
You think he'll be interested?

361
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:04,837
Well, maybe. Ask him. Door unlocks

362
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,957
door shuts, albie clears throat

363
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:11,517
hi! Guess who won
slimmer of the week?

364
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,677
Hello.

365
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:14,277
Hi. All right, hiya, val.

366
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,677
I thought you were going
for a drink after slimmers' club.

367
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:19,277
Er, yeah, I decided it
wasn't worth the calories.

368
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:21,837
Jonny all right? Yeah,
watching TV in his room.

369
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:25,301
Maybe check on him? Why?
What are you lot plotting?

370
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:27,541
Talking shop.

371
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,237
Poor you.

372
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,757
It's all right. I enjoy it.

373
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:34,341
Come and say hi to jonny.

374
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,021
Joan?

375
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,637
We won't make any
decisions without you.

376
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,261
Bloody better not.

377
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,901
I'll call him. See what he says.

378
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:04,581
Paul? I'm Joan. Sorry I'm late.

379
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:09,397
Been shopping? Get
anything nice? Mind your own.

380
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,117
Ooh, calm down, love.

381
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,117
I've never worked with a bird before.

382
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:15,637
Yeah?

383
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:18,757
I've never worked with an
ugly bastard like you before.

384
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,957
Joan.

385
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,581
You two married, yeah?

386
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:29,157
And that's cool with
you? Yeah. Joan's sound.

387
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:31,261
And it's my job.

388
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:36,341
Right, what do you think?
Have they filled you in?

389
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:42,317
I've done eight post
offices and ten banks,

390
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:45,117
and it's always been sweet.

391
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,637
Nice one. But I was in and out.

392
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,837
This is slow.

393
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:52,421
Stripping cabinets, opening
cases with tiny, little keys.

394
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,997
Makes it risky. Given
we're in the high street,

395
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,317
middle of the afternoon...

396
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,037
We're gonna recce tomorrow, time it out.

397
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,797
And I know the gaff back to front.

398
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:02,757
I'll be directing the job once we're in.

399
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,381
Yeah. Can you handle that?

400
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:07,941
What weapon you taking, love?

401
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,741
I'm the victim, aren't I?
I'm not carrying anything.

402
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:14,541
Colt 1911.

403
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,181
Fit it with a silencer. Why?

404
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,061
Are we doing this properly?

405
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,077
Yeah. Then we need to be prepared.

406
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:26,997
The boss, Bernard, he's
like putty in my hands.

407
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,781
We are not going with loaded guns. No.

408
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,037
I'll need a sawn-off, double barrel led.

409
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:34,381
Scare the shit out of him.

410
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:41,381
You don't seem sure about this.

411
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:45,501
I've never been more
sure of anything in my life.

412
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,757
Are you in?

413
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:52,741
I'll let you know.

414
00:30:57,101 --> 00:31:00,117
She sighs that went well.

415
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,541
He's got to trust us. All of us.

416
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:13,141
Music box plays

417
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,101
you shouldn't have been late.

418
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:26,117
You spooked him.

419
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:28,517
The social said I can
visit Kelly on her birthday.

420
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,621
I had to get her something.

421
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,341
I'm glad you can see her before we go.

422
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:04,941
Do you trust me, boisie?

423
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,181
I'm giving up my whole life for you, Joan.

424
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,037
Seven years ago, Nance.
Feels like yesterday.

425
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:39,437
Yeah, in that cab off to hospital.
You screaming blue murder.

426
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:43,317
Should have gone hours before.
Yeah, you wanted to wait for Gary.

427
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,037
Yeah, what a mug. Nancy chuckles

428
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,317
you had bad taste in men.

429
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,421
Yeah, with dad as a fucking role model.

430
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:56,981
What? He's really poorly, Joan.

431
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,237
Good.

432
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:05,821
Don't you think you should visit,
Bury the hatchet before he...?

433
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:09,821
I'm sure he'd love to see you.

434
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:25,237
God. The social worker's here.

435
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:27,541
Yeah, course she is. That's all right.

436
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,261
Can you hold this? Yeah, course.

437
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,837
Mummy!

438
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,581
Happy birthday, kel!

439
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:43,157
You look... seven.

440
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:45,677
I am seven! Seven today! Joan laughs

441
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:48,637
I know you are. Say
hello to auntie Nancy.

442
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:52,197
Hello, auntie Nancy. Do
you like my school uniform?

443
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,861
I do. Happy birthday, Kelly!

444
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:57,381
Here, this is for you.

445
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,837
I thought we'd do presents after tea.

446
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,581
Aw. Aw.

447
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:07,957
Can I sit on your lap for tea, mummy?

448
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:10,701
Course you can. Yay!

449
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:17,861
Give me a minute,
ok? Sit there. Good girl.

450
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,437
So, I want to know all
about your new school.

451
00:34:26,461 --> 00:34:28,877
Did they sing you happy
birthday today? Yeah.

452
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,757
Joan exhales heavily

453
00:34:31,781 --> 00:34:34,957
that's so brilliant. Have
you got lots of new friends?

454
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:37,997
Yeah. Everyone in my
class wants to be my friend.

455
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,301
You're so popular!

456
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:50,821
I'll check access at the back.
You keep him busy round the front.

457
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:09,301
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

458
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,341
Thank you, sir.

459
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,677
Can I help you, sir?
After a ring for my wife.

460
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,221
Go ahead. Take your time.

461
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:31,597
Can I help you, sir? He's
after a ring for his wife.

462
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:33,517
Absolutely.

463
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,661
You go get your lunch, sweetheart.

464
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,221
How long have you been married, sir?

465
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:52,517
A few months. How
about an eternity ring?

466
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:55,477
An expression of everlasting love.

467
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,517
Absolutely. Can I see
that one at the back?

468
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:58,941
Course.

469
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:14,517
There we are. Nine-carat
diamond in platinum.

470
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,077
Boisie exhales

471
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,477
or there is the option of the half eternity,

472
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:23,037
meaning the diamonds only
cover the front of the ring.

473
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:25,077
I wouldn't wanna do it by halves.

474
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,541
Quite right, sir.

475
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:31,901
I'll take it.

476
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:35,717
Just not right now.

477
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:36,901
I'll be back.

478
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:48,637
Here we go. Presents! I want presents!

479
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:52,901
Course you do. Here you go. Open it up.

480
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,821
I'll take the paper. There we go.

481
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,421
Here. That's it.

482
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:08,517
Music box plays

483
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,981
you can put all your treasures inside.

484
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:19,517
Did you have one when you were seven?

485
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:24,581
No, but I always wanted
one. I used to ask every year.

486
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:28,781
That's from me.

487
00:37:35,981 --> 00:37:40,421
Wow! Pens, glue, stickers!

488
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:45,717
It's a making box! She
loves making things.

489
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,941
Do you like it, mummy?

490
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:52,837
Mummy? I love it.

491
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:55,197
She's very creative.

492
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:58,061
Yeah, she's always beavering away
on a project. She's got real talent.

493
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:05,437
Yeah, excellent. All right.

494
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,021
He places phone in receiver

495
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:14,621
that was albie. Paul's just called. He's in.

496
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,701
He groans

497
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:25,861
are you still thinking about Kelly?

498
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,261
Yeah. And my dad.

499
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,981
You think we should go and see him?

500
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:40,821
Maybe.

501
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:45,021
I mean.

502
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:50,541
What if he wants to say sorry?

503
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:35,397
He hates slap.

504
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:37,837
I thought you didn't
care what he thought.

505
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:39,101
I don't.

506
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:44,541
She exhales.

507
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:48,741
I won't be long.

508
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,077
Thought I'd better come.

509
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:14,901
He wheezes.

510
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:35,461
Nancy told me that
you're not doing too good.

511
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:39,061
She told me that you're
in trouble with the law.

512
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,637
You never did know
how to obey the rules.

513
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,837
It's complicated. It's not my fault.

514
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,781
And how many times did we hear that?

515
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:52,997
It's true. Ask Nancy.

516
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,821
Just grow up, Joan.

517
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:57,541
Stop fighting.

518
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:01,621
Make life easier on yourself.

519
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,061
God, you know nothing
about my life now.

520
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,917
I know you've put Kelly in care.

521
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:10,821
You lost her.

522
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,477
No. No, I haven't.

523
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:18,917
It's all right. She'll
thank you for it one day.

524
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:21,717
Joan huffs and you know it.

525
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:26,437
I have tried to be nice, but I can't...

526
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:28,877
Here we go. Poor little Joan.

527
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,477
No. You did this to me,
dad. You made me like this.

528
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,117
Always blaming someone else.

529
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:36,861
You think you can raise a kid
by beating the shit out of them?

530
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:45,781
Belting them across
the... back till they bleed?

531
00:41:57,941 --> 00:42:00,477
You know, I will get my daughter back,

532
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:01,877
because I love her.

533
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:04,821
Something that you'll never understand.

534
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:31,477
Thanks for coming.
What's the emergency?

535
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:34,941
I need you to add Kelly to my
passport so I can take her with us.

536
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:38,541
And boisie's ok with that?

537
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:42,717
He tuts I mean, you
hold stuff back from val.

538
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:45,837
Yeah, no, to protect her. That's different.

539
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:49,141
No, you have to tell him.
Yeah. I will, I will. I just

540
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,421
I need to find the right time.

541
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,397
I know how deep your debts run.

542
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:03,061
There'll be ten grand more
after the job, once we've sold on.

543
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:11,381
Promise me you'll tell him.
Before the job. Promise.

544
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,541
How you gonna get her?

545
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,541
Got an idea, I just need to research it.

546
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:29,221
Children chatter.

547
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:42,637
Phone rings 'hello, king's morten.'

548
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,917
'hello, it's Simone highsmith

549
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:46,077
'from the New York herald.

550
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:49,437
'I'm over here writing an article
about British children at play,

551
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,461
'and I'd love to visit the school.'
