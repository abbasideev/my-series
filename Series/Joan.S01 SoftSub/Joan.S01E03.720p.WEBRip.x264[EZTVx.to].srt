1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:04,197
Gary, what the hell
did you do?! She gasps

2
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,437
so, you've just been made homeless,

3
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:08,797
and you want to place your
daughter in emergency care?

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,237
Come here. Don't go,
mummy, please don't go.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,997
'I love my daughter so much.

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,677
'I fully intend on getting a job and
a place of my own to support us.

7
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,061
'I just need a chance.'

8
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,517
- if I did have something to sell...?
- What?

9
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,581
Some stones, loose.

10
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,797
How'd you get them out?

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:32,037
'Grabbed them from the
safe. Necked 'em, walked.

12
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,437
'So, can you sell them for
me?' 'Might take a few weeks.'

13
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,637
right, I need cash now.

14
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,301
Would you do a bit more work, then?

15
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,957
'So, what am I nicking?'
'Clothes, designer gear, luggage.'

16
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,517
'but I wanna Nick jewels, not
shoplift with a dodgy chequebook.'

17
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,397
'all in good time.' 'I'm
only doing this one job.'

18
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:52,077
once you Nick the gear,
we're going to Spain tomorrow.

19
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,181
Spain?

20
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:57,757
'We need to courier some jewellery.

21
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:59,397
'My mate albie sells it out in Spain

22
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:01,077
'where the pigs aren't looking for it.

23
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,797
'We take it over, he pays us on delivery.'

24
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:06,157
'so you want me to take it on the plane,

25
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,221
'bear all the risk?'

26
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,757
so, we'll swing by his club.

27
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,477
'You need to act dumb
around his missus.'

28
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,197
business and pleasure all
in one cute, little package.

29
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,117
Yeah, no, I reckon
we'll make a good team.

30
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,877
I found out your ex did a
job for me back in the day.

31
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,477
You've spoken to Gary?

32
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,341
Says you was a right nightmare.

33
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,557
Ran off with his kid.

34
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,341
Gary's a bloody liar.

35
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,277
When am I coming home?

36
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,237
It won't be long now, I promise.

37
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:44,237
Our only concern is for Kelly's welfare.

38
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,261
I'm afraid we think that
she's better off where she is.

39
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,901
I need money. I mean "money" money.

40
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,517
Know what I mean?

41
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,541
Yeah, I reckon I do.

42
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,181
'The love cats' by the cure

43
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,341
today's special. Thank you.

44
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:32,157
So, what's the set-up?

45
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,197
It's perfect.

46
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,957
The house is miles from anywhere.

47
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,277
Crap security, no window locks.

48
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,917
We'll wait till it gets dark and break in.

49
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,397
Oil's halfway up the stairs.

50
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,077
It's definitely a real stubbs?
Classic. Worth thousands.

51
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,157
Enough to buy me and Kelly
a new home with a garden?

52
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,341
A mansion, with a Butler thrown in.

53
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,997
So, what about the owner?
Woman. Lives on her own.

54
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,861
Drinks a lot, according to Hugo.

55
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:59,397
Your man at the auction house? Yeah.

56
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,157
When did he value it? This morning.

57
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,477
She was already half-cut.

58
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,157
Why?

59
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:09,077
Hard life when you're filthy rich.
No, no, I mean why get it valued?

60
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,357
I dunno, probably insurance.

61
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,277
Or she's planning to sell it. Your point?

62
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,237
Well, I mean, if she's
already got a legit buyer,

63
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,997
they'll come looking for it when it goes.

64
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:19,357
It's much harder for us to sell on.

65
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:21,517
No, we'd have to hold
on to it for a while anyway.

66
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,317
Well, I don't want to
hold on to it for a while.

67
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,981
I need cash now. To
set myself up for Kelly.

68
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,437
Right, we'll go back to London
now, get Jim Cho to knock up a sham.

69
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,517
Come back.

70
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,837
I'll find a way in by
day, let you in at night.

71
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,221
Swap the pictures.

72
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,181
No-one will know it's gone.
We can sell it on straight away.

73
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:49,661
She grunts

74
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,741
thunder rumbles.

75
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:06,797
I was out walking. I was

76
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,357
I was out... I was out walking.

77
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,501
I was out walking.

78
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:21,077
Bell rings dog barking
get down! Who is it?

79
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,821
Sorry to disturb. Er, I need help.

80
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,941
I don't open the door to strangers.

81
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,141
Well, I've twisted my ankle.

82
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,837
I was out walking.

83
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:40,901
If... if I could just use your
telephone and call a friend?

84
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:43,221
It's getting dark.

85
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,917
I don't know what I was
thinking, setting off alone.

86
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:56,117
And then I turned my
ankle on a stile and...

87
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,437
Dog barks get back!

88
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:01,021
You're obviously a long way from home.

89
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,501
I just... I need a pick-me-up.
Well, I could open some Brandy.

90
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,997
Of course, if I could afford
to heat this bastard place,

91
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:20,421
I wouldn't need it.

92
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,237
It's a beautiful house.

93
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:28,037
It was, before my husband
walked out, left me with all the bills.

94
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,757
Fuck-face.

95
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:31,781
Sounds familiar.

96
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,877
Can't believe that anyone would
abandon a little poppet like you.

97
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,317
You'd be surprised.

98
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,021
Another woman?

99
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:47,237
He packed a bag and said
he was "going on the run."

100
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,877
Classic. I know. Fuck-face!

101
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:54,157
Woman chuckles, dog
barks shush! Dog barks

102
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:57,461
shush! You'll get your sausage.

103
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,757
He'll be back soon enough.

104
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,917
Dog whines

105
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:05,181
tail between his legs
with a peace offering.

106
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:08,477
Bottle of gin or something.

107
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,397
But don't let him back in! I won't, I won't.

108
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:13,797
That's always been my problem.

109
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:17,141
Well, you've got a kind heart.

110
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,621
You'll stay the night.

111
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,301
Thank you. That's very kind.

112
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:00,117
Aw... your daughter?

113
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,957
Married a kiwi last year.

114
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:05,101
Buggered off to the
other side of the world.

115
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:09,461
I'll see you for breakfast.

116
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,437
My friend needs to come
early, so I'll just slip out.

117
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,197
Everyone leaves me in the end.

118
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,341
Well, thank you for having me.

119
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,301
Good night. Night.

120
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:12,981
Dog pants shh! Good boy.

121
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:23,061
Boo.

122
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,677
Dog barks shh!

123
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,837
Here, give him a sausage.

124
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,341
Why me? You're the stranger.

125
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:40,637
We're fine for now. I put
that valium in her nightcap.

126
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:43,677
Ok. Where's the sham?

127
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,181
It's in the Van. Let's
get the real deal out first.

128
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,717
What a beauty.

129
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:03,317
1760, 1765... Come on, then.

130
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,021
Look at the detail.

131
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,677
Joan grunts stop, stop, stop.

132
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,797
It's fine, it's fine.

133
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,461
Careful. Don't touch the oil.

134
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,957
Door unlocks, dog
barks door creaks, closes

135
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:21,637
- shit.
- Henrietta?

136
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,717
Hen?

137
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,637
Forgive me. Hen?

138
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:30,317
Scream. Joan screams
out my way! Dog barks

139
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:34,397
glass smashes put it down. Now!

140
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:36,717
Dog growls

141
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:41,277
who are you? A friend of hen's?
Go in the kitchen, call the police.

142
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,717
Gun cocks out my fucking way.

143
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:47,317
Dog barks move.

144
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,597
Move, or I'll blow your brains out!

145
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,901
Dog barks.

146
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:04,781
Man grunts don't fuck with me.

147
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,101
Fuck's sake! Get in! Car starts

148
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,957
you brought a gun?!

149
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,621
It's all right, I wasn't gonna use it.

150
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,301
Do you think he'll call
the police? Yeah, course.

151
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,301
Just drive.

152
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,037
You're over-thinking it.

153
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,237
He was drunk. He saw you for a second.

154
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:49,357
But I spent all evening with her.

155
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,837
You were in disguise, and
she doesn't know your name.

156
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,597
She's got no means of tracing
you. Well, she'd get me in a line-up.

157
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,037
A line-up?!

158
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:58,637
Well, it's all right for you.
You had a balaclava on.

159
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:01,197
Yeah, to make you
the victim, protect you.

160
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,877
Protect me? You pulled out a gun!

161
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,597
You turned it into an aggravated assault.

162
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,861
I wasn't gonna use it. I don't care.

163
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:09,437
What was I supposed to do, joanie?

164
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,797
Follow me upstairs. Run
out the back, like I did.

165
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,677
Without this? Yeah, without the painting.

166
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:15,741
It's not like we can sell it now.

167
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,501
I'm taking it to the
warehouse. Order a Chinese.

168
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:24,861
Be back in an hour.

169
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,461
But I wanna come with you.

170
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,061
Let me come with you. Sorry, joanie.

171
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,357
So, I graft for you all day,
put my neck on the line,

172
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,501
and you don't fucking care?

173
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,501
You can't just shut me out!

174
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,501
Fuck you.

175
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,461
Sighs.

176
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,701
Bell rings

177
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,021
what can I do you for?

178
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,461
Selling stones.

179
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,221
Loose?

180
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,797
Who sent you? No-one.

181
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,277
Well, who are you?

182
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,637
Joan. Joan who?

183
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,501
You interested or not?

184
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,861
Where'd you get them from, Joan?

185
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,917
Does it matter? Well,
it should to you, darling.

186
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:20,141
You've been royally done. Cut glass.

187
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,981
I can see it from here.

188
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,741
She sighs serious?

189
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,117
What you doing? Might
as well Chuck them, then.

190
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,061
No, no, no. Look. Let
me take another look.

191
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:40,077
I might be able to give you a few quid.

192
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,421
It's all right. I think they're
worth more than that.

193
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,341
You never told me
where you got them from.

194
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,237
I'm not going to.

195
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,621
Then I'd better keep hold of them.

196
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,061
Call my mate down the cop shop.

197
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,941
They're only worth something
if you know how to sell them!

198
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,701
Stupid cow.

199
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,541
Murmur of conversation.

200
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:08,957
Enjoy.

201
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,821
'Nocturnes op.9, no.2' by chop in

202
00:15:13,421 --> 00:15:15,221
same again, without the... veg.

203
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,877
Would you let me buy
this? No, I wouldn't.

204
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,021
She never accepts
drinks off strange men.

205
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,581
Of all the gin joints...

206
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,341
How did you find me?

207
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,021
I never buy what I can steal.

208
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,581
This came. From social services.

209
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,197
She sighs they want to visit.

210
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,381
Check out the suitability of
my new living arrangements.

211
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:03,581
So come back.

212
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,701
You've gotta let me in, boisie.

213
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,797
I mean, men have been
pushing me around my whole life,

214
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,797
keeping things from me.

215
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,301
I won't have it any more.

216
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,941
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

217
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,021
I'm not a grass.

218
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,861
Never have been.

219
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,581
Keys jingle

220
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,181
key's in the glove box.

221
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,781
Glove box opens, keys jingle.

222
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:42,301
George iv. It's mahogany.

223
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:47,101
Here you are. Look at
the craftsmanship here.

224
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,541
How beautiful.

225
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,101
She chuckles.

226
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,541
Wow.

227
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:16,741
Never seen you so happy.

228
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:20,221
I had nothing as a kid.

229
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,621
Me neither.

230
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:26,741
Not a bean. Yeah, not just.

231
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:33,341
Stuff. I mean... No family.

232
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:36,301
My mum.

233
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:38,461
I get it.

234
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,381
My dad beat me.

235
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,141
A lot.

236
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,781
What did she do?

237
00:18:56,741 --> 00:19:00,077
She... chose her fella over me,

238
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:01,621
gave me away when I was a kid.

239
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:06,917
He plays piano melody

240
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:09,477
then one day, she
said I could come back.

241
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,197
That's good. Yeah.

242
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:14,157
So they could claim family allowance.

243
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:15,741
Five shillings a week.

244
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:18,781
25 pence?

245
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,381
Least I knew what I was worth.

246
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:36,621
They'll be safe here.

247
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,261
Choose something.

248
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:19,877
Ringing tone

249
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,197
'southern well social
services. Good morning.'

250
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:24,861
hello, it's Joan O'Connell again.

251
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:30,997
I-I'm still waiting for a
visit from the social worker.

252
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:33,517
Any idea when they're coming?

253
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,277
'I'll have to check
where you are on the list

254
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:36,901
'and get someone to call you back.'

255
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:40,061
but I've got my flat all ready.

256
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:43,341
'Yes, I appreciate that.'

257
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,381
I'm just... I'm desperate
to get my little girl back.

258
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,701
'I'm sorry, but we are
really busy at the moment.'

259
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,021
ok.

260
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:58,757
Thank you.

261
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,861
Vacuum whirrs.

262
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,197
'To get your motor running smoothly,

263
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,197
'choose Becker type o grade,

00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:17,021
'the finest engine oil in the world.'

'sapphire goldsmith's, London.'

268
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:48,701
Thanks.

269
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:01,357
Can I help you, madam?
Er, yeah. Coffee?

270
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,901
Certainly, madam. Thank you.

271
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:08,581
Show me the emperor
again. Of course, madam.

272
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,797
We can always adjust it.

273
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:27,117
I'm in London again next
week. I can try it on then.

274
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:30,157
Absolutely. If you send the car?

275
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:31,557
To the dorsington? Yes.

276
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,397
And I need the spec. The
carats, the cut, the mount.

277
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:39,157
My husband likes to know
what he's spending his money on.

278
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,061
Salesman chuckles of
course. I'll write it all down.

279
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,221
I've been thinking, boisie.

280
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:58,861
If we can't sell the painting now.

281
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,077
I still need some money.

282
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:05,141
Thanks.

283
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,157
Well, I'll sell something
from the warehouse

284
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:09,381
to get you some cash.

285
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:13,581
No. I wanna earn my own money.

286
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:17,661
So you can buy Kelly a horse?

287
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:19,837
Sorry, two horses.

288
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:22,157
I don't want her to ever wish
she was back at the ashburys.

289
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,221
She won't.

290
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,661
I've seen a ring I wanna Nick.

291
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,997
Worth 250 grand.

292
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:35,061
He scoffs

293
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:38,901
they won't even get the ring out of
the cabinet if they don't know you.

294
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:41,797
Unless I convince them I'm a somebody.

295
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,117
An American. Loaded.

296
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:46,317
Dress up proper fancy,

297
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,477
drop in that I'm staying at a posh hotel.

298
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,261
You know, string them along.

299
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:54,557
Tell them I need a spec
made up for my lover.

300
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:56,477
Ok. Take the spec up to hat ton garden.

301
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:57,597
Get a sham made up.

302
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,677
So then... when I return
to actually buy the ring...

303
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,381
Swap it, walk out, sell it on.

304
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,381
Well, you don't need me at all.

305
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,997
I do. I need a sugar
daddy to come with me,

306
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,221
help me sell my character.

307
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:19,501
Come with you? What,
like your assistant?

308
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:27,037
I can't leave the shop. No, sorry, Joan.

309
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:30,301
You'll for ego 80 grand because
you won't close up for half a day?

310
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,901
She scoffs

311
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,501
do you even want me to succeed?

312
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:44,221
As a thief or as a mother?

313
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:57,861
Doorbell rings

314
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,421
boisie? Can you get it?

315
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:05,341
Might be the social.

316
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,141
Indistinct conversation

317
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,117
hello, Joan. It's you.

318
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,221
Nice to see you, too. Albie chuckles

319
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,621
what are you doing here?

320
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,421
Val was getting sunspots. And the rest.

321
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,117
So, back for good? Joan.

322
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:35,061
No, that's fair. Let her quiz me.

323
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,357
If we're about to work together.

324
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:39,741
What do you mean? What's he said?

325
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:48,101
Can you act?

326
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,501
With you on my arm, anything's possible.

327
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:56,997
Great

328
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:59,877
look, I'm happy to get
involved. He clears throat

329
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,437
but why don't you just do it on your own?

330
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,157
I need help selling on.

331
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:06,261
The fence won't work
with someone new.

332
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,421
It's all planned out. I've got the spec.

333
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,901
I know what I'm doing, albie.

334
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,461
Well, I don't doubt that for a minute.

335
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,141
Bell rings

336
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,381
need a word with king, darling.

337
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,237
King. What?

338
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:33,517
There's a bloke here to see you.

339
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,997
Once you've made the
introduction, I'll do the talking.

340
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,421
Er, no. King's the kind of geezer
who'd rather talk with a man.

341
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,477
Hello, mate. Hello.

342
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,197
Didn't know you was
knocking round again.

343
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:52,237
Only so long you can lie on
a beach, know what I mean?

344
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,637
King chuckles

345
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:56,397
you should've told me
you was working for albie.

346
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,317
I'm not. He's working for me.

347
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:02,101
Working together, mate.
Er, we need a piece made up.

348
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,397
Not selling stones any more, then?

349
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:07,461
Sold them. You missed out.

350
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:12,341
What kind of piece? It's
my job. I've got the spec.

351
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,501
You need to get your
trousers back, mate.

352
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:22,861
He whistles in appreciation

353
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,477
where did you get this
from? From the jeweller's.

354
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:30,837
I want an 18-carat four-claw
mount with the fake set in.

355
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,917
Made of? Cubic zirconia.

356
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,861
It's got to match this exactly.

357
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,861
He exhales

358
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:41,237
that's a lot of work. It'll cost you.

359
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,877
You're gonna do it for free.
You mad cow. Hey, Joan, no...

360
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,357
In return, you'll get the real deal

361
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:47,477
when I bring it back the next day, ok?

362
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:51,981
Retail's 250 grand. I want
80 in cash, unmarked notes.

363
00:28:58,261 --> 00:28:59,757
75.

364
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,597
80. And I want the
sham ready for Thursday.

365
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:03,941
Ooh!

366
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:13,997
He whistles through his teeth forget it.

367
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,117
Not the only bent
jeweller in hat ton garden.

368
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:19,141
All right, all right. You're on. You're on.

369
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,661
I'll do it.

370
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:25,437
How'd it go?

371
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:28,077
All right. Is he shaping
up as a good sugar daddy?

372
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,837
Well, he's not exactly Sidney poitier.

373
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:32,677
Thanks well, maybe Eddie
Murphy on a good day.

374
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,101
He chuckles

375
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:39,181
so, what's the set-up?

376
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:43,317
Er... pick up the sham from king
on Thursday, go home, get changed.

377
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:45,517
Take the tube to Heathrow,
pick up a black cab,

378
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:49,957
check in at the st James's park
hotel as mrs Stephanie sutherland.

379
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:52,997
I have cases. No problem,
madam. Thank you.

380
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:56,437
'Stay the night, get
prepared for the big day,

381
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,901
'get into character.'

382
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,021
Knocking.

383
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,501
Just wanted to say good luck.

384
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,261
Go. Why?

385
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,757
Because I'm jet lagged.

386
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:43,597
Having a quiet night in before I meet up

387
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,221
with my sugar daddy in the morning.

388
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:51,541
You love all this, don't you?

389
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:54,261
Dressing up.

390
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,117
Pretending.

391
00:30:57,141 --> 00:30:59,141
Job satisfaction isn't a crime.

392
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,581
But the rest of it is.

393
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,781
Just go.

394
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,861
He sighs

395
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,117
so albie's not staying?

396
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,877
Don't be ridiculous. You know the story.

397
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,101
I'm meeting him in the shop.

398
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,581
All right. Bye. Bye.

399
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:06,621
Phone rings

400
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:08,621
she clears throat

401
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,181
hello.

402
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,661
Yes, I'll be straight down.

403
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:19,581
Yeah, checking out this
afternoon. Thank you. Bye.

404
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,901
For fuck's sake. Where
the fuck did that go?

405
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,141
Morning.

406
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,661
Mrs sutherland. Thank you.

407
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:34,141
Hello, mrs sutherland.

408
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:41,317
Mrs sutherland, how
lovely to see you again.

409
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:42,957
I trust the car arrived ok?

410
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,237
Thank you. And how was your flight?

411
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:48,237
I think I picked up a cold. She sniffs

412
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:52,317
you know, I can't get that
cute little ring out of my mind.

413
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:54,477
It's an exceptional piece.

414
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,677
I-I told my, er... My friend all about it.

415
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,861
Are we to expect him?

416
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:04,461
Well, I thought that he'd be here already.

417
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,677
Maybe I could try it on again?

418
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,821
Of course. Thank you.

419
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:21,261
Thank you.

420
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,181
It goes beautifully with your eyes.

421
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,101
Hello, sweetie.

422
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,581
They chuckle.

423
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:44,621
I've been thinking about you all night.

424
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:48,877
What do you think?

425
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:51,637
It is stunning. Isn't it?

426
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:54,077
And you really, really want it?

427
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:57,181
More than anything. Please?

428
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,877
It's a very special piece,
sir. Totally unique, in fact.

429
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,797
Of course. I saw the spec.

430
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:05,837
And the price is very...

431
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:08,541
Da-da-da-da. Not in front of her?

432
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,101
Let's talk.

433
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,061
They chat indistinctly

434
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,181
she sniffs.

435
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,317
It's not too much, is it?

436
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,741
For you, my love... It's a bargain.

437
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:54,261
Stephanie?

438
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:58,077
Honey. We said we'd
meet at the restaurant.

439
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,077
You didn't need to come here. Er... er

440
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,077
Steph and I just bumped into each other.

441
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:03,261
We were friends in college.

442
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,381
Hi. Sorry. James sutherland.

443
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:13,077
- He's always been the jealous type.
- Good to meet you, James.

444
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:17,621
Well... Let's go and get some lunch?

445
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:20,141
Next time.

446
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,821
Thank you.

447
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:30,261
You could surprise her with it.

448
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:37,701
No. I don't think so.

449
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,101
My apologies.

450
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:48,821
Good work.

451
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,061
Thought you really were a
green-eyed monster for a minute.

452
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,837
Right, some of us
have still got work to do.

453
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,181
I'm off to king's. Er, you
want me to come with?

454
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,277
In case he's funny about
giving money to a lady.

455
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:06,861
Well, then he needs to learn.

456
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:09,941
I'll get you your 20% later.

457
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,461
Gonna need to keep her on a tight rein.

458
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:27,101
'Sweet dreams ' by eurythmics.

459
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,877
I wouldn't have any
work if I ripped people off.

460
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:42,717
I always count the money.

461
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:21,717
Folk music plays albie barely sets foot

462
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,557
in the kitchen. That's not true.

463
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,277
I know you can cook.
She is so bloody lucky.

464
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:27,797
Look... what is this, Boise?
I bought a load of antiques

465
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:30,237
off this Russian geezer. He
threw in his record collection.

466
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:32,437
Did you make them from scratch?

467
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:36,461
Course I did, you stupid
cow. He's transformed you.

468
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:40,021
Maybe I've transformed myself. Yeah

469
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,661
you like him, though?

470
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:48,701
Yeah, I do. I think he's great!

471
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:51,917
Apart from his weird taste in music.

472
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:55,957
I'm proper happy for you,
Joan. Come on. Let's go.

473
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:57,461
Got 'em? Yeah.

474
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,461
Let's go.

475
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:01,701
Ta-da!

476
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,717
Right, val. Don't let me
down. No, I couldn't, Joan.

477
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:11,037
You could, couldn't you? Well,
if you made it, course I can.

478
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:13,061
What is it about London
that makes you so hungry?

479
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,677
Well, I have been working
pretty hard these last few days.

480
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:19,381
You're working here? What you doing?

481
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:24,157
This and that. Er... Me and Boise,

482
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:26,757
been working on a scheme
with an American couple.

483
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,237
Americans? Don't ask, Joan.

484
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,317
This... This... dessert is gorgeous.

485
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:35,357
You know what Jerry hall
says. Cook in the kitchen...

486
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:36,981
Whore in the bedroom. Albie!

487
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:40,021
Sorry, Joan. She doesn't mind.

488
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:42,381
Come on, Joan. Top me up.

489
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,581
Come on.

490
00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:55,061
Nice.

491
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,861
Toast to Joan.

492
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:02,197
Look at her. She's perfect, isn't she?

493
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:04,077
God! What are you on about?

494
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,677
I fell for her the moment I met her,

495
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:09,077
scrabbling for coins in a pub.

496
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:11,437
We got as drunk as
lords. Nothing's changed...

497
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:13,221
Laughter

498
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,741
except I love you even more.

499
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:19,261
I love you.

500
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,661
Marry me, joanie.

501
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:29,261
What?

502
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,261
Are you sure?

503
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:34,957
Course.

504
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,501
I adore you.

505
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:38,861
Let's get married.

506
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:44,581
Marry me.

507
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:49,597
Yes! Yes! Yes!

508
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:52,261
Whooping

509
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:55,861
congratulations!

510
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:59,941
Yes, grab the champers!

511
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:13,821
Music echoes and fades doorbell rings.

512
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,221
It was a one-off.

513
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:35,437
I'll take that, sorry. Once Kelly's here,

514
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:37,997
there'll be nothing like this, I promise.

515
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:40,197
Do you want a coffee? No, thanks.

516
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:43,157
We've got freshly
ground. Honestly, I'm fine.

517
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:46,877
Joan sighs if I'd known you were coming

518
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:49,077
I mean, I've been keeping
the place spick and span.

519
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,621
I've been obsessed.
Hoovering night and day.

520
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:55,637
We're not too bothered about mess.

521
00:41:55,661 --> 00:41:58,357
As long as you're making progress
towards building a stable home.

522
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,741
Yeah, I am, definitely.

523
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:04,117
Because Kelly's doing
well where she is now.

524
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,021
Yeah, course she is. She's a good girl.

525
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:09,821
It-it's not about compliance, Joan.

526
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:13,461
Mrs ashbury tells us she's really thriving.

527
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,957
Kelly's flourishing at school.

528
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:17,861
Yeah, well, she would
say that, wouldn't she?

529
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:22,757
Do you want to sit down, Joan?

530
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,277
I've got something I need to tell you.

531
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:27,501
What? Sit down.

532
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:30,021
Spit it out.

533
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:34,461
The ashburys have asked
us if they can adopt Kelly.

534
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,957
It's just a request at the moment.

535
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:39,477
You're her mother,

536
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:43,397
and no-one's doing
anything without due process.

537
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,861
We do always try to keep
children with their mothers.

538
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:50,637
'It's really important
that Kelly moves back

539
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:53,341
'into a settled, stable environment.

540
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:59,381
'Right now, we're not
convinced you can provide that.'

541
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,381
TV plays faintly.

542
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:13,901
Door opens.

543
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:42,141
Good night, sweetheart.

544
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:26,781
