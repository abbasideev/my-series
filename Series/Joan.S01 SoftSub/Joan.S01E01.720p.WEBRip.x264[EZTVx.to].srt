00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,661
Hello?

3
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,781
Yes, I'll be straight down.

4
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:53,637
Yeah, checking out this afternoon.

5
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,477
Thank you. Bye.

6
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,517
Fuck's sake. Where the fuck did that go?

00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,157
here you go, love.

9
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,621
Thanks, mummy.

10
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,821
K...

11
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:55,037
E... L-l-y.

12
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,581
Kelly! Brilliant girl!

13
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,997
You're crazy!

14
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,861
Car horn outside

15
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,541
happy birthday.

16
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,157
Gary!

17
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,117
Gary, you're on the
wrong side of the road.

18
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:37,157
Am I?

19
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,637
Move away, Gary. Gary!

20
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,797
Tyres screech, horn beeps

21
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,557
my god! Slow down,
slow down, slow down,

22
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,221
please, please, please.

23
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,261
Look in the back.

24
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:01,821
Happy birthday, joanie. My god.

25
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,797
Gary!

26
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,381
She squeals

27
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,157
where did you get it?

28
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:10,637
Come on, Joan, you know not to ask.

29
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,301
Yeah, about a telly,
but this... And the car.

30
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,261
Tyres screech

31
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,301
'tainted love' by soft cell

32
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,597
are you done with this?

33
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,821
Thank you.

34
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,317
Bourbon?

35
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,997
And one for yourself.

36
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:40,397
How many times?

37
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,301
I don't know. Tell me again.

38
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,917
We could just be friends, you know.

39
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,941
I think you want more
than that, I can see it.

40
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,821
Salesman?

41
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,197
Same again?

42
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:16,141
Music fades Gary?

43
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,701
Gary?

44
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:24,701
Door opens and closes
where have you been?

45
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,661
You left kel on her own.

46
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,797
Where have you been?

47
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:42,757
I've got to be on my toes for a bit, love.

48
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:46,981
What did you do?

49
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,357
Gary, what the hell did you do?

50
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,661
She gasps

51
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:55,797
cheap.

52
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,117
Who is she?

53
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,877
Maybe I want to screw a bird
who don't expect me to mind her kid.

54
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,837
Your kid.

55
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,517
You keep your trap shut!

56
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,837
What can I say? I don't know anything.

57
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,037
Door opens I'll change the locks!

58
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,101
He scoffs.

59
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:21,037
We'll have to smash it with a rock again.

60
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,501
You know what, I think I've got it.

61
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:28,157
Kelly gasps what's that? I don't know.

62
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,277
Kelly giggles all right.

63
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,557
You see how many you
can find, see if you can find

64
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:35,077
the prettiest, prettiest shell, ok?

65
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,157
Ok.

66
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:37,637
I'll be on the bench, ok?

67
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,421
Find the prettiest one you can.

68
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,477
Cute kid.

69
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,917
Thanks.

70
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,077
I thought you lived in ashford.

71
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,701
Have car, can travel.

72
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,117
Shouldn't you be selling windows?

73
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,677
You trying to soften me
up for a set right now?

74
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,141
He scoffs

75
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:30,781
who are you?

76
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,581
Just a friend, someone to chat to.

77
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,317
You're undercover.

78
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:40,997
Slow down.

79
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,077
Look, I know Gary's done a big job,

80
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,597
ok, he's in trouble. Bollocks.

81
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,117
Talk to me.

82
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,437
Ok? Tell me where he is.

83
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:49,557
I can help you, I can keep you safe.

84
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,957
He's away on business.

85
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,317
Come on. Sports cars and fur coats,

86
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,861
it's not rocket science, Joan.

87
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,157
Oi, talk to me. For her sake.

88
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:00,637
I'm not a grass.

89
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,957
Joan, come on.

90
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,461
Kelly, it's getting cold, let's go home.

91
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,637
Or shall we go and get
a hot chocolate, yeah?

92
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,981
Yeah.

93
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,021
Creaking

94
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,341
kel?

95
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,957
Kelly?

96
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,741
Are you all right?

97
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:56,061
Creaking.

98
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,221
Gary's not here.

99
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:24,917
He... he hasn't told me
anything, I swear. You're...

100
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,181
You're wasting your time.

101
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,701
Get up.

102
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:54,221
He owes us money, Joan.

103
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,621
Where is he? I don't know.

104
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,061
She whimpers where is he?

105
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,277
If I knew, I'd tell you.

106
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,061
You need to open up.

107
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,861
She whimpers.

108
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,317
I said open it.

109
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:18,941
Wider.

110
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,301
Now close.

111
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,157
In the morning, your brains blown out,

112
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,477
imagine little Kelly's face.

113
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,517
He's got a girlfriend, he stays out,

114
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,397
he'll be back in the morning.

115
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,461
She breathes shakily.

116
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,357
Well, let's hope Gary comes
home for breakfast, then.

117
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:45,341
Otherwise, it will be
little Kelly who gets it.

118
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,701
Door closes she sobs.

119
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,157
Kelly.

120
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,341
Kelly, wake up. Come on, love.

121
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:25,877
You need to wake up, all right?

122
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,541
We're going out.

123
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,317
But your nose is bleeding.

124
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,301
It's all right. Get dressed.

125
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,541
Good girl.

126
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:08,981
Where are we going now?

127
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,941
A safe place.

128
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,501
It's ok.

129
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,917
So, you've just been made homeless,

130
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:32,157
and you want to place your
daughter in emergency care?

131
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:35,301
I don't want to, obviously.

132
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,037
Of course.

133
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,117
And there's nowhere
else you can go for a bit?

134
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,117
Your parents'?

135
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,357
Get hold of my old file,

136
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,117
see what I went through as a kid.

137
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:47,277
What about a sibling?

138
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:52,477
I've got a sister in London,
but I can't take her there.

139
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:54,197
Is there something else going on, Joan,

140
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,717
that I need to know about?

141
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,917
No.

142
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,661
Is Kelly in danger?

143
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:03,877
No, no. Not at all.

144
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:09,757
Just, er... Just... Need...
need a bit of a break.

145
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,581
It's ok.

146
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,877
That's what we're here
for, to help people in trouble.

147
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,477
And it's only till I find a new flat,

148
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,437
and that won't be long, I promise.

149
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,677
A few weeks.

150
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,381
We're gonna place her in a foster family.

151
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,557
Yeah.

152
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:32,277
Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't
want her in a home.

153
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:34,381
I was in a home as a kid.

154
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,101
And it's definitely just temporary.

155
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,821
I-I won't... I won't lose her, will I?

156
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,917
Promise me I won't lose her.

157
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,941
Of course not.

158
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:53,541
Now, tell me a bit about Kelly.

159
00:13:56,381 --> 00:14:01,117
She, er... She loves beans and nuggets.

160
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,181
She'll notice if you sneak any veg in.

161
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:09,981
She hates scratchy jumpers.

162
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,381
She's a good girl.

163
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,181
She won't complain.

164
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,461
Look after her.

165
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,461
Course we will.

166
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:34,397
There's your bag.

167
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,061
Come here.

168
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,621
Hey.

169
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:49,557
My mummy... gave me this ring

170
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:52,037
so I'd remember her
when we were apart.

171
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:54,261
Look how pretty it is, it sparkles.

172
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,757
I want you to stay, mummy.

173
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:00,957
I know.

174
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,501
Knock at the door

175
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,821
hi. It's time to go.

176
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,317
Come here.

177
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,141
You'll be all right.

178
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:13,957
You'll be all right.

179
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:18,477
Kelly sobs will you be all right, mummy?

180
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,261
Of course I will, sweetheart.

181
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:22,621
Come here.

182
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,661
Don't go, mummy, please don't go!

183
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,661
'Time' by culture club

184
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,757
what's happened? Are you all right?

185
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,557
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing.

186
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:24,837
Where's Kelly?

187
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,381
Hello, are you all right? Come over.

188
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,837
Where's Kelly?

189
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,781
She's in foster care for a bit. She, er.

190
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,997
I have to keep her
safe, they can't find her.

191
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,621
Why? What's happened?

192
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,957
Gary's got gangsters after him.

193
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,117
Don't you dare bring
him anywhere near here.

194
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:48,757
It's fine, I've left him, I've left him.

195
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,957
I just... I've got nowhere else to go.

196
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,501
Nance.

197
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,677
You can sleep on the
settee for a few days,

198
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,197
until you find somewhere else.

199
00:16:58,221 --> 00:16:59,717
Thank you.

200
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:02,837
You can borrow my
clothes, help out in the salon.

201
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,397
But none of your bloody chaos.

202
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,861
I mean it, Joan. Upstairs.

203
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,061
Don't worry, she's a
good kid, she'll be ok.

204
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,461
She sniffs

205
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,717
it's the chemicals.

206
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:34,981
You need to make a
fresh start for you and kel.

207
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,861
Nancy.

208
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,141
What?

209
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,901
I'm gonna try.

210
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,061
I know. New hairdo will help.

211
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,741
Bit quiet, aren't you, sweetheart?

212
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:00,021
Smile.

213
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,861
That wasn't hard, was it?

214
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:06,877
You're not so bad
when you make an effort.

215
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,397
Aw, thank you.

216
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,637
You're like my missus,

217
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,557
just need a little nudge now and then.

218
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,317
She's got an excuse - we've got kids,

219
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,037
she's knackered.

220
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,141
Product?

221
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:39,261
Yeah. It's come out nice, Dave.

222
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,557
You've made a nice job of that.

223
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,181
I'll leave you with Nancy to pay up, ok?

224
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:01,157
She sighs I've just lost
one of my best clients.

225
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,637
What the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,421
Why can't you just be normal?

227
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,757
I'm an O'Connell.

228
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,397
So am I. No bloody excuse.

229
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:10,301
Phone rings

230
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,301
hello?

231
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,341
Yeah, sure. I'll just get her for you.

232
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:25,141
It's for you. Social worker.

233
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,117
Hi.

234
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:36,597
Fine, thanks. How's kel?
I'm desperate to see her.

235
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,717
See you. Night.

236
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,157
See you, girls. Have a good one.

237
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,237
Night.

238
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,021
Feet are killing me. Yeah.

239
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,757
Tenner.

240
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,757
Fiver, then, please.

241
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:49,037
End of the week, you'll
get paid like everyone else.

242
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:50,557
All right, just the train fare.

243
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,437
The foster mum said
I can visit tomorrow.

244
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,717
I need you here tomorrow,
we're fully booked.

245
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:57,277
But Kelly's expecting me now.

246
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,397
I'm really sorry, but you
should have checked.

247
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:01,981
You can't just have a
day off whenever you like.

248
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:46,941
Engine starts.

249
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,941
She chuckles

250
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,557
kel! Come here.

251
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,197
Come here.

252
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:55,037
Aw!

253
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,501
My girl, I'm sorry.

254
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:01,277
You've had your hair cut.

255
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:03,037
Do you like it?

256
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,661
I like it.

257
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,237
What's she doing? She's walking in.

258
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,277
And who's that?

259
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,837
Here you go. Nice hot drink.

260
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:13,901
Thank you.

261
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,037
Have you cut Kelly's hair?

262
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,357
Just a bit. We just
thought we'd try a change.

263
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,981
She looks pretty, doesn't she?

264
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:24,141
Do you like it, kel?

265
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:28,261
I like how you do it, mummy.

266
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:33,861
I-I-I gave her a ring.

267
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,957
We put it on a chain, didn't we?

268
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,421
So you'd always be close to mummy.

269
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:48,741
Thank you for being...
She's a lovely little girl.

270
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,261
Phone rings.

271
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,541
Sue answers the phone.

272
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:25,381
Sirens.

273
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:32,901
Fuck.

274
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,661
All right?

275
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,581
Door lock clicks.

276
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,237
What are you doing here?

277
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:17,837
Saw your name on the custody sheet.

278
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:19,197
I had to see Kelly.

279
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,797
What, by nicking a car,

280
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:23,637
ruining your chances
of getting her back?

281
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,221
Dumb blonde.

282
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,061
What do you want, Joan?

283
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:33,741
A normal life.

284
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,317
Get Kelly back.

285
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,277
Then tell that to the magistrate, right?

286
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:41,837
Tell him you're gonna get a job and a flat,

287
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:44,877
that you're gonna do
everything right from now on.

288
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,157
Like he'll believe me. I'll write something.

289
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,701
I'll back you.

290
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,997
Why would you do that?

291
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:53,781
Cos I think it's true.

292
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:59,421
Just... just don't report
me to the social, please.

293
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:08,341
Cell door closes door lock clicks.

294
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,957
'I know that I've been stupid, reckless,

295
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:29,437
'but it won't happen again.

296
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,277
'I mean, I haven't been
in trouble with the law

297
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:33,101
'since I was a teenager in care.'

298
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:37,077
and I love my daughter so much.

299
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,301
It would be.

300
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,717
Disastrous for her if I were
to get a custodial sentence.

301
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:46,317
And I fully intend on getting a job

302
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,077
and a place of my own to support us.

303
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:53,621
I just... I just need a
chance to prove myself.

304
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,877
Er, where have you been?

305
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,037
Sneaking back in like that.

306
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,477
To see Kelly.

307
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,101
I, stayed at a mate's.

308
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:20,397
I'm really sorry. I should've called.

309
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:23,821
I'm sorry, Nance. But look.

310
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:35,261
How was it?

311
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,941
Brilliant.

312
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,381
Sad.

313
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,837
I can't have you working
in the salon, Joan.

314
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:49,781
You're not reliable enough.

315
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,917
Find a new job, something
you're interested in.

316
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:56,701
You're more likely to stick at it that way.

317
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:15,357
Indistinct chatter

318
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:17,197
where are you heading? Into Mayfair.

319
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,597
You're heading to Mayfair?

320
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,917
Actually, I do need to look
for a present for my mother.

321
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,997
Shall we go together? Let's.

322
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,677
I was thinking a piece of jewellery.

323
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,301
A diamond ring or something.

324
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:50,437
I'm looking for a present for my mother.

325
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,117
Mother.

326
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:56,477
I'm looking for a very
special present for my mother.

327
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,157
Can I help you, madam?

328
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,117
Yes, I'm looking for a special present

329
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,917
for my mother - a diamond.

330
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:06,317
Absolutely. Do you see
any you particularly like?

331
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:10,957
They're all so beautiful.
How does one choose?

332
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,957
Would you like some advice?

333
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,797
Yes. How kind.

334
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,077
I want to know the
details of what I'm buying.

335
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:18,541
Of course.

336
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,837
Here you can see our diamond rings,

337
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,077
which we grade using the four cs

338
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,877
the carat, the clarity,
the colour and the cut.

339
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:30,637
Just there, you'll notice
what we call the scintillation.

340
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:33,637
- 'That's the sparkle a stone.
- Diamond, in this case

341
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,117
'emits when it's moved,

342
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:37,421
'and it's most visible in bright light.'

343
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,437
I've come about the job in the paper.

344
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,941
O levels? References?

345
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,837
No. But I'm keen.

346
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:53,381
Well, I don't need a Dolly bird.

347
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,437
I'm not. I know all about diamonds.

348
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,821
The four cs - the carat,
the clarity, colour, cut.

349
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,637
Tell me about the cut.

350
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:04,517
Well, the grade of the
cut is measured against

351
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,397
three different types of reflections.

352
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,237
Which are?

353
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:10,341
Brilliance, fire and scintillation.

354
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:14,101
Tell me about the scintillation.

355
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,157
Well, that's the sparkle a
diamond emits when it's moved.

356
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:20,957
That's most visible in bright light,

357
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,477
so that's why you have the contrast

358
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,581
of the bright lights on your cases.

359
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,757
Where did you learn that?

360
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,837
In books.

361
00:29:29,861 --> 00:29:31,701
I'm interested.

362
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,501
I'll give you a month's trial.

363
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,957
We do have a very, very special

364
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,317
emerald and diamond
necklace in our collection.

365
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:50,901
Mrs Asher.

366
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:54,197
How lovely to see you.

367
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,237
I do hope Joan is looking after you.

368
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,757
She's charming.

369
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:00,117
I'd love to see that special necklace.

370
00:30:00,141 --> 00:30:03,477
Well, miss foley can show
you our premier collection.

371
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,221
Joan, I think you're ready.

372
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,741
Miss foley sighs

373
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:15,157
there's the key.

374
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,237
Thank you.

375
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:19,861
Drawer unlocking.

376
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:27,317
Would you like to try it on?

377
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,077
I don't want to take all this fur off.

378
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:30,581
Let me see it on you.

379
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:52,517
Stunning. I'll take it.

380
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,101
Excellent.

381
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:56,981
This way, mrs Asher.

382
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:12,221
Joan, you can take it off now.

383
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:33,541
Door opens.

384
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:39,157
Gary, what are you doing here?

385
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,061
Looking good, joanie.

386
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:44,277
You can't be in here. No, it's all right.

387
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,397
Please. Outside.

388
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,837
Come on, joanie. Come on.

389
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:52,821
Joanie... go on, let me...
Get off me! I mean it.

390
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,357
Fuck off, you fucking psycho!

391
00:31:57,381 --> 00:32:00,117
Joan? Joan, what's going on?!

392
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,637
Get out of here, Gary.

393
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:03,237
You've always hated me, Nancy.

394
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:05,157
No, Gary! No, no, no!
I'm calling the police.

395
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:07,597
Come on, then! Gary! Gary, leave her!

396
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,877
Leave her alone.

397
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,221
Fuck off.

398
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:14,157
Go back up. I can handle this.

399
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,941
Are you sure? Go.

400
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:19,397
Girlfriend threw you out, did she?

401
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,637
Fuck off.

402
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:22,957
Get out. I want nothing
more to do with you.

403
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:24,197
What about Kelly?

404
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,077
You don't give a shit about Kelly.

405
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,597
I want to see Kelly!

406
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:30,461
No, you don't, Gary. Now fuck off!

407
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,021
He spits

408
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,781
be careful, Joan.

409
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,261
Door closes.

410
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,301
Packed you a bag.

411
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:54,757
Thanks, Nance.

412
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:58,677
Sorry for all of the, er... chaos.

413
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:01,437
I've packed undies,
pyjamas and some makeup.

414
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:05,037
You don't have to leave. Not like this.

415
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,757
You've put up with enough.

416
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,541
Sure you can afford to stay
in a hostel till you get paid?

417
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,581
I'll be fine.

418
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:18,821
Ok?

419
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:00,901
You're in early.

420
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,677
It's 8:15.

421
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:05,797
Told you to come in at midday.

422
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:07,357
We're doing the stock take tonight.

423
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,837
Forgot.

424
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,397
Well, I mean, I don't mind

425
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:13,501
working a couple of hours extra.

426
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:18,581
Look and learn, Linda. Look and learn.

427
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,277
Mr Jones, can I ask you something?

428
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,997
You can call me Bernard.

429
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:32,141
Is there any way that I could
get an advance on my wages?

430
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:36,317
Bernard. Bernard.

431
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:40,101
Have to see how we get on
at the stock take, won't we?

432
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,221
Night.

433
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:45,741
Door lock clicks.

434
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:52,301
Lock ourselves in, shall we?

435
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:57,197
Can be tricky, that.

436
00:34:57,221 --> 00:35:00,117
Here you are. Let me help you.

437
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:04,557
Lock clicks I thought
we'd start at the back...

438
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,501
With our loose stones.

439
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,141
I've already opened the safe.

440
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:14,581
Why don't we start in here
with the premier collection?

441
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,861
All right.

442
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:31,381
'Emerald and diamond earrings. 50,000.'

443
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:36,181
diamond fringe necklace.

444
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,221
60,000. That's it.

445
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,221
Sapphire and diamond earrings.

446
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,101
20

447
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,021
25,000.

448
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:11,661
Would you like to try it?

449
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:16,701
I think we should push on.

450
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,837
Somewhere to go?

451
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:22,317
No.

452
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:24,037
Boyfriend to see?

453
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,381
No.

454
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,061
There are no cameras out the back.

455
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:47,141
Let me freshen up.

456
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,701
She sighs

457
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:05,661
fuck's sake.

458
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:15,501
Water flushing.

459
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,237
Joan, what are you doing?

460
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,661
One minute.

461
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,917
The, er... The painters have arrived.

462
00:38:56,941 --> 00:38:58,917
Down below.

463
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:01,797
Sorry, Bernard. Not feeling great.

464
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:03,581
No. Well.

465
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:08,781
Maybe we can postpone
the stock take till next week.

466
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:13,461
I'll see you on Monday morning.

467
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:20,741
You take care of yourself.

468
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,837
Double vodka and orange, please.

469
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:43,341
Coming up.

470
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:00,461
1.40, please.

471
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,437
Sorry, mate, I'm gonna be short.

472
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:11,861
I'll get it.

473
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:15,101
Stick it on the tab. All right, sure.

474
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,677
I never accept drinks from strange men.

475
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:20,957
Strange?

476
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:23,061
Yeah, I'd say.

477
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:26,221
Thanks anyway.

478
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,541
You could always pay me back.

479
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:38,941
Just round the corner.

480
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,461
Bring you the 1.40 tomorrow.

481
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:46,077
Deal.

482
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:48,661
'Wicked game' by Chris isaak.

483
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:02,797
It's been a tough day.

484
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:04,781
Yeah? What do you do?

485
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,821
I'm a thief.

486
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,381
Fancy another?

487
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,021
"boisie."

488
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:04,261
Holy fuck.

489
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:45,781
'Take five' by Dave brubeck.

490
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:25,461
She gasps.

491
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,477
Yeah, it's walnut. Mid-19th century.

492
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:07,197
Yeah, escutcheons inlaid at
a later date, though, I'd say.

493
00:45:07,221 --> 00:45:08,917
It's in my warehouse,

494
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:11,357
so I'll bring it in if you let
me know when you're coming.

495
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:13,341
Thanks. Right, bye.

496
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:17,477
Morning. Hello.

497
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,917
How are you feeling?

498
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:21,621
Fine. Fresh as a Daisy.

499
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:24,501
Just making coffee.

500
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,637
So, where do you get it all from?

501
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:50,597
I've just been doing it for years, really.

502
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:52,197
I know people, people who know people.

503
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:53,717
Auctions, furniture sales.

504
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:55,541
Do you ever buy jewellery?

505
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,877
Stolen?

506
00:45:57,901 --> 00:45:59,717
Why would you say that?

507
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:02,381
You just walked out of
your job at a jeweller's.

508
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:06,877
Wild, crazy guess.

509
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:09,381
All right. What else did I say last night?

510
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:11,717
You're unemployed and homeless,

511
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:14,277
you've just lost your kid,
but you're gonna be rich.

512
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:16,021
Well, thanks for the coffee.

513
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,357
If I did have something to sell... What?

514
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:28,797
Some stones. Loose.

515
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:30,757
Well, I'd need to have a look first.

516
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,701
Why should I trust you?

517
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,101
Got any other options?

518
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:47,157
How'd you get 'em out?

519
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:50,517
Grabbed 'em from the
safe, necked 'em, walked.

520
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,477
You've got some balls, girl.

521
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,077
It was an impulse. I've
never nicked before.

522
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:56,357
I mean, nothing big.

523
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,797
Why now?

524
00:46:57,821 --> 00:47:00,037
Means to an end.

525
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:02,061
You enjoyed it, though.

526
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,821
Yeah.

527
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:07,957
So, can you sell 'em for me?

528
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:10,837
Might take a few weeks.

529
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,797
Why?

530
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:14,957
Well, gotta find you the right fence,

531
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:16,357
get you the best price.

532
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:19,277
Look, I told you, I've got nothing, right?

533
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:20,901
I need cash now.

534
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:23,101
So.

535
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:26,077
Would you do a bit more work, then,

536
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:28,101
get yourself back on your feet?

537
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:32,277
I mean a job for me.

538
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:34,157
Yeah, I know what you mean.

539
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,621
Proper job. Not necking
stuff and legging it.

540
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:39,701
Yeah, I'll do whatever you want.

541
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:43,101
I wouldn't promise that.

542
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,317
I'm a hard worker. That's what I mean.

543
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,517
Excellent.

544
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:50,677
Hair of the dog? Can you face it?

545
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,221
Course I can.

546
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:08,621
Think you and I are
gonna get along, Joan.

547
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,221
It's just work.

548
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,757
