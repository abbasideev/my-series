1
00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:01,957
There's nothing left.

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,797
You know, how'd they
even find the warehouse?

3
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,461
I don't know.

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:09,597
Just lay low.

5
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,557
So, what is it? Punishment for
bringing the pigs to their door?

6
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,021
'Or a warning.'

7
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,397
if you help them to land a bigger fish,

8
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:20,477
one of your associates...

9
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,637
Not a chance. Trying to rip off the ra?

10
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,981
You'd better be tougher than you look.

11
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:33,157
If I make a deal, the ira kill
me. If I don't, I get ten years.

12
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,637
We have to run. To Spain.

13
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,221
It won't be cheap. You got
the Irish in. You owe me.

14
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:45,397
Joan? I miss that smile.

15
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:49,277
Bernard's. I mean clear the place out.

16
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,957
Every single piece of
that premier collection.

17
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,477
Now, that would buy us a new life.

18
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,837
We go on our own, and
I'll come back for her. Ok.

19
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:00,917
'More cameras?'

20
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:04,581
and a panic button,
straight through to the police.

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,357
Access is through the alley here.

22
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:15,837
We'll need another man to watch him.

23
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:18,277
Are you in? I'll let you know.

24
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,037
'I need you to add Kelly to my
passport so I can take her with us.'

25
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,917
promise me you'll tell him.
Before the job. Promise.

26
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:27,197
'Hello, king's Morton.'

27
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,477
'hello, it's Simone highsmith

28
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,021
'from the New York herald.'

29
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,981
Door unlocks, footsteps

30
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,701
door closes

31
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,157
phone rings 'hello, king's Morton.'

32
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,197
hello, it's Simone highsmith

33
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,237
from the New York herald.

34
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:24,077
I'm just calling to confirm my
visit to the school tomorrow.

35
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,277
'Yes.

36
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,517
'The headmaster is asking
if you could bring it forward

37
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,837
'to three o'clock.' No, I can't.

38
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,157
I'm unavailable until
3:30. I'm sorry. 'Right.

39
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:33,757
'As long as you're aware that
the children will be outside then?'

40
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:38,677
great. As I told him, my article
is about British children at play.

41
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,277
'Ok, I'll let him know.'
Thank you so much.

42
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,677
See you tomorrow. 'Goodbye.'

43
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,301
bye.

44
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,781
Phone rings

45
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,157
'hello?'

46
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,717
albie, can you talk?
'Yeah, briefly. What is it?'

47
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,397
I need the bloody passport. Door unlocks

48
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:00,437
'midday, at the caf.' All
right, lunchtime. Got it.

49
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,557
- Albie, can you...?
- Joan?

50
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:03,661
'Joan?'

51
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,157
forgot my cigs. What did alb want?

52
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,237
Nothing, really.

53
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,221
I mean, just confirming
the meet with Paul.

54
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:22,901
It's gonna be ok.

55
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,757
What?

56
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:32,317
Nothing. I was just
gonna say... You love me?

57
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,237
You're finally gonna admit it?

58
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,461
No, not today!

59
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,621
- Morning.
- Morning.

60
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,661
Toilet flushes

61
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,221
morning. Morning.

62
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,541
Joan.

63
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:44,437
We're still on for the, er,
stock take tomorrow lunchtime?

64
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,781
Course.

65
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,861
Val. What can I do you for?

66
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:34,421
1920s cigarette case?
Absolute steal at £15.

67
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,477
My husband and your wife.

68
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,837
What about 'em?

69
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:43,541
They've been meeting up... "For work".

70
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:49,461
Well, Joan's in the
business. You know that, val.

71
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,221
So, do you want to buy something?

72
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,621
Door slams

73
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:04,181
no-one else. Scope it out Sunday week.

74
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,077
Haven't heard from me
unless there's a problem.

75
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,261
All right. No fuck-ups, please.

76
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,797
Albie.

77
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,237
Hello. How you doing?

78
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,997
Just hand it over.

79
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,997
Please.

80
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,317
Sorry, I'm stressed. Yeah,
well, doing a job on bail

81
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,957
I'm not going to prison.

82
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,757
I'm not losing Kelly. All right.

83
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,877
Anything I can do to help?

84
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:42,037
It's just the timings are
so tight. For getting Kelly.

85
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,877
I have to be at the
school tomorrow at 3:30

86
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,261
so she's outside playing, 3:40 latest.

87
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,117
Right, thanks.

88
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:53,957
Better go, or we'll be late for Paul.

89
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,341
You get there first. I'll
walk round the block.

90
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,781
So, boisie's cool about Kelly?

91
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:06,077
I'm telling him tonight. Jesus Christ.

92
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,357
Look, just... just, please,
don't screw this up...

93
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,397
Or he'll pull out the whole job.

94
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,461
You think I don't
fucking know that? Jesus.

95
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,781
Paul applauds bang on time. Yeah.

96
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,101
Right, is everyone clear on the plan?

97
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,877
Me and boisie break in, scare Bernard.

98
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,077
Paul stays with him while you
and me do the safe, clear the shop.

99
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,957
You work in total
silence. Fast as we can.

100
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,197
Slow and steady. No rush.

101
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,157
No, we need to be in and out,
Paul. I don't wanna fuck around.

102
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,781
I get it, Joan. No fucking around.

103
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,557
Look, I'll be in the alley.

104
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,557
Soon as we're loaded, we
head to wrentham street.

105
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:58,501
Where the getaway car will
be. We share out the gear, then...

106
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:10,797
Then you drive here. Directions.

107
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,397
Albie clears throat there's a caravan.

108
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:14,261
Bit basic, but it's out of the way.

109
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,117
Stay there till dawn,
then head to newhaven.

110
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:19,821
Why can't we get an earlier ferry?

111
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,021
We need to wait for
albie's man to be on shift.

112
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:31,597
So... one o'clock, I'll give albie the nod,

113
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,197
he drives round the back, two
of you break in straight away.

114
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,437
We wait till half past.

115
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,957
Five past.

116
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,677
What if he decides to serve another
customer? Go out for a sandwich?

117
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,957
He won't. We need
to build in some slack.

118
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,557
Look, I can control
Bernard, all right? Trust me.

119
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,997
He's got a point, Joan. It's
not worth cutting it too fine.

120
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:49,397
You want me to cuddle up
to Bernard for half an hour?

121
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,741
Does that not bother you, no?

122
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:55,757
Quarter past, then? Fuck's sake!

123
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:57,277
I know what I'm doing.

124
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,317
Look, I think we should
trust Joan on this.

125
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,917
Should we?

126
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,037
Yeah. It's her job.

127
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,341
Thanks, alb. Five past one.

128
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,877
If we're done?

129
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,221
Where the hell are you going? Work.

130
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,901
If that's ok with you?

131
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,701
Fuck's up with her?

132
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:56,901
Gun clicks.

133
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:09,781
Boisie?

134
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:12,341
I need to talk to you.

135
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,021
Boisie?

136
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,501
I was just about to tell you, I promise.

137
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,717
Before the heist or after?

138
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:35,061
No, that's... that's not fair.

139
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,861
Job's off.

140
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,277
Hey.

141
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,781
Leave me alone.

142
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,821
I mean, what was I
supposed to do, Boise?

143
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,317
If you really, really want something...

144
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,741
Why don't you get it?

145
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,221
It's not about what you want.

146
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:13,077
It's about Kelly, what's best for her.

147
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,597
Is it?

148
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,717
Or is it what's best for
boisie fucking hannington?

149
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,797
What?

150
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:25,197
Insecure, jealous...
Prefers paintings to people.

151
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:26,677
Doesn't trust a soul.

152
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:29,757
Convinced his own wife is up
to all sorts with his best mate!

153
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,477
Cos you were. No, no, no. No.

154
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,877
No, that's not what this is.

155
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,957
What is it, then? Tell me.

156
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,701
You just don't want her to come.

157
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,421
You'd rather I lost my daughter
than allow her into our life.

158
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,181
Are you crazy?

159
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,597
I'm coming back to get her.

160
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:57,557
I'm returning as a wanted
man, risking years inside,

161
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,581
and I'm doing that for you.

162
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,981
For you, Joan.

163
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,877
I can't, boisie. I can't... I
can't wait. She'll forget me.

164
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,477
No. I'll lose her. It's already started.

165
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:27,781
She's... she's happy there. She's settled.

166
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,901
She sits on that.

167
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:33,917
On that woman's lap.

168
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,517
Do you know how that feels?

169
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,237
It's like a... a blade to my fucking heart.

170
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:41,117
Joan, listen.

171
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:43,621
No, I won't. You know why? Cos.

172
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:51,381
All I want... is to be happy.

173
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,301
Is that so bad?

174
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,317
To want a family?

175
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,501
A home?

176
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:06,381
What I've never had, you've never had.

177
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,901
This is our chance, boisie.

178
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:23,301
Door opens, shuts.

179
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,141
Thought I'd find you here.

180
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,381
Your mum gave you up.

181
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:20,317
You must understand
why I can't do that to kel.

182
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:22,357
I can't.

183
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,901
I won't.

184
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:27,477
I'm her mother.

185
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,381
She needs to be with me.

186
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:37,381
When I was a kid, I
learnt not to need anyone.

187
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:39,861
Anything at all.

188
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,981
I just wanted to feel safe.

189
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,661
I know.

190
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,541
And I'm fine here.

191
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,301
Then stay.

192
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:07,141
Or... take a risk.

193
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:11,637
And if it doesn't work out, that's fine.

194
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:17,861
But don't spend the rest
of your life... wondering.

195
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,021
Boisie sighs.

196
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,901
Joan sniffles

197
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,757
you're crazy, do you know that?

198
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,701
She chuckles

199
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,061
yeah.

200
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:46,461
You're stuck with me now. She sniffles.

201
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,341
I love you.

202
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,701
I love you so much.

203
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,701
Joan laughs.

204
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:17,141
I'm heading off.

205
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,861
Joan.

206
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:23,221
I dunno, it doesn't feel right.

207
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,301
No, it'll be fine. I've worked it all out.

208
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:33,317
It's gonna be ok, Boise.

209
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:37,277
Five past one, you and
Paul storm the back door.

210
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:41,117
'Paul takes Bernard into the
back while we empty the safe.

211
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:43,917
'Once the safe's done, we move
to the shop and clear the cabinets.

212
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:47,237
'It's... it's a good plan, Boise.

213
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:48,621
'Foolproof.'

214
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,437
Penny for your thoughts?

215
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,797
She laughs worth more than that.

216
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:06,661
He chuckles.

217
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:22,141
I hate it when it's quiet. It's so boring.

218
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:28,397
Do you wanna hear my
theory about this place, Joan?

219
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,397
You listening, Joan? Yeah.

220
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,597
Mondays, the blokes come in

221
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:35,317
engagement rings if they've
popped the question on the weekend...

222
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,517
Phone rings ..Or little gifts for the missus

223
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,997
if they've had a row.

224
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,237
Tuesdays, dead as a doornail.

225
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,317
Bernard Jones, can I help you?
Joan? Wednesdays, people browsing.

226
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,877
Starts to pick up around
lunchtime. No, that won't be possible.

227
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,157
And Thursdays, normally busy.

228
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:51,501
Absolutely not. Goodbye.

229
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:56,261
That was for you. Urgent, apparently.

230
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,957
What? Who was it?

231
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,181
You know you're not
allowed personal calls.

232
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,917
Sorry.

233
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,837
But did he say who it was?

234
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,237
Wouldn't leave a name.

235
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:10,341
Said he needed to speak
to you about this afternoon.

236
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,317
If you've got other plans,

237
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:16,117
I can always ask Kirsty
to do the stock take.

238
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:18,781
No, no, no. I'd never let you down.

239
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:24,437
Then, er, maybe we should
just close up and push on with it?

240
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:25,821
No.

241
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,317
We might miss a sale.

242
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,357
True enough.

243
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,077
You haven't even had
your morning coffee.

244
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,837
Look, why don't the
two of you take a break,

245
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,997
and I'll, er, organise the stock?

246
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,661
Good idea.

247
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,181
Just the one sugar, Kirsty.

248
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,437
Can I bring you one, Joan?

249
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:08,901
No, thanks.

250
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:28,101
Well done.

251
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,501
Here's your sale, smarty-pants.

252
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,917
Hello, sir. How can I help you?

253
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,221
I saw a ring in that case.

254
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:55,357
So, Paul's decided he can't
trust you, just pulled out.

255
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:56,397
Fuck.

256
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,117
We'll have to stand down, set it up again.

257
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,237
No, we can't. I've already cut the wires.

258
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,437
Fucking hell.

259
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,157
Tell albie we need to find someone new.

260
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:04,677
In an hour? Who?

261
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:06,061
I don't care. Anyone.

262
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:10,197
Tell albie to offer a third of the take.

263
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,157
Christ.

264
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,557
I mean, he knows half of
London. He'll find someone.

265
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:17,021
And we leave that
someone alone with Bernard?

266
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:21,677
You take care of Bernard,
I'll work with the new guy.

267
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,917
Just find someone, anyone.

268
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,461
Everything ok over here?

269
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,197
Fine. You said you'd come back.

270
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:34,357
Eternity ring, married a
few months, madly in love.

271
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:35,821
Never forget a face.

272
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,957
Joan, you try it on for him.

273
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:40,541
Best way for the gentleman to decide.

274
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,957
I think you should go ahead, sir.

275
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:47,877
Yes, trust the lady.

276
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,237
It's a big decision.

277
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:52,557
You won't regret it, I promise.

278
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:54,997
Your wife... your wife will...

279
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:58,741
It's an eternity ring.
She'll love you forever.

280
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,221
Are you sure?

281
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:07,301
Ok, then. You talked me into it.

282
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:10,157
Excellent.

283
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,397
Final sale before the stock take, Joan.

284
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,941
Mark it down.

285
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,301
We're on.

286
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:05,621
Knocking.

287
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,277
I left my purse somewhere.
Do you really need it now?

288
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,621
What? I could lend you a tenner.

289
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,221
What did I do with it?

290
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,461
What did I do with it?

291
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,637
What am I like? Right, off you go.

292
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,501
Bye! Bye.

293
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,637
Shall we start with
the premier collection?

294
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,621
Why don't we just go
straight to the safe?

295
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:51,821
You go get the ledger. I'll open her up.

296
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:01,341
Three minutes.

297
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,101
Do you want me to open
the safe? Just a minute.

298
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,997
If you could pick any one

299
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,477
I can't afford diamonds, Bernard.

300
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:17,421
Present... from me.

301
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:24,981
I mean, I'd feel bad. Are you sure?

302
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,941
Choose one.

303
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,541
I know you want it, Joan.

304
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,181
Why don't I give you a back rub first?

305
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,397
Stick with her. Follow her orders.

306
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,981
Joan'll love that. You know her?

307
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,421
Yeah, I'm Kelly's dad.

308
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,981
Don't want any trouble,
just my share of the gear.

309
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,541
Go!

310
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,237
We're in. Go!

311
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:56,997
Joan screams you, out
the back. Go on! Move!

312
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:59,477
Don't hurt her, please. Open the safe.

313
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:02,157
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

314
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,141
Gary, what the fuck? Go on, then!

315
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:11,237
Sit down. Keep your gob shut.

316
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:14,597
Stop fucking about.
Open it. Get out of my face.

317
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,077
Calm down, joanie.

318
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,717
Go in the front. Start on the cabinets.

319
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,781
If you're sure, boss
quiet and fast as you can.

320
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:39,341
Shit. Fucking keys!

321
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,357
What the hell are you
doing? You said fast.

322
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,997
And quiet. Someone'll hear
us, if they haven't already.

323
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,917
Give me five minutes.
Grab as much as possible.

324
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,037
Stop. Stop! Is that an order, is it?

325
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,357
Stop! I said stop, you fucking idiot.

326
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,517
What do you fucking call
me? It ain't even loaded.

327
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,061
Isn't it?

328
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:29,581
Out my way. Through there. Now. Now!

329
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:35,141
Engine revs

330
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,917
get in the Van now. I'm getting my share.

331
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:40,317
You're getting fuck
all. You ain't in charge.

332
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:41,957
Get in the Van. Fuck off.

333
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,701
Tell him, Joan. You're in charge.

334
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:48,461
You fired a fucking gun!
Get in the fucking Van.

335
00:27:56,661 --> 00:28:00,101
No. N-No.

336
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,461
What the fuck?

337
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:14,661
No, don't!

338
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:32,381
Boisie grunts and
whimpers no. No, no, no.

339
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,461
Help me. Help me!

340
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,637
It's ok. I'm all right. I'm all right.

341
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,421
Tie, give me your tie. Joan...

342
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:57,421
What the fuck happened?
Boisie got himself shot.

343
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:00,141
Fucking drive.

344
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,501
Tyres screech

345
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:12,181
you fucking liar.

346
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:23,997
Ok.

347
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:25,741
Boisie grunts tight.

348
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:30,677
Tighter. I've cut the wires.

349
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,597
Let us get away, or I will fucking kill you.

350
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:37,357
Ok. Right. You need to lean on me, ok?

351
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:40,077
A few steps to the Van. Come on. I can't.

352
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:42,597
You have to. You have to, boisie.

353
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:44,421
Come on. Come on.

354
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,061
Joan groans

355
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:53,117
that's it. Come on. Use your good leg.

356
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,541
You're doing it, boisie.

357
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,317
Keep going. No, keep going.

358
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:03,341
No, no, you're not trying.
Try again. Try again.

359
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:09,357
Get Kelly. No. No, I'm
not leaving you. Stop.

360
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:11,021
Boisie!

361
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,237
Come on. Come on, get up. Please.

362
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,461
Please, try. Please, try. Please, try.

363
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,101
Try.

364
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:21,781
No. No.

365
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:29,157
You fucking bastards.

366
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:31,341
No! Come on.

367
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,141
Hey. Hey.

368
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,477
I'm right here. You're not going.

369
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:43,341
No, you're not going.
Hey. I'm right here, hey.

370
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,261
Boisie. Boisie.

371
00:30:54,701 --> 00:31:00,317
Boisie. Boise, you wake up. Boisie, no...

372
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:06,581
No. She sobs boisie! Boisie!

373
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:13,421
Joan sobs

374
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:20,501
police sirens wail.

375
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:49,301
Joan sobs.

376
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:37,581
You're fine. You're fine. You're fine.

377
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:40,397
Welcome. I'm Walter
Roberts, the headmaster here.

378
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:43,117
Simone highsmith, New York herald.

379
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:45,797
Sorry, it's warm in here.

380
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:47,957
Thank you for agreeing to the article.

381
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:50,677
Of course. It's a
subject close to my heart.

382
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,077
Here at king's Morton,

383
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:54,877
we value play just as much
as time spent in the classroom.

384
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,477
That's great.

385
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,557
I-I actually heard the kids on the way in.

386
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,917
Is it afternoon play now?

387
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:03,397
For another few minutes.

388
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,901
We might just be able to catch them.

389
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:15,477
Hopscotch. It's a
traditional English game.

390
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,901
Do you know it? Miss highsmith?

391
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:24,341
Sure, yes, it's popular. May I? Of course.

392
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,157
Now, girls, we have a visitor
all the way from america.

393
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:32,077
- Say hello.
- Hello.

394
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:35,397
Come on girls, speak up. Hello.

395
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:39,677
Maybe some of the older
girls might be less shy?

396
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,917
Good idea. I'll find you a couple to talk to.

397
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:43,101
Thank you.

398
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:54,621
What's your name? What do you mean?

399
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:57,221
Come on.

400
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:02,901
Listen carefully, kel. Don't
go back to your lessons.

401
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,357
Why is your hair like that, mummy?

402
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:09,781
Don't worry. It's still me. It's ok.

403
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,277
Listen very carefully.

404
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,517
I need you to meet me by the gate, ok?

405
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,621
I'll explain to you when
I see you, all right?

406
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,117
Here we are. This is poppy. This is Olivia.

407
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,717
Poppy, Olivia, I'm Simone.

408
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:26,181
Nice to meet you.

409
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:42,541
Ok, sweetheart?

410
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:49,221
Shall we have some music? Yeah?

411
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:53,501
Radio crackles

412
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:13,501
come on, kel, sing along!

413
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:41,821
Dial tone rings

414
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,597
'hello. Alb, is that you?'

415
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,117
it's Joan. Where is he?

416
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:50,037
You tell me.

417
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:52,437
I've just got in and found a
note saying, "I've gone abroad."

418
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,277
"Don't expect to hear
from me for a while."

419
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,877
'What the fuck is going on, Joan?'

420
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:59,037
if he does call, will you
give him a message?

421
00:36:59,061 --> 00:37:02,517
'Tell him I'm looking for him.' Joan.

422
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,781
'Joan.'

423
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,021
I'm gonna fucking destroy him.

424
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,501
It smells funny.

425
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,301
We're only gonna be here till tomorrow.

426
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,797
And then we're gonna get on a boat,

427
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:50,717
and we're gonna drive
all the way to the sunshine.

428
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:53,021
Is boisie coming with us?

429
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,621
Why?

430
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:07,077
Kelly, I need you to be a good girl.

431
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,517
Just do what I tell you, ok?

432
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,117
Not asking me any questions. Is that ok?

433
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,261
Shall I find you a colouring book
so you can do some drawing?

434
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:39,381
'Boisie! Boisie!'

435
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:43,821
mummy?

436
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,621
Mummy, I've finished.

437
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:58,701
Kel, it's brilliant. That's me.

438
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,821
And is that peanuts? Yes.

439
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:07,861
And, look, there's me next to you. No.

440
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:12,341
That's mama sue, my other mummy.

441
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,981
Joan sobs

442
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:25,541
mummy, stop it. Stop crying.

443
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:29,477
Look, why don't you go and
take your lipstick off, yeah?

444
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:33,821
There's tissues in my bag
inside. And take off that silly wig.

445
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,101
Go on.

446
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:50,941
Joan sobs.

447
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:10,621
'It's already started.
She's... she's happy there.'

448
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:13,717
'it's like a...' No.

449
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:17,157
'A blade to my fucking heart.'

450
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:19,221
she sniffs and sobs.

451
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:53,661
Mummy! Mummy! Joan gasps

452
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,701
god. God. I'm sorry.

453
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:05,581
I'm sorry, kel. I'm so
sorry. What have I done?

454
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:11,077
It's all right. I'm scared, mummy.

455
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:14,021
I'm here. It's all right, kel. She sighs.

456
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,421
I'm so sorry.

457
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,621
I want to go home.

458
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:48,941
I need to keep you safe.

459
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:57,021
So you're gonna go and...
And stay with mama sue now.

460
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:01,901
I've got to go away.

461
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:05,861
I'm so sorry.

462
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,661
I love you so much, kel.

463
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,621
Never, ever forget that.

464
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:15,141
Bye, Kelly. Bye, mummy.

465
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,661
Bye.

466
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:58,117
'All I wanted was my own family.'

467
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,221
now without Kelly, boisie...

468
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:05,021
There's no point.

469
00:46:21,021 --> 00:46:24,677
So, how'd you get out
so soon? You know me.

470
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:26,141
Good behaviour.

471
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,101
You got my money?

472
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:46,581
Yeah.

473
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:51,077
You can put your feet up
now. Going back to work.

474
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:54,021
Necking stones, snatching rings?

475
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,861
No. No more little cons.

476
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,941
I'm gonna build myself a bloody empire.

477
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:08,901
So, you, er, wanna talk business? Pfft.

478
00:47:11,181 --> 00:47:13,517
You think I'd work with you again?

479
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,621
You left us in a fucking alley.

480
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:20,861
I'm done with men.

481
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:25,861
Just go. Fuck off.

482
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,101
Be careful... Joan.

483
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:45,141
And you. Watch your fucking back.

484
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,021
