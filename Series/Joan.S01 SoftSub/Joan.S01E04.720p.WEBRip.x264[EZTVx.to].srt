1
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:02,077
What's the set-up?

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,157
It's perfect. House is
miles from anywhere.

3
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:07,221
'It's definitely a real stubbs?'
'Yeah. Worth thousands.'

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,157
she screams out of my way!

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,821
Glass smashes move,
or I'll blow your brains out!

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,597
'You've gotta let me in, boisie.

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,757
'Men have been pushing
me around my whole life.'

8
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,957
I won't have it any more.

9
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:31,917
I'm still... waiting for a
visit from the social worker.

10
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,821
'I'm desperate to get my little girl back.'

11
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,861
what do you want, Joan? A normal life.

12
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:45,301
Can you act? With you on
my arm, anything's possible.

13
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,717
I want an 18-carat four-claw
mount with the fake set in.

14
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,517
You love all this, don't you?

15
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,861
Dressing up... pretending.

16
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:02,197
'I can't get that cute
little ring out of my mind.'

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,637
it's an exceptional piece.

18
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,261
Thought you really were a
green-eyed monster for a minute.

19
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,597
You like him, though?

20
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,141
Yeah, I do. I think he's great.

21
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,421
Marry me?

22
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,157
Yeah. Yes!

23
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,581
Yes. Crack the champers!

24
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:37,677
I've got something I need to tell you.

25
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,317
What?

26
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:42,277
The ashburys have asked
us if they can adopt Kelly.

27
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,197
It's just a request at the moment.

28
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,477
You're her mother,

29
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:48,317
and no-one's doing
anything without due process.

30
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,117
We do always try to keep
children with their mothers.

31
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,197
It's really important that Kelly

32
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,677
moves back into a
settled, stable environment.

33
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,141
And right now, we're not
convinced you can provide that.

34
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,141
Come on, then, let's
get you that sparkler.

35
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,461
Morning.

36
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,501
There we are. Perfect engagement ring.

37
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:50,141
Nice. It's gorgeous.

38
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,741
I love it.

39
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,301
Do you think Kelly will like it?

40
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,437
I can't believe she's gonna
be here in a couple of hours.

41
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,397
I can't believe I handed
over good money for it.

42
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:13,357
I'm not nicking my own
engagement ring, am I?

43
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,741
Forty grand, Joan?

44
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:19,277
It's bad luck to start
marriage with stolen goods.

45
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,877
But it's all right if the cash
came from the 65 grand we got

46
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,757
from selling a ring you did half-inch?

47
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,277
Yeah?

48
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,077
Are you saying I'm not worth it?

49
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:31,061
Cos we both know I am.

50
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,117
Love that.

51
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,461
All right, boisie?

52
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:56,117
What can I do you for?

53
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,277
Ds Harris.

54
00:03:57,301 --> 00:04:01,397
You heard anything about
an art theft in Sussex?

55
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,357
Not a word.

56
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:06,637
A George stubbs got nicked,
and a gun was involved.

57
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:09,501
Yeah? You won't mind if we look inside?

58
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,637
Don't suppose you've
heard any... Whispers?

59
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:34,021
Me? Why would I?

60
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,077
They must know something,
boisie. That's just what they do.

61
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,397
They check all the
antique shops in the area.

62
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:46,917
Yeah, but how long are they gonna take?

63
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,917
I mean, what if Kelly
comes back early...? Stop.

64
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,301
It's going to be fine.

65
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,061
Don't let the door hit
your arse on the way out.

66
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:12,037
We've gotta get rid of that painting.

67
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,877
I'm working on it. Never
mind "working on it".

68
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,421
We can't sell it now, can
we? Just Chuck it in the river.

69
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:22,757
I can't fight Kelly's adoption
with the police sniffing around.

70
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,717
They didn't find anything.
Yeah, but if they do,

71
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,717
it's a direct link between
us and the robbery.

72
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,477
Can you calm down? We
carry on as normal, it'll blow over.

73
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:33,517
Are you fucking serious?
What do you suggest, Joan?

74
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,317
We go straight.

75
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,357
What?

76
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:39,341
We run this place
completely legit from now on.

77
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:43,677
There ain't an antiques shop in
the world that's completely legit.

78
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,397
Yes, but we need the social
to think we're a normal couple.

79
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,237
We're not, though, are
we? I mean it, boisie.

80
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:53,957
So, no more diamonds, no more furs?

81
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,301
And what will you do all
day? I'll work in the shop.

82
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,021
Door bell rings

83
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:16,597
put that out. They'll give her the
third degree when she gets back.

84
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,397
She's a kid.

85
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, she ain't stupid, I'm telling you now.

86
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,237
Hello!

87
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,997
Hi, kel. Come in, come in.

88
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,021
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

89
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,957
When did you get that big?

90
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,637
You must be boisie. Mrs may.

91
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,717
And you must be Kelly.

92
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,957
Kels, this is boisie.

93
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,837
Boisie, this is the most
beautiful girl in all the world.

94
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:49,797
Right, I'll be back later
to get you for your tea.

95
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,637
Don't worry, I've got loads in for her.

96
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,397
Burgers. Hot dogs.

97
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,677
You still like hot dogs,
don't you? Course she does.

98
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,197
Who doesn't like hot dogs?

99
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,077
Chuckles bye-bye, Kelly.

100
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,517
Bye. Thank you. Let
me get the door for you.

101
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,301
Thank you. Oops. Ha.

102
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,861
Right.

103
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,917
So, today, we are gonna
go and see auntie Nancy,

104
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:17,357
and she has a big treat for you!

105
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:20,077
'Love action' by the human league

106
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:24,837
and spin! Whoo! Go, Kelly!

107
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,637
Whee-hee!

108
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:48,277
Kel. Kelly, say cheese.

109
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,221
Cheese. Yay!

110
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:59,397
Kelly! Grab anything you fancy.

111
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,637
Stop fussing.

112
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,997
Sighs I need this to go well.

113
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:05,701
It is going well.

114
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,677
I want her back, boisie.

115
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,677
We have to go straight.

116
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,317
It's not that simple.

117
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,437
Yes, it is. I have to do this for her.

118
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,677
You understand that, right? Yeah. I get it.

119
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,901
So you'll get rid of that
painting, then, yeah?

120
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:25,621
I got the chocolate one! Look. Aw.

121
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:29,541
My goodness.

122
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,261
Do you know what this means?

123
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:46,837
That mummy likes diamonds?

124
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,021
They chuckle clever girl.

125
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:55,421
But it also means I've asked
your mum if she'll marry me.

126
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,357
And then you'll come and live with us,

127
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:05,477
and we'll be a proper family again.

128
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,077
A fresh start.

129
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:09,997
Am I coming to the wedding?

130
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,957
Of course.

131
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,837
You'll be my chief bridesmaid, obviously.

132
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:18,621
You and aunty Nancy. You'll
have pretty frocks, flowers.

133
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,077
Will I get flowers in my hair?

134
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:25,077
Well, I mean, you can't be a bridesmaid

135
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:28,917
without bloody flowers
in your hair, can you?

136
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:30,421
Chuckles.

137
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,357
Well, look

138
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:42,157
I might be able to put a bit
more cash in your direction,

139
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,477
if you're interested?

140
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,037
I need a buyer for something.

141
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,837
Sharpish. All right.

142
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,621
What we talking
about? A stubbs painting.

143
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:52,877
You nicked that?

144
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:54,981
Yeah, me and Joan.

145
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,997
They chuckle

146
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:03,917
police are asking a
lot of questions about it.

147
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,357
Why I need a buyer.

148
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:09,237
None of the usual suspects are
gonna touch anything that hot.

149
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:13,261
Can you think of any unusual suspects?

150
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,997
Maybe. Yeah?

151
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,181
For

152
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,197
25%. 25?!

153
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:29,277
Risky. Do me a favour.

154
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:32,797
Risky, risky, risky this
one, Boise. Very risky.

155
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,837
All right, all right, save the spiel, mate,

156
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:37,421
I know you're broke.
Who've you got in mind?

157
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,381
Albie clears throat darling?

158
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,181
The Irish.

159
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:50,901
Ira?

160
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:55,757
They've always got money to spend.

161
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,397
What are a bunch of terrorists gonna do

162
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,117
with a painting of a fucking
horse? Hang it on their wall?

163
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:02,197
They always need to buy
things from abroad, right?

164
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,781
Yeah, guns and explosives.

165
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:10,397
Look, they have trouble
moving money overseas.

166
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,221
But... but art, it's a different kettle of fish.

167
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,381
You think we can trust people like that?

168
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,517
I think that we can trust the fact

169
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,397
that they always need things to shift.

170
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,101
And a stubbs is perfect.

171
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:38,981
So, is it yes, or no?

172
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:54,621
Baby crying.

173
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,397
What are you doing?

174
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,637
Needs restoration, but before that,

175
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,941
there can't be a grain
of dirt, or it'll get trapped.

176
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,021
Why don't you clean the tea
sets? There are some special cloths.

177
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:20,437
Yeah.

178
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,421
Working in the shop
was your idea, remember?

179
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,141
Yeah, to make sure I get Kelly back.

180
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:38,037
You know what we should do?

181
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,477
I'm all ears.

182
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,981
We should turn this
place into a jewellers.

183
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,317
It's not enough to like
sparklers to run a jewellers, Joan.

184
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,877
You have to know about 'em.

185
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,397
And not just that stuff
you learned to parrot.

186
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,981
Proper deep knowledge. Fine, I'll learn.

187
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:01,541
How you gonna do that, then?

188
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,397
I want to be fully qualified.

189
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,277
Then you'll have to do
the foundation course

190
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,117
which is £2,250.

191
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,797
Do you take cash?

192
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,997
Ready for the big day tomorrow, boisie?

193
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,677
Yeah, Joan's got it all under control.

194
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,317
Nice place you've got here.
Albie's mate's letting us use it.

195
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:22,677
Till I get myself sorted.

196
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,997
Won't be long. Fingers crossed.

197
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,117
Give us a shout if
you want anything else.

198
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,941
Thanks, val.

199
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,157
Can't believe you spent
five grand on a wedding ring.

200
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,437
And 40 on an engagement ring.

201
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,237
You're going soft, Boise.

202
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,237
Exhales heavily

203
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,877
yeah, I couldn't Nick 'em -
Joan wants us to go straight.

204
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:46,157
What women want and what
they get are two different things.

205
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,717
I've been telling val I'm
going straight for years.

206
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:51,901
Scoffs Joan's different, though.

207
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,861
Too right.

208
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,117
Well, here's a day I thought I'd never see

209
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,917
you getting married.

210
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,237
Yeah, and to someone you actually like.

211
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,461
Chuckles.

212
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,157
What?

213
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,117
It's just a bit quick.

214
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,677
Do you know him well enough?

215
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,197
I do, yeah.

216
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:20,501
We can say anything to one
another. There's no... secrets.

217
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,381
So, you're gonna sell
the stubbs to the Irish?

218
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,341
Yeah.

219
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:32,397
Well, you'll need someone
to say it's not a fake.

220
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,557
And it's gotta be an
expert. They're no mugs.

221
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:39,917
Mas cervezas? Albie
chuckles thanks, val.

222
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,357
These ones done? Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,821
Nice one, babe.

224
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,277
I was thinking Hugo at abney's.

225
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:53,477
He's the one that gave me
the tip-off in the first place.

226
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,757
Trust him?

227
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,101
Enough.

228
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,261
'I've got a little something for you.'

229
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,997
Are they real? Course
they're bloody real.

230
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,941
Got Kelly a necklace, as well.

231
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,557
I wish she was here.

232
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,277
You'd think the social
would let her stay the night.

233
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,557
It's not allowed,

234
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:35,181
while they're still talking
about... Bloody adoption.

235
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,037
Can you imagine what
mum and dad would say?

236
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,797
Don't start.

237
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,357
I just wish you'd invited them,

238
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,397
so they could see how
well you're doing, and Kelly.

239
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,797
No, that man is not coming
within a mile of my daughter.

240
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,317
He's too ill to hurt a fly these days.

241
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,581
It's never gonna happen.

242
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,221
Chinks glass

243
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:09,157
may I present my beautiful, talented wife.

244
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:11,397
Let's hear it for mrs hannington.

245
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:15,541
Applause, whooping
you're not so bad yourself.

246
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:21,477
Just don't expect me
to honour and obey, ok?

247
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:25,357
Laughter er, speech, Boise, speech!

248
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:29,517
All clamour come on.

249
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,477
You know, I'm a man of few words.

250
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:33,597
Only when it comes to the old bill, boisie.

251
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:34,797
Laughter

252
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:37,957
only words he knows down
the Nick are "no" and "comment".

253
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:40,117
So I'll keep it brief. Thank god for that.

254
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:42,757
If you'll let me get a word in...

255
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:45,357
All I want to say is

256
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,757
I'm very grateful to you all for coming

257
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,101
and helping us celebrate today.

258
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,941
I can honestly say I
have never been happier.

259
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,181
So, here's to you.

260
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:03,797
To boisie and Joan.

261
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:05,477
Boisie and Joan.

262
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:11,261
Applause I love you. I love you.

263
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,141
'I'm so excited' by the pointer sisters.

264
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,901
Laughter

265
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,021
are you all right?

266
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,717
Lots of noise and
people you don't know?

267
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:14,277
Joan!

268
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,237
Come on! Come and dance with us.

269
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,341
Not gonna leave her on her own, am I?

270
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,437
Which one's your favourite?
Tell me he hasn't got the hump

271
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,317
cos you've gotta look
after your own daughter?

272
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,357
Mind your own.

273
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,837
Keep your hair on.

274
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:30,637
How about you keep your nose out?

275
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,077
First off, you're telling me I
don't know him well enough...

276
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,661
And do you?

277
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,501
What was all that crap about
the police and "no comment"?

278
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,957
If you're not banging on about boisie,

279
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:44,157
you are on one about dad.

280
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:46,877
He'd be proud of you now. Proud?

281
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:48,917
You know as well as I
do that if he were here,

282
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,437
he'd be finding fault in everything,

283
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,397
just like he's done
since the day I was born.

284
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:55,237
You were the apple of his
eye. Yeah, till I turned 12.

285
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:57,357
Joan, you were a tearaway,
he was old-fashioned.

286
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,797
He didn't know how to handle you.

287
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,861
I wasn't a tearaway, I was a
runaway, and you know why.

288
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,157
Why do you pretend like you
don't know what he did to me?

289
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,917
I've still got the scars to prove it.

290
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,797
Not in front of Kelly. No, she's
gonna grow up understanding

291
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,677
that it's not all right for a
man to behave like he did.

292
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,237
And it's not all right for other people

293
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:17,277
to make out like it didn't happen.

294
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:19,581
You and mum are as bad
as each other, you know that?

295
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:23,797
So, you'll dance with
albie but not your husband?

296
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,677
Kelly needs her. You can see that.

297
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,717
How about you take Kelly
back to the ashburys'?

298
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,197
They're staying nearby.

299
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,437
You don't wanna go yet, do you?

300
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,581
I'm tired.

301
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,357
'Ere you are, ten minutes
in a taxi. No, I want kel here.

302
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:41,197
Yeah, but she doesn't
wanna be here, does she?

303
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,901
Nancy?

304
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,301
Give your mum a kiss, kel.

305
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,957
You all right?

306
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:57,061
Yeah? Good girl.

307
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,821
Come with auntie Nancy.

308
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:04,941
She'll be all right. Come on.

309
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,301
Cheering.

310
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:30,157
Judging the value of a gem
stone is complex, of course,

311
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,597
and much depends on the type of stone,

312
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:37,077
but the number one factor
will always be durability.

313
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,597
No matter how beautiful a stone looks,

314
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:43,277
the most important characteristic
is how long it will endure.

315
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:45,661
And do we know which
stones are the most durable?

316
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:49,397
Diamonds. Actually, no.

317
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,701
Anyone else?

318
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,181
At the back.

319
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,277
Jade?

320
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,757
Correct.

321
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:02,077
Could you tell us why?

322
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,437
Well, diamonds are the hardest stones,

323
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:05,917
but they have perfect cleavage,

324
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:09,477
so they can split in two
more easily than Jade.

325
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,917
You'd say, then, that we should
look to avoid cleavage in a diamond?

326
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,597
I wouldn't go that far. Laughter

327
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:21,637
so, if we're prepared to excuse
cleavage in our diamonds,

328
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,677
how do we value them?

329
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,397
The first question we
must always ask ourselves

330
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:29,301
is are these diamonds real?

331
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,917
And if we're talking about uncut stones,

332
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:36,677
we're going to answer that by
checking for any tiny inclusions,

333
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,317
or, in layman's terms, flaws.

334
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:43,461
Because a flawless
uncut diamond is a fake.

335
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,757
All you've got to do is tell them

336
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:52,277
the painting's genuine, which it is.

337
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,517
I can't.

338
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,957
You've done it loads
of times before for me.

339
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,061
Not this one.

340
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,797
You'll get your usual fee, plus 10%.

341
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,437
I value my kneecaps more, boisie.

342
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:07,301
So, you don't want that
grand for the initial tip-off, then?

343
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,877
You're getting nothing if I can't sell it.

344
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,077
I know you need that cash.

345
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,861
Just find someone else,
boisie, for god's sake.

346
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:19,517
For one thing, I'd never
pull it off. Look at me.

347
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,957
Hugo inhales I'll screw it up.

348
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,397
They'll see I'm a wreck,
and they won't believe me.

349
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,061
Ok.

350
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,397
If I find someone else,

351
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,277
then you need to get
them plotted in here.

352
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,397
The Irish will want to
know they're kosher.

353
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,677
And what will I tell my boss?

354
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:40,037
Say... I dunno, they're here to train.

355
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,437
Hugo, you can say
anything you like, I don't care.

356
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,901
If you want that grand,
this is what's happening.

357
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,597
And I need you to tell 'em
everything there is to know

358
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,917
about George fucking stubbs.

359
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,837
Well, they'll need to be
word-bloody-perfect. Listen...

360
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,101
There is no way this
is coming back on me.

361
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,981
'This is the one I'm not sure is genuine.'

362
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:09,421
I think I can see the smallest flaw, but...

363
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,437
Some inclusions are
extremely hard to detect

364
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:15,917
with magnification alone,

365
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,597
so checking for
fluorescents with a uv torch

366
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:21,861
can be very helpful.

367
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,541
Have another look.

368
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,957
Do you see an inclusion?

369
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,637
I can, yeah.

370
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,421
That means?

371
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:49,101
It's real.

372
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,461
He exhales.

373
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,581
You gonna tell me what's up?

374
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,741
I've found a buyer for the stubbs.

375
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,117
We agreed that you'd
Chuck it in the river.

376
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,197
No, we didn't. Yes, we did.

377
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,197
Cos I'm only trying to
get my daughter back,

378
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:42,437
and you stood there, and you
told me that you understood that.

379
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:43,597
I do understand.

380
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:46,797
Yeah, provided you can still do
whatever you want, when you want.

381
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,421
A work of art is not going in the river.

382
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:52,957
I just need someone to
say they're from abney's

383
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,037
and sign it off as legit.

384
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:56,341
I'd ask you to do it, but...

385
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:01,541
You don't care, do you?

386
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,061
You don't care if I get her back or not.

387
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,541
Well, married life is suiting you.

388
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,837
How do you know I'm married?

389
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:46,157
It's my job to know what you're up to...

390
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,181
What you're thinking.

391
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,541
Well, go on, then, clever clogs.

392
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:55,357
You hungry?

393
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,877
Hungry for what?

394
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,197
Change.

395
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:00,421
Excitement.

396
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,981
'I know what you really want, Joan.'

397
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:07,957
to have Kelly back with you.

398
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:10,197
And I would love for that to happen.

399
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:13,021
The thing is, I don't think it can.

400
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:16,341
Not now.

401
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,821
What's this?

402
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:27,541
That robbery in Sussex.

403
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,557
Don't know what you're
on about. Yes, you do.

404
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:32,381
Harris and his boys searched the shop.

405
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:35,221
That's the woman involved.

406
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,917
Harris has met you.

407
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,357
If he sees this, he's gonna
know straightaway that it's you,

408
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,221
and he'll Nick you for
aggravated burglary.

409
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,477
You're looking at years
for that, not months.

410
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,461
It doesn't look anything like me.

411
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,181
The thing is, I can make
sure that doesn't happen.

412
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,397
Why would you do that?

413
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:02,157
I mean, you don't wear a
uniform, but you've still got a badge.

414
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:05,077
All you've got to do is work for me.

415
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,517
You be my eyes and ears,

416
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,997
and I'll do a deal, get
the other thing gone.

417
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,757
Think about it, Joan.

418
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,717
You could have a
completely different life.

419
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:18,237
You're safe, with Kelly.

420
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,317
I'm not a grass, Tom.

421
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,221
Anyway, I've got nothing to tell you.

422
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,941
Car pulling up

423
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,701
thanks, I'll keep it.

424
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,021
Here you go, mate.

425
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:00,997
What's with the old bill?

426
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,061
Don't know what you're on about.

427
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,597
That bloke I've just seen you with.

428
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:10,701
Well, who says he's old bill? We
both know bacon when we smell it.

429
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:17,397
If you must know... He
wanted to show me this.

430
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:22,437
Apparently, she was involved in
nicking a painting by George stubbs.

431
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,757
A burglary, Boise.

432
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,397
A burglary where a bloke
got clocked with a gun.

433
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:28,837
According to who?

434
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,957
The woman who owns
the house and the painting.

435
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:32,757
What about the fella? He say anything?

436
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:34,797
No, don't worry, all he can remember

437
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,557
is that whoever hit him
was wearing a mask,

438
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,717
so you are in the clear.

439
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,917
It's just me facing time.

440
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:43,517
With one witness, who
drinks like George best?

441
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:47,141
That'll never stick. It will
if they find the painting.

442
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,221
She sighs.

443
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,141
She coughs lightly.

444
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,941
Door closes.

445
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,781
Tyres screech.

446
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,677
Oi! Don't.

447
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:12,261
I'm not going down and losing
my girl over a few quid, boisie.

448
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,301
It's not about the money.

449
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,141
It's about who the buyer is.

450
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:26,141
I'm selling it to the Irish.

451
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:32,197
You've organised a
sale with the ir-fucking-a,

452
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,477
and you didn't tell me?

453
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,637
I know, I know. It was the
only fucking option, so

454
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,717
I just want Kelly back.
This won't affect that.

455
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:40,077
Are you mad?

456
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:42,437
Tell them it can't be done,
tell them the deal's off.

457
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:45,741
I can't do that with the ira.
Are you trying to get me killed?

458
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,621
We said we were going straight.

459
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,261
That life's not for the likes of us, Joan.

460
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,661
I need you, Joan.

461
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:34,581
I have since the second
I laid eyes on you.

462
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,981
If I do this.

463
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:49,221
It's because we have no fucking choice.

464
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:25,917
Can I help you?

465
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:27,917
Jessica Cunningham
to see Hugo saxton.

466
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,141
Of course. Thank you.

467
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,117
Right, tell me about this.

468
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,357
One of a set of three paintings

469
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:45,077
commissioned in 1759 by
the second Duke of Richmond...

470
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:47,757
The third Duke of Richmond. Jesus!

471
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:49,837
We've only just been through this.

472
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:52,437
You do realise how
dangerous these people are?

473
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,077
Of course, I know.

474
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,581
You cannot mess up.

475
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,157
One of a set of three paintings

476
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,517
commissioned in 1759 by
the third Duke of Richmond,

477
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,117
who was so pleased with the results

478
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:09,357
that he encouraged his
fellow Dukes and lords

479
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:10,941
to follow his lead. Telephone rings.

480
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,597
Hugo saxton.

481
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,837
'Can I speak to Jessica
Cunningham, please?'

482
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,621
yes, she's here with me
now. One moment, please.

483
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,701
Jessica Cunningham
speaking. How can I help you?

484
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:35,181
Click, disconnect tone.

485
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,621
Right. He clears his throat

486
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:49,077
you'll need to inspect
every inch very carefully.

487
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:50,797
And you'll need to check the signature

488
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,101
against photographs of other examples.

489
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,117
'As for the brush strokes,

490
00:33:56,141 --> 00:33:58,717
'you're assuring yourself
that these are in keeping

491
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:01,877
'with the artist's entire body of work.

492
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:04,997
'Be confident, self-assured.

493
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:08,021
'Most of all, do not hesitate.'

494
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:13,821
good afternoon, everyone.

495
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,341
Jessica Cunningham.

496
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:28,221
Sean. This is Michael.

497
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:31,477
You work at abney's?

498
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,941
I'm sure you've checked,
or I wouldn't be here.

499
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,181
So, how are we gonna do this?

500
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:39,917
It's not my business,

501
00:34:39,941 --> 00:34:42,237
but I do need a quiet
space to assess the piece.

502
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:43,597
Right, well...

503
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:45,397
Clears throat ..I've got an hotel room.

504
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,277
Not a fucking chance
we're all in the same room

505
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,061
with both the painting and the money.

506
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:51,621
Because?

507
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,741
Plausible deniability, sweetheart.

508
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,837
Right, you come to the hotel
with me and do your thing.

509
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,357
You, stay here with Michael. Hang on.

510
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:07,957
When, er... Sorry,
what's your name again?

511
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,381
Jessica.

512
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:13,037
When Jessica confirms she's
happy with what she sees,

513
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,261
I call Michael, he'll give you the cash.

514
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,117
I'm not just going to
hand over the painting...

515
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:21,461
We do things our way or not at all.

516
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,781
I'm sure albie'll be
around to keep an eye out.

517
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:35,181
It's all right. Let's just do what he says.

518
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,381
Lift bell dings.

519
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:29,901
Drink?

520
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,381
No, thank you.

521
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,221
You're tense.

522
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,741
You're armed.

523
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,061
Right, then, shall we take a look?

524
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:11,277
There's a lot of copies around.

525
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:13,261
It's a very popular artist.

526
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,317
Big exhibition at the Tate last year.

527
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:18,917
I wonder how many of them were fake.

528
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:21,181
Each painting will have
been authenticated.

529
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:25,877
By someone like you? Yes.

530
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:27,757
You're not exactly
honest, miss Cunningham,

531
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:29,261
or you wouldn't be here.

532
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:36,797
My reputation relies on
my opinions being honest.

533
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,437
If they could be bought,

534
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:40,501
they wouldn't be worth
much, would they?

535
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:45,981
What's your opinion on this?

536
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,101
Patience, please.

537
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:57,221
Interesting.

538
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:05,261
It hasn't been relined.

539
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,597
And?

540
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,237
And it's highly unusual.

541
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:14,597
To find a piece in its
original condition, like this,

542
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:16,861
is... rare.

543
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,261
Let's see.

544
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:29,301
Candle wax.

545
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:34,637
The thing about fakes, good fakes,

546
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,301
is that they're completely perfect.

547
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,541
Every stroke utterly perfect.

548
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:43,261
But what about the flaws, Sean?

549
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:53,501
Telephone ringing.

550
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:01,541
Michael, phone.

551
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:42,661
Thanks very much for the stubbs.

552
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:46,901
Now be on your way.

553
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:51,317
I think you need to get going.

554
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:53,101
I want my money.

555
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:56,101
And I want a free Ireland.

556
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:00,317
We had a deal.

557
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,941
Scoffs your deal's fucked.

558
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,797
Now, leave.

559
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:09,381
While you still can.

560
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:54,821
You do know what we do
with these paintings, don't you?

561
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:58,301
I stay out of these things, Sean.

562
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,221
We use them as collateral
to buy arms for the struggle.

563
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:07,981
As I say, I stay out of these things.

564
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:12,741
Well, you're a hard bitch, right enough.

565
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:17,181
I'll think you'll find I'm
not hard, just practical.

566
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,037
Do you fancy that drink now?

567
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:25,501
I'm afraid I have another engagement.

568
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:30,757
I really do... Grunts police! Stay down!

569
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,941
She grunts.

570
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,981
All right. Get in.

571
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,117
Good look, Joan.

572
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,157
You been following me the whole time?

573
00:42:00,181 --> 00:42:02,741
I'm sorry. I tried to offer you a way out.

574
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,141
Pigs.

575
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:09,637
You're all the same.

576
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,501
He sighs Joan

577
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,317
'Joan hannington, you
are remanded in custody,

578
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,997
'and we are not granting you bail

579
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:24,397
'because there are
substantial grounds to believe

580
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,117
'that you will not come back to court,

581
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:27,917
'or you will commit another offence.

582
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:30,237
'We believe this because of
the nature and seriousness

583
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,917
'of the offence and how
you might be dealt with for it,

584
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,637
'and because of your criminal record,

585
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,597
'personal background and character.

586
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,037
'You may apply to the crown
court for bail in due course.'

587
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:40,357
don't you fucking hang up on me!

588
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,717
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- We're waiting!

589
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:45,157
I've just arrived. I need
to make some calls.

590
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:48,141
I need to call my little girl.
No, I need to call my daughter.

591
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:50,821
Go on, we're waiting!

592
00:42:58,181 --> 00:42:59,957
Ringing tone

593
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:02,877
'hello, 0-8-2-9?' Mrs
ashbury? It's me, Joan.

594
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,917
Can I speak to Kelly, please?

595
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:10,637
Shouting 'Joan?

596
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:12,597
'Joan.' I said can you please tell

597
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,597
'I'm truly sorry, but I think it's better

598
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:17,661
'if you don't speak to Kelly while
you're in your current environment.'

599
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:22,877
no, no, you can't do
that... 'As I say, I am sorry.

600
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,141
'It's better for Kelly. You
can see that, I'm sure.'

601
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:33,557
disconnect tone calm
down! What is going on?

602
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:36,021
Shouting continues calm down!

603
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:16,421
