1
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,447
T-minus 15 seconds,
guidance is internal.

2
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,281
12... 11... 10... nine...

3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,529
- Ignition sequence starts...
- Damn it, turn that vacuum off!

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,365
- Hattie!
five... four... three...

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,205
two... one... zero.

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,203
All engines running.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,442
Liftoff.
We have a liftoff.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,568
32 minutes past the hour.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,051
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,884
Boy.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,764
Oh boy, it looks good.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,051
You know what?
Why don't you swing down to Irvine?

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,328
We have a lot more
groves down there.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,403
Can we go to Tijuana?

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,528
I'm tired at looking at oranges.

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,326
There's more to look at
than the ground.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,642
Imagine what it's like
for the astronauts.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,007
They're probably scared.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,891
Why?
Maybe they won't make it.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,122
All their problems will be over.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,607
You know how to fly this thing?

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,440
What are you doing?

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,922
See that spot along 66?
Probably Claremont.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,929
Good spot
for smoldering wreckage.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,885
- It's not funny.
- Turn it back on this minute!

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,811
You wanted to go up in the plane,
we went up in the plane.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,526
My God, we're gonna die!

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,411
Well, I thought I'd talk to you
privately first,

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,370
because your next call is going to be
from Pete Campbell.

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,851
Have him call me.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,490
I'd love to hear his version of it.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,126
Well, Pete says that Sunkist
called him distraught.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,287
Severely distraught because apparently
you cut the engines

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,482
and scared them half to death.

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,211
And also expressed a real
feeling of wanting to die.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,006
You used to fly.
Didn't you ever feel that?

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,686
Over Dresden?
I wanted to live.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,490
And the clients
want to live, too, Ted!

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,123
I thought this was private.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,246
He's leaving.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,003
Look, Jim, I don't want to die.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,083
I just don't want
to do this anymore.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,528
- Do what?
- Advertising.

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,808
I wanna do something else.
Somewhere else.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,361
- I don't think that's possible.
- Sure, it is.

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,806
You're gonna buy me out.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,485
Ted, you don't know
what you're saying.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,967
I've made up my mind.
Good-bye.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,644
Mr. Avery's here.

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,290
Send him in.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,044
Just wanted to say
Commander cigarettes is dead.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,720
Leo Burnett says they're rolling it up
with the rest of Philip Morris.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,769
Oh, well, that's too bad.

54
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
But I suppose now people will know
we're in the tobacco business again.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,369
- And that's good.
- Oh, sure.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,329
There's a cork-tipped
Newport in the works.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,608
Shall I invite them
to "Don Draper Dinner Theater"?

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,728
Maybe a matinee?

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,491
10 years I've built
a tobacco resume

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,847
and one meeting
turned me into a joke.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,641
I'm gonna crawl outta this place
with nothing left to show.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,370
We don't owe you anything!

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,126
You're a hired hand.
Now get back to work.

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,691
Bobby! Sally! Get down here!
You're being rude!

65
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,001
But I know I put it in the car.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,083
Neil, that's enough.

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,930
"The case of the missing telescope."

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,690
Neil can bunk with Bobby,

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,683
and there's a daybed
in the sewing room for Sean.

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,807
Sean, Neil,
this is Bobby and Sally.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,526
- Where's your little brother?
- My goodness, Sally.

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,409
You look like your mother
freshman year.

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,528
Carolyn, you're the one
with the fully grown men.

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,564
- You have such a lovely home.
- Where are we supposed to put these?

75
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,808
I'll show you.

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,370
Don't let the lady carry a bag.

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,005
Oh, it's fine.
I'm strong.

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,685
Let me get it.

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,369
Follow me, Rick.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,882
Bobby, show Neil your telescope.

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,929
It'll give you an excuse
to take it out of the box.

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,082
You can't see anything
during the daytime.

83
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,009
That's not true.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,089
Come on.

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,008
Of course, now that my partnership
is on the table,

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,571
Jennifer has stopped
talking about divorce.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,643
She's postponing the conversation.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,604
Yeah, till after I get that money.

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,802
Don, can you be impartial?
What do I hold out for?

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,531
Don't negotiate,
just accept the deal.

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,210
Should we take it from the top?

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,129
"Welcome, welcome.

93
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,408
Indiana's beautiful this time of year."

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,011
I tell a joke, everyone laughs.

95
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,403
Then Harry gets up and doesn't squander
the good will I've just generated.

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,370
- I have a joke, too.
- No, you don't.

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,046
"Local buy, national buy,
outdoor."

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,925
I tell them about
the IBM 360, but...

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,129
I don't show them a picture,
because we only show pictures of ads.

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,044
Peggy.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,727
We were scared until we knew
the genuine superiority of Burger Chef.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,360
More general flattery,
research, research.

103
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,727
"Without further ado,
Donald Draper. Don?"

104
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,410
ls that what you're going to say?

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,085
Don't worry about
what she's going to say.

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,924
I was going to say that...

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,923
"every great ad is a story,

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,687
and here to tell you that story
is our creative director and partner,

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,524
Donald Draper.

110
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,164
Don?"

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,962
"I don't know
about your dinner table,

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,645
but I know about mine.

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,564
- When I get home--"
- That's fine.

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,361
Now we just have to pray
everything goes smoothly on the moon.

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,804
Hello?

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,602
Oh, I'm sorry.

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,125
Where's Kazmir?

118
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,089
He had to run downtown.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,969
Oh.

120
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,288
Well, it looks like
you're doing a good job.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,885
Once you get the grid up,

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,327
you just try not to break the tiles.

123
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,522
I'm Peggy, by the way.

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,842
I'm Nick.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,367
You've got a lot of books.

126
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,090
It's so hot in here.

127
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,890
Would you like some iced tea?

128
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,361
Kaz should give you a discount.
Your son was a big help.

129
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,568
MY Son?

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,530
Oh, Julio.
No, he's my neighbor.

131
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
I own the building.

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,849
By yourself?

133
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,204
I was very clear I am not paying
before it's finished.

134
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,125
That's my number.

135
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,442
In case you have any odd jobs
too small for Kaz.

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,848
Well, thank you.

137
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,124
- Good night.
- Good night.

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,123
Good night, kid.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,962
Can I have a Popsicle?
I only had one today.

140
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,963
Sure.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,529
So then Rutgers promised him
a generous athletic scholarship.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,569
It was nice he had choices,

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,768
but I don't see any passion.

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
I don't remember dreaming
of anything but Paris at his age.

145
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,682
Paris and Ty Power.

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,245
How did I marry Rick?

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,846
He has no eyelashes.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,082
So...

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,811
I have to ask.
Do you ever see Don?

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,247
Only when absolutely necessary.

151
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,643
I'm starting to think of him
as an old, bad boyfriend.

152
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,247
Someone a teenage
anthropologist would marry.

153
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,684
- Is there any oatmeal?
- Good morning, mister.

154
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,444
Good morning, Mrs. Francis.

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,602
Betty.

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,001
Go get decent.

157
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,124
- Hey. Sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm late.

158
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,645
What can I get you?

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,564
She gets to eat in a bathing suit?

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,121
- 'Cause I swim in these shorts.
- I can't eat anything

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,647
because I'm a lifeguard
and I can't wait an hour.

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,001
Go.

163
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,008
Bye, everyone.

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,247
She is so beautiful.

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,283
Particularly today.

166
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,370
She's never worn lipstick
to the pool before.

167
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,728
Because before they reach
the surface of the moon,

168
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,041
they're gonna throw down
an anchor.

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,765
And what if that
sinks right into it?

170
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,730
Hmm?
What if it's quicksand?

171
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,167
- Am I late for something?
- No.

172
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,766
May I speak with you?

173
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,129
What's going on?

174
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,203
You got this letter this morning

175
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,887
and it's very upsetting news.

176
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,483
Are they firing you?

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,768
I don't know.

178
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,685
What does that mean,
"breach of contract"?

179
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,162
This is from the agency's attorney.
Why didn't they call me?

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,891
Look at you.

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,844
You're so confused.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,371
You never even met
with Commander cigarettes.

183
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,807
I would have known.

184
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,041
It doesn't matter.

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,808
I want you to listen to me.

186
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,967
I know you're feeling vulnerable,

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,124
but I am your strength.

188
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,251
Tell me what I can do.

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,005
You can get my attorney
on the phone.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,002
And we can't do this.

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,328
You're right.

192
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,403
Not right now.

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,041
You think you're gonna throw me
out of my own company?

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,202
Madeline, I've got it.

195
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,448
Todd, could you excuse us?

196
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,762
Don has a habit
of walking into meetings

197
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,365
unannounced.

198
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,727
- Should I reschedule?
- Get out!

199
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,086
It was cut and dry.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,368
You broke the stipulations
of the addendum to your contract.

201
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,329
You set that meeting
to force me out of the agency.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,403
What was I supposed to do?

203
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,922
You know, Ted and I,

204
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,447
whenever we would hear
that your agency was involved,

205
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,001
we'd always be so intimidated.

206
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,605
"What was that man up to?"

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,127
Such a cloud of mystery.

208
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,487
Now that I've been backstage?

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,484
I'm deeply unimpressed, Don.

210
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,563
You're just a bully and a drunk.

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,007
A football player in a suit.

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,525
The most eloquent
I've ever heard you

213
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,091
was when you were blubbering
like a little girl

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,760
about your
impoverished childhood.

215
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,890
What? You wanna
take a swing at me?

216
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,889
It would save us all
a lot of trouble.

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,731
- ls he in?
- He hasn't read it.

218
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,002
I just got it.

219
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,606
Hey!
Get out here!

220
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,961
What's going on?

221
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,248
I just got a breach letter
with your name on the bottom.

222
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,325
- What?
- Joan! Get out here.

223
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,286
Joan! Could you get
Cooper out here?

224
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,847
- What's going on?
- Find Pete.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,843
- No one knows about this?
- I saw it.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,367
Then why did you say,
"What's going on"?

227
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,522
I want you to calm down.
I just called Jim.

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,364
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

229
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,046
- Is there a meeting?
- Have you seen this?

230
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,531
Is this a partners' meeting?

231
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,808
You're not a partner yet.

232
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,325
This is outrageous.

233
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,562
You know we're going to be
at Burger Chef on Monday.

234
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,404
I vote against this.
Right now.

235
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,928
It's not subject to a vote.
The contract was very clear.

236
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,366
You wanna play
parliamentary procedure?

237
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,931
Let's play.

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,128
Everyone who wants to get rid of me,
raise your hand.

239
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,362
Fine.
I have Ted's proxy.

240
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,528
You had no right
to put my name on that.

241
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,250
Anyone else?

242
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,642
All opposed?

243
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,325
Motion denied.

244
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,881
That is a very sensitive
piece of horseflesh.

245
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,929
He shouldn't be rattled.

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,849
He's a pain in the ass.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
You knew about this?

248
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,882
No, but I'm tired of him
costing me money.

249
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,808
We all set those stipulations,
and he signed them.

250
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,201
You shouldn't have done that.

251
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,085
Can I watch TV?

252
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,447
I'm sorry, you can't.
I'm working.

253
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,728
Wait, get in here.

254
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,931
This is a suit and it has a skirt

255
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,771
and it has grey in it,
which is what men wear.

256
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,924
And this is a dress and it's pretty,

257
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,766
but I might be sweating
and not just because it's July.

258
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,120
- Forget it.
- I gotta watch Sunday.

259
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,406
That's when
they're supposed to land.

260
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,403
I'm sorry, but I'm going to be
in Indianapolis.

261
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,607
Why?

262
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,650
Because we're presenting
to Burger Chef Monday morning.

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,770
I know the astronauts may not make it,
and then what are we gonna say?

264
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,369
Oh.

265
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,169
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,725
They're going to be fine.

267
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,484
- It's not fair!
- You know what?

268
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,450
I'll give you the key and you can
come down and watch yourself.

269
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,090
Just don't use the stove again.

270
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,163
I don't wanna go to Newark.

271
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,651
Nobody does.

272
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,406
My uncle has a house
and he got my mom a job.

273
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
I don't wanna leave!

274
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,610
You're moving?

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,123
Well...

276
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,328
well, that's okay.

277
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,887
Maybe you'll have a yard.

278
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,847
You want your mom
to have a job, don't you?

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,287
She don't care about me.

280
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,486
Yes, she does.

281
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,120
That's why she's moving.

282
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,404
I'll visit you all the time.

283
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,608
No, you won't.

284
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,123
- You can watch TV while I pack.
- Okay.

285
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,561
Hello?

286
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,082
Hello.
What are you up to?

287
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,570
I'm going to the movies with Jill.

288
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,250
I think we're gonna see
"The Wild Bunch."

289
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,084
I wanna see that.

290
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,527
You want me to wait?

291
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,841
When are you going to Indiana?

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,082
I don't even know if I'm going.

293
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,846
What happened?

294
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,650
They're going to fire me.

295
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,125
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,965
I thought if I kept
my head down and...

297
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,481
did my job--

298
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,290
I guess that's not what they want.

299
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,681
What do they want?

300
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,609
They want me to move on.

301
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,967
Well, maybe you should.

302
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,724
Aren't you tired of fighting?

303
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,210
Yes.

304
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,120
I guess I could see it
as an opportunity.

305
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,601
I could finally move out there.

306
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,565
Megan?

307
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,768
I'm here.

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,324
Is that what you want me to do?

309
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,644
Don...

310
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,322
I'll always take care of you.

311
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,761
I'll be fine.

312
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,845
Well, until you are.

313
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,888
Whatever you need.

314
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,969
I owe you that.

315
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,287
You don't owe me anything.

316
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,241
Good-bye, Don.

317
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,848
- What are we gonna do about Cutler?
- Sit, take off your shoes.

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,684
I don't feel like it.

319
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,322
- Whoever is in control is in charge.
- We're in control.

320
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,847
We've got the votes,
except for Benedict Joan.

321
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,840
Don cost her a million dollars
when we didn't go public.

322
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,247
So you want him out, too?

323
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,687
Do you understand Don Draper
can work anywhere?

324
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,408
No man has ever come back
from leave, even Napoleon.

325
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,769
He staged a coup, but he ended up
back on that island.

326
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,604
So why didn't you vote him out?

327
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,606
Because I'm a leader
and a leader is loyal to his team.

328
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,649
Don doesn't understand that.

329
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,723
But I do.

330
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,646
And you have talent and skill
and experience.

331
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,082
But you're not a leader.

332
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,725
And Cutler is?

333
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,044
He has a vision,
but he's not on my team.

334
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,288
So, "let's have another cup of coffee,
let's have another piece of pie"?

335
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,086
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like to ask you now

336
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,369
to extinguish your cigarettes
as we prepare for takeoff.

337
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,847
I'd like to say that we'll be
sharing the sky today

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,968
with one other notable aircraft,

339
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,202
and I'd like to wish fellow pilots

340
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,290
Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins

341
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,369
godspeed and a safe return.

342
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,444
Why did you have to do that?
Now I feel like we're in danger.

343
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,204
If they don't make it,
we're going to have to postpone

344
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,362
this thing for a year.

345
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,962
You're going to go in there
and you're going to win this.

346
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,645
And if Cutler doesn't
like it, I'm sorry,

347
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,169
but the Don Draper show is back
from its unscheduled interruption.

348
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,801
I appreciate that,
but I'm not rattled.

349
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,725
Well, you're sighing a lot.

350
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,167
What do you say
you come out to California?

351
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,891
It's possible if all goes well
that I could be spending

352
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,804
part of my time in New York.

353
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,123
And Ted's going to run that place
into the ground.

354
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,527
He's off the deep end.

355
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,569
Lane Pryce.

356
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,483
There's no reason to go to L.A.

357
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
ls Megan moving back?

358
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,928
Marriage is a racket.

359
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,046
It's happening!

360
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,565
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go!

361
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,524
Come on.

362
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,731
Indiana's dry on Sunday.

363
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,848
I had to buy these
off the night clerk.

364
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,321
Getting back up to that first step...

365
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,642
He came out.

366
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,565
...not even collapsed
too far, but it's adequate...

367
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,007
- Two beers?
- Roger. We copy.

368
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,282
It takes
a pretty good little jump.

369
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,363
So there's a foot on the moon.

370
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,602
Stepping down on the moon.

371
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,171
If he's testing that first step,

372
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,800
he must be stepping down
on the moon at this point.

373
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,043
Buzz, this is Houston.

374
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,003
F2-1/160 second for shadow photography
on the sequence camera.

375
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,524
Okay.

376
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,808
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

377
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,568
The LEM footpads are only

378
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,601
depressed in the surface
about one or two inches,

379
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,651
although the surface
appears to be

380
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,770
very, very fine grained
as you get close to it.

381
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,446
It's almost like a powder...

382
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,601
down there.

383
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,125
It's very fine.

384
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,011
Boy, look at those pictures.
Wow.

385
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,645
It's a little shadowy, but--

386
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,525
Hot damn.

387
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,769
Armstrong is on the moon.
Neil Armstrong.

388
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,562
38-year-old American,
standing on the surface of the moon.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,004
On this July 20th, 1969.

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,084
That's one small step for man...

391
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,801
one giant leap for mankind.

392
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,122
Bravo.

393
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,885
I think that was Neil's quote.

394
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,081
I didn't understand.

395
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,651
Well, "one small step for man,"

396
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,531
but I didn't get the second phrase.

397
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,489
Roger. We got you boresighted

398
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,405
but back under one track.

399
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,291
It's just incredible.

400
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,164
I'll tell you what's incredible.

401
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,209
It cost $25 billion.

402
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,771
Be quiet, Sean.

403
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,285
'Cause there's no problems
back on Earth?

404
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,528
I can't hear it.

405
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,846
It's probably Nixon
calling for Henry.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,890
Sally.

407
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,724
Okay.

408
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,723
...underneath it says,

409
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,087
"Here Man
from the Planet Earth..."

410
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,689
- Francis residence.
- Hello, sweetheart.

411
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,524
Hi, Daddy.

412
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,921
Isn't this something?

413
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,242
I guess.

414
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,084
So you're unimpressed?

415
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,163
It's such a waste of money.

416
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,891
You don't really think that, do you?

417
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,522
We'll be going there all the time
while people go hungry down here.

418
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,251
Don't be so cynical.

419
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,204
You want your little brothers
to talk that way?

420
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,805
No.

421
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,567
- Are they up?
- I'll go get them.

422
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,644
Neil, this is Houston.
After you've got the core tubes...

423
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,371
Just leave it alone.

424
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,645
Hello?

425
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,007
Yes, this is he.

426
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,081
Oh, shit.

427
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,447
What is it?

428
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,049
Hello?

429
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,247
I'm so sorry.

430
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,362
- Well, this is unfortunate.
- Yes.

431
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,444
Roger, my condolences.
He was a giant.

432
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,965
Thank you.

433
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,481
He was a wonderful man.

434
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,043
I'll have the obituary
ready in an hour,

435
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,089
and I suppose we can
divide up the clients

436
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,241
and start calling them.

437
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,004
It's 1:00 in the morning.

438
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,730
The agency and the world
are closed tomorrow.

439
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,360
Do we have to do this now?

440
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,171
Well, as tragic as this is,
I for one am happy

441
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,766
that we have a chance to have
a conversation with the clients

442
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,161
about the future of this company.

443
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,210
And to give Don Draper
a send-off along with Bert.

444
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,925
Excuse me?

445
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,401
I hate to remind you
that with Harry's partnership

446
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,360
and without Bert, Don's dismissal
is a foregone conclusion.

447
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,364
Cooper's been dead an hour
and you're prying his hand open?

448
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,841
Roger, I know what this company
should look like.

449
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,201
Computer services.

450
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,204
Media buys pinpointed
with surgical accuracy.

451
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,806
We can offer the services
beyond our clients.

452
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,923
It's the agency of the future.

453
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,924
Is this what would happen if I died?

454
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,041
Are you the only one out here?

455
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,884
Yes. ls that okay?

456
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,567
Yeah, I don't want them
giving me shit for smoking.

457
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,006
Smoking causes cancer.

458
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,289
How does it look?

459
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,408
- Can you see it?
- The moon?

460
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,562
Nah, it's already set.

461
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,609
Then why aren't you watching TV?

462
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,246
I don't wanna listen to them
or the reporters.

463
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,370
Besides, there's other things
to look at.

464
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,766
Like what?

465
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,284
Polaris.
It's a star.

466
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,004
Take a look.

467
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,282
I can't see anything.

468
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,124
Do you see your eyelashes?

469
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,567
Yes.

470
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,285
Okay.

471
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,331
Tilt your head back
and open your eyes really wide.

472
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,448
Okay.

473
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,209
I think I see it.

474
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,886
Isn't that better than TV?

475
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,489
It is.

476
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,729
What do I do now?

477
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,531
Neil, honey?
Where are you?

478
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,250
I'm outside.

479
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,528
Get in here!
It's bedtime!

480
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,930
Neil, this is Houston.
Did you get the Hasselblad...

481
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,849
- Hello?
- Figured you'd still be up.

482
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,685
Roger?
How'd you find me?

483
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,525
Your itinerary
was on Caroline's desk.

484
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,330
I'm at the office.

485
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,524
Bert passed away.

486
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,729
A couple hours ago.

487
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,161
He was in his living room
on the couch.

488
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,648
Roger, I'm so sorry.

489
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,604
I know what he meant to you.

490
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,885
Well, now I'm gonna lose you, too.

491
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,963
We don't have the votes anymore.

492
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,690
It's the first thing Cutler said.

493
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,370
Well, he's consistent.

494
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,884
Poor Bert.

495
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,530
I should've realized
it was the end.

496
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,887
Every time an old man
starts talking about Napoleon,

497
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,530
you know they're gonna die.

498
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,364
Is his sister still alive?

499
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,086
He was hard on me, you know?
But maybe he was right.

500
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,086
The last thing I said to him
were the lines to some old song.

501
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,531
Come on, Roger, you know
he was very proud of you.

502
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,564
Give 'em hell tomorrow.

503
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,130
Okay.

504
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,885
Okay, the hatch
is closed and latched...

505
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,971
May I speak with you?

506
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,009
Of course.
ls something wrong?

507
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,731
May I come in?

508
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,802
There's been a change of plans.

509
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,645
You're gonna give
the presentation tomorrow.

510
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,007
Did Harry tell you
about my dream?

511
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,049
What? No.

512
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,247
We have a couple hours.

513
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,442
You can practice it with me
and still be fresh.

514
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,247
- Are you serious?
- You're gonna be great.

515
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,529
No. Stop messing around.
It's not funny.

516
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,528
You must have heard
that they're trying to get me out.

517
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,160
If I win this business,
and then I go,

518
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,129
you'll be left with nothing.

519
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,645
They're trying to get you out?

520
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,969
I thought everything
was finally back to normal.

521
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,043
Me, too, but...

522
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,770
sometimes actions
have consequences

523
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,127
and one of them
is I can't present tomorrow.

524
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,762
You win this business
and it will be yours.

525
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,250
No, Don.

526
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,721
It's tomorrow.
I'm unprepared.

527
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,530
You've been listening
to me for weeks.

528
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,081
Well, I can't just say
what you've been saying.

529
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,369
I'm a woman.
I'm the "voice of moms," remember?

530
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,084
Maybe that's better.

531
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,129
Maybe that's the way it always
should have been.

532
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,884
Well, Pete won't stand for it.

533
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,362
Pete's pregnant.
He has to do what we say.

534
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,766
No. Cancel it.
What about the moon landing?

535
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,207
- It was a success.
- No, Don.

536
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,727
I have to talk to people
who just touched the face of God

537
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,530
about hamburgers!

538
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,729
I wouldn't do this
if I didn't know you could.

539
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,849
You've never even
seen me present.

540
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,844
I've overheard things.

541
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,127
We have no liquor.

542
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,884
Good morning.

543
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,405
Did you see we landed
on the moon?

544
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,131
ls that right?

545
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,766
Neil Armstrong, what are you going
to do with the rest of your life?

546
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,207
Screw every girl in Florida,
I guess.

547
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,011
So you called me at sunrise
to discuss the meaning of life?

548
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,131
No. I just want to know
if Buick had left you yet.

549
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,725
Why would they do that?

550
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,609
Because we've built
a relationship with GM

551
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,250
and they know we can
handle a bigger car.

552
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,569
And our Chevy account man
just moved there.

553
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,129
Uncle.

554
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,930
So, you made the overture.

555
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,043
What did you have in mind?

556
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,043
Well...

557
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,608
we'd want the whole Chevy team.

558
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,888
You, Jim Cutler, Don Draper,

559
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,883
and Ted Chaough.

560
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,441
We both know you're
in the acquisitions business.

561
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,490
I think... you should buy
the whole company.

562
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,047
Because I have a vision.

563
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,602
All our accounts,
our cutting-edge computer,

564
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,364
and the employees
that I know to be worthy

565
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,166
as an independent
subsidiary of McCann.

566
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,850
You just lost Burger Chef,
we may win it.

567
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,331
Then you'd still have it.

568
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,970
And I'd have my company--

569
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,488
without Jim Cutler
and all that baggage from CGC.

570
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,290
That's an interesting idea.

571
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,243
But this is still all about Buick.

572
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,449
You have to bury the hatchet
with Ted Chaough.

573
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,647
Why?

574
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,003
Because GM thinks
he and Don Draper are one person.

575
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,602
I don't know if I can do that.

576
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,280
Well, then, I don't know
if I can help you.

577
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,411
I'm gonna be bold and say
that no one in this room

578
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,045
knows more about
the Burger Chef customer

579
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,123
than Peggy Olson.

580
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,361
She has visited 20 restaurants
in nine states,

581
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,722
interviewed hundreds
and is obviously

582
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,168
uniquely qualified
to craft this modern campaign.

583
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,401
Every great ad tells a story.

584
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,723
Here to tell that story
is Peggy Olson.

585
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,564
Thank you, Don.

586
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,803
That's a lot to live up to.

587
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,685
Because I certainly
can't tell a better story

588
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,047
than the one we saw last night.

589
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,724
I don't know what was
more miraculous--

590
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,605
the technological achievement

591
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,725
that put our species
in a new perspective

592
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,601
or the fact that all of us were doing
the same thing at the same time.

593
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,331
Sitting in this room,

594
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,605
we can still feel the pleasure
of that connection,

595
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,446
because, I realize now,
we were starved for it.

596
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,601
We really were.

597
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,962
And, yes, we'll feel it again
when they all return safely.

598
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,568
And, yes, the world will never
be the same in some ways.

599
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,847
But tonight, I'm going
to go back to New York,

600
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,608
and I'll go back to my apartment
and find a 10-year-old boy

601
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,282
parked in front of my TV,
eating dinner.

602
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,966
Now, I don't need to charge you
for a research report

603
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,726
that tells you
that most television sets

604
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,885
are not more than six feet away
from the dinner table.

605
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,168
And that dinner table

606
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,011
is your battlefield and your prize.

607
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,451
This is the home
your customers really live in.

608
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,887
This is your dinner table.

609
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,404
Dad likes Sinatra,
son likes The Rolling Stones.

610
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,327
The TV's always on,
Vietnam playing in the background.

611
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,847
The news wins every night.

612
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,843
And you're starving.

613
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,327
And not just for dinner.

614
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,451
What if there was another table

615
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,047
where everybody gets what they want
when they want it?

616
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,640
It's bright and clean,

617
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,484
and there's no laundry,

618
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,530
no telephone, and no TV.

619
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,770
And we can have the connection

620
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,002
that we're hungry for.

621
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,205
There may be chaos at home...

622
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,963
but there's family supper
at Burger Chef.

623
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,169
That's beautiful.

624
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,925
That's nice to hear

625
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,128
because that's the name
of the spot.

626
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,410
We open on a bird's-eye view
of a typical kitchen table.

627
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,162
- Welcome home.
- How'd you get in here?

628
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,288
Money.
But he wouldn't open the door.

629
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,363
I need to talk to you.

630
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,971
Cooper still dead?

631
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,487
His situation hasn't changed,
but ours has.

632
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,324
Can I get a drink?

633
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,930
- How'd it go?
- Great.

634
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,809
Is that why you're here?

635
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,089
We got an offer from McCann Erickson
to buy the agency.

636
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,685
Hear me out.

637
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,366
We'd be a subsidiary,
separately operated.

638
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,602
We keep our name, our offices,
you keep your job--

639
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,445
your real job--
and I'll be the president.

640
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,285
- Of McCann?
- No, of Sterling Cooper.

641
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,805
They know we're primed
for a big car,

642
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,325
and they don't want
to compete with us.

643
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,960
Did you forget we started this agency
to get away from them?

644
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,600
Yeah, I know that,
but a lot's happened in between.

645
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,649
Most of it good,
but some of it very bad.

646
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,041
Without Cooper, Cutler's gonna
lock you out by the end of the week.

647
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,806
- I don't want to work for McCann.
- You're gonna work for me.

648
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,325
Don't fool yourself.

649
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,204
You know they're not
gonna leave us alone.

650
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,721
They did with Marschalk.
And they're buying 51%.

651
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,291
You're gonna make a fortune.

652
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,011
Fine, you have my vote.
What's that gonna do?

653
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,362
You can't even save my job.
How are you gonna sell the company?

654
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,808
I'm working on it.
You're of essence to the deal.

655
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,007
But so is Ted Chaough.

656
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,605
Ted Chaough?
What are you doing?

657
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,728
They want the guys
who won Chevy.

658
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,490
Roger, I just wanna do my work.

659
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,290
I don't wanna deal
with business anymore.

660
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,886
And what about everyone else?
We all send out resumes?

661
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,931
Cutler's not gonna stop until the firm
is just Harry and the computer.

662
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,287
That means everybody goes.

663
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,485
And you know it.

664
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,401
Ted, welcome back.

665
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,528
Well, I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

666
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,126
I've instructed Don
to gather everyone at noon.

667
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,970
Did you want to discuss
the remarks?

668
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,209
I thought we would begin
with a poem of memorial for Bert.

669
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,964
"O Captain, My Captain"?

670
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,889
Then we have a lot
of pressing business here

671
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,684
with finalizing
Don's departure and--

672
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,524
And I have an announcement
of my own.

673
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,001
We don't need
to deal with that today.

674
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,684
I haven't heard anything.

675
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,009
- About what?
- Burger Chef.

676
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,011
- Good morning.
- I'm glad that you're here.

677
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,685
Would you please all have a seat?

678
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,049
There's coffee.
I have some rather urgent business.

679
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,690
I insist.

680
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,246
I'm coming to all of you
with an incredible opportunity.

681
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,882
McCann Erickson wants to buy
a 51% stake in SC&P.

682
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,809
We'll be independently operated,

683
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,243
and all they ask are five-year contracts
from everyone.

684
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,244
- Including Don?
- Especially Don.

685
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,209
And you'll be our king.

686
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,044
Well, I did put it together.

687
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,446
The details have
to be worked out,

688
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,087
but we'll keep our office,
our name, and our clients.

689
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,685
Why would they do that?

690
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,127
Because we finally turned this place
into a legitimate threat

691
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,567
and they'd like to neutralize it
with cold, hard cash.

692
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,768
- How much?
- When did you do this?

693
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,888
Since you asked,
I'll use you as an example.

694
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,520
Let's say they value the agency
at $65 million

695
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,125
and they buy 51% of it.

696
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,291
That means your 5% share
is worth a little over $1.5 million.

697
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,842
- 25% of that upon signing.
- Oh, my goodness!

698
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,122
I've got 10%!

699
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,645
Keep counting those chickens.

700
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,883
I hope you all realize this is
a pathetic ploy and a delusion.

701
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,441
It is until everybody votes on it.

702
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,126
Sorry, just heard
about the partners' meeting.

703
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,805
- Perfect timing.
- He hasn't signed.

704
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,961
He missed the boat.

705
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,963
- What's going on?
- None of your beeswax.

706
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,726
- I'll take the deal.
- Good-bye, Harry.

707
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,848
Don't worry about it.

708
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,125
Well, I won't do it.

709
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,964
That's fine because
you're not of essence.

710
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,121
And you are?

711
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,449
Yes, all they care about
is me, Don, and Ted.

712
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,366
Don, you're gonna sign a contract
to work at McCann for five years?

713
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,760
Well, I've given this a lot of thought.

714
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,321
I'm sure you did.

715
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,562
And I agree with Roger
that we should do everything we can

716
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,803
to keep Jim from breaking up
the agency.

717
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,650
You mean, save your hide.

718
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,485
Look, I don't want to stand in the way
of everyone making all this money,

719
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,768
but I am done with advertising.

720
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,163
Your 20% share will be worth
at least $6 million.

721
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,970
I'm going to have
plenty of money

722
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,122
from selling my partnership
as it stands.

723
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,486
Can't you do it without me?

724
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,330
You don't think I tried that?

725
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,684
If I sign a contract for five years,
that'll be the rest of my life.

726
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,365
You've got to be kidding me.

727
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,841
You're not just pathetic,
you're selfish.

728
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,650
Well, I'm sorry, Roger.

729
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,485
You may have the votes,
but you don't have a deal.

730
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,085
Now can we dispense
with this nonsense,

731
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,726
go outside and say
a fond farewell?

732
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,445
Ted...

733
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,203
what if I told you
you could just write copy

734
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,408
and fight clients
and not worry about

735
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
partnership votes or stock prices?

736
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,884
You could just go back
to creative.

737
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,088
I have that right now,
and I'm miserable.

738
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,890
No, you don't.

739
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,849
I really lost this last year

740
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,924
and I realized I would do anything
to get back in.

741
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,081
And I did anything.

742
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,164
I wrote tags,
I wrote coupons.

743
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,211
Things I haven't done
since I first got my start.

744
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,401
I know you.

745
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,609
I know the man
who I walked into Chevy with.

746
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,286
You don't have to work for us,
but you have to work.

747
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,563
You don't wanna see what happens
when it's really gone.

748
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,530
You remember the last time
he talked you into something?

749
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,928
I don't know.

750
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,602
- So, I'd move back to the city?
- Ted's in. Let's have a vote.

751
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,444
- Hold on.
- Let's have a vote.

752
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,642
Everyone in favor.

753
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,764
Really?

754
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,685
It's a lot of money.

755
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,325
I just got off the phone
with Burger Chef.

756
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,642
They couldn't find anyone.

757
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,810
We got it.

758
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,962
Well, they heard what I heard.

759
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,803
Where are you going?

760
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,962
Back to work.

761
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,570
Excuse me, everyone.
If I could have your attention.

762
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,486
Mr. Sterling would like to make
an announcement.

763
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,166
Thank you, everyone.

764
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,482
It's difficult that at this moment
of national pride,

765
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,450
we have to deal
with some sad, personal news.

766
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,365
On Sunday night we lost
our founder Bertram Cooper...

767
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,488
