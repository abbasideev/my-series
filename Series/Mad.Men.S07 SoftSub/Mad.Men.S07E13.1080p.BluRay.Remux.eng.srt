1
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,417
I need your
license and registration,

2
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,670
and I need to know
what you were doing.

3
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,171
I'm driving.

4
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,090
Don't get smart with me.

5
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,758
We've been looking for you.

6
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,178
There's been a mistake.

7
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,182
You knew we'd catch up
with you eventually.

8
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,452
I can't find any baking soda.

9
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,371
We're gonna have to
make do with Colgate.

10
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,248
On my arm?

11
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,586
- Well, you're back early.
- Well, we had to skip lunch.

12
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,298
- Hello, Sherry.
- Hello.

13
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,133
I got stinged.

14
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,051
Oh, sweetheart.

15
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
We were up at Lyman Orchards.
It's mostly bees.

16
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,725
Daddy put toothpaste on it.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,811
Yes. And you're no worse for wear.
Not allergic, thankfully.

18
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,730
I'm terribly so.

19
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,191
I have an hour.
I suppose we could still grab lunch.

20
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,527
No, this is fine.
She should probably rest.

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,656
I'll see you Thursday, Wonder
Woman. We'll go to Friendly's.

22
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,246
Well, I'm off.

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,003
Go inside and lay down, sweetheart.

24
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,884
Every time Bill has the kids,
something terrible happens.

25
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,180
Well, the incredible thing is
I make her lunch,

26
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,724
I take her to school,
I read to her every night,

27
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,185
and he spends Sunday
and Thursday night with her,

28
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,686
and that's all I hear about.

29
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,271
Well, I admire you.

30
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,524
Are you trying to get me
to make you lunch?

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,111
No, I think it's admirable that you
haven't poisoned her against him.

32
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,114
I don't know
if I could have that restraint.

33
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,866
Yes, you would because

34
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,659
you'd be concerned
about your child,

35
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,037
and do your best to forget things.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,332
And not expect your friends
to remind you all the time.

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,379
I am so sorry. That is not
what I was trying to say.

38
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,507
I know.

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,804
Would you like some of these?

40
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,140
So, what happened to field hockey?

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,435
If I'm on the yearbook,
I won't be a benchwarmer.

42
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,647
Well, can you quit before I buy you
cleats and a stick next time?

43
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,607
I'm going to sell everything.

44
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,442
You know how much Madrid's going to cost?

45
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,029
I'm not going to back out
of that. I want to go to Spain.

46
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,656
I want to go to Spain.

47
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,659
You think it'll be more
interesting than Wyoming?

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,246
I don't know.
Wyoming had a two-headed cow.

49
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,831
You'll see it on the postcard.

50
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,166
So, where's next?

51
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,295
Well, I'm in Kansas right now.

52
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:20,343
I'm going to take Route 35.
Then over on 40.

53
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,805
Then 89 to the Grand Canyon.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,349
I feel like I'm sitting
right next to you.

55
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,853
Is it cold yet?

56
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,355
A little. I wouldn't rush home.

57
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,191
Well, I wanna get your brothers
before they go to sleep.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,026
I'll call you next week.

59
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,237
I really want you
to sell that equipment.

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,738
You have no idea about money.

61
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,074
I will. Bye.

62
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,868
Bye, sweetheart.

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,883
Are you lost?

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,719
No, I'm a student here.

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,972
Well, see you around.

66
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,022
Hey, give her some room.

67
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,733
You okay, lady?

68
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,028
Just my pride. New shoes.

69
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,823
I think I need a minute.

70
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,829
Hi.

71
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,374
- Duck, how are you?
- Fit as a fiddle, thank you.

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,755
28th? That's top brass.

73
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,673
Actually, it's none of your business.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,175
Don't be coy.

75
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,052
You're helping them
replace Don, aren't you?

76
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,262
I've done it before.

77
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,608
Is it true he left behind
a couple million bucks?

78
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,111
Nice to see you.

79
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,280
Actually, let me ask you something.

80
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,158
- Morning, John, Norm.
- Morning.

81
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,868
One month
and you're already the mayor.

82
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,829
They've been very hospitable.
Of course, I delivered everyone.

83
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,957
I even brought Burger Chef back.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,501
And after Joan cashed in,
I saved Avon.

85
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,835
There have been whispers
about Coca-Cola.

86
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,420
No need to impress me.

87
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,882
- What do you want?
- Not here.

88
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,555
This will just take a moment, Sarah.

89
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,100
You can't be in here.

90
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,435
Everyone's going to think
I'm looking for a job!

91
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,145
You mind?

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,524
They should always think
you're unhappy.

93
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,110
You're wrong! And for
the first time, they don't.

94
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,363
Now, go outside and tell everyone
you staggered into the wrong office.

95
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,781
They'll believe you.

96
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,616
Look, this isn't about you.

97
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,328
I've been trying to get
this private aviation company

98
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,997
to have me do all their hiring,

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,417
but before any of that happens,
they want to review their overall strategy.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,918
So I want you to go to dinner

101
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,838
and recommend that they hire
an in-house senior marketing man.

102
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,339
And I'm the guy to find him.

103
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,716
Because you're the best?

104
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,927
Yes. And then you can extoll
the wonders of McCann.

105
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,470
Everybody wins.

106
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,014
I don't need to poach.

107
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,558
You know, I helped you for free
after that stupid merger,

108
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,935
and then you sent Peggy
to Gerald what's-his-name

109
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,103
when she was in need.

110
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,730
This is how I make my living, Pete.

111
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,607
I've paid you at some point.

112
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,318
You'd want this business
if you knew you couldn't have it.

113
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,862
Learjet is private,
luxury air travel.

114
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,578
Look, Pete, I just have to
fill this one position

115
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,622
and I'll make it through
the winter.

116
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,040
For old times' sake.

117
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,544
Fine. Who is he?

118
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,212
His name is Mike Sherman.

119
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,381
And he moved to Wichita
from Philly four years ago.

120
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,884
Princeton '52.
You should have a lot in common.

121
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,886
I'm Dartmouth '56.

122
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
I know that!

123
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,515
Don't pretend like you're not
going to jack each other off.

124
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,060
- Sarah.
- Yes, Mr. Campbell?

125
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,229
Would you remind me that I need to
make a donation to Lincoln Center?

126
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
Mr. Phillips was very persuasive.

127
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,275
Thank you for your generosity.

128
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,117
KOMA, fun-loving 1520.

129
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,619
The capital radio station

130
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,789
for the capital city,
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

131
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,461
Shit.

132
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,843
Look for clear skies with
a high temperature today of 75.

133
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,179
A pleasant day here
in this pleasant city.

134
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,972
Current temperature is 73.

135
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,808
Beautiful weather out there today.

136
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,104
Dr. Buckley will be right with you,
Mrs. Robinson.

137
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,980
It's Mrs. Francis.

138
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,942
The boys who dropped you off
said that was your name.

139
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,611
I think that was a joke.

140
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,823
Nurse, could you excuse us?

141
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,036
Mrs. Francis, is it possible
to get your husband down here?

142
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,623
I can drive with a broken rib.
It's not even that sore.

143
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,542
Well, I took a look at your X-ray...

144
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,420
and it may be more serious
than just the rib.

145
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,589
How serious?

146
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,635
You can use the phone
at the nurses' station.

147
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,479
I'm going to sue them.

148
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,815
First, I'm gonna go through
the health commission

149
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,650
and I'm gonna look into their funding.

150
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,445
That quack has some nerve
scaring you like that.

151
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,196
What happens to my car?

152
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,075
I'll send my secretary up here
in a cab tomorrow morning.

153
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,912
And I'm going to call Jim. Call...

154
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,001
You know what? I'll just call Rocky's office.
That's what I'm going to do.

155
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,170
Henry, I want to go home.

156
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,089
Babe, look at me.

157
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,093
You're going to be just fine.

158
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,789
Afternoon.

159
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,832
Wyatt called from the service station.

160
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,793
We've got our best available for you.

161
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,463
If you threw a rod,
it's gonna take some time.

162
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,048
It's the rocker arm.

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,760
Well, I've got a weekly for $37
or a daily for $6.

164
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,889
Let's take it a night at a time.
I'm an optimist.

165
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,558
Hello.

166
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,395
This is my wife Sharon,
of the Sharon Motel.

167
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,482
- This is Donald from New York.
- Don.

168
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,900
Pleasure to have you with us.

169
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,778
Do you know where I could get a meal?

170
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,988
There's a cafe a couple miles up the road.

171
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,532
He's got car trouble.

172
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,328
Well, I made a roast. How'd you
like leftovers as room service?

173
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,997
I don't want you to go to the trouble.

174
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,374
You have vending machines?

175
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,000
You can have both.

176
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,087
Give him some change,
and have Andy take his luggage.

177
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,713
This is all I got.

178
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,423
Here's two dimes and a nickel.

179
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,008
There you go.

180
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,393
I believe that's one of the
best steaks I've ever had.

181
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,145
Well, it's the best because
they flew it out from Kansas.

182
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,689
Isn't Wichita cattle country?

183
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,274
It sure is,

184
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,527
but I was disappointed when I got there
that I didn't see more ten-gallon hats.

185
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,572
But your company
is very glamorous.

186
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,158
As far as I can tell, its entire public
reputation is based on Hollywood.

187
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,246
Well, we thought we'd go with
our most exciting customers.

188
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,124
Elizabeth Taylor. Danny Kaye.

189
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,543
Somebody you want to meet?

190
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,922
Not really. In fact, I think that's
the problem, if you have one.

191
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,134
I have one,
or I wouldn't be talking to you.

192
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,970
Corporate executives
should be your core business.

193
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,805
You can read that without glasses?

194
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,934
I've looked at your business,
and I think Duck's right.

195
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,229
You need a senior marketing
executive, and not just anyone.

196
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,814
You need someone comfortable

197
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,608
with the kind of boardroom leaders

198
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,026
that see Learjet as a tool,

199
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,279
not a frivolous extravagance for
movie stars and their pets.

200
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,824
McCann could run circles
around Carson Roberts,

201
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,285
but we wouldn't even be
interested unless Duck

202
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,995
found the right man for your company.

203
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,248
I don't understand.

204
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,834
Are you advocating
for your agency or for yourself?

205
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,836
We're one and the same.

206
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,755
Well, the jobs are not one and the same.

207
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,049
You can't work for McCann and work for us.

208
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,969
I'm aware of that.

209
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,806
But I couldn't agree with you more
about who we need.

210
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,559
I told Duck I was looking
for a real knickerbocker.

211
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,728
Right schools, right family.

212
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,855
Someone who can rap his ring
on the table

213
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,358
and let everyone know
they're with a friend.

214
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,360
Well, I'm flattered,

215
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,028
but I'm afraid Duck Phillips

216
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,197
has tricked me into a job interview.

217
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,952
I stand by my analysis,
but I'm very happy where I am.

218
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,456
I expect him to lie to me.
I didn't expect him to lie to you.

219
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,916
I'm glad we got to meet.

220
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,126
Likewise. That's never a mistake.

221
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,048
You want a brandy?
Because Duck's going to get the check.

222
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,305
Well, unfortunately,
we've discovered

223
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,224
that the cancer has spread from the lung

224
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,977
and metastasized to the bones

225
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,145
and to lymph nodes
in the mediastinum.

226
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,731
I don't understand
what you're saying.

227
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,693
It's aggressive and it's very advanced.

228
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,654
I wish there was better news.

229
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,864
What do we do?

230
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,159
Well, I'm gonna recommend
a radiation oncologist for therapy

231
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,202
to help mend the rib.

232
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,664
It won't heal without it.
Then a medical oncologist.

233
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,584
She could have nine months to a year,

234
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,421
but these treatments
are usually palliative.

235
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,924
I'm so sorry.

236
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,603
Sorry about that.
You should put the sign out.

237
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
You're the maid?

238
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
And the messenger.

239
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,698
I guess they didn't know
you were in here. Wyatt called.

240
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,533
It's a bushing on the rocker arm,

241
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,201
but it's got to come from Tulsa.

242
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,787
So I'm going to need another book.

243
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,748
The chlorine's killed
the piss in the pool by now.

244
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,957
You can go for a swim.

245
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,960
Anything else to do around here?

246
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,423
There's football at
the high school Friday night.

247
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,675
Revival church every night.

248
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,012
Fairview's got a drive-in,
but you don't have a car.

249
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,723
Where can I get a drink?

250
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,060
That's a little complicated...

251
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
but I probably
can rustle up a bottle.

252
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,192
That'd be great.

253
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,944
Andy. You want me to clean up?

254
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,322
Don. Maybe tomorrow.

255
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,690
There she is.

256
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,984
Don't run.

257
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,876
I'm in Grand Central. Come down.

258
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,129
Only to throw you under a train.

259
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,880
Come on.

260
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,634
I only have one question.
I better have gotten that lousy job.

261
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,553
You did, and it's not lousy.

262
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,139
I haven't even negotiated,
we're already at 100 a year.

263
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,058
All benefits and unlimited
private jet travel.

264
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,144
It's a flying limousine, Pete.

265
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,271
You can have lunch in New York
and be back for dinner.

266
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,731
Good, because I live here.
I have to go.

267
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,567
He wants to have dinner with wives.

268
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,734
No.

269
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,820
He's only meeting with you
and one other guy.

270
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,238
Two last-round dinners.

271
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,073
Help me turn it
into a horse race.

272
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,826
How many times do you think
you can lie to this man?

273
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,704
We both told him you didn't
want the job. What's the lie?

274
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,624
Well, for one thing, I don't
have a wife. For the other...

275
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,211
I have four years left
on my contract with McCann,

276
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,089
and $1 million contingent
on my presence.

277
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,759
So now we know there's a price.

278
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
You're talking to yourself.

279
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,847
Have dinner. Yuck it up.

280
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,724
Don't you want to sign him one day?

281
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,268
You know the corporate royalty
on those planes?

282
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,729
7:30 Saturday.

283
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,272
Grill Room at the Four Seasons.

284
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,483
Your wife's under the weather
but you didn't want to miss it.

285
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,578
There's two guys.

286
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,080
Hy Epstein wants to
start treatment immediately,

287
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,708
and he's conducting a study
at New York Hospital.

288
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,585
The other one...

289
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,670
Can't read my own writing.

290
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,007
He's a surgeon. Very aggressive,
but he's in Bethesda.

291
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,593
Stop brushing your hair.
How's the rib gonna heal?

292
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,262
My rib's not going to heal, Henry.

293
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,890
You can't waste any more time
being in shock.

294
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,225
You have to do something.

295
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,601
Do what?

296
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,145
What do you think would happen
if Nelson Rockefeller got this?

297
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,855
He would die!

298
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,566
Betty, you want the kids
to hear you talk that way?

299
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,360
I don't want them
to hear anything

300
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,153
until I've decided what to tell them.

301
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,863
That's what's on my mind, Henry.

302
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,908
Do you want to help with that,
or do you want to keep chasing your tail?

303
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,284
You're being morose.

304
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,912
You're a very lucky woman.
You have been your whole life.

305
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,330
Stop yelling at me.

306
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,641
Thanks for the books.

307
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,978
It's $10.

308
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,105
I gave you $10.

309
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,773
It was hard to get.

310
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,985
I'm not paying $20
for a bottle of whiskey

311
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,195
and a couple of paperbacks
somebody left behind.

312
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,280
You've got the money.

313
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,325
I walked into town. And it's
hard for me. I got flatfeet.

314
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,092
You want one?

315
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,804
No, sir. I'm one-eighth Comanche.
Can't ever touch it.

316
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,932
Folks know the hustle
you're running out of their motel?

317
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,475
My folks are over in Woodward,

318
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,353
and ain't none of their business
how I get rich.

319
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,022
That's true.

320
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,275
How'd you get rich?

321
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,236
I was in the advertising business.

322
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,448
- You make commercials on TV?
- Lots of them.

323
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,950
So many you don't have to
work no more?

324
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,410
Anymore.

325
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,580
All right. Well, I'm around.

326
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,930
Don't forget to take
the pie Tammy made you.

327
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,443
These two traveling
salesmen, they were selling yo-yos.

328
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,488
I was only teasing.

329
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,866
You know, I love children. I wouldn't
do nothing to offend one of them.

330
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,243
- See, I think children are a blessing.
- Yes.

331
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,205
And when you see couples
with no children...

332
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,893
Sorry to bother you,
but my TV just died.

333
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,270
Well, we'll get you a new one,

334
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,856
soon as I'm done
fighting this battle.

335
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,666
There you go.

336
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,626
Then it comes loose.

337
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,602
You're the quick brown fox.

338
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,522
Did you learn to type
in the army?

339
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,065
No, night school.

340
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,733
Were you in the service?

341
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,861
Yes.

342
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,822
Well, everybody who's a vet
and likes drinking

343
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,782
will be at the Legion
on Saturday night.

344
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,535
My husband would be tickled
if you joined him.

345
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,078
Why didn't he ask me?

346
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,998
He's going to,
soon as he spies a chance.

347
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,793
He could sure use someone new
to tell his stories to.

348
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,045
I don't know that I'll be here,
unless you know something

349
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,589
about my car that I don't.

350
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,217
Wyatt's going to overcharge you,
but he'll get the work done.

351
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,762
Let's get that TV
so you can get back to relaxing.

352
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,313
Hello?

353
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,903
The whole pie is for you.

354
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,531
Eat with me.

355
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,326
There were two pies.

356
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,328
I'm not gonna tell you what
happened to the other one.

357
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,836
I have a favor to ask of you.
I can repay you.

358
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,089
I'll take her for a weekend next month.
You can go away.

359
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,883
What?

360
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,802
I have a dinner
with a potential client,

361
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,471
and I'd love for you to join me.

362
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,350
No. Thankfully, that's no longer
one of my obligations.

363
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,227
You used to love it.

364
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,939
I daresay it got you excited
trying to close over coffee.

365
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,567
I never closed anything.
I was just trying to stay awake.

366
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,946
Trudy, you understand my business.

367
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,864
No one else ever really has.

368
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,660
Well, I'm not comfortable being your date
under any circumstances.

369
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,620
Well, then...

370
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,831
How about for old times' sake?

371
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,006
You know...

372
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,469
I'm jealous of your ability to
be sentimental about the past.

373
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,473
I'm not able to do that.
I remember things as they were.

374
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,895
It's late.

375
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,189
I'd like to turn off the lights.

376
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,028
Well, good night, then.

377
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,530
Good night.

378
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,041
Because she got kicked out
of Brearley.

379
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,168
Hold on. Easy.

380
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,839
- What are you doing here?
- You're not supposed to be in here.

381
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,924
Could you leave us alone, sweetheart?

382
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,261
Of course.

383
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,558
Come have a seat.

384
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,569
I have some serious news.

385
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,696
It's bad news.

386
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,370
Your mother is sick.

387
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,207
She has lung cancer,
and it's very advanced.

388
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
I'm very sorry.

389
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,006
I've got to call her.

390
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,799
She doesn't want
you kids to know.

391
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,051
Then why are you telling me?

392
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,345
Because there's hope
she could have more time.

393
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,554
People do.

394
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,556
It's a tough road,
but it's a chance.

395
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,975
Well, that's good.

396
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,894
But she won't do it.

397
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,063
I don't know if she's just
being stubborn or vain,

398
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,731
but she won't even hear of it.

399
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,319
Henry, my ears are still buzzing.
I don't understand you.

400
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,446
I breached her confidence

401
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,948
because I want you to
talk some sense into her.

402
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,409
She'll listen to you.

403
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,289
I wouldn't know what to say.

404
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,754
It's okay for you to cry, honey.

405
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,122
Jesus, what am I gonna do?

406
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,689
How's she running?

407
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,441
Good as new.

408
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,235
I suppose you're gonna be
on your way then.

409
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,403
I should settle up.

410
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,613
Sure I can't talk you into
joining us tonight?

411
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,032
I should get going.

412
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,160
Mister, I know you're not in a rush.

413
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,829
We got plenty of tourists
with cars in the shop.

414
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,415
You made two phone calls
in six days.

415
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,000
Wyatt thought you ran away.

416
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,835
I don't know.

417
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,962
Tell you what.

418
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,132
I'll throw in the room tonight,

419
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,844
and I'll give you another night
if you fix the Coke machine.

420
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,554
I don't think I can help you with that.

421
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,598
I know you were right about your car,

422
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,850
and Sharon said she caught you
being handy.

423
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,935
Don't they fix it?

424
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,272
They want to give me a new one,
but I like this one.

425
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,523
I'll get my tools.

426
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,705
Hello? Smells good.

427
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,126
I brought you a surprise.

428
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,391
Betty.

429
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,522
What are you doing here?

430
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,899
I got in trouble at school again.

431
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,070
- What'd you do?
- I don't want to talk about it.

432
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,910
- Are we supposed to eat?
- Genie, come over here.

433
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,521
So, I'm gonna tell you in advance

434
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,524
that I know we seem like
fine people,

435
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,442
but I've been a little dishonest.

436
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,944
Okay.

437
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,865
This is a fundraiser for
Al Bettendorf over there.

438
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,283
His house burned down.

439
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,534
Well, the kitchen...

440
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,870
the most expensive room.

441
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,289
There's a fine jar.

442
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,379
We're just strangers,

443
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,799
but it does include barbecue
and I'm getting your drinks.

444
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,514
$40 for Don!

445
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,061
What's your rank,
and where did you serve?

446
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,646
7th Infantry. Korea.

447
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,607
Rank?

448
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,609
Lieutenant.

449
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,695
Lieutenant, 7th Infantry, Korea.

450
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,989
Shit, we should be paying him.

451
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,827
That's $5 for swearing.

452
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,413
What are you drinking?

453
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,380
I'll just have the shrimp cocktail.

454
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,092
Well, as Mother used to say,
"You're not that fat."

455
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,762
No, I have a...

456
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,347
Well, something came up.

457
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,557
Since I invited you?

458
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,019
You're always complaining
we never see each other.

459
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,521
Then I ask you to dinner,
miss a very important meeting,

460
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,190
and you have other plans.

461
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,400
It was very short notice.

462
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,238
If you need an alibi,
you're going to have to ask.

463
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,282
Please.

464
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,578
Now, what did you want to talk about?

465
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,790
Let me ask you something.

466
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,168
How do you know when something's
really an opportunity?

467
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,463
I'm wrong sometimes...

468
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,715
but the girls
aren't shy nowadays.

469
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,802
No, I meant in your career.

470
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,764
Well, in banking there's a road
and you just stay on it.

471
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,684
Still, you're required
to assess risk.

472
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,519
Pete, I don't buy or sell anything.

473
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,105
I just distribute,
and it's never up to me.

474
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,566
Fine, forget your business.

475
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,902
You're taking a risk tonight.

476
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,614
So now you're jealous,
and you're trying to ruin my evening.

477
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,742
Your wife knows. I'm not
asking you to imagine it.

478
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,327
I'm telling you she knows,

479
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,080
and how do you feel
now that you know that?

480
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,291
Judy's always loved that I was
attractive to other women.

481
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,668
It's part of what she likes about me.

482
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,294
I'm just supposed to turn that off?

483
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,380
You're not supposed to act on it.

484
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,966
But I always have.
That's the way we are.

485
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,801
But why?

486
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,680
Always looking for something better,
always looking for something else.

487
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,266
Because Dad was like that.

488
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,310
He really was, wasn't he?

489
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,691
You know, once at the Polo Grounds,

490
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,776
some jeweler
thanked him profusely

491
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,528
for buying a diamond necklace.

492
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,863
Dad got very cross,

493
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,073
and called off the sale
right in front of me.

494
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:11,036
He kept muttering
how the man was indiscreet.

495
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,620
I looked it up.

496
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,250
I didn't need any detective work.

497
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,044
I just saw the way
women looked at him.

498
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,382
You really think she knows?

499
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,302
I think it feels good
and then it doesn't.

500
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,848
I have to make a phone call.

501
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,767
Don't listen to me.

502
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,518
I'll be right back.

503
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,109
And Wayne's dad ran
the drugstore before Wayne did.

504
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,945
He was all Ten Commandments
rolled into one.

505
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,826
He caught us smoking,
stealing, cussing.

506
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,580
My wife went to high school with
these two. They were hooligans.

507
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,624
I didn't break
the real commandments

508
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,209
till I was in Europe.

509
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,169
Were you in Europe, Don?

510
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,421
Don was in Korea.

511
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,716
You don't just need new glasses.
You need a new hearing aid.

512
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,343
Well, he hasn't said anything.

513
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,054
Did you introduce him to...

514
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,474
Hey, Jerry! Jerry Fandango!

515
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,226
Get over here.

516
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,771
Jerry served in Korea.

517
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,690
So, you know,
maybe you've seen him before.

518
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,526
What the fuck do you farts want?

519
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,486
Gerald Fanning, this is...

520
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,447
Don was in Korea.
You two can reminisce.

521
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,368
I don't want to talk about it.

522
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,163
Jerry Fanning. PFC, 34th Infantry.

523
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,832
Come on, let me see your face.

524
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,045
When and where?

525
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,882
Before they called it a war,
near the Yalu River.

526
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:53,221
Oh, hell. I wasn't there
till, uh, Christmas '53.

527
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,643
I was home by then. Have a seat.

528
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,812
No, I got one.

529
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,897
Tell you one thing about Korea.

530
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,232
They can keep it.

531
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,618
Who did you talk to in there?

532
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,123
Bartender, Hallie Woods, Larry Stark.

533
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,875
What did Hallie say?

534
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,335
She gave me the runaround.

535
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,047
Go away.

536
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,716
What the hell happened to you?
You stood me up.

537
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,594
Get in here.

538
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,390
I never said I would go.

539
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,433
You did.

540
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,978
And Mike was waiting with Charlene
in the Grill Room for an hour!

541
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,731
For heaven's sake, you're drunk,

542
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,484
and you're being
very menacing right now.

543
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,238
I'm happy. Listen to me.
You're on a streak.

544
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,156
You're on one of those magic...

545
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,783
We used to call it a trend.

546
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,702
You know, because of the graph
where the line just goes up!

547
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,455
I don't know
what you're talking about.

548
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,167
Mike called me from his
hotel room. He was pretty sore.

549
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,710
So I told him you wanted to come,

550
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,587
but you were insulted by the offer.

551
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,673
- You what?
- He wants to do it all.

552
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,883
Company car, company plane,
signing bonus,

553
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,551
and he's gonna get you out of McCann.

554
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,262
He's going to give me $1 million?

555
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,430
He's gonna get very close
with stock options,

556
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,140
and McCann's gonna
cut a deal for the rest

557
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,725
because you're gonna help them.

558
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,270
Learjet's a tiny account.
It's peanuts to them.

559
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,605
You're not the client.
Your passengers are.

560
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,733
Jim Hobart's very excited
about who flies on those planes.

561
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,860
Every important CEO in America.

562
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,904
You talked to Jim Hobart?

563
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,408
You know what $100 buys you
in Wichita? A two-bedroom house.

564
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,494
You stupid wino. You're going
to destroy everything!

565
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,622
Who's gonna win
the World Series this year?

566
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,165
I don't know.

567
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,917
You are!

568
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,919
Because you are charmed,
my friend.

569
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,713
Good night, Duck.

570
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,550
I've been there.

571
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,884
It doesn't last long.

572
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:51,065
So the doctor says, "Sorry, son,
but your pecker's got gangrene.

573
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,067
"We're going to
have to amputate."

574
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,529
So the GI
goes to the Jap doctor.

575
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,074
"Oh, good news. No need to amputate.

576
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,827
"In three days,
will fall off by itself."

577
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,915
To Don!

578
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,919
For being generous
and not saying shit.

579
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,839
I don't know that many jokes.

580
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,257
Just leave him alone.

581
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,553
Don, you're not allowed to say,
"I don't want to talk about it" in this place.

582
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,430
That's why I never joined.

583
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,682
You're not listening to me.

584
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,643
You're among friends.

585
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,271
Floyd, tell him.

586
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,815
Floyd!

587
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,941
What?

588
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,320
Tell him about
the Hurtgen Forest.

589
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,239
Give me a drink.

590
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,283
Tell him the story first.

591
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,786
Oh, shit.

592
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,583
You know where it is?

593
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,546
It's on the border
between Belgium and Germany.

594
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,473
We were cut off.

595
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,517
Three of us.

596
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,395
Actually,

597
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,357
there were
nine of us originally.

598
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,655
We came on a machine gun nest.

599
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,577
There were four Krauts in there
looking to surrender.

600
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,331
They had their hands in the air
with their papers.

601
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,418
They were starving.
Don't skip that.

602
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,170
We were starving.

603
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,339
Scrounging for grub.

604
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,842
We were boiling bark.

605
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:49,016
So, there's three of us,
four of them,

606
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,186
and more snow coming.

607
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,900
You did what you had to do.

608
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,947
What did you do?

609
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,202
Someone made them start digging.

610
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,247
And we bounced them.

611
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,875
One at a time.

612
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,796
Took a couple of hours.

613
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,174
One of them was so skinny,

614
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,885
he tried to run away,
his pants fell down.

615
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,016
You know, they all got blue eyes.

616
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,274
You just do what you have to do
to come home.

617
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,573
I killed my CO.

618
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,874
We were under fire.

619
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,003
Fuel was everywhere.

620
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,883
And I dropped my lighter.

621
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,929
And I blew him apart.

622
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,645
And I got to go home.

623
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,443
That is the name...

624
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,237
of the game.

625
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,618
Hey, where is that kid?

626
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,204
We need a bottle over here!

627
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,457
Over here! Over here!

628
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,420
Get that kid
with the booze over here

629
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,550
'Cause the Yanks are coming

630
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,677
The Yanks are coming

631
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,556
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

632
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,601
Over there, over there

633
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,897
Send the word,
send the word over there

634
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,191
'Cause the Yanks are coming

635
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,110
The Yanks are coming

636
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,697
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

637
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,957
- Did I wake you?
- No.

638
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,845
Henry shouldn't have scared you.

639
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,014
I wanted to tell you myself.

640
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,767
He doesn't know
you won't get treatment

641
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,436
because you love the tragedy.

642
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,399
Sally, I've learned to believe people
when they tell you it's over.

643
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,777
They don't want to say it,
so it's usually the truth.

644
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,447
Henry said you could have a year.

645
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,490
And what would that year
be like?

646
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,284
I'll be with you.

647
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,869
I won't let you give up.

648
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,538
I know that.

649
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,834
But I watched my mother die.

650
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,378
I won't do that to you.

651
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,382
And I don't want you to think
I'm a quitter.

652
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,509
I've fought for plenty in my life.

653
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,387
That's how I know
when it's over.

654
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,890
It's not a weakness.

655
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,142
It's been a gift to me.

656
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
To know when to move on.

657
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,905
These are instructions.

658
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,408
Open it the minute
you know I'm gone.

659
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,744
No.

660
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,162
Listen to me.

661
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,207
Things happen very quickly
when people die.

662
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,126
Henry's not going to be able
to handle things.

663
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,092
You're going back to school in the morning.

664
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,678
I don't want you alarming
your brothers.

665
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,269
Go back to sleep.

666
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,955
What the hell?

667
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,374
We want our money.

668
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,792
What?

669
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,210
We know you took the money.

670
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,714
Let me go!
Sharon, what's going on?

671
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,341
Your car was fixed.
You should have been on your way.

672
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,470
Now, I don't know
who the hell you are,

673
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,015
but you've got five Mississippi
to get our money back.

674
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,976
I didn't take your money.

675
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,395
You threw all that money around

676
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,856
'cause you knew
you'd get it back.

677
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,738
I mean business!

678
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,533
You really think
I need your spare change?

679
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,965
Give us the cash
and you can have your car back.

680
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,842
Probably stolen.

681
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,011
We'll find out.

682
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,330
- My God, what's wrong?
- I need to speak with you.

683
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,583
My goodness, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Is everything all right?

684
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,466
You're scaring me.
Please, what is it?

685
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,718
It's good news.
Catch your breath.

686
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,222
What on earth is going on?

687
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,933
I was offered a job tonight.

688
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,185
Because its origins
were supernatural...

689
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,979
I realized that its benefits
might be as well.

690
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,399
I want you and Tammy
to come with me.

691
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,362
I want you to relocate
to Wichita, pick out a house,

692
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,405
and be my wife and family again.

693
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,535
Peter...

694
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,495
I'm not dismissing you.

695
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,498
I'm saying with respect

696
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,000
to whatever is happening
in your eyes right now,

697
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,045
we both know
things can't be undone.

698
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,505
Says who?

699
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,008
We're not even through
half our lives.

700
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,220
And even if we are,
we're entitled to more.

701
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,097
Of what?

702
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,309
Then we're entitled to
something new.

703
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,105
I want to start over.

704
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,608
And I know I can.

705
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,070
I'm not so dumb anymore.

706
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,198
I'm not ignoring the fact that
I could actually lose your love.

707
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,785
You never lost it...

708
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,371
but I will never allow you
to hurt me again.

709
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,292
I love you, too.

710
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,753
I always have.

711
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,673
I've never loved anyone else.

712
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,633
Never.

713
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,225
You think you can come in here

714
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,895
when I'm all disoriented
and say the things

715
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,897
I wanted you to say to me
two years ago

716
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,857
and make me run away with you?

717
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,277
I said it to you 10 years ago
and I'll say it again.

718
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
I do.

719
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,868
Wichita is beautiful.

720
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,745
And wholesome.

721
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,789
And not the city
and not Cos Cob.

722
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,752
And you'll have a plane to use
at your disposal. We will.

723
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,464
To pick up and go anywhere
anytime we want,

724
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,132
like driving to Montauk.

725
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,677
I want to go everywhere with you.

726
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,144
Say yes with your voice,
not just your eyes.

727
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,377
How will I explain this to Tammy?

728
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,380
Tell her...

729
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,132
her birthday wish came true.

730
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,182
I'm going to go.

731
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,269
And we're going to have dinner
on Saturday night...

732
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,896
the three of us...

733
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,857
like it was the first time.

734
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,501
Good morning.

735
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,989
This one's on the house.

736
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,952
What do you want to know?
You want to know what I told them?

737
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,496
I'm just being a good citizen, man.

738
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,040
You don't know anything about me.

739
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,332
I could kill you right now.

740
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,084
You took that money
and you set me up.

741
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,337
I don't know what you're talking about.

742
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,298
You have shitty instincts
for a con man.

743
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,842
You're lucky you feel guilty.

744
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,053
That's the one difference between
you and those animals right now.

745
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,680
I don't feel guilty taking
that drunk's money.

746
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,223
He burned his own house down.

747
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,893
He doesn't deserve a pot to piss in,
let alone 500 bucks.

748
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,227
You're gonna get me that money,

749
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,188
pack your bag
and get out of town.

750
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,940
I can't leave
without that money.

751
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,526
I know you think you know
how to hustle,

752
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,028
but this is a big crime,

753
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,613
stealing these people's money.

754
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,783
If you keep it, you'll have to
become somebody else.

755
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,327
And it's not
what you think it is.

756
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,415
You cannot get off on that foot
in this life.

757
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,377
What do you care? You got money.
I know you got money.

758
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,755
I cleaned your room
and didn't take nothing.

759
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,090
Anything!

760
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,593
You think this town is bad now?
Wait until you can never come back.

761
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,428
Can I go?

762
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,013
Go get the money.

763
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,048
I'm not paying for the room.

764
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,602
Could you drop me off
at the bus stop?

765
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,400
Get in.

766
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,873
I'm off.

767
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,666
Where are you going?

768
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,834
I have class.

769
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,004
Why are you doing that?

770
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,423
Why was I ever doing it?

771
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,780
"Dear Sally,
I know that you're frightened

772
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,034
"and there are many decisions
I can't prepare you for,

773
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,037
"but you must immediately tell the hospital
and the funeral director

774
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,955
"that I'm to be interred intact

775
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,166
"in the family plot
in West Laurel.

776
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,337
"Uncle William has the details
from Grandpa Gene's burial.

777
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,756
"I've also enclosed a portrait

778
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,675
"from the 1968 Republican
Winter Gala.

779
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,054
"The blue chiffon I wore
is my very favorite.

780
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,889
"I hung it in a gold garment bag

781
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,099
"in the hall closet
beside the mink.

782
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,895
"Please bring them the lipstick
from my handbag

783
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,606
"and remind them
how I like to wear my hair.

784
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,817
"Will you show them the picture?

785
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,489
"Sally, I always worried
about you

786
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,325
"because you march
to the beat of your own drum,

787
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,036
"but now I know that's good.

788
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,706
"I know your life
will be an adventure."

789
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,462
"I love you. Mom."

790
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,912
Pink slip's in the glove box.

791
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,999
What?

792
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,042
Don't waste this.
