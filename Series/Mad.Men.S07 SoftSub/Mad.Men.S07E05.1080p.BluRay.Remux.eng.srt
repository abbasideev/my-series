1
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,372
Good morning.

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,889
Plans for the weekend?

3
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,256
- California?
- Next weekend.

4
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,889
I want you to know
I haven't forgotten

5
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,864
your request
regarding Handi-Wrap.

6
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,230
I spoke to Lou and he's very happy
to have you on the business.

7
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,868
And, of course, you can assume
from our conversation that I am, too.

8
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,374
Thank you.

9
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,774
I hope you understand
I mean on the team.

10
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,915
That's exactly what I asked for.

11
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,586
Stop humming!
You're not happy!

12
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,759
Do you want me to introduce you?

13
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,396
I'm not interested in her.

14
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,465
She belongs to it
and it belongs to her.

15
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,569
- What is "it"?
- What, am I Cassandra?

16
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:09,299
That machine came for us.
And one by one...

17
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,843
- Good morning.
- Morning.

18
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,776
Morning, lovely.

19
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,340
What's wrong?

20
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,143
Do you know anything about this?

21
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,755
Where did you get this?

22
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,118
I found it on the Xerox machine.

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,022
And I thought,
"Wow, Shirley's gonna be

24
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,789
in a lot of trouble
for leaving it there."

25
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,160
- It's sensational stuff.
- I didn't leave it there.

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,699
But I appreciate its return.

27
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,359
It's got to be pretty recent.

28
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,835
He's got one about
Eisenhower's funeral.

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,804
I'm sure he'd prefer
you hadn't seen this.

30
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,104
Hmm, that's not
what Dr. Freud would say.

31
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,269
No one has seen this.

32
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,815
"Scout's Honor."

33
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,817
Mr. Ginsberg?

34
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,455
This thing's on the fritz.

35
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,653
S-T-R-A-T-E-G-Y.

36
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,321
Meredith, honey,
I don't want that spelled out,

37
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,864
I just want it spelled right.

38
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,059
Mr. Draper.

39
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,162
I was just talking to you.

40
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,568
There's a Stephanie Horton
calling collect.

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,300
Would you like
to accept the charges?

42
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,172
She says she's your niece.

43
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,404
Yes.
Yes, absolutely.

44
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,042
Hello, Stephanie.
It's Don.

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,417
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

46
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,586
Come on.
How are you?

47
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:38,161
How are you... Don?

48
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,525
About the same.

49
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,995
Is everything okay?

50
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,260
Well...

51
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,270
I suppose it probably sounds
like an emergency, but it's not.

52
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,375
I thought of you because, well...

53
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,101
it's not an emergency.

54
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,405
You're making it sound
like an emergency, sweetheart.

55
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,350
I'm pregnant.

56
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,281
I'm expecting.

57
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,614
And I'm running out
of bread and...

58
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,925
I hate that this is why I'm talking
to you after all this time.

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,221
I'm glad you called me.

60
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,920
That's what I'm here for.

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,692
I mean, you're my...

62
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,358
What'd you call yourself?
My niece.

63
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,893
I don't know why I said that.

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,233
No, that's what you are.

65
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,397
I like that.

66
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,599
Are you still in Berkeley?

67
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,975
I'm in LA.
That's where I ended up.

68
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,616
It's gonna be fine.
Do you have a pen?

69
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,607
How far along are you?

70
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,414
I think around seven months.

71
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,817
But my mom says I came early.

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,890
My wife, her name
is Megan Draper, lives in LA.

73
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,255
Can you get to Laurel Canyon?

74
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,591
I've got a car.
You got married again?

75
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,461
Yes.

76
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,296
She's gonna take care of you.

77
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,404
I want you to stay there.
I'm coming out tonight.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,732
I don't know.

79
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,739
I want to see you.
It's not up for debate.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,110
Thank you, Dick.

81
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,184
You may find the time by dialing

82
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,259
Meridian 7-1-2-1-2.

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,252
I'm sorry, can I speak
to Megan, please?

84
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,793
- Hello.
- Listen, I'm coming out tonight.

85
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,496
Oh, okay.
Is everything okay?

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,936
Not really.

87
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,803
You're gonna get a visit
from Stephanie Horton.

88
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,172
She's Anna Draper's niece.

89
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,541
She's expecting and she's alone

90
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,876
and she needs money
and I should see her.

91
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,318
Poor thing.

92
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,216
I'll cancel my party
and you can catch up.

93
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,515
What Pam?

94
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,989
You said you weren't
coming this weekend,

95
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,150
so I'm having the party
for my acting class.

96
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,354
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow night.

97
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,692
But I don't need to have it.

98
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,665
Or you can come.
Stephanie can come.

99
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,168
Don't worry about it.
We'll stay out of your way.

100
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,671
You don't have to pick me up.
I'll be in by 10:00.

101
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,833
I'm so sorry, Don.
We'll make her feel at home.

102
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,171
Who's there with you?

103
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,541
Amy from Delaware.

104
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,578
Could you get rid of her?
I'd rather keep this a family matter.

105
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,219
Okay.

106
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:21,090
I'm sorry this is the reason,
but I'm glad I get to see you.

107
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,229
Me, too. Bye.

108
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,523
Ooh.

109
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,363
Burger Chef's mascot
Little Chef is a flop

110
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,061
because he's, what,
another chef?

111
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,037
He doesn't eat the burgers,
he cooks them.

112
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,939
But what if you replaced him
with a fresh recruit?

113
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,876
A saucy little retard named Scout.

114
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,947
He can't work
at a hamburger stand.

115
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,550
He can take anything
but an order.

116
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,754
Hey, Don.

117
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,188
Stan, once the smoke clears,

118
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,758
I need you to rush some things out
for Handi-Wrap.

119
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,953
- I need it by 4:00.
- Mmm.

120
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,621
I'm really, truly busy.

121
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,461
What the hell is that?

122
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,070
Turns out Lou thinks
he's Mort Drucker.

123
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,540
- Mort Walker.
- How'd you get this?

124
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,044
It wasn't our fault.
Why is Scout always up to no good?

125
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,738
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.

126
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,316
Thought they were potatoes.

127
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,747
I'm gonna get rid of this.

128
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,821
He left it on the Xerox.
He obviously wanted us to have a copy.

129
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,049
You're just gonna force me
to draw my own.

130
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,750
I've got a plane to catch.
Get to work.

131
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,622
Don's still part of the faculty.

132
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,325
Naw, he's gonna stroke
to 'em later.

133
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,263
Why don't you let Loretta do that?

134
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,774
She can handle the homework.
I'll handle the silver.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,604
What'd you land on?

136
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,409
Rumaki, Crab Louie
on toast points,

137
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,449
and little franks
in barbecue sauce.

138
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,087
You know they've got
four more houses to visit after us?

139
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,849
I wanted to go first
to put everyone at ease.

140
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,754
They get so tongue-tied
around us.

141
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,021
They can only pretend so long
we're just regular neighbors.

142
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,624
Could you stock the bar?

143
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,670
Hi. Did you have
any trouble finding us?

144
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,365
No.

145
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,978
I'm Megan, by the way.

146
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,673
I'm Stephanie.

147
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,145
You are so beautiful.

148
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,019
I know, I'm a Madonna.

149
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,888
But you are truly magnetic.

150
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,463
What do you do?

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,464
Don didn't tell you?
I'm an actress.

152
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,395
Uh, welcome.

153
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,401
I'm grateful.

154
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,838
For some reason,
I'm not crying, man.

155
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,500
Well, why don't I fix you
something to eat

156
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,509
and then you can take
a shower if you want?

157
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,012
- Is it that bad?
- No!

158
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,844
I don't know.

159
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,644
I think you'd want to relax.

160
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,721
Don didn't say much about
your situation other than the obvious.

161
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,892
Your place is out of sight.

162
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,028
I'm at a flop in MacArthur Park,

163
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,686
but I'm headed up to Oakland
with a little help.

164
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,355
I have some friends there
and one of them's old man's a doctor.

165
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,233
So, assume it's no trouble at all.

166
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,201
What's your pleasure?
Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?

167
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,831
Do you have any meat?
I've been dreaming about it.

168
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,342
Sure.

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,377
Now you go into the bedroom
back there.

170
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,379
I changed the sheets.
There are towels.

171
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,849
You can lie down, run a bath,
whatever you want.

172
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,385
Make yourself at home.

173
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,046
Thank you.
I'm pretty beat.

174
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,634
You know I want her.

175
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,567
You can't have her.

176
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,604
Why can't I have her?

177
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,640
Because Scout's on 'er.

178
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,228
Nice of you to join us.

179
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,275
Don, why don't you take the mound,
throw out the first pitch?

180
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,675
Sure.

181
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,283
Stan has some
very preliminary work.

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,613
Stan?

183
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,517
Should I move over there
or do you want to come over here?

184
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,090
I don't know, Stan.
Can you be smug from over there?

185
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,527
Lou, I don't know
what you think you heard.

186
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,357
I heard everything!

187
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,501
From your first fart
to your last dying breath.

188
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,193
You think it's funny?

189
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,169
I apologize deeply.

190
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,705
What happened?

191
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,638
Let me ask you, Peggy.

192
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,971
- You ever heard of Underdog?
- The cartoon?

193
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,136
Yeah.
Sweet Polly Purebred.

194
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,611
Saturday morning.

195
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,478
It makes hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year.

196
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,053
Mostly for its creator Chet Stover
of Dancer Fitzgerald.

197
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,816
- Did you know him there?
- He was nothing special.

198
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,391
"Scout's Honor"
is 100 times better.

199
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,826
I can tell you right now,
it's a winner.

200
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,200
You know who had a ridiculous dream
and people laughed at him?

201
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,997
You?

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,639
What?

203
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,401
Oh, I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

204
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,012
I mean, if you're telling us
that this is your dream,

205
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,308
I apologize for being
one of those naysaying idiots.

206
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,916
I hate people like that.

207
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,586
Bob Dylan.

208
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,347
Is he hip enough for you?

209
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,719
He was 20 years old
when he wrote "Blowin' in the Wind"

210
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,861
and he's a genius.

211
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,394
Look at where he is,
look at where you are.

212
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,158
You know what?

213
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,496
You're a bunch
of flag-burning snots.

214
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,037
You've got a thing to learn
about patriotism and loyalty.

215
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,199
The very fabric of "Scout's Honor"
is a joke to you.

216
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,168
We're gonna have
this meeting later.

217
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,509
So order dinner
because I want finished work.

218
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,116
And if any of you don't like it,

219
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,880
you can thank
your hilarious friends here.

220
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,236
Last flight's at 9:00.
Put me on that.

221
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:46,036
- I'll cancel my plans.
- Just mine, not yours.

222
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,139
I don't know if it's vandals
or just kids being kids.

223
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,749
What is it?

224
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,283
Someone broke all the streetlights
on Peck Avenue.

225
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,045
And you want Henry
to get them fixed?

226
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,316
No. Mike was just saying
it's a national disease.

227
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,153
The wildness of the kids.

228
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,090
I just don't expect it
in Westchester.

229
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,231
I know all everyone wants
to talk about is Vietnam,

230
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,095
but things are
falling apart here, too.

231
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,728
The rumaki is exquisite.

232
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,838
Thank you.

233
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,838
Well, I don't know
that those things are unrelated.

234
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,568
I mean, first the kids
start off protesting

235
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,612
and the next thing you know
every authority is up for grabs.

236
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,410
I mean, if they learned
how to support their country,

237
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,610
sacrifice in hard times,
we'd have the morale to win the war.

238
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,817
Mike, you have plans for summer?

239
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,289
Even Nixon wants to bring
the war to an end.

240
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,086
I'm surprised, Henry.

241
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,662
Don't be, Mike.
I agree with Nixon.

242
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
I think it's too costly.

243
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,490
It has to be clone
on the right terms,

244
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,499
but I think we should get out
while the getting's good.

245
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,194
Since when?

246
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,931
I've always supported
the president, honey.

247
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,639
I think that maybe everyone
should fill up here.

248
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,804
I don't know
if my lamb turned out.

249
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,711
I'm sure it's delicious.

250
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,011
Let me check the Sterno.

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,531
Well, I think I worked
every side of the strategy.

252
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,328
Don, you've been the boss.

253
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,494
The briefcase and the hat,
that's a rookie maneuver.

254
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,230
You got someplace to be?

255
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,502
I'm afraid I do.

256
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,701
How's it going to look for them
if I let you go?

257
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,345
Well, you could let everybody go.

258
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,003
Is that what you would do?

259
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,846
No, I'd let you go, Lou.

260
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,917
Well, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

261
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,015
I'm gonna do you the courtesy
of reading these

262
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,422
so that you can continue to work on them
instead of coming up with new things,

263
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,063
because I'm gonna
tuck you in tonight.

264
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,535
About your cartoon.

265
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,534
Here we go.

266
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,765
This is an office made out of people
who have problems with authority.

267
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,603
You know you have to have
a thick skin, but don't help them.

268
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm not taking management advice
from Don Draper.

269
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,889
Hello?

270
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,026
I can't get out of here tonight.

271
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,355
Oh, I'm sorry.

272
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,397
- Is she there yet?
- She's taking a bath.

273
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,589
How is she?

274
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
She's pretty far along.

275
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,370
So beautiful.

276
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,635
Well, don't bother her.
Tell her I'll see her in the morning.

277
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,743
Don't worry.
I made her a steak.

278
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,572
Thank you.

279
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,910
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

280
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,416
Okay.

281
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,488
Damn, that smells good.

282
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,387
Don's stuck in New York.
He's flying in tomorrow morning.

283
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,928
Was that him?

284
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,759
Yeah, he's frustrated.
I told him not to worry.

285
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,928
Wait, do you want to eat outside?

286
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,298
I do that all the time.

287
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,467
I love that you're wearing
Anna's ring.

288
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,112
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.

289
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,280
I'm sorry I never met her.

290
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,612
She's around.
Believe me, you've met her.

291
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,777
She's happy it's in the family.

292
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,016
Well, maybe you'll have
someone there to give it to.

293
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,126
Oh, no.
It's yours now.

294
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,784
You'll probably have
someone of your own.

295
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:28,091
We'll see.
I don't know.

296
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,530
Don's kids are plenty for me.

297
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,468
I haven't eaten meat in a year.

298
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,470
I don't think this is a good idea.

299
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,472
I can make spaghetti.

300
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,879
It's probably hard
with you here and him there.

301
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,177
Are you with someone?

302
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,479
Not right now.
He was a musician.

303
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,144
They're the worst.

304
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,314
Dropped out of school.
Followed him down here.

305
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,357
Started flush at the beach,

306
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,360
ended up downtown panhandling.

307
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,125
And then he got busted
dealing grass

308
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,462
and we celebrated
before he went away.

309
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,299
He'll be out in a month.

310
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,566
So will this little guy.

311
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,074
- Does he know?
- No.

312
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,906
I'm afraid he'd murder someone
just to stay in jail.

313
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,813
- I won't tell Don.
- Oh, I don't care.

314
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,679
I know all of his secrets.

315
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,893
But you don't know him
very well.

316
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,826
You're right.
You're right.

317
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,430
It's just I'm looking at you

318
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,662
and seeing how, well,
disorganized this all is.

319
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,703
And I don't think
he'd stand for that.

320
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,900
I don't think he'd trust you
to make your own plans.

321
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,671
I don't know what I'm doing here.
This was a dumb idea.

322
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:55,376
No, no, I mean, he wants to help,
I'm sure, in his way.

323
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,077
We both do.

324
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,763
I'm going to give you."

325
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,297
would $1,000 get you far enough?

326
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,238
That's very generous.

327
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,901
This comes with no strings.

328
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,646
Thank you.

329
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,888
I really think it's better this way.

330
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,991
You're right.
I'm gonna take off.

331
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,717
You haven't eaten anything yet.

332
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,754
I guess I got what I came for.

333
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,557
There's no rush.

334
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,797
Nothing ever happened
between us, you know.

335
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,235
Of course not.

336
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,274
You're his niece.
I know that.

337
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,250
The children are asleep.

338
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,485
- What about your headache?
- Keep your voice down.

339
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,459
I did not appreciate going stag

340
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,098
to four people's homes
whom I barely know.

341
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,165
I'm sorry.
I wasn't feeling well.

342
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,597
You didn't have to go.

343
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:24,165
Hey, Emily Post, why were you
talking about the war?

344
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,809
I didn't bring it up.

345
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,002
But maybe I should more
because I didn't know where you stood.

346
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,544
I shouldn't have to brief you

347
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,205
because you shouldn't be
talking about those things.

348
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,147
I'm not a dinner companion.
I'm their elected representative.

349
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,810
- You ran unopposed.
- We'll see if that lasts.

350
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,979
From now on, keep your conversation
to how much you hate

351
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,127
getting toast crumbs in the butter
and leave the thinking to me!

352
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,726
Henry!

353
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,890
I'm sorry.
It just caught me off-guard.

354
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,231
Well, you embarrassed yourself
way more than me.

355
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,679
You know what?

356
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,344
I decided I can see that Monday.

357
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,222
Good night.

358
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,336
Hello?

359
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,036
What?

360
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,917
Is she okay?

361
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,123
Hello?

362
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,694
Oh, hi.

363
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,695
- Who are you?
- I'm Amy.

364
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,393
- We met on the phone.
- Is Megan here?

365
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,731
Oh, Don.
I...

366
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,567
Amy, do you mind?

367
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,266
I'll just use the ladies'.

368
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,412
I'm sorry, but she left.

369
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,482
You told her I wanted to see her?

370
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,586
I really tried to get her to stay.

371
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,417
But the money already came up
and I gave her $1,000.

372
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,752
She must have been embarrassed.

373
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,553
She said she'd call you
from Oakland.

374
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,061
You should have called me.
At least let me talk to her.

375
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,290
She's an adult, Don.

376
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,599
Do you want to go
to the market with us?

377
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,763
You know, I'm gonna have
company tonight.

378
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,500
Maybe it'll cheer you up.

379
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,411
We'll go.
Amy.

380
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,749
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

381
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,082
- We should go.
- Anything for you, Don?

382
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,485
I know what he likes.

383
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,203
Ahem.

384
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,427
We're back.

385
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,434
- Let me see.
- She's fine.

386
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,263
Couple of black eyes.

387
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,506
Ow.
Can I go lie down?

388
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,267
I want to know
what really happened.

389
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,707
They were sword fighting
with golf clubs.

390
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,370
- We're idiots, okay?
- You are.

391
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,107
You can't be trusted on your own.
That's your face, young lady.

392
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,082
That's right, it's my face.

393
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,711
- Why am I even here?
- Girls! Girls! Please.

394
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,221
Sally, you can understand

395
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,121
how your mother and I are both
worried about your nose.

396
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:39,729
Yeah, I know, because where would
Mom be without her perfect nose?

397
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,694
She wouldn't find
a man like you.

398
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,527
She'd be nothing.

399
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,726
It was a perfect nose.

400
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,632
And I gave it to you!

401
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,704
You're lucky Henry
is important enough

402
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,739
to get Dr. Kramer
to fix it this weekend.

403
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,377
I suppose you'd rather do it
in a barn in Farmington.

404
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,740
It's a nose job,
not an abortion.

405
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,473
- I'm going to break your arm next.
- Betty!

406
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,379
Don't worry about me
finding a man.

407
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,315
I already have you
to keep me in line.

408
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,285
You're going to your room and you're
going to wait there until morning.

409
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,823
Good, I prefer it.

410
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,569
Hello?

411
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,471
Just a minute.

412
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,441
It's for Megan again.

413
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,341
Megan?

414
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,743
It's Green Matt's.

415
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,342
Hello.

416
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,286
The main door was open
and you didn't check the peephole?

417
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,625
It's a bad neighborhood.

418
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,857
What are you doing here?

419
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,865
I wanted to tell you...

420
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,628
May I?

421
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,294
Michael.

422
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,771
I was just in the office
and there's something going on.

423
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,932
- What?
- The computer.

424
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,511
It's Saturday.
Take the day off.

425
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,648
That's right,
so why were Lou and Cutler

426
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,805
having a secret meeting
in that air-conditioned lair?

427
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,782
- I don't know.
- But I do.

428
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,353
They're homos.

429
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,353
Okay.

430
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,150
Anything else to report?

431
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,691
Peggy, it's serious.

432
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,954
That machine makes men
do unnatural things.

433
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,392
What did you see?

434
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,332
- Who are you?
- This is Julio.

435
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,166
- Hello.
- Hey.

436
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,831
I'd like to say Peggy's mentioned you
at work, but she hasn't.

437
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,670
Julio lives upstairs.

438
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,506
Interesting arrangement.
Very modern.

439
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,976
I live with my mama.

440
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,414
I live with my pop,
which is why I can't work at home.

441
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,849
Can I please work here?
I can't go back to the office.

442
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,886
Not right now.
I'll stay out of your way.

443
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,517
Fine.

444
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,887
Can I use your typewriter?

445
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,030
It's too loud.

446
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,129
I wouldn't have invited them both
if I had known.

447
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,460
I swear, I thought
she was his daughter.

448
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,795
Don't you kind of want
to see what happens?

449
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,732
I'm doing fine.

450
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,144
I don't think you are doing fine.

451
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,285
Maybe I'm not in the mood.

452
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,945
Oh, sorry.

453
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,988
This is why I never
invite musicians.

454
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,299
Boo!

455
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,437
What a merry band
of players we are.

456
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:18,980
So you're an actress, too?

457
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,744
I will be if someone will let me.

458
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,437
Come on.

459
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,152
Come on in.

460
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,532
Want another drink?

461
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,403
Is that Harry?

462
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,073
Don. Megan.

463
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,585
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,690
Miranda here invited me to a party.
I didn't know this was it.

465
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,120
Hi, Miranda.

466
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,954
This place is out of sight.

467
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,392
I've been trying to help
Miranda find an agent.

468
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,190
You're so helpful.

469
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,258
Harry, what do you say
we go get a drink?

470
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,032
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

471
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,732
As long as Harry drives.

472
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,242
Well, I-we...

473
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,211
should I bring Miranda along?

474
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,044
Do you want to?

475
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,915
Sorry, honey.

476
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,584
We'll get you a ride.

477
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,498
She better not catch you in here.

478
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,730
But then I'm not
gonna get to see you.

479
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,773
That's the way Betty likes it.

480
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,769
Are they gonna get divorced?

481
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,935
What? No.

482
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,082
They're the Dynamic Duo.

483
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,343
That's never going to happen.

484
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:12,080
The other night, they were
really screaming at each other.

485
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,622
I saw Henry take
a pillow to the den.

486
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,849
I'm gonna hitch
back to school tonight.

487
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,461
Can I come with you?

488
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,529
You want to run away?

489
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,329
I have a stomach ache
all the time.

490
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,469
You're not gonna piss, are you?

491
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,942
I don't do that anymore.

492
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,812
I'm sorry.

493
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,816
They'll never let you out.

494
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,955
You're too little.

495
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,830
- Michael.
- I'm sorry.

496
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,970
The kid left an hour ago.

497
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,128
It's interesting because
first you were dead,

498
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,673
then all this activity
started in your eyelids.

499
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,504
Time to go.

500
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,737
There's this pressure in my head

501
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,245
like there's a hydrogen bomb
that's gonna go off.

502
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:16,352
And then I realize
it's that hum in the office.

503
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,078
It's getting to me.

504
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,654
I caught myself looking
at Stan's shoulders

505
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,189
and getting, you know, excited.

506
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,351
- Really?
- That's the computer's plan.

507
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,326
Turn us all homo.

508
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,864
Peggy, we got to reproduce.

509
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,369
If there was a way to do it
without having sex, I'd do it.

510
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,836
Stop it!

511
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,201
You have to leave.

512
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,401
Great. What am I doing?
It's building up.

513
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,273
Well, maybe you should see
a doctor or something.

514
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,381
Why?
'Cause I want you?

515
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,380
No, because you're not right.

516
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,917
Did you notice the radio
doesn't work in there anymore?

517
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,748
That's not my imagination.

518
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,753
It's just a computer!

519
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,227
No, you're right.

520
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,889
I'm gonna go.

521
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,742
You don't have to report
this information.

522
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,104
Good night.

523
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,426
This is so much better.

524
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,765
Do you not want to talk?

525
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,265
Because you seemed
so happy to see me.

526
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,664
I was. I am.

527
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:44,103
Good. 'Cause I was
happy to see you.

528
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,608
You know what, Don?
I am put in a strange position.

529
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:57,117
But I want you to know
I respect you.

530
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,581
Agencies change.

531
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,920
For the better, maybe.

532
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,120
But guys like us, we've got
to look out for each other.

533
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,027
I'm not gonna tell your wife.

534
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,792
That's not what I meant.

535
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:16,201
You wouldn't do that.

536
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,369
We go back along way, don't we?

537
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,671
We do.

538
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,872
Well, I'm going to make sure

539
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,176
that you're still important.

540
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:32,652
I don't know how.
It's gonna take some thought.

541
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,984
It's going to take
some major brain power.

542
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,683
In fact, you might
have to figure it out.

543
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,025
I think the solution here
is not to get rid of you.

544
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,996
You should be in LA.

545
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,136
Your wife's out here.
Ted Chaough is useless.

546
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,034
Use-less.

547
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,835
Ted Chaough.
Broken man.

548
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,377
What solution?

549
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,675
Oh, this is the final solution.

550
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,012
Cutler and Lou
are pursuing Commander.

551
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,818
- Commander who?
- No, Commander cigarettes.

552
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,514
Philip Morris.

553
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,557
I think they're pretty sure
that they can land it

554
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,251
and you'll have to go.

555
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,663
How long has this been going on?
Is there work?

556
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,204
Don't make me sorry I told you.

557
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,502
I hope you know how much
I appreciate this.

558
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,708
So far, just phone calls.

559
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,715
But I turned in
the media plan yesterday.

560
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,346
Can we get another round?

561
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,690
Hello.

562
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,424
Everybody just left.

563
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,261
Not everybody.

564
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,133
Wilma!

565
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,137
Ah!

566
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,906
How was the night on the town
with Harry Crane?

567
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,108
Educational.

568
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,411
You know what would
make you feel better?

569
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,985
Drugs.

570
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,058
I'm tired.

571
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,889
But you just got here.

572
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,456
I'm going to bed.

573
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,393
There goes the fun.

574
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,794
I'm supposed to tuck you in.

575
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,263
And what does your friend say?

576
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,363
I don't want you to be
in a bad mood.

577
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,099
Stop playing around.
You're stoned.

578
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,508
Don't you like Amy?

579
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,703
Leave him alone.

580
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,613
This is the best place
to be right now, Don.

581
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,158
Right here.

582
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,495
Kiss her.
I know you want to.

583
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,729
I don't want anything right now.

584
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,199
Don't lie.

585
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,727
- Hey.
- I can't find the coffee.

586
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,798
I'll get it.

587
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,606
Good morning.

588
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,119
Hello?

589
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,588
Oh, yes, hi.
He made it.

590
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:38,694
It's Stephanie.

591
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,352
Oh.

592
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,660
Where are you?

593
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,199
I'm back in Oakland.

594
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,200
I felt bad about missing you,
but I didn't want to break my word.

595
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,805
You did. You told me
you were gonna be here.

596
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,873
I know, but I kind of promised Anna
I'd let you live your life.

597
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,447
That is not what she meant.

598
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,811
Like it or not,
I'm worried about you.

599
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,488
I want you to call me
when the baby comes.

600
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,490
I want to take care
of anything you need.

601
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,356
I'm so grateful.

602
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,963
And that Megan's really solid.

603
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,962
Thank her for me again.

604
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,900
You have my number.

605
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,198
Bye-bye.

606
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,684
- I'm sorry.
- She sounds okay.

607
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,745
I have to get back.

608
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,356
Harry told me some things
I shouldn't have been told.

609
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,052
- What is wrong with him?
- No, I'm glad.

610
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,663
But I have to get back.

611
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,527
Really?

612
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,094
But you're still coming back
next weekend, right?

613
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,704
Of course.

614
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,703
Hello, everyone.

615
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,205
Bye, everyone.

616
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,741
I'm making coffee.

617
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,709
I'm gonna split.

618
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,541
Great party.

619
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,948
I'm gonna shower.

620
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:29,531
"Abendlich Strahlt
der Sonne Auge" playing

621
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,640
How'd it go?

622
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,969
She doesn't need an operation.

623
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,578
It's not even broken.

624
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,045
Come on.
Let's go inside.

625
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,411
I'm comfortable here right now.

626
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,982
I just drove to White Plains
and back up to Farmington.

627
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,748
I don't want to sit
in the kitchen like the help.

628
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,414
"The help"?

629
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,582
I'm going to assume
you're not referring to me.

630
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,955
What's gotten into you?

631
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,724
You come in and ask me to move
just because you feel like moving.

632
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,994
I'm comfortable in here
or I wouldn't be sitting in here!

633
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,603
Knock it off.

634
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,761
I'm tired of everyone
telling me to shut up.

635
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,771
I'm not stupid.

636
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,568
I speak Italian.

637
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,840
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

638
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,609
You're sorry you forgot to inform me
what I am supposed to think.

639
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,343
Guess what.
I think all by myself.

640
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,079
You're so smart.
Why don't you run for office?

641
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,245
You know what, Henry?

642
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,689
I don't know what I'm going to do,
but that's a good idea.

643
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,338
Good morning, Michael.

644
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,030
How are you?

645
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,301
Can't you tell?
I'm myself again.

646
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:46,472
Oh, good.
Glad to hear that.

647
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,516
But I do want to say
in the clearness of day,

648
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,051
I have feelings for you.

649
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,780
Well, I'm flattered.

650
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:57,722
And that happens
when you work with people,

651
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,987
but it's not real.

652
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,358
I realized it was the waves of data.

653
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,830
They were filling me up.
I had to find the release.

654
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,832
I removed the pressure.

655
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,993
Now it just flows through me
without affecting me at all.

656
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,037
It has an outlet.
Open it.

657
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,167
You don't have
to thank me for that.

658
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,575
It's obviously something
you did on your own.

659
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,812
What is that?

660
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,888
It's my nipple.
It's the valve.

661
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,527
It's weird... they'll sew it up,
but they won't take it off.

662
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,355
I had to do that myself.

663
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,763
Anyway, I'm grateful,
so I wanted to show it.

664
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,438
Michael, sit down.

665
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,047
I want you to wait here.

666
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,059
Did Mr. Ginsberg find you?

667
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,971
"Savoy" playing

668
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,794
Jim, Lou.
Sorry to interrupt.

669
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,162
You must be Les.
Don Draper.

670
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,735
Don.

671
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,771
This is Stephen and Tony.

672
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,305
We weren't expecting you, Don.

673
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,773
I know that and I apologize.

674
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,173
I just wanted to say
something that I think

675
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:00,009
these gentlemen from Philip Morris
are too polite to say.

676
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,946
We know who you are

677
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,950
and we're only talking
about a presentation right now.

678
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,113
But we do have a problem
working with the man

679
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,350
who cut our throat
in "The New York Times."

680
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:16,190
Well, if you were
to give us a shot,

681
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:19,335
I'm prepared
to leave the agency.

682
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,470
Don, thanks for saying that
so that we don't have to.

683
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,275
Just know the man
that wrote that letter

684
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,935
was trying to save his business,
not destroy yours.

685
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:35,881
Like Lou, I have over 10 years
of tobacco experience.

686
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,815
Since my first day
on Lucky Strike,

687
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,319
the government
was building a scaffold

688
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,889
for your whole industry.

689
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,684
And I found a way to stay
that execution

690
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:48,024
in '60, '62, '64, and '65.

691
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,532
I'm also the only cigarette man
who sat down with the opposition.

692
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,501
They shared
their strategy with me

693
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,836
and I know how to beat it.

694
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,501
That may be true,

695
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,239
but we don't turn on our friends
as easily as you do.

696
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,046
I just keep thinking
what your friends

697
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,885
at American Tobacco would think
if you made me apologize.

698
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,357
Force me into your service.

699
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,898
They are still your competition,
