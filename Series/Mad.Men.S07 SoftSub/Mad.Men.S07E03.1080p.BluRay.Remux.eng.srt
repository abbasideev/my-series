1
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,200
Dawn Chambers, please.

2
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,146
- Dawn Chambers.
- I'm glad I caught you.

3
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,145
I need ribbon for my typewriter.

4
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,079
It's a Coronet.

5
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,880
And I have letterhead,
but I could use a ream of onionskin.

6
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,044
Okay.

7
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,555
And I wrote a letter
to Fritz over at Leica.

8
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,716
I'm going to need
an airmail envelope.

9
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,089
I can get these
sent over to you right now.

10
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,596
- Just bring them with you.
- Mr. Draper, I'm swamped.

11
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,428
I have to get a schedule out
for a shoot.

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,763
So you can come a little later.
What are you shooting?

13
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,270
- Mountain Dew.
- Oh.

14
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,736
What is it?

15
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,571
Um, it's called "Invisible Boy."

16
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,974
It's this kid...

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,614
Ginsberg finally got that through.

18
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,613
I guess so.

19
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,584
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can get
a messenger to you in 20 minutes,

20
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,120
unless you're going out.

21
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,348
Obviously I didn't
make any plans.

22
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,288
I was expecting you
to come over.

23
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,950
Were there any calls?

24
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,529
Just Mr. Alan Silver

25
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,030
from the Paul Kohner Agency
in Los Angeles.

26
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,929
Can you get him on the line?

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,468
I'm sorry, my phone
is ringing off the hook.

28
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,630
I hope it's okay.
He says you have his number.

29
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,207
Or I can give it to you again.

30
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,366
No, Dawn, I want you
to call him.

31
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,638
I, uh... can you hold?

32
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,720
Don Draper for Alan Silver.

33
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,358
Don.
Glad I caught you.

34
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,197
I was beginning to give up hope.

35
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,032
How can I help you?

36
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,300
It's a bit of a casting issue.

37
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,034
I don't know if I can
help you with that.

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,839
Well, it has to do with our girl.

39
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,482
And I'm probably overreacting,

40
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,175
but you're the closest thing
to a manager

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,048
and, let's face it, you probably
have more influence.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,689
You better.

43
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,155
Just get to it, Alan.

44
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,158
Megan went into an audition

45
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,356
and performed adequately
from what I can tell

46
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,432
and by the time she got
to the parking lot

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,194
decided to call casting

48
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,702
and ask if she could come back in
and do it differently.

49
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,340
So she's persistent.

50
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,535
On Sunday she got
the director's number

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,204
from someone in her acting <i>class,</i>
called his home,

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,943
then managed to run into him
at the Brentwood Country Mart

53
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,611
while he was having lunch
with Rod Serling.

54
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,555
She met Rod Serling?

55
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,023
I don't even know
if she knew he was there.

56
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,527
She apparently pled
her case in tears

57
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,529
and demanded another reading.

58
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,100
Why would she do that?

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,964
It's not like I've never
seen this before.

60
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,434
They lose their confidence.

61
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,540
But I don't want anyone
to have that anecdote.

62
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,539
It's best we nip this in the bud.

63
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,542
Well, what am I supposed to do?

64
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,544
You know her better than I do.

65
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,876
I tried to talk to her,
but she hung up.

66
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,245
You have to tell her to relax.

67
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,910
She really is doing well
as the new girl in town.

68
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,112
Yeah.

69
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,259
Well, then, I don't want to take up
any more of your precious time.

70
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,722
Yeah, thank you.

71
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,144
It's the Clios.
Who cares?

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,441
I do, but you shouldn't
give them the power

73
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,845
to decide who shall live
and who shall die.

74
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,454
Stan and I are part of the agency
and Playtex is our client.

75
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,851
We'd feel the same
if it was the other way around.

76
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,254
Would you describe that
<i>as</i> patronizing?

77
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,861
I'm not taking anything
away from anybody.

78
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,431
But I'm not going to do
better work than St. Joseph's.

79
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,295
Lou's finishing his call.

80
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,626
You'll get 'em next year.

81
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,005
I gave that account
to you when I left.

82
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,767
I worked Playtex for years.

83
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,845
Well, maybe you
didn't work it right.

84
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,180
Send in the cavalry.

85
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,224
Morning.

86
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,224
Mr. Draper, good morning.

87
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,794
A weekday?
What a treat.

88
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,795
Nice to see you, Tricia.

89
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,399
No briefcase?

90
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,535
I'm going to surprise my wife.

91
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,331
I've said it before...
I hate her.

92
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,071
What can I get you?

93
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,007
Tomato juice.

94
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,816
Freeze-frame as our stallion
runs through the background.

95
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,350
The bottle appears.

96
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,919
Announcer... "Chevalier Noir.

97
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,522
More horsepower."

98
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,589
Why is there artwork?

99
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,523
Well, I believe it really helps
if you see it.

100
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,425
You understand every hour
he works costs money?

101
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,997
You can't be hypothetical.

102
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,327
- It took a second, Lou.
- Stay out of it, Rizzo.

103
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,663
It's already done.
Would you just look at it?

104
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,828
Who put a knot
in your pantyhose?

105
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,709
She's upset because
I got nominated for a Clio

106
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,208
and "Rosemary's Baby" didn't.

107
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,176
I don't care about awards.

108
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,441
Oh, sorry, Peggy.

109
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,245
Jim pulled it
because St. Joseph's

110
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,514
was still unhappy
about going over budget

111
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,522
and all the awards
Ted's already won for them.

112
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,354
They're upset about winning?

113
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,427
You know clients hate awards.

114
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,394
That's why Ogilvy never submits.

115
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,432
He does it for the clients.
Trust me.

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,196
Wasn't Ogilvy the chairman
of the Clios last year?

117
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,033
That's comforting...
you weren't rejected.

118
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,640
You weren't even considered.

119
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,105
- Are we finished?
- Sorry about that.

120
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,112
- You want to go to color?
- Ask your boss.

121
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,724
I'm usually by his side.

122
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,884
The real challenge in our life has been
trying to get Rocky's attention.

123
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,552
Rocky.

124
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,722
I told you last time to tell him
that I'm an admirer.

125
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,900
After Henry patched things up,

126
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,470
he'd hoped to be on
the short list for AG.

127
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,937
Attorney general.

128
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,269
But I shouldn't be
talking about this.

129
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,843
How are things in real estate?

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,412
I'm a travel agent, Betty.

131
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,810
But you're still going to take
that exam again, aren't you?

132
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,747
No, it's going swimmingly.

133
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,786
I'm in the office
three days a week now.

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,017
"Wanderlust Travel."

135
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,958
- That's spicy.
- Take a few.

136
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,290
I'm sure you'll need them.

137
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,262
Henry's secretary
takes care of all that.

138
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,162
But she still has to book
through somebody.

139
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,167
Trust me, it's not all about breaking
the rack rate on a hotel room.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,135
It's about perfection.

141
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,798
One of my clients told me
that I redefined

142
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,205
his definition of first class.

143
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,642
Three days a week in an office.

144
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,011
What's that like?

145
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,551
It's a little shopping center
in Dobbs Ferry.

146
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,985
Just a storefront, really.
A bunch of desks.

147
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,647
Everybody's on the phone
all the time,

148
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,815
so you have to keep
one finger in your ear.

149
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,893
I have three phones
and no secretary.

150
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,327
Sometimes I can't turn my neck
when I get home.

151
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,660
Doesn't Carlton complain?

152
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,994
He likes the money.

153
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,159
He wants me to let the girl go,
and I probably should.

154
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,999
Ernie and Jenny
are walking to school now.

155
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,641
Well, Gene's a few years
away from that.

156
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,167
Oh, your time's occupied.

157
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,040
But for the rest of us,

158
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,647
as they get older,
there's less and less to do.

159
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,013
Being alone in the house
all that time.

160
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,812
I really needed a challenge.

161
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,219
Well, there's still plenty
of challenges ahead, believe me.

162
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,327
Fine, I needed a reward.

163
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,588
I thought they were the reward.

164
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,231
I don't know.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned.

165
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,535
Betty Draper, that is indeed
how I would describe you.

166
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,031
I want that streusel coffee cake.
Will you split?

167
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,700
Of course.

168
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,182
Well, hello.
How are you doing, Tom?

169
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,678
- Randall.
- Good.

170
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,053
Our good friends at Koss here,
and frankly I'll include myself,

171
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,023
have a few questions for you.

172
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,560
I'd love to explain anything.

173
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,391
I think it's the media plan
we agreed upon.

174
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,897
No.

175
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,695
It's about this article
from a few weeks back.

176
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,070
Yes, I've seen this, obviously.

177
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,230
I'm very happy
with our media plan,

178
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,708
but Grey has this computer
that they're opening up to everybody.

179
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,541
We just thought maybe
we should look into it.

180
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,239
Or you should.

181
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,544
Look, may I sit down?

182
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,584
This is a very enviable piece of PR.

183
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,158
Grey gets "The New York Times"
to tell all about their computer

184
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,296
by offering their services
up to the world.

185
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,330
But I swear, as clever as it is,
it's just PR.

186
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,468
I'm an engineer.

187
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,762
You can explain to me
what the difference is

188
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,405
between their computer
and your computer.

189
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,939
Well, computers don't think.
People do.

190
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,338
And the data accumulated
by me and my department

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,776
reflects the same
national availability of media.

192
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,439
What we will be able to offer soon
is local data as well.

193
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,454
We will be able to integrate local
and national markets into one report.

194
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,918
We are developing that program.

195
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,580
There you have it.

196
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,282
You'll forgive me,

197
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,088
but Grey's does sound
very impressive.

198
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,094
They're a different kind of agency.

199
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,496
I wasn't even invited to this meeting
because this is about your business.

200
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,932
Koss, that's the only name
that should be in the paper.

201
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,435
Very well put.

202
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,038
Tom, does that put you at ease?

203
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,808
I'm really sorry
to put you through that.

204
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,880
Randy warned me,
but, you know, I got to ask.

205
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,175
I'll walk you out.

206
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,843
You said you wanted to poke
your head in and say hi to Peggy?

207
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,480
It's good to see you.
Got to get you out on that boat.

208
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,150
Thank you, Jim.
Harry, always a pleasure.

209
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,063
What are you smiling about?

210
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,032
Did you not call for a fireman?

211
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,173
Why the hell is Grey Advertising
coming up in my meeting?

212
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,069
Well, that article
could have been about us

213
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,471
if anyone appreciated
our media department.

214
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,476
Are you aware your self-pity
is distasteful?

215
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,138
You know what?
This conversation is over.

216
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm really not interested.

217
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,169
Hello.

218
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,444
You're here!
You surprised me!

219
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,050
Maybe I got your hints.

220
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,749
I've never, ever admitted
that I wanted this.

221
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,862
What happened?
Did you get fired?

222
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,559
I just had a hankering.

223
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,133
Really?

224
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,137
Well, an extra special hankering
you shall get.

225
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,282
Hello.

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,420
Loretta, please.

227
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,919
They're not watching.

228
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,214
No, I believe they're not
interested in that.

229
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,985
Aren't you helping Bobby
with his homework?

230
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,150
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,560
You got to sign this slip
for Bobby's field trip.

232
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,392
How was everyone today?

233
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,594
They're little angels.

234
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,771
They're looking for chaperones.
I can take Genie along.

235
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,434
Well, if you can remember
to turn this in, I want to go along.

236
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,581
You do?
You're gonna come?

237
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,943
Yes.
Yes, lam.

238
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,948
Great.
It's Miss Keyser's dad's farm.

239
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,781
She grew up there
and they make butter and grow eggs.

240
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,786
Well, we'll see all that,
won't we?

241
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,447
I'm going to change.

242
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,121
I really needed that.

243
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,258
I really needed this.

244
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,297
So I could have been anyone.

245
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,873
It's your own fault.

246
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,136
I think I've been alone too much.

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,110
You have so many friends,
I can't keep track.

248
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,806
I don't know.

249
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,522
It's sunny here
for everyone but me.

250
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,953
I'm walking around
in a cloud of "no."

251
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:14,162
Megan, you know,
they're getting rejected, too.

252
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:19,230
Maybe they're just
handling it better.

253
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,230
That's a terrible thing to say.

254
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,842
I'm speaking from experience.

255
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,911
You can't let it erode
your confidence.

256
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,417
And you can't get angry
or desperate.

257
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,644
I know that.

258
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,719
I know all that.

259
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,018
What the hell are you doing here?

260
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,218
Alan called me.

261
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,593
What?
He called you?

262
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,897
I'm your husband.
He was worried.

263
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,163
Great, now I have to fire him.

264
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,898
What am I gonna do?
How am I gonna find someone new?

265
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,064
You don't have to fire anyone.

266
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,767
You just have to stop acting
like a lunatic.

267
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,241
What did he say?

268
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,507
You know what?
Forget it.

269
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,049
So you came out here to what?

270
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,016
Pull me out of a bathtub
where I slit my wrists?

271
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,553
I'll admit it, I was worried.

272
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,884
Well, thanks for the visit, Daddy.

273
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,956
I was stupid for thinking
you could possibly miss me.

274
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,926
I do miss you.

275
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,465
No, you don't.

276
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,069
I should fly in and surprise you.

277
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,963
Yeah, that's a scary thought,
isn't it?

278
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,904
- No.
- Really?

279
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,771
You're never there when I call

280
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,913
and you always
have to call me back.

281
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,445
And it's always quiet.

282
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,742
Where is it quiet in that office?

283
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,579
And I've never even heard
a typewriter.

284
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,153
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is true.

285
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,257
I'm sorry I had to interrupt
your love affairs

286
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,949
with the disaster of my career.

287
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,492
Megan, sit down.

288
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,062
I was your secretary, remember?

289
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,926
I know what you're like
when you're left alone.

290
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,829
- You're acting crazy.
- So where are you?

291
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,596
Why can't I reach you?
Who's your new girl, Don?

292
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,434
There is no one else.

293
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,772
I've been at home.

294
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,074
They put me on leave, okay?

295
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,946
You lost your job?

296
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,686
Don't worry,
I'm still getting paid.

297
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,781
I don't give a shit.
When did this happen?

298
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,518
Right after you left.

299
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,461
They fired you last year?

300
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,795
I didn't get fired.
That's the thing.

301
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,700
I don't know if they want me
or they don't want me.

302
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,641
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,299
Because I messed up

304
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,467
and I didn't want you to know
until I fixed it.

305
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,511
And there is no one else.
I've been good.

306
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,376
I haven't even been
drinking that much.

307
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,019
So with a clear head,

308
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,885
you got up every day and decided

309
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,617
that you didn't
want to be with me?

310
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,390
Megan.

311
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,499
Mm, I'm not walking
out of my own house.

312
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,838
So that means you have to leave.

313
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,206
Have you calmed down?

314
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm not kidding around.

315
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,483
I want you to call a cab,
get on a plane, go home.

316
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,025
I don't want you to worry
about me anymore.

317
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,497
- Stop it.
- It's okay, Don.

318
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,401
This is the way it ends.

319
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,731
It's going to be so much
easier for both of us.

320
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,594
I have Mr. Grady calling.

321
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,561
He's from
"The Wall Street Journal."

322
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,962
Really?
Put him through.

323
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,139
Ahem, Harold Crane here.

324
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,971
We have a situation.

325
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,602
I know this isn't the message,

326
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,113
but we can all learn something
from the funeral business.

327
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,910
Did you tell "The Wall Street Journal"
to give me a call?

328
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,815
I felt badly about diminishing
your contributions

329
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,218
in this morning's meeting.

330
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,916
And let's face it, this computer
situation is an arms race.

331
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,323
There's no point in winning
if people don't know.

332
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,760
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

333
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,228
What?

334
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,958
Believe me, I ask for one
every Christmas

335
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,659
and no one even bothers to say no.

336
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,499
Well, why did you tell
the client we do?

337
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,106
It's semantics.

338
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,799
We use a computer,
therefore I call it our computer.

339
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,945
But it's actually
someone else's computer.

340
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,105
And the local markets program?

341
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,305
It's a great idea.

342
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,974
I'm sure someone's
going to do that.

343
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,613
You have stiff competition,
but I believe you to be

344
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,919
the most dishonest man
I have ever worked with.

345
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,460
I didn't call
"The Wall Street Journal."

346
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,756
Kill it.

347
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,331
Dave Wooster's office.
- Is Dave in?

348
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,972
It's Clarence Birdseye calling.

349
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,039
Just a minute.
Let me see if he's available.

350
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,044
Well, hello, Don.

351
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,148
Enough dancing around.
Let's have dinner.

352
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,806
How's tonight?

353
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,453
7:30.
The Algonquin.

354
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,660
Well, while we're digesting,

355
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,560
perhaps you should do
a little digesting.

356
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,164
You can look at it now
or you can put it in your pocket,

357
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,502
but you can't use it
as a coaster.

358
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,843
Why don't you just
tell me what's in it?

359
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,982
Why don't you look?

360
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,981
- That's coy.
- No, that's drama.

361
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,848
Excuse me.

362
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,184
I'm sure you caught my eye
during dinner.

363
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,919
I was only staring because I believe
we know each other.

364
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,691
Emily Arnett?

365
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,765
I'm afraid I can't place you.

366
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,932
I don't mean
to interrupt anything.

368
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,044
Would you like to join us?

369
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,372
No, I'm off to bed.

370
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,880
Hopefully I'll be able to sleep.

371
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,179
I'm on the top floor
right next to the elevator.

372
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,378
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

373
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,525
Have a good night.

374
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,057
Who was she?

375
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,221
Fellas, there's no need
for the hard sell.

376
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,095
We had nothing to do with that.

377
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,203
I wish I'd thought of it.

378
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,735
Should we get another drink
or do you have someplace to be?

379
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,656
Hello.

380
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,226
What are you doing here?

381
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,420
Are you alone?

382
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,826
For the time being.

383
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,599
I came by because I had
a quick question.

384
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,604
- Shoot.
- How do you sleep at night?

385
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,642
You know what?
I called you at Christmas.

386
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,837
I'm sorry I opened the door.
I was expecting a BLT.

387
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,948
Why would I want to talk to you
when you fired me?

388
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:48,608
I got the message.
"Merry Christmas, love, Judas."

389
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,244
What is this?

390
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,088
That's a nice offer.

391
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,249
They're really trying to make it sound
like it's not a demotion.

392
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,453
So I take the job?
That's your advice?

393
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,619
If that's what you want to do.

394
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,663
Well, I know what you want me to do.
Go away.

395
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,302
I guess you don't remember
I started that company.

396
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,458
I had to talk you into it.

397
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,299
I guess you forgot I found you
at the bottom of a fur box.

398
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,031
I would never have
done that to you.

399
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,803
Oh, come on.
Don't be a big baby about it.

400
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,139
You were a disaster.
We did you a favor.

401
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,940
The man who talked to Hershey?

402
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,481
I've seen that man wandering
the streets with a sandwich board

403
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,050
saying "The end is near."

404
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,381
- So I have my answer.
- I didn't know the question?

405
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,988
You want to come back?
Come back.

406
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,455
I miss you.

407
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,362
- Who is it?
- Room service.

408
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,027
Oh.

409
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,967
I didn't know we had company.

410
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,902
Yeah, for once,
it's a friend of mine.

411
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:47,242
Sherry, this is Don.

412
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,345
I was just leaving.

413
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,550
Come in Monday.

414
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,375
- Hello?
- It's me.

415
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,284
Hello.

416
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,949
I wanted to hear your voice.

417
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,619
I don't have a lot to say.

418
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,561
Then you can just listen.

419
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,394
I...

420
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,399
I shouldn't have lied to you.

421
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,738
And I'm sorry.

422
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,381
And I want everything
to be okay.

423
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,152
Are you there?

424
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,822
Yes.

425
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,926
I can see now that I wasn't...

426
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,092
thinking clearly

427
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,893
and I had this logic
to what I did and...

428
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,436
hopefully now...

429
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:25,104
things can be the way
we want them to be

430
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,005
because I'm going back
to the agency.

431
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,669
Good for you.

432
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,611
I don't know if I can undo it,
but I think I fixed it.

433
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:38,281
"I fixed it"
is you got a job out here.

434
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,015
That's what you promised me.
That's why I'm here.

435
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,922
I just thought that if you found out
what happened...

436
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,088
you wouldn't look at me
in the same way.

437
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,366
I can't believe after all this time
you don't know me.

438
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,769
I know how I want you to see me.

439
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,508
Don't lie to me.

440
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,874
Don't do that.

441
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:07,142
You can't do that.

442
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,479
I'm your wife.

443
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,713
Stop pushing me away
with both hands.

444
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,527
I could come back out.

445
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,323
I have the weekend.

446
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,799
Not now.

447
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,736
It's not a good idea.

448
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,203
I love you.

449
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,576
Good night.

450
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,276
There's basically Frankenstein,
Dracula, Wolf Man,

451
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,539
the Mummy, and the Creature
from the Black Lagoon.

452
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,114
- That's quite a few.
- There's also King Kong, too,

453
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,218
but he's not really a monster.

454
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:19,686
I like all of them, but I guess
Wolf Man's my favorite

455
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,017
because he changes into it.

456
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,387
Dracula changes into a bat.

457
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,961
That's true.

458
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,291
16, 18...

459
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,058
It's nice to see
somebody getting along.

460
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,032
We were having a conversation.

461
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,399
Thank you so much
for helping out.

462
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,901
Makes my job so much easier.

463
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,579
Bobby asked
and I couldn't say no.

464
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,807
My mom loves animals.

465
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,546
She really likes you.

466
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,554
Yes, well, that blouse
says she likes everyone.

467
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,058
It's Lou, right?

468
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,734
Oh, hello there.

469
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,738
Good to see you.

470
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,410
Sure.

471
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:23,876
How are you, Don?

472
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,906
Ready to get back to work.

473
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,745
Good for you.

474
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,723
Hello there.

475
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,729
Oh, Don!
Look at you.

476
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,561
- How are you?
- I'm good.

477
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,225
It's been too long.

478
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,670
Here I am.

479
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,170
Why don't you let me
take that up to him?

480
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,104
To Roger?

481
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,210
No, he's not in yet.
That's mine.

482
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,436
Do you want some?

483
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,672
When do you expect him?
I think we have a meeting.

484
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,873
I'm always the last to know.

485
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,251
It's fine.

486
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,891
I'll keep myself occupied.

487
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,890
Great to see you again.

488
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,866
Keep that.

489
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,233
- Is Jim Cutler in yet?
- I think he's at breakfast.

490
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,272
I don't care if he's in bed
with Joey Heatherton.

491
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,068
Get him on the horn.

492
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,077
Don?

493
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,411
Is that you?

494
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,049
Hello, Michael.

495
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,557
Ed, come here.
Look who's here.

496
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,389
Oh, hi, Don.
Great to see you.

497
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,656
Boy, you smell good.

498
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,458
Hey, you know what?
Are you busy?

499
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,329
- What do you mean?
- Don't bother him.

500
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,061
He'll know.
Come here.

501
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,773
Chevalier Blanc
has started Chevalier Noir.

502
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,636
That's "night," or "black."

503
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,436
Either way,
it's the opposite of Blanc.

504
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,772
And we're supposed
to work up print

505
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,507
based on this voiceover tagline,
"More horsepower."

506
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,346
And you gotta see the words,
but it ends with a freeze-frame.

507
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,112
What does?

508
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,415
The TV spot.

509
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,422
Oh. I assume
you have storyboards.

510
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,618
Exit stage left.

511
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,690
What have you been up to, Don?

512
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,327
Just R&R mostly.

513
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,494
Do you want to see the strategy?

514
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,276
Sure.

515
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,280
What happened to the storyboards
from Chevalier Noir?

516
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,009
She gave them to Lou.

517
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,279
What do I do?
Don wants to see 'em.

518
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,117
- Don?
- Don... Draper.

519
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,314
Says who?

520
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,323
Says him.
He's outside.

521
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,024
Right now?
What's he doing here?

522
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,029
You want I should ask him?

523
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,740
What's he doing?

524
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,468
Who cares?

525
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,847
- What's going on?
- Shh! Look.

526
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,045
What is he doing here?

527
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,655
Maybe he finished drying out.

528
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,916
Meredith, we better
get back to work.

529
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,360
Hello, Don.

530
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,729
Hello, Stan.

531
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,525
Where you been?
Riding the rails?

532
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,033
- Turns out Lou's got the boards.
- It's fine.

533
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,034
Mr. Draper.

534
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,605
Morning, Dawn.

535
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,505
Seems to be some lapse
in communication

536
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,076
regarding my return.

537
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,542
No one told me.

538
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,012
Could you just let me know when
someone tracks down Mr. Sterling?

539
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,583
- Can I get some coffee?
- Certainly.

540
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,547
Why don't you fellas
catch me up?

541
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,247
You want me to get everything?

542
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,517
Whatever you got handy.

543
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,751
Let's start with the garbage.

544
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,233
Children, this is my father,
Farmer Cy.

545
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,741
You can call me Cyrus
or Cy or "hey, mister."

546
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,473
If you look around,
you can see pigs

547
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,980
and goats and chickens.

548
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,880
And Pammy's favorite,
the horsies.

549
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,543
We've got all the animals.

550
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,622
But this farm is mostly
for growing potatoes,

551
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,554
so there's not a lot
above ground.

552
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,921
But I know you're all here
to see the cows.

553
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,892
So why don't we walk this way?

554
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,325
I'm sorry, ladies,
but there's no smoking in the barn.

555
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,060
I'll be along.

556
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,400
You're not afraid of missing them
milk the cow?

557
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,304
I'll be done in a minute.

558
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,912
Well, I hope no one accidentally
grabs on the wrong udders.

559
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,106
Excuse me?

560
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,114
Farmer's daughter needs a bra.

561
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,620
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you need my lighter?

562
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,159
Would you mind?

563
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,093
Don?
Is that you?

564
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,760
Boys, excuse me a minute.

565
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,131
Don, what a pleasant surprise.

566
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,362
You're looking well, Joan.

567
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,973
What have you been up to?
What are you doing here?

568
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,268
- Waiting.
- For what?

569
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,139
You two just getting in?

570
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,143
We had a breakfast meeting.

571
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,304
What are you doing here?

572
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,882
I guess I'm waiting for Roger.

573
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,020
Oh, I see.

574
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,281
Well...

575
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,357
it was nice seeing you.

576
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,495
Guess what.
Cynthia had a little boy.

577
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,633
Edward, but we call him Eddie.

578
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,529
Eddie Cosgrove.

579
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,735
That's the carousel
in Central Park.

580
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:50,669
Always makes me think of you.

581
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,172
Now I know
what you'll look like bald.

582
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,342
May I have a word?

583
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,572
Don't linger in the door.

584
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,182
I'm wearing boots.

585
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,251
Yes, fine, dear.

586
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,479
Did you know that
Don Draper is downstairs?

587
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,850
Doing what?

588
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:10,186
He says he's waiting for Roger.
Does that ring a bell?

589
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,157
He shouldn't be here.

590
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,499
So obviously I would like
to get married,

591
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,864
but, you know, I don't
really have any savings.

592
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,506
I mean, it doesn't make any sense
to borrow money from my parents

593
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,541
just so I look successful
in front of hers, does it?

594
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,436
I don't know.
That is a tough spot.

595
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,205
What the hell is going on in here?

596
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,007
We were just catching up.

597
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,846
That's nice, ladies.
You four, in my office.

598
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,186
- We have that meeting.
- What meeting?

599
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,255
Sorry, Don.

600
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,938
Don't get no fresher than that.

601
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,277
Who wants to try it?

602
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,607
I will.

603
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,378
- Really?
- Sure.

604
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,884
See how warm it is?

605
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,427
It's sweet.

606
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,240
Don.

607
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,936
Where the hell were you?

608
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,807
- Had an early lunch.
- I can smell it.

609
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,311
I didn't know you
were gonna beat me here.

610
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,007
You could have told somebody.
Anybody.

611
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,311
I don't have to tell anybody.
That's my name on the door out there.

612
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,921
This is my agency.
I'm the president of this agency.

613
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,579
I don't have to ask
anybody anything.

614
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,623
You know what? I could call a holiday
for the whole office right now.

615
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,783
I've been sitting in here
waiting for you.

616
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,191
I'm not gonna slink out of here
with my tail between my legs.

617
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,026
- Now call a damn meeting.
- Let me ask Joan.

618
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,635
- Don't ask Joan.
- Wait here.

619
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,707
Chicken salad on rye
and a Nesbitt's?

620
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,137
Yes, thank you, Dawn.

621
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,989
You eat.
I'm going to wash my hands.

622
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,825
Okay.

623
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,330
You can't sit there.
That's my mom's spot.

624
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,638
Don?

625
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,139
Hello, Jim.

626
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,675
I'm surprised to see you.

627
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,255
Well, here I am.

628
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,822
Mr. Cutler, there you are.

629
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,199
I can go down to the lobby
and sell newspapers,

630
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,701
but you're still gonna pay me.

631
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,999
- I have a two-year contract.
- Calm down.

632
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,369
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

633
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,874
What am I supposed to do?

634
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,569
Just hide
while he sits down there

635
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,578
cooling his heels
like Longfellow Deeds?

636
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,048
We're going to ask him to leave.

637
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,880
May I?

638
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,523
Be careful.
I've seen this before.

639
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,216
You might want to call security.

640
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,566
A lot of bees over there.

641
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,795
They live in drawers.

642
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,736
- Where's my sandwich?
- What do you mean?

643
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,105
There were two.

644
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,803
I traded it.

645
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,381
- You traded it?
- With Susie Rogers.

646
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,575
She didn't have a sandwich.

647
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,276
I got her gumdrops.

648
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,620
Bobby, that was my lunch.

649
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,759
I'm sorry.
I'll go get it back.

650
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,985
Stop it.
It's fine.

651
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,494
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

652
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,430
I'm sorry.

653
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,932
I swear I didn't know
you were going to eat.

654
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,094
There were two sandwiches.

655
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,637
You want them?

656
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,939
No. You eat them.

657
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,249
But I don't want them.

658
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,851
Eat your candy.

659
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,008
Your shoes.

660
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,976
What about her?

661
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,047
I just discovered
you're our best hope

662
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:03,482
to explain why
Don Draper is downstairs.

663
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,985
He came to me in remorse
and said he's ready to come back.

664
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,387
Oh, I see.

665
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,155
Well, unfortunately,
we fired him.

666
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,696
No, we didn't.

667
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,562
We deliberately put him on leave
in this very room.

668
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,794
We didn't fire him.
I would never agree to that.

669
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,633
The leave of absence
was a very clear message.

670
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,832
We were allowing him
to preserve his dignity

671
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,374
while seeking other employment.

672
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,840
Ah.

673
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,913
Well, I remember clearly
that Cutler said

674
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,641
the leave of absence
was to give him time to think.

675
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,013
I didn't want any more rancor.

676
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,848
Is that what you thought?
That we fired him?

677
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,354
Not necessarily,
but I did expect

678
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,857
to revisit the topic
after some time as a group.

679
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,690
Well, here we are.
Let's take a vote.

680
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,194
- I'll speak for Ted.
- And I'll speak for Pete.

681
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,394
All I can say is that Don
is a very talented man,

682
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,732
but how does he fit
into everything now?

683
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,932
This is working.

684
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,270
Besides, we're still mopping up
the damage he's done.

685
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:05,778
I do not like the way this agency
is spoken of out there.

686
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,417
You don't think that's because
our creative is invisible right now?

687
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,211
One nomination.

688
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,355
Lou didn't put in anything
he couldn't tag his name on.

689
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,955
He barely worked here last year.

690
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,557
Lou is adequate.

691
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,626
I think it's more important
we discuss Harry Crane.

692
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,262
Harry Crane?

693
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,557
He's gone.
Anything else?

694
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,031
This agency is too dependent
on creative personalities.

695
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,794
You're still talking for Ted?

696
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,939
If we want people
speaking about this agency,

697
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,404
what they should be speaking about
is our media department.

698
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,908
We need to invest
in a computer, period.

699
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,411
We need to tell our clients
we're thinking about the future,

700
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,242
not creative hijinks.

701
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,748
Don is a genius.

702
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,579
He's costing us a fortune!

703
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,414
- You hate him.
- I don't!

704
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,385
I hate what he did to Ted.

705
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,583
Enough!
This is a financial decision.

706
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,489
Obviously, it's not.

707
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,631
Right now Don draws
a sizable salary

708
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,266
and has a partnership stake.

709
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,992
That costs more than a computer.

710
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,103
- He has a contract.
- He's in breach.

711
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,432
No, he's not.
He's on leave!

712
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,767
And even if we do fire him,
he's a partner.

713
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,967
We have to buy him out.

714
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,913
That's true.

715
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,275
That's a big hit.

716
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,917
As tough as it is, I'm confident

717
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,519
it'll be more profitable
in the long term.

718
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,781
Since when are you allowed to use
the words "long term" in this office?

719
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,448
It'll be 1973 before we're even.

720
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,252
We fire him,
we lose the noncompete.

721
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,293
You want to walk down
some hotel hallway

722
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:30,433
and see Mary Wells sitting on Don's lap
the next time you go in to present?

723
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,465
How was the farm?

724
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,773
How was your day?

725
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,838
Did you eat?

726
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,643
I'm not hungry.

727
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,218
I was hungry, but now I'm not.

728
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,281
It was a long day.

729
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,858
I'm going to give Gene a bath.

730
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,223
Come on, Genie.

731
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,738
What happened?

732
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,007
I wish it was yesterday.

733
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,383
- Have a good night.
- Good night, George.

734
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,385
How was your day?

735
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,224
That remains to be seen.

736
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,665
Are you coming back?

737
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,429
I thought so.

738
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,735
Now I'm not so sure.

739
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,937
Well, I can't say
that we miss you.

740
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,047
Thank you, Peggy.

741
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,429
What happened?

742
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,760
I couldn't get it out of Bobby.

743
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,928
It was a perfect day
and he ruined it.

744
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,734
How is that possible, Betty?

745
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,236
Do you think I'm a good mother?

746
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,939
Of course.

747
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,487
Then why don't they love me?

748
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,319
What are you talking about?

749
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,926
Look at him.

750
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,431
It's just a matter of time.

751
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,610
Mr. Draper.

752
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,908
Yes. Dawn...

753
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,415
can I get some coffee?

754
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,144
Of course, but they want to see you
in the conference room...

755
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,515
the partners.

756
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,450
Oh.

757
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,352
Hello, everyone.

758
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,650
Come on, sit down.

759
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,630
- Bert, how are you?
- Capital.

760
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,133
Well, this is the meeting I assumed
you were going to have

761
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,965
before I came, Roger.

762
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,232
Sorry if I disrupted your day,

763
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,809
but I've had a productive time
catching myself up with everything.

764
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,469
Well, we've discussed it
and we've reached the conclusion

765
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,581
that we'd like you
to come back to work.

766
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,850
I'm pleased to hear that.

767
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,488
But there are some stipulations.

768
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,756
Violation of which
will result in termination

769
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,830
and a reabsorption
of your partnership shares.

770
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:27,762
You are not allowed
to be alone with clients.

771
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,599
You are to stick
to the script in meetings

772
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,503
and that means the script
will be approved

773
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,837
by the people in this room.

774
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,743
Outside of client hospitality,
there will be no drinking in the office.

775
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,949
You'll be in Lane's old office.

776
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,679
And you will report to Lou.

777
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,197
Okay.
