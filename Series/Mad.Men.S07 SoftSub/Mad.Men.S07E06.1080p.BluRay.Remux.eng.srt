1
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,754
I'm sorry to bother you,

2
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,553
but we're the people
who paid for your meal,

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,390
and as much <i>as</i> I am committed
to you enjoying your food

4
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,191
while it's still piping hot,

5
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,425
I do have a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

6
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,695
I'll give you the $3.10 back.

7
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,668
I have to beat my husband home.

8
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,397
Would your husband
be happy if you were late,

9
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,338
but had another $10?

10
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,705
Well, I guess it would help.

11
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,938
Good evening, ma'am.
What's your name, little girl?

12
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,710
It's Stacy.
Is that your question?

13
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,048
Would you say that you eat
here weekly, monthly?

14
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,883
Too much.

15
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,287
What's your favorite thing
about Burger Chef?

16
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,018
The taste or the price?

17
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,594
It's near my house.

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,287
Convenience.

19
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,955
Usually.

20
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,626
Does your husband
ever pick it up?

21
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,929
Oh, he wouldn't do that.

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,231
It's bad enough
that I'm not making dinner.

23
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,566
Is that all?

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,081
Come back soon.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,278
How much money do you have?

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,585
Two more families
and Chinese for us.

27
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,328
It's not a listing.
It's Sybil's apartment.

28
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,961
I'm not squatting.

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,628
I can afford a hotel.

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,796
It's seven nights.

31
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,934
I'm not paying for it, Bonita.

32
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,937
Let me at least pay
for the theater tickets.

33
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,606
I get them for free.

34
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,981
Well, I'm going to buy you
a pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.

35
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,952
I want you shopping all day...

36
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,786
and screwing all night.

37
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,985
You'll spend the weekend
with me, won't you?

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,496
I will need to spend some
of Saturday afternoon in Cos Cob.

39
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,866
Well, I'll come.

40
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,697
Why would you want to do that?

41
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,305
I sure would like to meet Tammy.

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,963
I picked out her Barbie.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,474
I don't want to confuse her, baby.

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,838
She's probably more confused

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,207
that her parents
aren't actually divorced.

46
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,043
So that's something
that bothers you.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,820
Of course it bothers me.

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,383
I don't know where this is going,

49
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,787
but I don't want it to fail
on account of delay.

50
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,857
I haven't seen her in a while.

51
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,158
Next time... I promise.

52
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,335
I thought you were never
going to get married again.

53
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,880
Meet me in the restroom
in 60 seconds.

54
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,252
I've always wanted to do that.

55
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,882
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'll have a roll at the office.

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,611
Well, you're disappearing.

57
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:07,221
Every time you say something
like that, I go off my diet.

58
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,619
Go outdoors today, please.

59
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,639
I hope I'm not interrupting.
It's Bonnie.

60
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,972
I remember you.

61
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,974
You can't just walk in here.

62
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,272
Bonnie, this is Meredith.

63
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,279
Do you want me to come
and get you in five minutes?

64
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,418
Meredith, that'll be all.

65
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,755
Pete's having quite a homecoming,
so I thought I'd duck in.

66
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,414
You're the only one I know here.

67
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,150
How long are you in town?

68
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,556
I hate to say it,
but I knew where to find you.

69
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,959
- Don, how are you?
- Good to see you.

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,396
I like what you've done
with the place.

71
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,001
I heard you have quite the home.

72
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,660
Pete says it's 2,000 square feet.

73
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,601
Not quite.

74
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,174
Peggy's going to be leading us
through the work, as it were.

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,776
I assume you're attending.

76
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,470
- Burger Chef?
- You're on the team.

77
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,138
I'd like you to be there.

78
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,617
- I guess this is my cue.
- Baloney.

79
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,448
Walk me to the conference room.

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,283
He wants to make sure
everyone's seen you.

81
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,656
- Ta-ta.
- Very well.

82
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,623
Is this the billboard?

83
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,466
It's kind of lackluster.

84
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,969
That's the tray liner.

85
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,132
- That's everything, chief.
- Thank you, Stan.

86
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,674
- Hello, Stan.
- Good to see you, Pete.

87
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,838
How's life treating you?

88
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm in New York and I'm in love.

89
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,648
Me as well.

90
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,549
Hello, Pete.

91
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,487
Well, I think we should
get this started.

92
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,217
Did you need something, Don?

93
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,986
I've asked Don to join us.

94
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,895
I didn't know you wanted the team.
Should we get Mathis as well?

95
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,058
No, Don's plenty.

96
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,034
Well, he has been instrumental.

97
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,140
I think we're circling a strategy...

98
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,579
all the research points to the fact
that mothers feel guilty.

99
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,309
They don't eat at the restaurant

100
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,579
because of what Mathis calls
a "cleanliness fetish."

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,024
And even when they get home,
they're embarrassed.

102
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,356
Our job is to turn Burger Chef
into a special treat served with love.

103
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,258
So the more these women
go to Burger Chef,

104
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,228
- the worse they feel.
- Yes.

105
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,664
We need to address how to give
homemakers permission.

106
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,269
Well, who gives moms permission?

107
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,699
Dads.

108
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,739
It's a dark night.

109
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,435
Reveal our morn, driving,
girl in a tutu next to her,

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,375
boy wearing a football helmet
in the back.

111
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,778
Push into a close-up
as we hear Mom's voice...

112
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,850
the things on her mind.

113
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,852
"Let's see, check that list
for the marching band fundraiser.

114
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,116
Get the sink trap checked.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,123
Get Jim to take down
the storm windows.

116
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,556
Jim!

117
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,389
Jim will be home
in a half an hour."

118
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,930
Just then the little girl says,
"I'm hungry."

119
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,728
The boy says, "I'm starving."

120
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,565
Mom says, "One more stop."

121
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,230
We see the reflection
of the Burger Chef sign

122
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,105
on the station wagon windshield
<i>as</i> she pulls in.

123
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,303
Mom gets out of the car.

124
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,540
A handsome man comes out
holding a bag.

125
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,278
Mom walks up to him
and gives him a deep kiss.

126
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,651
The kids in the car
looking surprised.

127
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,452
He laughs and says,
"Can I take you to dinner?"

128
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,653
She says, "Next time,
let me get dinner.

129
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,388
You take down
the storm windows."

130
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,899
Cut to them at the kitchen table,

131
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,004
camera moving from face
to smiling face.

132
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,733
They're laughing,
Mom looks around, smiling.

133
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,104
"Aren't you glad

134
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,906
everybody loves Burger Chef
as much as you do?"

135
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,112
Very nice.
I think it's coming along.

136
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,412
It's nice to see
family happiness again.

137
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,577
Thank you.

138
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,455
What do you think?

139
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,495
The dad surprising the family
absolves the mom.

140
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,296
It's right on strategy.
It's exactly what they wanted.

141
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,672
Don worked the tag over
by the syllable.

142
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,276
- It's deceptively simple.
- Thank you.

143
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,706
Why don't you take us
through the legs?

144
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,710
Let's start with radio.

145
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,476
Looky here.
A sight for sore eyes.

146
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,355
Ah...

147
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,822
Hello, Jim.

148
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,551
How's your Burger Chef work going?

149
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,195
Better than yours, I guess.

150
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,025
Thank you, by the way, for failing
and giving us a shot at it.

151
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,997
It's not McDonald's.
It's run by morons.

152
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,830
A lot of companies
succeed that way.

153
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,994
But look who I'm talking to.

154
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,799
You don't mean that.

155
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,965
You're going after fast food.

156
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,839
You've got your little car...

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,037
it's not Buick, but it's cute.

158
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,876
I know you folks want to be
just like McCann when you grow up.

159
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,417
When we grow up, we're going
to kill you and marry your wife.

160
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,584
Listen, I hear you're talking
to Philip Morris.

161
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,247
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?

162
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,655
Well, I'm just curious how you think
you're going to pull that off

163
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,921
with Don Draper
haunting your halls.

164
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,998
You're so lucky my problems
aren't your problems.

165
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,194
What if I wanted them to be?

166
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,861
Are you looking for a job?

167
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,404
No. No.

168
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,908
I'm just looking to enrich
the lives of people I respect.

169
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,208
The New York Athletic Club
frowns on people

170
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,441
making advances
in their steam room.

171
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:38,686
I was kidding around,
but I think you're making eyes at me.

172
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,023
I'm gonna go get a massage,
relieve some of this tension.

173
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,857
Fellas, we got a live one here.

174
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,892
Come in, join us.

175
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,935
I'm drinking rum.

176
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,040
- Do you want some?
- No, thank you.

177
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,733
That bar, it's hysterical.

178
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,900
My wife's a card.

179
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,547
I'm very pleased with the direction
I saw this morning.

180
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,081
- We all are.
- Thank you.

181
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,049
And... not but...

182
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,621
I think with my understanding
of George Payton

183
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,248
that our success would be
further assured

184
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,452
if Don delivered the presentation.

185
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,154
- Oh.
- Here's the but.

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,061
It is completely your decision.

187
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,937
Why are you doing this now?

188
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,436
That's what I said.
She's doing fine.

189
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,338
Lou, first of all,
you've never seen Don at his best.

190
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,342
It'll be a tearjerker.

191
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,778
Number two is Peggy,
in my mind, will still speak,

192
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,439
but as the mother.

193
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,246
A change of tone.
You were wonderful in there.

194
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,116
I don't like being in this position.

195
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,690
I know I can bring this home.

196
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,953
Peggy, you didn't walk into this office
and see Don here.

197
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,255
This is your client,

198
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,262
and you're going to write
as much of it as you want to.

199
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,765
Don will give authority,
you will give emotion.

200
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,632
I have authority.
And Don has emotion.

201
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,137
I prefer you as an expert witness.

202
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,297
You will introduce him.

203
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,307
But it's your decision.

204
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,173
- What?
- It's Ted.

205
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,143
Ted's on the phone.

206
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,146
Oh.

207
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,306
Hello.

208
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,885
I've seen the work so far.
I'm impressed.

209
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,521
And what would you do?

210
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,817
I would use everything
at my disposal to win it.

211
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,827
If you think George Payton
will prefer it,

212
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,365
I'm not going to ignore that.

213
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,630
You know that she's every bit as good
as any woman in this business!

214
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,834
I do.

215
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,203
He'll be great.

216
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,806
Keep up the good work.

217
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,357
It's big and powerful
and costs a fortune,

218
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,586
but it can't make coffee.

219
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,252
They've got a computer
twice that size

220
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,059
working on the engine for the XP.

221
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,702
- Clara.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.

222
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,030
Gentlemen, there's coffee and cake
in Mr. Crane's office.

223
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,900
May I take your hats?

224
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,099
Hey, fellas.

225
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,005
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.

226
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,544
- Hello, Kenny.
- How's the kid? Is he flying yet?

227
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,773
Are you kidding?
He's crawling all over the place.

228
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,541
You've really got to keep
an eye on him.

229
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,851
Joan!
Come say hello.

230
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,846
Welcome back, Bob.
Gentlemen.

231
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,050
How the hell did we end up
with him instead of you?

232
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,128
- No one asked.
- This is Bill Hartley.

233
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,060
Bill's been bumped
to vice president of brand.

234
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,460
Congratulations.

235
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,295
You certainly picked
the right place to celebrate.

236
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,131
You mean New York City
or this very spot?

237
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,564
So far all we have lined up
is six hours of network pilots.

238
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,234
Clara, could you take them
to Harry's office?

239
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,641
- Enjoy.
. Very funny.

240
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,577
Pleasure, ma'am.

241
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,412
I'd love to see you Sunday.

242
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,578
Unless you've made plans
with some married guy.

243
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,247
I am all yours.

244
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,155
But if you want to see Kevin,
you're going to have to see my mother.

245
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,455
I want to see everyone.

246
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,471
- You need something?
- Yes, actually, I do.

247
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,100
I've given it careful thought,

248
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,767
and I think you should give
the presentation to Burger Chef.

249
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,640
Hold on.

250
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,013
You did a great job this morning.

251
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,775
That's good to hear,

252
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,783
but I want to have the best chance
of winning this,

253
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,615
and I'm not going to pretend
you're not it.

254
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,987
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

255
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,628
I'll introduce you,
and when you're rounding third,

256
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,025
you hand it off
to "the voice of moms."

257
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,360
And then you turn and hit the tag
like you just thought of it.

258
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,504
- Do I do that?
- Yes, you do.

259
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,138
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

260
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,640
Thank you.

261
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,641
You know, I was just
noodling around with the idea

262
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,045
of seeing the whole thing
from the kids' perspective.

263
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,278
- "Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?"
- Excuse me?

264
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,854
I don't know.
Just a thought.

265
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,120
I appreciate it,
but we already have a strategy.

266
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,166
Megan?

267
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,998
Hello!

268
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,668
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,175
Why didn't you say something?

270
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,745
No, Marsha, this is Megan,
Don's wife.

271
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,848
I didn't know he was married.

272
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,382
So nice to meet you.

273
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,851
Marsha, can you get Megan
some coffee?

274
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,853
I'm fine.

275
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,549
This is very impressive,
but where do you work now?

276
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
My office is right here.

277
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,092
- Are you a surprise?
- No, he's expecting me.

278
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,861
Well, you're a surprise for me.

279
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,833
How is everything in LA?

280
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,202
It's exciting
and new and different.

281
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,070
And a lot quieter.

282
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,837
What a great office.

283
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,244
Sooner or later you're going
to get Don's, aren't you?

284
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,079
I don't know
how much better it is.

285
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,084
He's right next door.

286
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,052
Oh.

287
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,213
Hey!

288
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,121
I didn't expect to see you.

289
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,229
- Megan's in for a visit.
- Thanks for the subtitles.

290
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,229
- Did you hear about Ginsberg?
- Yes. Have you seen him?

291
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,561
I did.
She won't go.

292
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,226
All right, Meredith, I'm gonna go.

293
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,531
Don.

294
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,968
What are you doing here?

295
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,938
I couldn't wait to see you.

296
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,736
I thought we could eat downtown.

297
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,402
That's a great idea.

298
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,710
Well, it was so great
to see you both.

299
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,648
Is it okay?
I have a visitor.

300
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,618
Enjoy yourself.

301
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,415
Good night.

302
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,262
I miss her.

303
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,923
You didn't even ask me
how the dry run went.

304
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,569
Was there a problem?

305
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,398
No, they loved it.

306
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,102
Are you mad at me?

307
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,834
No.
Good night, Stan.

308
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,569
Good night.

309
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,084
Ah, good, you're still here.

310
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,690
That's your opinion.

311
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,259
I played a round this morning
with Les Clark-

312
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,793
my friend from Philip Morris?

313
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,124
The brand commander
of Commander brand.

314
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,357
Your name came up
and I sure would appreciate

315
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,627
you helping us pave that road.

316
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,828
Your secret plan to win the war?

317
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,496
Stop thinking about Don

318
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,699
and start thinking
about the company.

319
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,959
Who's here for William Hartley?

320
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,497
- Bill?
- Don't say anything.

321
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,658
But you should say thank you
to your boyfriend

322
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,702
- for posting bail.
- Has he seen a doctor?

323
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,670
- What did I just say?
- Take him to a headshrinker.

324
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,333
He tried to fellate
an undercover officer.

325
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,847
May I go?

326
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,248
Good night, ladies.

327
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,157
I called you because I knew
you could keep this to yourself.

328
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,096
You should go to the hospital.

329
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,736
You know they're just
going to call the cops.

330
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,032
I wish I was back in Detroit.

331
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,438
I've got that place wired.

332
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,378
Have you ever been arrested?

333
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,039
No.
Never.

334
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,208
I guess you've been lucky.

335
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,615
Well, I appreciate this.

336
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,193
I'm going to miss having you around.

337
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,921
I am not of your stripe.

338
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,590
And you should think twice
before you threaten me like that.

339
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,865
Please.
I'm not threatening you.

340
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,772
We're moving the XP
over to Campbell-Ewald,

341
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,103
and you're moving on.

342
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,975
- We're losing Chevy?
- Don't worry.

343
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,879
GM loves the work,
and they really love you.

344
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,451
Obviously not.

345
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,782
Your agency had
a successful tryout,

346
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,084
but the plan was always to take
the XP in-house.

347
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,928
But Buick is going to come to you
with a great job offer.

348
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,594
What?

349
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,167
Well, that's very good news.

350
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,777
- When does all this happen?
- Imminently.

351
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,513
What about you?

352
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,652
I'm gonna call in sick.

353
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,754
My wife understands, thank God.

354
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,948
That's a good idea.

355
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,329
How did you live in this city?

356
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,132
There's so much temptation.

357
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,370
It was hard.

358
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,682
Hello?

359
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,346
Trudy?

360
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,924
Come along, let's go say hi.

361
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,388
Hello, sweetie.

362
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,359
It's Daddy, sweetheart.

363
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,437
I got you a Barbie
all the way from California.

364
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,535
Go ahead.

365
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,344
I don't believe we've met.

366
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,574
- Where's Trudy?
- She's at the hairdresser.

367
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,013
I'm Verna.

368
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,746
Well, Verna's going to come
with us to the car.

369
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,259
Tell me it was all a dream.

370
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,662
You're in a good mood.

371
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,236
Tell me you didn't miss this.

372
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,965
I missed you.

373
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,280
Well, we are going to eat
this delicious breakfast...

374
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,842
and I'm going to take you shopping.

375
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,614
Okay.

376
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,882
Hey, baby, I'm almost ready.

377
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,646
"Hi, baby" yourself.
I've been here since 10:00.

378
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,653
- Oh, it's you.
- Are you coming in?

379
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,122
Find something else to do today.
That's an order.

380
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,719
I don't like the idea.

381
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,158
Of doing something else?

382
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,663
No, the idea for Burger Chef.

383
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,233
You haven't been "noodling"
with anything else, have you?

384
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,337
It came easy.
You don't trust it.

385
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,736
- It didn't come easy at all.
- So find a new one.

386
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,506
So you don't like it either.

387
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,341
The work is great!
I'm positive, exclamation point!

388
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,476
How do I know you're not
just saying that

389
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:54,640
so you don't have to come in?

390
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,720
Do you need me to come in?

391
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,022
No.

392
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,183
Your baby's calling.

393
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,027
But we both know
there's a better idea.

394
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,030
There's always a better idea.

395
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,057
Bye.

396
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,210
Look at you!

397
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,940
You say good-bye to your daddy,
and then you're going to take a bath.

398
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,278
- Where's Trudy?
- She's out, Mr. Campbell.

399
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,545
Her car's in the drive.

400
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,849
Well, she came back,
but then she went out.

401
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,455
Why don't you give Tammy a bath
and let me tuck her in?

402
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,858
Of course, Mr. Campbell.

403
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,772
- Hello?
- Hello, dear.

404
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,206
I'm afraid I've been
waylaid in Cos Cob.

405
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,107
You go without me.
I'll pick you up for a drink after.

406
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,613
You really want me to see
"Oh! Calcutta!" by myself?

407
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,582
Trudy must've forgotten.

408
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,256
There's no one
to look after Tammy.

409
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,414
Oh.

410
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,491
That's rather inconsiderate,
isn't it?

411
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,588
I'm sure it's just a mistake.

412
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,298
Well, I'm going to wait
until the very last minute.

413
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,935
That's sweet.
I'll make it up to you.

414
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,300
You most certainly will.

415
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,848
- Should I get it?
- It's not for me.

416
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,457
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

417
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,789
- Are you on your way out?
- Just sitting down to dinner.

418
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,523
Well, it's just...

419
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,965
I just wanted to let you know that
I tried your "kids' point of view" idea,

420
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,297
and it's not good.

421
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,801
Well, it was great
hearing from you.

422
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,534
It's just I know,
now that you're presenting,

423
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,303
you're prone to more
serious thought,

424
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,345
and I just wanted you to know
that one's a loser.

425
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,313
I'm always working, Peggy.
So are you.

426
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,712
Why are you undermining me?

427
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,322
From now on
I won't express myself.

428
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,050
Well, now it's tainted.

429
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,855
It's poisoned, because you
expressed yourself.

430
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,624
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

431
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,705
Did you lose your appetite?

432
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,868
Absolutely not.

433
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,084
Oh, hello.

434
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,386
Did you just get back?

435
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,392
No, but you did.

436
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,360
Is Tammy still up?

437
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,524
No. We said our good nights.

438
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,070
Verna's back there
hiding somewhere.

439
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:06,376
Well, did you have a nice time?

440
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:10,503
I was in fine spirits
till I thought about you

441
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,912
pulled over on the side of the road
necking with Charlie Fiddich.

442
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,885
- Charlie Fiddich?
- Well, who was it, then?

443
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,420
Or are you going to keep it
a secret from me

444
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,580
like your father's heart attack?

445
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,124
You've seen your daughter
for the year.

446
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,693
Don't you have a plane to catch?

447
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,353
I don't like you carrying on like this.
It's immoral.

448
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,625
- You have a child.
- What?!

449
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,397
You picked tonight for your date?

450
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,397
You still care about me.

451
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,066
I know your debutante maneuvers.

452
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,735
We're getting a divorce.

453
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,313
We're still married.

454
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,452
You're not part
of this family anymore.

455
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,755
Good night.

456
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Well, hello there.

457
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,572
Well, hello yourself.

458
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,237
Somebody missed you.

459
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,181
You're early, but welcome.

460
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,149
These are for you.

461
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:27,621
And that is for you.

462
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,317
- Wow.
- It's an Erector Set.

463
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,962
America needs engineers.

464
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,791
What do you say to Uncle Bob?

465
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,455
Thank you.

466
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,800
I know everybody got something,
but I was shopping in Midtown

467
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,528
all day yesterday
and I struck out.

468
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,367
The Jews close everything
on Saturday.

469
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,975
I'm starving.

470
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,304
I see a day that starts
with pancakes

471
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,946
and ends with
an ice cream sundae.

472
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,445
Should I bring the stroller?

473
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,674
I'll carry him if I have to.

474
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,443
Let me get my bag.

475
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,330
What are you looking for?

476
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,665
Oh, good morning.

477
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,034
The fondue pot.
It's not in the kitchen.

478
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,473
Coffee's fine.

479
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,909
No, I thought it would get
some use out there.

480
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,709
I thought you just needed
summer clothes.

481
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,877
I miss my things.

482
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,223
You were dead to the world.

483
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,023
I sleep better when you're here.

484
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,066
Oh, I miss you, too.

485
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,171
I'm sorry the visit's so short.

486
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,409
Can I just check this in
on the plane?

487
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,341
How much is there?
I can take some.

488
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,003
When?

489
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,014
The next time I come.
End of July.

490
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,550
You know what?

491
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,924
I want to see you somewhere
where there's nothing else going on.

492
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,791
Not LA.
Not here.

493
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,023
Just us.

494
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,724
That'd be nice.

495
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,886
Air-conditioning.

496
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,790
Delicious.

497
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,955
- Did you have fun?
- You ate already?

498
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,158
I'm sorry, I was hungry.

499
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:53,098
I can eat again.

500
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,260
Look at these feet.

501
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,668
I wore my sandals
and I look like a hobo.

502
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,672
My toenails are black.

503
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,606
You can't wear those in the city.

504
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,440
You might as well be barefoot.

505
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,775
Will you try on your wares?
Slowly?

506
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,974
At least you're in a better mood.

507
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,510
Come over here.

508
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,957
Did you get your work done?

509
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,156
Some of it.

510
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,527
Well, this is my vacation,

511
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,136
and I knew you were
going to the office,

512
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,829
but the first Saturday we spent here,
you needed to see your daughter.

513
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,134
Then you didn't come home,

514
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,971
which I understand
was Trudy's fault.

515
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,137
Then you were grumpy.
Okay.

516
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,146
Then I amused myself
all morning,

517
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,444
and when I come back,
you ordered room service?

518
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,814
I'm inundated, sweetheart.

519
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,546
I don't like you in New York.

520
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,716
Well, then you don't like me.

521
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,986
You're not going to fuck
your way out of this.

522
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,356
What?

523
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,794
I'm going to wash my feet.

524
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,999
How's it going?

525
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Did you park
your white horse outside?

526
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:21,822
Spare me the suspense and tell me
what your "save the day" plan is.

527
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,687
I don't have anything yet.

528
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,260
The idea I had wasn't great.

529
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,021
It wasn't great.
It was terrible.

530
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,562
I want to hear the real one.

531
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,360
Or are you just going to pull it out
during the presentation?

532
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,434
This idea is good.

533
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,037
I think we can get
the client to buy it.

534
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,174
No, you don't, or you wouldn't
have questioned it.

535
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm going to do
whatever you say.

536
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,374
So you're going to pitch the hell
out of my shitty idea,

537
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,345
and I'm going to fail.

538
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,179
Peggy, I'm here to help you do
whatever you want to do.

539
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,117
Well, how am I supposed to know?

540
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,457
That's a tough one.

541
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,721
- You love this.
- Not really.

542
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,255
I want you to feel good
about what you're doing,

543
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,957
but you'll never know.

544
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,601
That's just the job.

545
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,236
What's the job?

546
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,271
Living in the "not knowing."

547
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,634
You know, I wouldn't have
argued if it was me.

548
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,245
I would have just given you
a hundred ideas

549
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,403
and never questioned why.

550
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,883
You really want to help me?

551
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,144
Show me how you think.

552
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,083
Do it out loud.

553
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,120
You can't tell people
what they want.

554
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,156
It has to be what you want.

555
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,730
I want to go to the movies.

556
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,898
I just came back from
"I Am Curious."

557
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,337
I'm still scandalized.

558
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,135
Of course Megan would want
to see a dirty movie.

559
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,245
- You want to work?
- It doesn't matter if I want to.

560
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,507
I have to,
because all of this is crap.

561
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,676
Pros and cons.

562
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,082
Pros... it's almost done
and it's good.

563
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,190
The account man's overjoyed
and the client's on board.

564
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,188
Those are the cons,
and you know it.

565
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,153
Well...

566
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:14,264
whenever I'm really unsure
about an idea,

567
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,633
first I...

568
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,435
I abuse the people
whose help I need.

569
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,012
And then I take a nap.

570
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,816
Done.

571
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,818
Then I start
at the beginning again...

572
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,525
see if I end up
in the same place.

573
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,820
Mom's job is to make dinner.

574
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,490
Burger Chef's job is to stop her.

575
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,871
What is it about that thing?
Little boys love it.

576
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,567
"The End of a Party"
plays in background

577
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,208
You're a very lucky person.

578
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,182
Have I been complaining
too much?

579
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,184
No.

580
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,983
- Did Gail go to bed?
- She did.

581
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,761
I know I shouldn't be saying this,

582
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,562
because my heart is pounding.

583
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,931
What?

584
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,869
I know I said
I didn't get you anything...

585
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,569
but I did.

586
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,516
Bob, put that away.

587
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,553
I know I should have done this
a long time ago.

588
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,849
Did I miss my chance?

589
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,383
No.

590
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,060
I don't know.

591
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,221
So you don't feel anything for me?

592
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,095
My face doesn't please you?

593
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,737
I don't believe it.

594
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,750
You don't want this.

595
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,908
You're not listening to me.

596
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,650
Bob...

597
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,323
you shouldn't be with a woman.

598
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,562
I have been, you know.

599
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,958
Why are you doing this now?

600
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,171
Well, honestly...

601
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,073
I'm moving onto Buick.

602
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,974
And GM expects
a certain kind of executive.

603
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,242
- You're leaving the agency?
- Yes.

604
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,511
But that's why
it would work so well.

605
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:47,122
You could stay here,
do whatever you want.

606
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,951
Kevin would have a father.

607
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,752
Or you could come with me.

608
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,588
You'd love Detroit.

609
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,287
We could have a mansion.

610
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,262
- When did all this happen?
- I just heard it.

611
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,959
And you can't relay it,

612
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,469
because they're moving the XP
to Campbell-Ewald.

613
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,876
- We lost Chevy?
- Yes, but the audition was a success.

614
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:11,207
There's something else
coming down the road.

615
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,474
The times like this, Joan...

616
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,279
this is when you need someone.

617
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,548
We could comfort each other
through an uncertain world.

618
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,384
I can't think
about this right now.

619
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,061
I'm thinking about you, Joan.

620
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,166
Is this what you want?

621
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,825
To be near 40
in a two-bedroom apartment

622
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,199
with a mother and a little boy?

623
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,641
I know I am flawed,

624
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:44,042
but I am offering you
more than anyone else ever will.

625
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,078
No, you're not, Bob.

626
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,481
Because I want love.

627
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,848
And I'd rather die
hoping that happens

628
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,393
than make some arrangement.

629
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,830
And you should, too.

630
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,668
I'm just being realistic.

631
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,267
Good night.

632
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,390
"Forever and Ever"
plays in background

633
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,061
Okay, so in this new version,
Dad's driving the car.

634
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:47,574
Mom's next to him, admiring?

635
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,876
How about a convertible?

636
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,606
Little boy and little girl
in the back,

637
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,151
Dad's got a pipe in his mouth.

638
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,084
Jesus, it's going to look like 1955.

639
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,282
1955 was a good year.

640
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,484
I don't remember.

641
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,788
1965 was a good year.

642
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,288
I got married.

643
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,101
Moms love Burger Chef
because it's an answer to a crisis.

644
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,566
What if Mom's
coming home from work?

645
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,941
What's her profession?

646
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,610
You are surrounded

647
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,941
by all kinds of mothers
who work, Don.

648
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,612
It's too sad for an ad.

649
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,280
Fine.

650
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,448
She burned the roast,

651
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,856
she dented the fender...

652
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,361
Keep going-

653
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,767
She backed over the dog,

654
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,371
little Katie's pregnant,
Jimmy got drafted,

655
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,700
but there is still a burger
and fries on that table?

656
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:56,044
Does this family exist anymore?

657
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,807
Are there people who eat dinner

658
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,349
and smile at each other
instead of watching TV?

659
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,049
Did you ever do that
with your family?

660
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,619
I don't remember.

661
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,396
What the hell do I know
about being a mom?

662
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,502
I just turned 30, Don.

663
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,204
Shit. When?

664
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,198
A couple of weeks ago.

665
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,345
It doesn't matter.

666
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,674
I kept it as secret as I could.

667
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,011
Now I'm one of those women
lying about her age.

668
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,915
I hate them.

669
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,852
I worry about a lot of things,

670
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,052
but I don't worry about you.

671
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,523
What do you have to worry about?

672
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,539
That I never did anything,

673
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,372
and that I don't have anyone.

674
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,421
I was in Ohio,

675
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,581
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

676
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,522
I looked in the window
of so many station wagons.

677
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,892
What did I do wrong?

678
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,114
You're doing great.

679
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,890
What if there was a place

680
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,428
where you could go...

681
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,656
where there was no TV...

682
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,163
and you could break bread...

683
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,840
and whoever you were
sitting with was family?

684
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,444
That's it.

685
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,249
That's more what it is.

686
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,028
Do you hear this?

687
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,292
I know, they're playing it
all the time.

688
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,595
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

689
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,106
Come on.

690
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,259
It's official.
The XP is no longer ours.

691
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,926
But they've thought of a name.

692
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,074
They're going to call it
"Roger Sterling's failure."

693
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,732
- I thought you signed them.
- Where did you hear this?

694
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,074
You knew?

695
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,971
I think we should
get ahead of this.

696
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,048
I'm proposing
a "New York Times" article

697
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,743
and the "Journal," too, announcing
that we're open for business

698
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,912
with our IBM 360
and our proprietary software.

699
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,581
And there's a big picture
of Harry Crane,

700
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,556
our newest partner.

701
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:39,820
What?

702
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,157
The rest of it's fine,
but Harry Crane's a partner?

703
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,095
If that's what it takes.

704
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,098
I'm not going limping
into Burger Chef.

705
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,827
Why does he have to be
a partner?

706
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,336
Say what you will,
but he's very loyal.

707
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,604
All in favor?

708
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,348
Opposed?

709
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,122
The motion carries.
With two abstentions.

710
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:09,019
All right,
everybody back to work.

711
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,519
I've got it.

712
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,260
- What the hell do you want?
- Not Harry Crane as partner.

713
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,130
Well, you knew about Chevy,
and you didn't tell me.

714
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,465
- I could have done something.
- There was nothing to do.

715
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,039
Spill the beans or get out.

716
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,307
Bob Benson told me.

717
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:31,140
- He's going to Buick.
- Bob Benson?

718
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:34,772
- Please don't get him in trouble.
- You're kidding?

719
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,852
- I knew McCann was up to something.
- What are you talking about?

720
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,545
They're afraid we're going
to steal Buick.

721
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,848
What?

722
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,516
Just forget it.
Thank you.

723
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,800
Now we have nothing.
We're only weeks away.

724
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,802
Just hear her out.

725
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:59,134
She'll have you done
in time for dinner.

726
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,177
My plans got cancelled.

727
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,343
Look around.

728
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,516
I want to shoot the ad in here.

729
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,688
- It's not a home.
- It's better.

730
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,057
It's a clean, well-lighted place.

731
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,495
Okay, Hemingway.

732
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,430
As long as it's still about moms.

733
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,730
It's about family.

734
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,373
Every table here is the family table.

735
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:33,566
I hate even the word "family."

736
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,369
It's vague.

737
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,740
"Mom" is more specific.
Tell her, Don.

738
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,849
She's doing it the way
she wants to do it.

739
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,747
You want it right or not?
