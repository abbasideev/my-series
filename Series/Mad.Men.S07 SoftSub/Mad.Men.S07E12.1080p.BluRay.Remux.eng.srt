1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,630
- Good morning, Mr. Draper.
- Morning.

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,174
It's Beverly, isn't it?

3
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,467
He's on 19.

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,802
Thank you.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,308
Good morning.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,393
You don't have to do this
every day.

7
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,312
I won't have you lost again.

8
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,898
I wasn't lost, I was late.
I was fibbing.

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,568
Well, you can't do that.
It throws off a very busy schedule.

10
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,321
And not to mention everything,
et cetera.

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,367
Can you call housekeeping and ask them
not to make up my bed while I'm still in it?

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,410
Well, you won't have to
endure the hardships

13
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,954
of the Plaza much longer.

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,581
The floors of your apartment
will be done Monday.

15
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,668
If you pick paint,
you could move in next week.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,835
That's great.

17
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,466
Honey, you can just have this
waiting on my desk.

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,677
Does it smell any better
in here?

19
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,888
If you like Air Wick and fruit.

20
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,556
When I was packing,

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,601
well, I think these were best
kept from the movers.

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,315
Have you thought about new furniture?

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,193
I think it looks great in here.

24
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,029
No, for your apartment.
You only have a bed.

25
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,117
I made dinner reservations
in Farmington tomorrow.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,743
You're taking Sally
back to school.

27
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,078
Thank you.

28
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,956
Jim Hobart's back from vacation.
No napping.

29
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,150
You and the computer are
gonna share an office over there?

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,736
No, the old girl
served her purpose.

31
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,447
McCann is mission control.

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,157
Statisticians, programmers,

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,659
5 men and 10 women
just handling data.

34
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,746
Maybe they can keep track of your hat size.
Seems to be growing.

35
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,122
Why are you still here?

36
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,000
Somebody's got to hand over
the keys.

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,711
Well, I'm on 24 and you're on 26,

38
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,504
but I'll be up there
all the time.

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,923
There's an
executive dining room.

40
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,844
You know, I once rode on a bus to camp
sitting next to a guy like you.

41
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,346
We're not gonna be bunkmates, Crane.

42
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,015
I'll make them build
another floor if I have to.

43
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,060
I'm not going to let you spoil
the moment. My moment.

44
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,187
See you in the funny papers.

45
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,649
I don't know what's keeping
the building representatives,

46
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,817
but I feel perfectly comfortable...

47
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,611
Forging my signature?

48
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,404
No, that's okay. You can go.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,699
Well, this is my last day
and I wanted to thank you.

50
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,785
Bullshit. They can't fire you.

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,579
Actually, I took another job.

52
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,123
Travelers Insurance.
My cousin works there.

53
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,833
Look, I hate Caroline, too.

54
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,918
No, it's...

55
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,252
- Did I do something?
- No.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,049
It's just I kept thinking
about walking into a new office.

57
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,884
Yeah. I'm doing it, too.

58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,719
And now there's gonna be
one less person I know.

59
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,471
Mr. Sterling, it's not you.

60
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,476
Advertising is not a very
comfortable place for everyone.

61
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,607
That in mind,
I have to say thank you.

62
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,818
You're very amusing.

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,321
Fat lot of good it did me.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,537
Hello, neighbor.

65
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,832
We're the welcome wagon.
We heard you had a window.

66
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,584
Aren't you sweet to come by?
This is Beverly.

67
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,504
- And who are you?
- I'm Libby Blum.

68
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,880
Karen Schmidt.

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,882
Can we have a minute?

70
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,552
We're copywriters.

71
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,388
I recognized the names.
I was just going over Tampax.

72
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,140
We also did the pill
for Ortho...

73
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,017
If it's in it, near it or makes
you think about it, we're on it.

74
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,107
So, Topaz Pantyhose and Butler
Shoes set off an alarm.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,025
But we really love Avon.

76
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,319
This is incredible.

77
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,156
So you just came in here
to get on my business.

78
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,575
And to say hello.

79
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,910
Well, I'm flattered by both.

80
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,580
If you want us,
just ask Frank in the studio.

81
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,956
He'll ask Bobby in traffic,

82
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,250
and he'll tell Carl,
the associate creative director.

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,252
You can put a request in however you want.

84
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,171
We'll let the Soviets
deal with it.

85
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,466
You're aware that Peggy Olson
handles all of those accounts?

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,343
See, I told you.

87
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,762
Well, we'd love to share
the crumbs with her.

88
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,016
Thank you so much for the plant.

89
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,060
We're going to
the Oyster Bar tonight.

90
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,770
We have an informal
ladies' club.

91
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,064
It's not women's lib,
just a bitch session.

92
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,942
We are strictly
consciousness lowering.

93
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,903
When I get settled in.

94
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,585
Incredible.

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,754
Did you come to get your furniture?

96
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,382
There was a mix-up.
My office isn't ready.

97
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,676
Why are you still here?

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,846
Well, I'm not going to McCann.
And so far I'm not going anywhere.

99
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,640
And I'm being paid
through the end of the week,

100
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,475
so I thought I'd make
some long-distance phone calls.

101
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,315
We lost Dow.

102
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,733
We still owe them work.

103
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,277
Could you get Mr. Kreutzer
at Sugarberry Ham for me?

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,612
Why would I do that?

105
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,031
Because Marsha's
sorting things out over there

106
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,699
and I'm not calling myself.

107
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,709
I'm giving you
a standing ovation.

108
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,295
How was the Bahamas?

109
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,965
It's everything
we say it is in print.

110
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,805
I hope you're finding
everything satisfactory.

111
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,932
Ferg's been
an excellent tour guide.

112
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,727
He's just following you around
because he's our resident impressionist.

113
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,312
Do an imitation of Don yet?

114
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,983
"I'm, um, working very diligently

115
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,609
"on the, um, matter at hand."

116
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,738
Well, you better not make a joke
of this man.

117
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,408
We've lined up coffee
and baloney with Nabisco,

118
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,742
National Cash Register,

119
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,828
and your old friend
Conrad Hilton.

120
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,788
He bought you a gift.

121
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,123
That's never good.

122
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,876
And we just bought an entire agency
in Milwaukee to get Miller Beer.

123
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,837
For me?

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,547
When I want something, I get it.

125
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,466
And I've been trying to get you
for 10 years.

126
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,926
You're my white whale, Don.

127
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,596
Well, maybe you should send me
to the Bahamas.

128
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,680
In due time.

129
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,515
The important thing is
we're expecting you

130
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,684
to bring things up a notch
around here.

131
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,855
Jim, I don't know what to tell ya.
I'll do my best.

132
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,609
And, Don, this is a shirtsleeves
operation. We want you relaxed.

133
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,444
And should you ever
need anything in this city,

134
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,529
dinner reservations,
parking tickets...

135
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,906
Just drop our name into yours.

136
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,868
I will.

137
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,291
Miller Beer is coming in tomorrow

138
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,585
for handshakes
on their new idea.

139
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,128
Diet beer.

140
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,880
For ladies?

141
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
For men
watching their waistlines.

142
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,634
Why don't we call it "Tub"?

143
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,386
Have you said it yet?

144
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,929
What?

145
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,349
Have you introduced yourself?

146
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,978
I'm Don Draper
from McCann Erickson.

147
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,071
I appreciate the call.

148
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,323
Mostly because it's hard
for me to walk around here

149
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,075
acting like nothing's changed.

150
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,743
Only some things have changed.

151
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,496
Avon will be serviced
by the exact same personnel.

152
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,581
Creative handled by
Ted Chaough and Peggy Olson.

153
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,832
Forget about personnel.

154
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,334
Every dollar you spend

155
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,878
will now get you five times
the audience.

156
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,255
And once we get you on TV...

157
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,341
Well, we already are on TV.

158
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,802
We know that.
What Dennis is saying is...

159
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,012
You know, I'm in Atlanta all the time.

160
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,515
How about a trip to Augusta,
play a few holes?

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,808
You any good?

162
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,601
No.

163
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,105
No, I'm not.

164
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,859
Listen, my girl is telling me that
it's time for our staff meeting.

165
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,153
- Thanks again for the call.
- Of course.

166
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,905
Such a pleasure, Barry.

167
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
Bye.

168
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,868
Who's next?

169
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,038
I don't know what to say
except Barry is in a wheelchair.

170
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,289
What?

171
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,250
I told you that...

172
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,751
and I wrote it down.

173
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,879
I thought
that was Charlie Butler...

174
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,840
from the shoes.

175
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,383
No, it's not.

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,302
And it's Charles Butler
and it's footwear.

177
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,388
I can't believe you.

178
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,639
It's an honest mistake.

179
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,559
You heard him say he was
"walking around the office."

180
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,685
It's an expression.

181
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,979
Which he shouldn't be
able to use.

182
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,107
I stayed up all night
preparing those briefs.

183
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,068
Mr. Donnelly said you'd be on
the call to help with the transition,

184
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,822
but you seem like you don't even care
about keeping these accounts.

185
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,827
I'm sorry. Who told you
you got to get pissed off?

186
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
All I ask is that
you please read the brief

187
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,046
before our next call.

188
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,174
You know what?

189
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,176
Do it yourself.

190
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,179
I thought you were gonna be fun.

191
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,792
I'm sorry to drop by.

192
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,212
Marsha. That's so sweet of you.

193
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,174
You didn't have to come up here.
It's not your fault.

194
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,801
Those are actually from McCann.

195
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,386
An apology. That's classy.

196
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,305
How do I explain this?

197
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,432
All the SC&P girls got flowers.

198
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,851
It's still classy.

199
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,895
Well, all the new secretaries.

200
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,398
They thought I was a secretary?

201
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,068
Did you tell Don what happened?

202
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,861
- Do you want me to?
- No.

203
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,324
- Maybe I should call Joan.
- That's not her job there.

204
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,993
- I know that, Marsha.
- I am taking care of it.

205
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,620
As well as your mail and memos

206
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,373
regarding Peter Pan
Peanut Butter and Tampax.

207
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,333
What happened to all my things?

208
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,001
They're putting your boxes in storage.

209
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,378
You will have an office any minute.

210
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,922
In the meantime,
you can work in the pool.

211
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,967
I am a copy supervisor.

212
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,095
I am not setting foot in there
until I have an office.

213
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,848
If they want me,
they can reach me here.

214
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,933
At home?

215
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,312
No. No. I'll be at SC&P.

216
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,773
Hell, that's where my furniture is.

217
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,525
I will let them know.

218
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,327
Could you hold that?

219
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,415
Good morning.

220
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,958
How are you, stranger?

221
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,668
Homesick.

222
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,966
- Well, takes some time to settle in.
- I know.

223
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,261
You should come by for a drink.

224
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,179
When am I going to do that?

225
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,936
Put me on your calendar.

226
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,189
We don't share any accounts.
You're too important.

227
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,399
Not for you.

228
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,819
Believe me,
I'd involve you if I could.

229
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,614
It's been a little bumpy.

230
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,908
I can still interfere.

231
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,285
No, I'll figure it out.

232
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,913
Of that I am certain.

233
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,169
- Let's make a date for lunch.
- Soon.

234
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,185
Tell me if you like the
general idea so I can take a few risks.

235
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,519
Where'd you learn to do this?

236
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,522
I'm an army brat, remember?
New base every year.

237
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,525
I want to live here.

238
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,861
You're my decorator.
I'll pay you in cash.

239
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,696
Nonsense. I love it.

240
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,866
Lunch in the executive boardroom
with Miller Beer.

241
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,910
They asked if roast beef
was okay.

242
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,578
Perfect.

243
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,419
Joan, nice to see you up here.

244
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,839
Are you coming to the Sears briefing?
That's a good idea.

245
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,633
No, I was actually
looking for Mr. Donnelly,

246
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,176
but if now is a bad time...

247
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,386
Ferg.

248
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,097
Pete, it's your meeting.
You can start without me.

249
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,641
I'm gonna put in a request
to get you involved with this.

250
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,767
Thank you.

251
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,061
That's thoughtful.

252
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,479
So, what can I do for you?

253
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,106
It's just...

254
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,692
Regarding the Avon transition,

255
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,236
I thought maybe
Pete could be an asset.

256
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,572
Pete's a vice president.
What's wrong with Dennis?

257
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,449
I like Dennis personally.

258
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
I'm not sure
the client responded to him.

259
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,497
Say no more.
I'll take care of it.

260
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,550
Hello?

261
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,768
Are those my boxes?

262
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,395
I gotta go.

263
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,563
I gotta go!

264
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,024
Yeah, I signed for them,

265
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,191
but I was wondering
what happened.

266
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,277
You've got to be kidding me.

267
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
You know
we're the only ones here.

268
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,197
Have you been on the phone all morning?

269
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,617
Stan called.
He doesn't have a phone yet.

270
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,495
He's on the 14th floor.
Come by and say hi.

271
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,705
And

272
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,916
I prepared this
for your approval.

273
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,380
What is this?

274
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,215
Do you think "quagmire"
should be plural?

275
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,551
We can't do this.

276
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,678
They're never going to
look at it.

277
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,847
Ed, you could easily end up

278
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,974
working for Dow again
or Ken Cosgrove.

279
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,185
You could even end up working for me.

280
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,190
That's not very subtle.

281
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,070
I asked you to do one damn thing
and you didn't even do it.

282
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,238
Fine. I quit.

283
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,662
Well, thanks for everything.

284
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,418
When you get settled in over there,
which will happen,

285
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,712
give me a call.

286
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,173
I promise.

287
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,778
I'm sorry. It's Bob, right?

288
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,488
Yes. Don, good to see you.

289
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,031
We've got the best box lunch around.

290
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,533
It should have your name on it.

291
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,827
Is this the Miller Beer meeting?

292
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,955
It certainly is.
Bill Phillips, Conley Research.

293
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,082
Don Draper and Ted Chaough.

294
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,667
- A pleasure.
- Shall we?

295
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,255
Is this every creative director
in the agency?

296
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,589
It's only half of us.

297
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,554
So, are you here
to "bring us up a notch," too?

298
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,763
So they tell me.

299
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,478
Good morning, gentlemen.

300
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,942
As you know, this is Bill Phillips,
senior director at Conley Research.

301
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,988
Bill, why don't you tell us a little bit
about this exciting new beverage.

302
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,076
Despite that pile of facts
and figures in front of you,

303
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,121
I don't look at this
as a presentation of research.

304
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,957
To me, this is an opportunity
to stimulate

305
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,543
some of our industry's
finest imaginations.

306
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,590
I'm going to describe a man to
you of very specific qualities.

307
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,596
He lives in Wisconsin,
Michigan, Ohio.

308
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,932
Some call it "the Heartland."

309
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,767
Some call it "the beer belt."

310
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,312
He has some college.

311
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,814
Makes a good living,

312
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,776
but it doesn't feel like it
because he works long hours.

313
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,778
He has a lawn mower.

314
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,406
Wants a hammock.

315
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,660
Bunch of power tools in
the garage that he never uses.

316
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,289
He loves sports
because he used to play them.

317
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,626
And he loves dogs
because they don't talk.

318
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,172
We all know this man

319
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,175
because there are
millions of him

320
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,593
and he drinks beer.

321
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,095
Not just any beer.

322
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,473
No, it has to be his brand.

323
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,309
And what is his brand?

324
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,312
The one he drank in college?

325
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,314
The one his dad drank?

326
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,943
The one that comes
in the best bottle, can, tap?

327
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,655
It doesn't matter
because that's it,

328
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,823
and it's not open
for discussion.

329
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,244
Now, you all know
that that's not true...

330
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,663
but how do you get him
to open his mind?

331
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,415
Better have something more,

332
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,251
or in this case...

333
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,418
less.

334
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,170
And that's tricky.

335
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,091
When we talk about
a low-calorie beer...

336
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,009
we immediately become feminine.

337
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,762
It's the word "calorie."

338
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,014
It makes you think
of a reducing plan.

339
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,643
A note on the fridge
to remind her about her diet.

340
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
Your girl still at lunch?

341
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,026
Beverly always takes
the whole hour. I insist.

342
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,282
I have a little news for you.

343
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,242
I hope
I didn't cause any trouble.

344
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,868
Too early for you?

345
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,829
No, of course not.

346
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,335
So, I spoke with Dennis.

347
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,296
I hope I didn't
ruffle any feathers.

348
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,301
Well, here's how it looks.

349
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,886
Like some junior account man
came in

350
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,430
and started swinging her elbows.

351
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,181
He didn't read the brief...

352
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,725
and I'm not Dennis' junior.

353
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,893
Joan, see it from his side.

354
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,522
He has a wife and three children.
He's not going to work for a girl.

355
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,607
What's he gonna say to a client?

356
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,859
"She's my boss"?

357
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,820
It happens all the time now.

358
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,613
Peggy Olson was our copy chief.

359
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,868
It's different with a bunch of
writers fresh out of Columbia.

360
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,245
And honestly, I doubt that's
gonna continue here anyway.

361
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,332
I see.

362
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,793
Joan, I didn't come down here
to upset you.

363
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,004
I agree that the best way
to keep the business

364
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,131
is to keep your status
on your accounts.

365
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,634
And you'll certainly get
the respect you desire

366
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,219
now it's just you and me.

367
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,931
You don't have to do that,
but I accept.

368
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,187
Good.

369
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,689
Now, first thing we have to do
is pay this guy a visit.

370
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,067
- Who?
- Barry from Avon.

371
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,693
We owe him an apology.

372
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,779
And let's face it, it would
be good to get out of town,

373
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,322
even if it's to Atlanta.

374
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,949
I appreciate that,
but I don't want to put you out.

375
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,788
Look, I know a good job
when I see one.

376
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,418
No, it's just that
might be too much.

377
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,711
He'll be in New York soon

378
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,838
and Avon corporate
is blocks away.

379
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,673
Hey, I'm easy.

380
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,635
I'm not expecting anything more
than a good time.

381
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,303
Excuse me?

382
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,515
I mean, I want to get
to know you, of course.

383
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,892
Of course.

384
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,144
Good.

385
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,439
My first act of benevolence,
you can call Charles Butler on your own.

386
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,858
We'll take him to lunch
next week.

387
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,110
Thank you.

388
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,281
From now on, no one comes
between me and your business.

389
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,617
I appreciate that.

390
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,292
We can't lose those accounts.
What would you do around here?

391
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,054
Loretta!

392
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,519
Here she is.

393
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,897
Sally left?

394
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,608
Yes. She got a ride
with her friend.

395
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,485
And no one thought to call me, I guess.

396
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,738
- Do you want something to drink?
- No.

397
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,990
They left after lunch.

398
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,033
I told her to call your office.

399
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,869
Your secretary is a moron.

400
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,621
I was out of the office.
I wanted to get the car washed.

401
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,915
She comes and goes
as she pleases.

402
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,835
And we can't get mad at her
for being independent.

403
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,961
It's normal.

404
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,715
Is that what Freud says?

405
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,510
So far I haven't come across
anyone normal.

406
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,890
You okay?

407
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,059
I carried $100 worth
of textbooks yesterday

408
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,227
during registration.

409
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,942
Maybe you're getting old.

410
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,487
I'm younger than you.

411
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,740
Always have been,
always will be.

412
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,620
Maybe you could find some nice
freshman to carry your books.

413
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,831
That's fine.

414
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,380
When do the boys get home?

415
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,052
Gene's at Cub Scouts
and Bobby's got baseball.

416
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,804
They won't be back until 6:30.

417
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,063
I'll let you get back
to your studies.

418
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,981
I've always wanted to do this.

419
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,818
Knock 'em dead, Birdie.

420
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,988
Bye.

421
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,385
Shit.

422
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,422
Your stomach is grumbling.

423
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,215
You never let me eat.

424
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,509
I can make fried chicken.

425
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,262
I don't mind playing the house,

426
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,930
but as long as your mother
and Kevin are away,

427
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,724
why don't you call in sick?

428
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,226
Let me take you to Bermuda.

429
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,811
No.

430
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,939
Cape Cod?

431
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,233
I don't wanna go anywhere
I don't want to go.

432
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,526
Don't make plans for me.

433
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,862
All right. All right.

434
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,700
I have a lot of work.

435
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,288
Look, I know I told you
not to complain,

436
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,416
but that doesn't mean
I don't want to hear about it.

437
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,670
But you really don't.

438
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,424
What happened?

439
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,554
It's a big place, and I asked
the wrong person for help.

440
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,807
And I don't think
I can get out of it.

441
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,144
Well, if you don't like that job,
you don't have to do it.

442
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,398
You got enough, and you got me.

443
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,776
They still owe me
over half a million dollars.

444
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,611
I'm not walking away from that.

445
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,905
So, this is a business problem.

446
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,366
Now, I can help.

447
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,413
You're already helping.

448
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,917
There's two ways
I deal with disagreeable people.

449
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,463
One, you can call a lawyer,
throw a bunch of paper at them,

450
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,133
tie them up in court,
cost them some money.

451
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,802
Nobody wins,

452
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,013
but it loosens the earth.

453
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,057
What's the second?

454
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,101
You can call a guy.

455
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,395
"A guy"?

456
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,106
I'm a developer.
Men get stubborn.

457
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,983
What does "a guy" do?

458
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,153
You get the right guy,
all they have to do is show up.

459
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,615
You've really done that?

460
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,952
You seem to like it,
so I'm gonna say yes.

461
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,288
You're disturbed.

462
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,084
Doesn't seem like
such a big problem now, does it?

463
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:55,303
I don't want to say goodbye for the summer

464
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,931
Beautiful night out there tonight.

465
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:02,144
In downtown Cleveland,
we have a high of 75, low of 62.

466
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,396
Not too sticky,

467
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,273
and it should stay
that way through the weekend.

468
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,566
I don't know about you,

469
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,235
but I am not ready
to say goodbye to the summer.

470
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,739
But not true of the folks
at Higbee's Department Store

471
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:18,493
where they're ready to provide
all the back-to-school fashions.

472
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,622
I'm really tired, aren't I?

473
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,918
You've been driving for seven
hours in the wrong direction.

474
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,170
Where are you going?

475
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,922
Racine, Wisconsin.
Ever been there?

476
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,924
No. What's in Racine?

477
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,803
Maybe some waitress
who doesn't care about you?

478
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,346
You shouldn't do that.

479
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,682
That's not gonna stop me.

480
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,644
You like to play the stranger.

481
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,690
Remember On the Road?

482
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,486
I've never read that book,
you know that.

483
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,030
I'm riding the rails.

484
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,241
"Whither goest thou, America,

485
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,661
"in thy shiny car in the night?"

486
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:10,962
Yes, it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer

487
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,592
But I'll feel the emptiness

488
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,824
- Hello?
- Peggy?

489
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,158
Yes. Who is this?

490
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,326
It's Marsha.

491
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,036
I thought I would try this
before I ran over.

492
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,162
Your phone's dead.

493
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,331
What do you want?

494
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,542
Well, on behalf of McCann Erickson,

495
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,836
I want to welcome you
to your new office.

496
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,754
When can you come over?

497
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,006
- Well, I guess right now.
- Wonderful.

498
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,092
Can you work at a drafting table

499
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,094
till they bring your things over
tomorrow?

500
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,012
Yes. Thank you.

501
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,146
Hello?

502
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,942
Is someone there?

503
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,063
- Roger.
- Oh, Christ!

504
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,191
I have a heart condition, you know.

505
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,695
Believe it or not, I'm not scary.
Organ music is scary.

506
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,405
What are you doing here?

507
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,241
I told Caroline I wanted
to pack my personal things,

508
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,826
which I will eventually do

509
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,954
as soon as I figure out why she
thought my bar wasn't personal.

510
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,247
Did you try Don's office?

511
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,250
All I found was lighter fluid.
I'm not there yet.

512
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,960
Mine's gone.

513
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,005
I don't want to go to a bar.
I did that yesterday.

514
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,591
Listen, sweetheart, if you don't mind...

515
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,344
I'm not running an errand.
I have to go to McCann.

516
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,220
Three days ago.

517
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,431
They screwed up my office, it...

518
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,476
It doesn't matter.
They're finally ready.

519
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,852
I'd do it for you.

520
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,521
Would you drink vermouth?

521
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,942
Yes, I'm afraid I would.

522
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,583
I'll be along in a minute.

523
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,336
Mr. Hobart. Can I help you?

524
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,422
You're sitting in his chair.
You're obviously not expecting him.

525
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,800
I told Daphne I don't know
when he'll be in.

526
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,176
Can I take a message?

527
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,970
Sure.

528
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,471
Tell him he missed Nabisco

529
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,390
and National Cash Register
just left,

530
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,017
so he might as well
take the rest of the day off.

531
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,894
Thank you. I'll let him know.

532
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,733
Is he on a bender, sweetheart?

533
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,985
I haven't heard from him,

534
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,320
but he went to take his daughter
to school.

535
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,905
I'm not concerned.

536
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,806
Look at this.
"Christmas Day, 1951 ."

537
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,600
Who's Roberta?

538
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,144
I don't know.

539
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,025
Roberta.

540
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,319
We had our drink.

541
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,449
You clearly don't need help.
You need an audience.

542
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,243
McCann made you wait.
You can make them wait.

543
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,454
I'm not enjoying this.

544
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,712
Oh, my God. What is this?

545
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,922
It's an octopus
pleasuring a lady.

546
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,551
It was Cooper's.
Was in his office forever.

547
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,053
You can have it.

548
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,554
You can put it in your office.

549
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,806
No. They won't take me
seriously.

550
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,602
That's pretty serious.
It's 150 years old.

551
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,396
You know I need to
make men feel at ease.

552
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,773
Who told you that?

553
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,859
So now I gave you something,
you can sit tight and keep me company.

554
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,783
You think you're gonna
have fun like this over there?

555
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,120
This is more attention
than I've ever gotten from you.

556
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,332
You should see the floor I'm on.
It's a nursing home.

557
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,626
What the hell happened?

558
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,170
You're acting like
you had nothing to do with this.

559
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,839
I'll have you know,
I held this place together.

560
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,009
I know you think that,
but you actually sold it.

561
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,096
You were supposed to
watch out for us.

562
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,848
This business
doesn't have feelings.

563
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,185
You get bought, you get sold,
you get fired.

564
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,395
If the account moves, you move.

565
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,190
Even if your name's on the damn door,

566
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,693
you should know better than to
get attached to some walls.

567
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,198
Well, hopefully I'll have
that problem someday.

568
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,535
Okay, hot stuff.

569
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,413
It's exciting.

570
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,876
I mean, I know
it's going to be challenging...

571
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,587
but I needed that.

572
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,839
So do you.

573
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,801
In the summer of '44,

574
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,012
it was over 100 degrees
every day in the Pacific,

575
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,766
so we dropped anchor in the
Ulithi Lagoon to go for a swim.

576
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,978
And you can imagine the men.
It was bedlam.

577
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,482
But I couldn't do it.

578
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,443
Can't you swim?

579
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,404
Did I mention I was in the Navy?

580
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,613
No, the real problem was

581
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,700
it was a two-story drop
off our cruiser.

582
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,369
We all have regrets.

583
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,080
No, I did it.

584
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,416
I just needed a push.

585
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,882
This was a hell of a boat, you know.

586
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,677
Come on.

587
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,853
It just looks good now,

588
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,314
but it was miserable
when you were in it.

589
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,356
Trust me.

590
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,859
Is that really how you're
gonna remember this place?

591
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,779
No.

592
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,032
Good.

593
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,497
This is the one for the road,
okay?

594
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,044
You gonna show up drunk
at 4:00 on your first day?

595
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,634
You know any Freemasons?

596
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,476
Yes? Can I help you?

597
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,811
I'm looking for Mrs. Baur.

598
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,438
I'm Mrs. Baur.

599
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,483
Good evening. I hope
I'm not disturbing your dinner.

600
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,319
Not yet. My husband
will be home any minute.

601
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,405
Well, I really just need
to talk to you.

602
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,158
I'm Bill Phillips
from Conley Research.

603
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,079
We represent an array
of American companies,

604
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,081
including Miller Beer,

605
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,876
and out of over 900 entries,
you, Diana Baur,

606
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,921
were chosen to win a brand-new
Westinghouse refrigerator

607
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,381
full of Miller Beer.

608
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,095
Now, you have your choice,
white or harvest gold.

609
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,847
That's the fridge, not the beer,
of course.

610
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,559
Well, that sounds wonderful...

611
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,062
but I'm not Diana, I'm Laura.

612
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,897
Can I still accept it?

613
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,609
I don't know.
I'm supposed to speak to Diana.

614
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,320
Is your mother home?

615
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,450
You really should
speak to my husband.

616
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,203
She's his ex-wife.

617
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,165
I guess if he knows where
she is, I could come back...

618
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,126
or wait in the car.

619
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,213
My neighbors have seen you
on the porch long enough.

620
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,506
Come on inside.

621
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,850
Have a seat.
Would you like some iced tea?

622
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,893
- I don't wanna be a bother.
- It's no bother.

623
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,687
I have to check on the chicken.

624
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,745
Are you looking for my mother?

625
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,957
Diana is your mother?

626
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,377
If she won something,
I should get it.

627
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,632
Yes, that makes sense.

628
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,686
Sorry to keep you waiting.

629
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,396
It was no problem at all.

630
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,862
I hope you're finding
everything satisfactory.

631
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,239
Well, I'm here
because I need your help.

632
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,492
I'm at your disposal.

633
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,620
I don't know how to put this,

634
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,372
but I don't feel that
my accounts

635
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,665
are getting
the right kind of attention.

636
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,292
Our accounts.

637
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,378
Well, that's just it.

638
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,046
I fully expect
to service clients

639
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,090
with the help of your personnel.

640
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,675
But as a partner at SC&P,

641
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,928
I had a certain amount
of status.

642
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,138
You know, more independence.

643
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,890
What's the problem?

644
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,558
You can speak freely.

645
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,812
Well, I don't think that
Ferg Donnelly is a good match.

646
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,565
Ferg's very important
around here.

647
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,568
Frankly, you're lucky he's taken
an interest in your business.

648
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,113
I understand that,
but it's not necessary.

649
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,949
I don't mean to brag, but I've been
handling this account on my own

650
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,283
since I brought it in

651
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,369
I'm sure that's true,

652
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,204
but you're gonna have to
get used to

653
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,248
doing things the way we do them.

654
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,836
Well, I don't know how to say this,
but I can't work with him.

655
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,925
Joan, it may not have sunk in,
but your status has changed.

656
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,804
Avon, Butler Footwear,
Topaz Pantyhose,

657
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,889
I guess you don't need
those accounts.

658
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,935
I've tried to be patient...

659
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,897
but I don't care about
your SC&P partnership.

660
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,817
I don't know if somebody
left it to you in their will,

661
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,736
but your little stake
doesn't mean anything here.

662
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,698
Is that what you want?

663
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,616
Because I'm perfectly happy to take

664
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,578
my half a million dollars
and be on my way.

665
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll bet people always say
you're the kind of gal

666
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,209
who doesn't take no
for an answer.

667
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,336
But no...

668
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,047
you're not telling me
how to run my business.

669
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,925
Now, find a way to get along...

670
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,636
or you can expect a letter
from our lawyer.

671
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,139
I wonder how many women
around here

672
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,849
would like to speak to a lawyer.

673
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,897
I think the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has one.

674
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,400
Women love it here.

675
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,652
You want to threaten us?

676
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,279
You'll be all alone.

677
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,948
No.

678
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,744
I think the second I file a complaint,
I'll have the ACLU in my office

679
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,704
and Betty Friedan in the lobby

680
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,373
with half the women
who marched down Fifth Avenue.

681
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,666
I guess you didn't see
the headlines

682
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,710
about what happened
at Ladies' Home Journal.

683
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,003
Or Newsweek.

684
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,506
Do you have any idea

685
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,007
how much space McCann buys

686
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,301
in The New York Times
every year?

687
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,387
We could get them to print
Mein Kampf on the front page.

688
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,182
Yes, I'm sure I'll find it difficult
to find a reporter

689
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,476
who wants to embarrass you
this deeply.

690
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,192
Look,

691
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,236
you're unhappy,

692
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,530
and now I'm unhappy.

693
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,240
So, how about this?

694
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,368
I'm willing to give you
50 cents on the dollar...

695
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,328
to never see your face again.

696
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,540
I guess I wasn't clear.

697
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,792
I'm not negotiating.

698
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,465
Then you should get
out of my office immediately.

699
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,306
Go ahead.

700
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,393
I'd rather give it to a lawyer.

701
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,910
So you get to drive all over
America giving people prizes?

702
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,495
That sounds like fun.

703
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,205
Well, I also give

704
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,999
a lot of boring presentations.

705
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,253
- Hello.
- Hello, honey.

706
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,589
This is Bill Phillips.

707
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,800
He says Diana
won some kind of prize.

708
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,261
A refrigerator
full of Miller Beer.

709
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,097
Really?

710
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,850
Well, there's been some confusion

711
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,437
because a Mrs. Diana Baur
entered our contest,

712
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,231
and, well,
she's nowhere to be found.

713
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,067
Diana never entered any contest.

714
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,445
Well, I guess it's a mistake.

715
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,988
Yeah...

716
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,531
letting you in our house.

717
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,452
And my wife, she doesn't know any better,
but I guess you knew that.

718
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,537
- Cliff, please.
- Let him answer.

719
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,627
Who the heck are you?
Or do I have to call the police?

720
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,217
You're right.

721
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,554
I'm deeply sorry
for the ruse, ma'am,

722
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,098
but I work for
a collection agency.

723
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,144
Clearly you're not responsible
for Mrs. Baur anymore,

724
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,064
but I need to know
her whereabouts.

725
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,194
Last I heard,
she was in New York.

726
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,905
- Do you have an address?
- No.

727
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,282
That's all I got.

728
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,786
I apologize for the intrusion.

729
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,048
Guess we're not as dumb
as you think we are.

730
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,174
I'm leaving.

731
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,176
The clothes, the shoes,
the Caddy?

732
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,637
You're no collection agent.

733
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,013
I am.

734
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,516
You think you're the first one
that came looking for her?

735
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,850
She's a tornado...

736
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,687
just leaving a trail of broken
bodies behind her.

737
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,234
I didn't mean to disturb you.

738
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,152
Yeah, but you did.

739
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,197
I'm just starting
to get back on my feet.

740
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,450
Just starting to get back to even
part of the way to where I was.

741
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,078
Look, I'm sorry.

742
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,913
I was worried about her.

743
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,210
She seemed so lost.

744
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,756
I lost my daughter to God
and my wife to the devil.

745
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,133
I lost everything.

746
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,468
Is that what you wanted to know?

747
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,096
No.

748
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,472
You can't save her.

749
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,767
Only Jesus can.

750
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,520
He'll help you, too.

751
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,272
Ask Him.

752
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,733
- Look, I...
- And don't come back.

753
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,118
Come on, once more from the top!

754
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,492
Where the hell have you been?

755
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,535
I had a lot of stuff to move.

756
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,579
Are any of you planning
to work here,

757
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,331
or is this
the con of the century?

758
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,375
Look, calm down.
We're all just settling in.

759
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,960
Calm down? Where the hell is Don?

760
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,837
He walked out of a meeting
Wednesday

761
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,922
and hasn't come back.

762
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,799
He does that.

763
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,219
Well, you may have sold me
a rotten apple,

764
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,805
but it's not too late
to let the ax fly.

765
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,223
Starting with that redhead.

766
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,516
Joan?

767
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,352
I don't want to hear
her name again.

768
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,296
Good morning. You made it.

769
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,258
You just come to work
like nothing happened?

770
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm here and I'm doing my job.

771
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,929
Get the door.

772
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,312
Jim Hobart's not afraid of you.

773
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,730
Then why'd he send you?

774
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,315
To tell you I can't help you.

775
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,776
Well, thank you very much.

776
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,236
Listen to me.

777
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,989
You're not going to do better
than 50 cents on the dollar.

778
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,574
It's not about the money.

779
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,325
It's only about the money.

780
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,785
Don't hide behind politics.

781
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,912
Take the money
and be done with them.

782
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,873
Take half my money?

783
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,543
I know it's all my fault.
And I'm trying to take care of it.

784
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,088
You've started something that
could leave you with nothing.

785
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,798
It's plenty.

786
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,342
I made sure he's good for it.

787
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,494
Tell him he has a deal.

788
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,358
Where you headed?

789
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,567
St. Paul.

790
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,695
I can go that way.

791
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,821
Great.

792
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,167
I don't want to take you
out of your way, man.

793
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,002
It's not a problem.
