1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,580
Are you ready?

2
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,748
Because I want you
to pay attention.

3
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,418
This is the beginning
of something.

4
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,860
Do you have time
to improve your life?

5
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,556
Do you have precisely 30 seconds

6
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,997
for a word
from Accutron Watches?

7
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,034
The watch appears bottom third.

8
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,399
The second hand moves
with a fluid sweep

9
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,042
and above it...
"Accutron Time."

10
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,040
You go into a business meeting.

11
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,941
Is there food in your teeth?
Ashes on your tie?

12
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,547
And you've got nothing to say.

13
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,741
The meeting is boring,
but you can't be.

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,852
But you're wearing an Accutron.

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,386
This watch makes you interesting.

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,785
It's a boardroom.
It's black and white.

17
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,120
We hear light traffic.
No talking.

18
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,627
We just see our man,
you, late 20s,

19
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:29,131
shaggy with a youthful cowlick,
but in a suit and tie.

20
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,769
This is a businessman
staring at his watch

21
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,769
as muffled conversation
swirls around him.

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,068
Now we just hear
the electronic hum.

23
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,576
Omm-mm.

24
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,272
He stands up
and the faces come into view.

25
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,781
A couple of white-haired men

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,783
and a contemporary
who looks like Steve McQueen.

27
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,151
You shake hands and "Steve McQueen"
gets a look at your watch.

28
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,155
We hear the first words.

29
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,123
"Is that Swiss?"

30
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,660
Now we're in color

31
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,661
and it's a little interview
for the two of them

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,290
while the other men look,
outlining the benefits of this watch.

33
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,267
It is Swiss.
It is accurate.

34
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,964
It is the height of design
and technology.

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,111
"Accutron.
It's not a timepiece.

36
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,906
It's a conversation piece."

37
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,412
Wow, Freddy.

38
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,820
That's a home run.

39
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,016
Actually,
it's kind of an end run.

40
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,297
That is not what I expected.

41
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,692
There's a nice way to say that

42
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,300
and there's the way
you just said it.

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,595
Well, it's really good.

44
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,830
They're going to resist
that black and white thing.

45
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,304
Yeah, but nobody's done it.
Not that I know of.

46
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,642
"Accutron, it's time
for a conversation."

47
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,645
It's not as dramatic
and it hides the benefit.

48
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,977
I don't know.
It sounds more elegant to me.

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,780
Yes?

50
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,819
You wanted me to tell you
when it was five minutes

51
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,286
until the status meeting.

52
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,289
Thank you, Shirley.

53
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,818
So, I'll see you next week.

54
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,554
I'm gonna have
another cup of coffee.

55
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,131
You really put the "free"
in freelancer, don't you?

56
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,813
Ahem. Hello?

57
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,315
Hello, Daddy.

58
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,147
Oh.

59
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,754
How are you, honey?

60
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,186
I'm well.

61
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,326
I thought I'd catch you
before you went to the office.

62
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,484
Right.

63
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,063
I'd like to have brunch
Sunday morning.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,359
Sure.
That'd be nice.

65
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,063
I'll bring vodka.
We'll have Bloody Marys.

66
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,501
No, in a restaurant.

67
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,538
How about the Plaza?
They have vodka.

68
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,040
It'll just be me.

69
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,611
Sounds touching.

70
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,612
10:30.
Bye-bye.

71
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,717
Bye, honey.

72
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,916
I feel like we really
got somewhere last night.

73
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,953
Hello, Dawn.

74
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,395
- Gentlemen.
- The team is here.

75
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,897
Fire when ready.

76
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,637
How long is this meeting?

77
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,034
That depends on you, doesn't it?

78
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,039
Who do we have here?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

79
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,381
That's very hip, Lou.

80
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,881
- Should I get the door, Lou?
- Yes, Nurse.

81
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,387
So, how is everybody today?

82
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,048
Ready for your routine checkup?

83
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,218
Just open your mouths
and say "ahh."

84
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,565
Gentlemen.

85
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,071
Get me those brand reviews.

86
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,072
It's a deadline, knuckleheads!

87
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,574
You know what it says to me?

88
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,144
It says you don't care.

89
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,180
And anybody who doesn't care
doesn't have to work here!

90
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,916
And you do not have the weekend!

91
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,824
- I can come back.
- No.

92
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,360
Clara, can I get a buttered roll,
please, from the lobby?

93
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,293
Yes, of course.

94
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,126
Come on in.

95
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,796
What are you holding?

96
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,272
It's Avon.
You said you wanted to see me.

97
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,933
How many accounts do I have?

98
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,203
Well, it's all of them.

99
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,347
It feels like more.

100
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,382
I'm walking into this office every day
and I barely get ahead of things

101
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,280
before I get Bob from Detroit
around noon

102
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,387
and Pete from LA around 2:00.

103
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,216
Is this Avon related,

104
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,380
or did you just need someone
to hand you a tissue?

105
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:52,326
I have no real help except Torkelson,
who's Cutler's guy.

106
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,158
And I think he's making
Clara nightly.

107
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,733
- That's juicy.
- He can have her.

108
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,394
The point is Butler Footwear
just hired a new head of marketing

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,403
and if I meet with him,
it's a demotion.

110
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,633
You're head of accounts.
He'll think he's important.

111
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,209
That's what it looks like to him.

112
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,972
But to Charles Butler Jr.,
it looks like I'm only as important

113
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,375
as his head of marketing.

114
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,016
If I have no underlings,
I'm useless.

115
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,015
Have Roger or Cutler
meet with him.

116
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,552
That's two dumb ideas.
You're not listening to me.

117
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,917
This is a hierarchy.
Do you understand that?

118
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,021
Tell him I couldn't make it
at the last minute.

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,227
I'm having dinner with Jerry Lewis
or GM or somebody.

120
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,835
No, don't mention other clients.

121
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,772
Certainly.

122
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,603
I appreciate
your confidence in me.

123
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,836
- Make him go away.

124
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,242
I have your roll and I have
Bob Benson on the line.

125
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,748
You see this?
I don't have time to take a crap.

126
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,553
And last but not least,

127
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,385
any news from the Motor City?

128
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,756
Chevy XP collateral is scheduled
to go to press Monday.

129
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,762
- Hallelujah.
- But we don't have approved copy.

130
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,400
We don't even have a name for it.

131
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,556
Dang it.

132
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,532
Chevy graphics people
keep telling me

133
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,535
there's a "Chevy way"
of doing things.

134
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,038
- And money is no object.
- Get it in writing.

135
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,572
You didn't pick an angle
for Accutron.

136
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,236
Wow, is that today?

137
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,644
Sure, I did.
Dawn, what did I say?

138
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,310
"Just in time to be on time."

139
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,285
That wasn't one of the choices.
I think that was a digression.

140
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,789
How about
"Accutron is accurate"?

141
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,894
That was one of the choices,
I'm positive.

142
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,496
"It's time for a conversation."

143
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,598
I think that one's more finished.

144
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,825
And I think you're putting me
in a position of saying

145
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,298
I don't care what you think.

146
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,633
Why would you put
something in front of me

147
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,297
that you don't want me to pick?

148
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,602
Because you told me
to give you two ideas.

149
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,472
You apparently only gave me one.

150
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,843
Last week I gave you 30 choices
and you told me to bring you two.

151
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,915
That's the way we do it.

152
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,319
I like your car.

153
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,853
Your flight was late.
We don't have time to go home.

154
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,890
One quick dinner, and the rest
of the weekend we're alone.

155
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,049
So let's go.

156
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,399
I can't move the seat.

157
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,345
Where should we start,
DDB or K&E?

158
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,216
- Surprise me.
- Oh, hey.

159
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,928
Well, hello there.

160
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,467
Why aren't you brown?

161
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,400
- It's January in LA, too.
- That's no excuse.

162
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,040
Oh, Moira, can you
remind me to pick up

163
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,903
two dozen bagels
before the end of my trip?

164
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,873
Aha.

165
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,310
So, the missus misses New York.

166
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,212
No, they are for Pete.
Nan loves California.

167
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,045
Aren't you done
with your adventure?

168
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,415
You know how many times
I've come down here looking for fun?

169
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,647
Isn't Lou fun?

170
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,382
Lou's great.
We just miss you.

171
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,759
Why don't you move
St. Joseph's back another day?

172
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,591
You'll still have time to catch up.

173
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,630
You can come to
the inauguration with me.

174
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,760
I'm supposed to take Sterling,
but say the word, I'll jettison.

175
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,304
Moira, let's start with Chevy.

176
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,463
You're really going to work?

177
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,576
Pencil him in for tomorrow.

178
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,744
That's what I've been saying.

179
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,318
I know. Okay, Ira.
I've got to go.

180
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,579
Hello, Alan.

181
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,484
I'm sorry,
I think I'm a little early.

182
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,924
First actress ever to say that.

183
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,459
You look wonderful, honey.

184
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,257
- Don Draper, this is Alan Silver.
- Don't get up.

185
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,829
The husband is a matinee idol.

186
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,473
I told you.

187
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,337
Don, I want to get one thing
out of the way.

188
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,603
Know that it was important to me

189
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,714
that you know the man your wife
is spending so much time with.

190
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,841
I assure you, it's greed
and nothing else.

191
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,783
I feel completely at ease.

192
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,481
My partners in New York
promise a lot of things to girls

193
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,648
when they come West.

194
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,521
They passed off a lot of dogs.

195
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,527
But your girl is something.

196
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,530
I mean, she's the kind of girl
who's gonna shine for the network

197
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,999
in her callback for
the "Bracken's World" pilot.

198
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,069
What?
Get out of here.

199
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,399
I will not.

200
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,007
I thought the guy hated me.

201
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,836
But his boss loved you.

202
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,671
I'll say one thing about this girl,

203
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,143
she evokes strong feelings.

204
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,250
I feel like I just ate
a bag of butterflies.

205
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,044
Let's celebrate.

206
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,243
Young man.

207
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,720
Let me get a bottle
of French champagne

208
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,382
for my French TV star here.

209
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,858
I can't believe it.
When is it?

210
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,361
Wednesday, 9:15.
We can hold off on fixing your teeth.

211
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,522
Obviously I jumped
the gun on that.

212
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:03,997
Okay.

213
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,832
What network?

214
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,404
NBC.

215
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,563
Such great news, honey.

216
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,511
Look at you two.

217
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,772
You're my favorite couple.

218
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,922
- Mr. Barnes? Wayne?
- That's me.

219
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,553
I'm Joan Harris from SC&P.

220
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,628
Should I tell them
that we're ready for a table?

221
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,628
Maybe we should wait for Ken.

222
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,630
Please, sit.

223
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,765
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a Coke.

224
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,909
Two Cokes.

225
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,475
I'm so sorry.

226
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,704
Ken was called away
on an emergency

227
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,905
and rather than risk cancelling
on someone so important,

228
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,549
he asked that I stand in.

229
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,946
Look, I must be crazy
to be disappointed.

230
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,452
I'm sure you had a hard time
keeping this seat empty,

231
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,647
but this conversation
is best for Ken.

232
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,094
Tell me about your new position.

233
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,751
Head of marketing.

234
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,625
That's not just new for you,
that's new for Butler Footwear.

235
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,131
They pay me to think
about the four Ps...

236
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,463
price, product, place,
and promotion.

237
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,504
- Thank you.
- That's a smart way to think about it.

238
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,073
I have a degree in business.

239
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,141
It's not a science,
but we try to make it one.

240
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,247
Advertising is just a small piece
of the marketing mixture

241
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,314
and it might be more effective
if it's better integrated

242
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,814
into our business.

243
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,646
So are you thinking
about bringing

244
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,482
one of our account executives
into your office?

245
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,648
Actually, I'd like to move
all our advertising in-house.

246
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,995
It does sound like the conversation
is getting bigger than the two of us.

247
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,296
There's someone above you
and someone below you

248
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,837
and everybody's buying
everybody dinner.

249
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,442
Wouldn't it be cheaper for Mr. Butler
to just walk down the hall?

250
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,272
SC&P's relationship
with Butler Footwear

251
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,211
is very important
to our company.

252
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,181
And I think you're being
shortsighted about our value.

253
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,343
Well, I was hired to be bold.

254
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,785
And I'm prepared
to make my recommendation.

255
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,886
Forgive me, but my wife
will he excited

256
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,690
to have me tuck the kids in
at least once this week.

257
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,026
Certainly, I just...

258
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,035
could you hold off on your
recommendation a few days

259
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,640
so that you can at least have the dinner
you thought you were having?

260
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,798
Sure.
Pleasure to meet you.

261
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,876
You as well.

262
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,307
Excuse me.

263
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,148
Could I get a splash
of whiskey in this?

264
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,593
I'll get the bag.
You go sit down.

265
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,428
Take a quick look.

266
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,903
Then I want to turn off the lights
so you can see the view.

267
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,774
I like what you did with it.

268
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,343
I love it.

269
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,107
But my next house
is gonna have a pool.

270
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,410
Our next house.

271
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,952
Are you sure you don't want to move
into a more populated area?

272
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,716
It's like Dracula's castle up here.

273
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,757
They're far away, Don.

274
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,794
It's just what happens
to the sound in the canyon.

275
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,091
I'm scared, but I don't want
to turn the lights back on.

276
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,734
I'm a little dizzy.

277
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,435
I just... I need to keep walking
just for a second.

278
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,606
Oh!

279
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,087
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,593
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.

281
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,456
Get some rest.

282
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,136
Don, honey.

283
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,280
Please don't flick any cigarettes
off the balcony.

284
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,972
I don't know how,
but everyone says

285
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,140
they can tell
where the fire starts.

286
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,033
Don?

287
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,770
I love my scarf.

288
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,347
I thought with the convertible,
you'd need a few.

289
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,644
It's 9:00 and I have to get to class.

290
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,445
You want me to drop you
at the office?

291
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,284
No, I'll take a cab.

292
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:56,120
Just don't work all day, okay?

293
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,320
And don't rip the ads
out of my magazines.

294
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,696
Stan, you want coffee?

295
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,415
What are you doing here?

296
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,018
I'm just catching up on all the work
that's been going on.

297
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,585
Looks good.
Lou, he's...

298
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,019
Yes, absolutely.

299
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,886
- So...
- I have a lot to do.

300
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,552
Stan, do you want any coffee?

301
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,322
- Yes.
- What?

302
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,364
He said yes.

303
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,865
Stan!

304
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,005
You don't have to make me any.
I'll he out of here in a minute.

305
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,508
Hey, Ted.
Good to see you.

306
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,268
Hey, Stan.

307
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,434
I thought you'd be tan.

308
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,745
Well, you're in an office here,
you're in an office there.

309
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,747
What's the difference?

310
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,907
You know what?

311
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm just going to get my work
and get out of here.

312
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,855
Good to see you guys.

313
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,391
None of this seems
related to coffee.

314
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,027
Buck up, chief.

315
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,933
I'm fine.
It's fine.

316
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,873
You look good.

317
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,952
You look well, too.

318
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,449
Iced tea.

319
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,256
You really branched out
into a new environment.

320
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,126
I did discover it
in a homesick moment.

321
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,894
I flew back New Year's Eve
after a week with my brother

322
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,300
and Christmas with Tammy
and my in-laws.

323
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,407
Sat at the counter by myself

324
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,304
and immediately felt divine.

325
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,445
I'll have a Brooklyn Avenue.

326
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,171
It's a pastrami with the coleslaw
right on the sandwich.

327
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,508
Two of those.

328
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,979
Believe it or not, Brooklyn Avenue
is a street in East Los Angeles.

329
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,851
The New Yorkers here,
they brought as much as we need.

330
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,822
But the bagels are terrible.

331
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,659
Where are you living?

332
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,299
I have an apartment
by the tar pits.

333
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,958
It's one bedroom,
but it's two stories.

334
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,695
Must have quite a view.

335
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,034
The city is flat and ugly
and the air is brown,

336
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,198
but I love the vibrations.

337
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,637
You not only dress like a hippie,
you talk like one.

338
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,341
What have you been up to?

339
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,817
Keeping busy.
You sign anything out here?

340
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,187
Yeah.

341
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,053
The first week I signed
H. Salt Fish and Chips.

342
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,693
Four stores.

343
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,954
Didn't Roger make
an announcement?

344
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,688
I wouldn't know.

345
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,027
Oh, of course.

346
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,228
Listen, you know if it was up to me,
you'd be back there already.

347
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,039
How's Ted?

348
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,541
I noticed you timed it so that you'd
be out here while he was back there.

349
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,543
I came to see my wife.

350
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,545
Yes, of course.

351
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,206
I've been meaning to look her up.

352
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,013
It's incredible, but he's sour.

353
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,886
Maybe he doesn't like the sun.

354
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,323
Last weekend, middle of January,

355
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,520
Sunkist sent us out
to the groves

356
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,030
and I picked an orange
right off the tree.

357
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,395
It's 75.

358
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,366
There's snow on the mountains.

359
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,563
Ted sat in the car with the door open
writing on a pad.

360
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,277
It's good, isn't it?

361
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,243
So although Beverly Hills
has the patina of show business,

362
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,783
it's really just accountants,
lawyers, and dentists.

363
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,514
And you can walk to lunch,
although I don't.

364
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,089
Very nice.

365
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,453
So this is the chamber of horrors.

366
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,959
And then that's my office.

367
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,698
Well, wonder who that could be.

368
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,599
- Hello there.
- Bonnie Whiteside.

369
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,802
This is Don Draper.

370
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,605
Bonnie's a real estate agent.

371
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,578
She's helping me find
the ideal pad.

372
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,943
What, and leave the tar pits?

373
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,415
It's cute, but he shouldn't
be renting.

374
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,623
Those are some
nice-looking properties.

375
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,252
Where are you living?

376
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,456
I told you, honey,
Don's bicoastal.

377
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,626
I wanted to be by the ocean,
but my wife rented a house in the hills.

378
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,796
- Great view.
- City or valley?

379
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,932
I don't know.

380
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,908
Well, when you're tired
of commuting,

381
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,944
give me a call.

382
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,484
Don't get excited, Don.

383
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,416
She turns it on for everyone.

384
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,482
Ooh!

385
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,658
Professor Podolsky?

386
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,803
Mrs. Harris, I presume?

387
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,199
I appreciate you meeting me
on a Saturday.

388
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,172
Well, the price is right
and the company looks interesting.

389
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,279
What exactly is the company,
by the way?

390
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,851
The client is in footwear.

391
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,318
Shoes, women's.

392
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,186
The new head of marketing
wants to cut costs.

393
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,228
I get it.

394
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,365
It's 20 degrees out there
and the kids are in sandals.

395
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,626
Lowering overhead
is not a bad idea.

396
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,667
Is that where you'd start,

397
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,805
keeping in mind "the four Ps"?

398
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,963
Do you have an MBA?

399
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,042
No, but their head
of marketing does.

400
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,008
These kids.

401
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,308
Believe me, Rockefeller didn't worry
about "the four Ps."

402
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,042
Still, I'm going to need
an argument

403
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,017
and I think it's going to need to be
more technical than that.

404
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,248
I mean, if they're not quitters,
it makes more sense

405
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,393
to diversify their lines
or open foreign offices.

406
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,052
How much to get an analysis
like that in writing?

407
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,825
Well, let's see if you have
anything to trade.

408
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,394
This is a business school.
Doesn't money work here?

409
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,502
I'm doing an advertising
research study.

410
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,007
I wanted to know
what percentage of your clients

411
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,270
work on fees versus commission.

412
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,339
Oh.

413
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,279
Well, when I started working,

414
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,751
my goodness... 16 years ago,

415
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,913
all of our clients
were on commission.

416
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,424
We started discussing
a fee-based model three years ago.

417
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,585
Now we're at 50-50.

418
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,389
I don't know
if you can answer this,

419
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,125
or even understand it,

420
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,771
but what is the difference?

421
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,100
Actually, I can answer that.

422
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,606
You're going to need another pad.

423
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,805
Hello.

424
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,451
You frying bacon?

425
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,814
It's in the coq au vin.

426
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,720
And I made bread pudding
with blueberries in it for dessert.

427
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,656
Any wine left
or did the chicken drink it all?

428
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,765
I picked you up a bottle.

429
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,797
Better.

430
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,431
I think you have the wrong address.
I don't know...

431
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,299
Fellas, why don't you
put it over there?

432
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,668
Over where?
It's huge.

433
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,470
By the window. There's a wall.
That's where it goes.

434
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,351
- Thank you very much.
- You've got to sign.

435
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,018
Thank you.

436
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,270
Why did you do that?

437
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,373
- You have an antenna on the roof?
- It's huge.

438
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,633
It's the way they make them now.

439
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,003
How's it gonna look, Don?

440
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,372
You know, everyone
I know here is starving.

441
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,672
You're going to be on TV.

442
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,372
Don't you want to watch yourself
in living color?

443
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,539
Don't jinx me.

444
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,387
I didn't know an expensive gift
would upset you.

445
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,525
You're not here
long enough for a fight.

446
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,893
What are you doing up so late?

447
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,695
My mama said to tell you
the toilet's clogged.

448
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,305
Well, she's not supposed
to flush things down it.

449
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,168
She'll know what
I'm talking about.

450
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,810
My mama said some people
just throw it out the window,

451
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:34,967
but she's not gonna.

452
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,135
You got to fix it.

453
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,679
I'm sorry, Julio,
but I just got home from work.

454
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,908
It's Saturday.
Why you got to work?

455
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,882
You got to fix it!

456
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,181
You could ask nicely.
That might work better.

457
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,756
- She said to yell at you.
- Why?

458
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,415
Because you don't listen.

459
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,561
I don't understand her!

460
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,597
Here. This is yours.
It's a gift. Good night.

461
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,929
What is this?

462
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,935
Let's go to bed.

463
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,372
Hey.

464
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,379
Yes?

465
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,108
We haven't celebrated.

466
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,422
Oh, I didn't know
if you wanted to.

467
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,722
I do.

468
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,795
Let me brush my teeth.

469
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,259
Hold on.

470
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,509
Are you okay?

471
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,522
I'm just...

472
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,717
I don't know why I feel nervous.

473
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,328
About this?

474
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,624
About everything.

475
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,826
Don't.

476
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,029
Good morning.

477
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,008
How much time do we have?

478
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,408
I'm on the red-eye.

479
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,785
I hate this.

480
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,251
We have the rest of the day.

481
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,187
I know.

482
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,759
I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

483
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,776
Hello.

484
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,108
They saved all the construction
for Sunday.

485
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,776
It's okay, Daddy.
Catch your breath.

486
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,114
It's so good to see you.

487
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,886
Sweetheart, being summoned
makes me nervous.

488
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,120
No, everything is wonderful.

489
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,129
Can you give us a minute?

490
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,259
To the fear of an ambush.

491
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,568
To being together.

492
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,170
What the hell are you up to?

493
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,810
I just wanted to see you

494
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,578
and tell you that it's been
too long and that...

495
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,813
well, when all is said and done,

496
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,424
I forgive you.

497
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,117
That's beautiful to hear.

498
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,660
Because I forgive you, too.

499
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
No, Daddy.

500
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,830
I forgive you.

501
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,627
And I forgive you.

502
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,037
All of your transgressions...

503
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,508
abandoning Mother,

504
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,010
making me ask for money,

505
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,945
your intermittent
interest in Ellery.

506
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:43,848
I don't even care
that you smell like incense

507
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:48,890
or have any thoughts about
your current, quote, "state of affairs."

508
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,395
I... I simply forgive you.

509
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,965
You want me to say I'm sorry?

510
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,365
Because I don't agree
with all that.

511
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,004
Where the hell
is this coming from?

512
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,698
Well, if you must know,
I've been searching.

513
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,368
And with a little help,
I've come to understand

514
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,743
that anger can be
vanquished by love.

515
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,383
Are you going to church?

516
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,678
Not in any way you'd understand.

517
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,686
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing.

518
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,415
You can't make it better.

519
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,825
So now we're just supposed
to eat eggs Benedict?

520
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,329
I would love that.

521
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,585
Good evening.

522
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,552
Evening.

523
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,957
Thank you.

524
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,727
Do you want a sleeping pill?

525
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,097
No, thank you.

526
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,135
You know what?

527
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,036
Me either.

528
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,803
I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you enjoy flying.

529
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,709
I fly a lot.

530
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:22,651
And I'm always hoping
I was seated next to,

531
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,310
well, someone like you...

532
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,222
instead of a man with a hairpiece
eating a banana.

533
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,789
But why would I expect
anything else?

534
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,988
You can blame
Madison Avenue for that.

535
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

536
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,776
Where were you?
I was worried.

537
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,969
I thought we hated
all things domestic.

538
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,340
You sound uptight.

539
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,948
Man walks in,
obviously having tied one on,

540
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,414
woman says,
"Where were you?"

541
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,985
Kind of establishment.

542
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,122
Why are you being so mean?

543
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,915
Move over.

544
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,259
Oh, Christ.
Move him over, too.

545
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,694
Is that my vest?

546
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,699
If you were with someone,
I don't care.

547
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,860
You know anyone's welcome
in this bed.

548
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,370
I just want to get some sleep.

549
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:40,558
I'd like to put this on,
but vanity is preventing me.

550
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,323
You want me to wear mine
so I don't see you?

551
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,565
This is nice.
I usually sleep alone.

552
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,174
What about the man
that gave you that ring?

553
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,748
He passed away.

554
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,909
A year ago, actually.

555
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,851
I was...

556
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,925
he wanted his ashes
scattered at Pebble Beach.

557
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,189
How was that?

558
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,160
I failed.

559
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,358
It's a very popular spot
for such things.

560
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,096
Apparently, they don't want
another sand trap.

561
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,934
I ended up at his second choice.

562
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,372
Disneyland.

563
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,276
Really?

564
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,112
- Have you ever been there?
- I have.

565
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,384
Where is he now?

566
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,956
Tom Sawyer Island.

567
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,791
That's probably
a popular destination, too.

568
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:49,228
Yes, they were very vigilant.

569
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,298
It took some doing.

570
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,699
How old was he?

571
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,964
He would have been 50.

572
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,541
So, much older?

573
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,703
He worked fast, too.

574
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,811
What happened to him?

575
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,319
He was thirsty.

576
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,718
He died of thirst.

577
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,918
His company sent him
to a hospital.

578
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:21,496
I went with him.

579
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:26,602
I was supposed to be
part of the cure somehow.

580
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,134
And all I did was observe.

581
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:38,505
I thought he was
really getting better.

582
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,181
Then a doctor told me
he'd be dead in a year.

583
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,183
All of them would be.

584
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,771
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

585
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,488
Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning.

586
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,318
Despite our best efforts,
we're still stacked up,

587
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,551
but it looks like we're two away.

588
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,026
I think that we'll begin
our descent in 15 minutes.

589
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,324
Sorry, I think I dozed off.

590
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,793
You have a few more minutes.

591
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,965
If I was your wife,
I wouldn't like this.

592
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,314
She knows I'm a terrible husband.

593
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:50,349
How long have you been married?

594
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,510
Not long enough.

595
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,359
I really thought
I could do it this time.

596
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,895
- Did she kick you out?
- No.

597
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,364
She doesn't know that much,
but she knows.

598
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:11,274
Well, if she doesn't know,
you should just keep it that way.

599
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,431
That's what people do.

600
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,042
I keep wondering...

601
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,616
have I broken the vessel?

602
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,418
If you did,
what can you do about it?

603
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,389
It's done.

604
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,536
I bet I could make you
feel better.

605
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,540
I bet you could.

606
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,473
There's a car waiting for me.
I can give you a lift.

607
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,817
I'm sorry, but I have
to get back to work.

608
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,935
Your tenant Mrs. Rodriguez
called again about her toilet.

609
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,800
She was hard to understand,
but I think she said

610
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,440
she's calling the alderman.

611
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,132
Ugh.

612
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,141
Call my sister Anita
and tell her to get Gerry

613
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,506
and his friend
the plumber up there.

614
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,976
- Shouldn't I just call Gerry?
- No.

615
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,343
Anita can ask
her husband, I can't.

616
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,781
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

617
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:33,013
- How was your weekend?
- Peachy. Cut up some firewood.

618
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,590
I'm sorry about last week.

619
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,423
You're right that I shouldn't have
suggested something I didn't like.

620
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,587
I never gave it another thought.

621
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,326
Well, I did and I realized
that Freddy's original idea

622
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,131
was the best,
but I didn't do it justice.

623
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,275
What are you doing?
I already said yes.

624
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,205
“Accutron,

625
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,676
it's not a timepiece,
it's a conversation piece."

626
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,281
Forget it.

627
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,044
- Morning.
- Morning, Lou.

628
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,884
This is actually a big idea.

629
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,957
Why are you making this so hard?

630
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,559
Open the door and walk in.

631
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,787
You do not need to parachute in
through the ceiling.

632
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,831
But I don't mind.
I just want to give you my best.

633
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,831
I don't know, Peggy-

634
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,368
I guess I'm immune
to your charms.

635
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,836
Can I get some coffee?

636
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,476
Good morning, Clara.
Is Ken in yet?

637
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:32,637
No, he's on the plane.

638
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,149
As soon as he lands, I need to speak
with him regarding Butler.

639
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,413
Good for you.
Mr. Butler is coming in this week.

640
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,988
What?

641
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,921
Get Wayne Barnes
on the line... now.

642
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,862
Mr. Barnes on line three.

643
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,269
Joan?

644
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,412
- You already set a meeting?
- Good morning.

645
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,348
I took you seriously,
but you didn't take me seriously.

646
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,853
Look, I know you're fighting
for your job, but don't get emotional.

647
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,582
I'm fighting for your job.

648
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,193
Okay, well, I appreciate it,
but don't worry about me.

649
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,923
- I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

650
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,399
Let's talk about your in-house
advertising agency.

651
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,539
You think you can go
into a network or a newspaper

652
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,265
with your checkbook
and get the space we get

653
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,434
when we deal with them
every day with 30 clients?

654
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,443
You will be competing
against us,

655
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,377
not against
other shoe companies.

656
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,143
We both know the shoe business
is going to decline

657
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,718
for some time in the future.

658
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,445
If you make a bold move now,

659
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,489
that decline will be
your responsibility.

660
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,717
What are you gonna do then?

661
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,623
You can only fire us once.

662
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,458
So what am I supposed to do?

663
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,156
I already set the meeting.

664
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,392
Cancel it.

665
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,002
No, I'm asking you,

666
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,139
what do I do?

667
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,411
Tell them we cancelled
the meeting.

668
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,674
We need more time to present
a revised media strategy.

669
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,648
- Yes.
- Good.

670
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,788
I'm still expecting to meet with Ken.

671
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,286
I'll follow up on that today.

672
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,856
You'd better.

673
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,159
Did you tell him to prepare
more boards for Accutron?

674
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,361
- Do you want to do it?
- No, I want to do it.

675
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,439
- I don't know what I did.
- Get out of here.

676
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,769
He may be in the art department,
but he reports to me.

677
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,208
We already have boards
for "Accutron is accurate."

678
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,711
You know that's a loser.

679
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,645
I think if he could see both of them,
he'll change his mind.

680
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,716
Or at least let us
show both to the client.

681
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,979
Let it go, baby.
It's dead.

682
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,350
No, I just don't think he's given it
the proper thought.

683
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,685
You're telling your boss
you think he's stupid.

684
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,725
Well, I'm tired of fighting
for everything to be better.

685
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,988
You're all a bunch of hacks
who are perfectly happy with shit.

686
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,995
Nobody cares about anything.

687
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,395
No one wants things
to be better, I got it.

688
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,127
I'll just stand out here
all by myself.

689
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,843
We find ourselves rich in goods,
but ragged in spirit...

690
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,175
reaching with magnificent precision
for the moon,

691
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,182
but falling into
raucous discord on Earth.

692
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,582
We are caught in war
wanting peace.

693
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,087
We're torn by division
wanting unity.

694
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:31,420
We see around us empty lives
wanting fulfillment.

695
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,584
We see tasks that need doing...

696
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,425
- Come in.
- ...waiting for hands to do them.

697
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,331
You know I'm breaking a rule here.

698
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,769
I haven't had one of these
sausages since I quit.

699
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,840
If this makes me
have dreams about beer,

700
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,500
I'm gonna be mad at you.

701
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,008
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.

702
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,243
I should be paying you.

703
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,786
You want that balcony door open?
It's freezing outside.

704
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,593
Peggy went bananas
for your Accutron work.

705
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,096
Of course she lifted her leg on it.

706
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,965
Also, I swang by
J. Walter Thompson,

707
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,297
thinking there was an emergency
with our copy for 7-Up.

708
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,804
- You want a sweater?
- Nah.

709
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,643
Turns out they're looking
for help on Oscar Mayer.

710
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,146
You are making quite a name
for me out there.

711
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:29,114
Bologna? Hot dogs?
It's moms and kids either way.

712
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,877
Why don't you stop this Cyrano bit

713
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,988
and march your ass in there
and get us both a job?

714
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,714
Because I have a job.

715
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,654
It's been two months.

716
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,393
Nobody's called, right?

717
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,995
I'm still being paid.

718
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,291
Well, they had Christmas
without you.

719
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,957
The Super Bowl.
Pretty soon it's gonna be Easter.

720
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,234
You know, I've been there.

721
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,339
You don't want
to be damaged goods.

722
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,350
I tried to get a hold of you.

723
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:06,114
Why? I spoke to Clara.
Thank you for solving that problem.

724
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:09,087
I bailed it out,
but I think it's irreparable.

725
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,124
It's only a matter of time
before we lose it.

726
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:14,126
Every account man who's ever come
into my office has said that.

727
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:15,855
But they haven't all
left one of these.

728
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,525
- Oh.
- Stay out of my office.

729
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,881
Sorry.

730
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,453
I dozed off.

731
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,386
Well, Jimmy says he'll be back
in the morning.

732
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:44,857
He needed a part.

733
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,053
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

734
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:50,199
It seems silly for you to go all the way
out to Brooklyn and come back.

735
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,698
It won't take long
this time of night.

736
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,736
Are you sure?

737
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,465
I don't like Anita there
alone in the house.

738
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,238
Of course.

739
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,846
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.
