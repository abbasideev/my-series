1
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,631
Hello!

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,382
Hi, Mom.

3
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,717
You want me to do that?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,801
In gloves?

5
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,262
The blender was broken at the diner.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,474
And you wouldn't dare
deprive them of dessert.

7
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,352
You look swanky. Fundraising?

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,270
Much better.

9
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,232
We had dinner with the dean
of Fairfield University.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,317
Some distant Rockefeller.

11
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,571
Actually, I'm planning on enrolling in the fall.

12
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,822
Master's degree.

13
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,116
Really? In what?

14
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,285
Psychology.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,790
I know it's beyond your experience,

16
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,750
but people love to talk to me.

17
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,836
They seek me out to share their confidences.

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,464
It should be fascinating
for everyone involved.

19
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,053
Hello, Don.

20
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,930
We're making chocolate shakes.

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,851
I should go.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,604
Don't rush off. You can finish your milkshake.

23
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,399
Make Henry one.

24
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,442
You give him a sip of yours.

25
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,735
Bye-bye.

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,697
Maybe I'll make my own.

27
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,993
Did you have fun?

28
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,299
Hello?

29
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,010
You're home.

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,387
I was expecting the service.

31
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,306
I just walked in.

32
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,807
I wanted to let you know that

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,393
the movers are gonna come on
Wednesday to pick up my furniture.

34
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,645
What time do you want me to be there?

35
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,105
Just tell the doorman.

36
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,649
We're coming at 10:00.
Does that give you enough time?

37
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,735
You know what time I go to work.

38
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,613
There's one other thing.
It's the 24th already.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,325
How could you be out of money?

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,744
Between the movers and the flight...

41
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,496
Why am I explaining myself to you?

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm tired of asking for an allowance.

43
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,459
Can we sign the papers and be done?

44
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,085
Your lawyer's very aggressive.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,129
That's not how I heard it.

46
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,423
I'm starting to think you're enjoying this.

47
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,551
Well, my finances are a mess
since the McCann deal.

48
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,679
You were a millionaire when I met you.

49
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,682
Just tell your lawyer he won.
I'll sign whatever you want.

50
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,892
I can't live like this.

51
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,227
This is what they do, honey.

52
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,647
How much do you need right now?
I'll leave a check.

53
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,400
Five hundred.

54
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,444
Who's moving you, the New York Jets?

55
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,822
I have to go.

56
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,745
I'm ready, Caroline.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
What's she doing here?

58
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,128
It's too much. I can't do it by myself.

59
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,755
Well, you should have asked me.

60
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,215
You're too busy!

61
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,633
Sit down, Shirley.

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,762
Well, this morning,
immediately following this,

63
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,681
you have a meeting with
Mr. Campbell and Mr. Torkelson

64
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,933
regarding Lester Chapman.

65
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,059
Who's he?

66
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,227
Secor Laxatives.

67
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,771
I'm sorry, but actually, he's at Life Cereal.

68
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,940
This is working out already.

69
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,025
They want to set a call for 4:00.

70
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,985
Hold on a second. Isn't he NAC?

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,654
I'll check the Rolodex.

72
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,322
I'm sorry, what's NAC?

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,325
No afternoon calls. Lester's blotto after lunch.

74
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,035
He is indeed.

75
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,245
Well, let's call him now.

76
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,256
So, it's 7-9-8...

77
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,633
This certainly is a two-man job.

78
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,136
...3...

79
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,514
So you just fly to Los Angeles
for the weekend?

80
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,640
Isn't that tiring?

81
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,559
What's tiring is coming back here.

82
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,561
So beautiful. You should go sometime.

83
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,479
I don't know if I'd like it.

84
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,189
How do you go to sleep at night

85
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,109
knowing the Manson brothers
could be running around?

86
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,903
- Good morning.
- The Manson family.

87
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,948
- Are they coming in?
- No. A quick word?

88
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,033
Coffee.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,415
So, I got a strange phone call.

90
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,294
Well, not strange, but unexpected.
Megan called me.

91
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,336
Really?

92
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,797
I guess she's coming into town
and she wants to buy me a drink

93
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,591
to see if I can help her find a new agent.

94
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,633
Can you?

95
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,051
Of course, I can. I do it all the time.

96
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,554
It's just... Well, I wanted to let you know.

97
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,056
Been down this road before
and you always find out.

98
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,975
Because you always tell me.

99
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,643
Yes, but she didn't want me to.

100
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,604
It's never stopped you before.

101
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,397
So should I meet with her?

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,609
She's not my wife anymore, Harry.

103
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:24,282
You have a call
from a Nicholas Constantinopolis.

104
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,325
Probably Greek.

105
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,328
Yes. I need to take this.

106
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,205
I'm sure that's a story.

107
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,666
Nicholas, it's Don.

108
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,090
Good evening. Can I get you
something from the bar?

109
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,717
Or are you expecting...

110
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,969
Hello.

111
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,598
How are you?

112
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,309
I'm surprised.

113
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,979
This isn't a coincidence.
I was looking for you.

114
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,898
What do you want?

115
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,692
I want to eat dinner with you.

116
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,611
Even if it's five minutes at a time.

117
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:02,946
No.

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,618
You're making me uncomfortable.

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,579
This is my phone number.
Call me when you get off work.

120
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,872
I'll meet you somewhere.

121
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,548
I'll show you her work.
You will absolutely recognize it. Ed!

122
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,175
All I'm saying is you dug pretty deep
to find a woman.

123
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,053
Do you know where
Samantha Ryan's portfolio is?

124
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,304
She calls herself Pima.

125
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,139
Pima Ryan?

126
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,016
Exactly.

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,394
She came and spoke
at RISD when I was there.

128
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,312
She's a very sexy lady.

129
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,689
I thought you were queer.

130
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,816
Where's Pima's portfolio?

131
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,819
I took it home. Does she want it back?
Does she need it?

132
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,823
No, I need it. Peggy forgot
this is my account, too.

133
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,284
We're really lucky. She's never done an ad.

134
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,078
Stan, I'm sorry, but you do not
have any of the qualities

135
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,748
that either I or Cinzano are looking
for other than being cheaper.

136
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,459
It's hard to keep my balls at this job.

137
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,503
Ed, what do you know about vermouth?

138
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,130
No.

139
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,761
Hello?

140
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,346
Hello. It's Diana.

141
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,557
You know, the waitress.

142
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,938
I'm glad you called.
I didn't think you were gonna.

143
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,691
I don't know anybody in New York.

144
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,901
So strange to see somebody that I know.

145
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,322
I'm just pleased you're not cross.

146
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,409
I was pretty mad. How did you find me?

147
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,371
Are you a private detective?
You kinda look like one.

148
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,166
Why don't we have a drink?

149
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,294
I've already got one. Let's talk now.

150
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
I waited a little,

151
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,674
maybe too long,

152
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,344
and you were gone.

153
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,014
So I told Nick at the diner to

154
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,224
let me know if you ever came back.

155
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,061
I went home.

156
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,771
Where's home?

157
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,273
Racine, Wisconsin.

158
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,485
I had to get a divorce.

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,613
I'm divorced.

160
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,366
Well, I happen to be in the same boat.

161
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,203
Right now I'm in the boat.

162
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
I must have known that.

163
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,875
Come over.

164
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,378
Where are you?

165
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,838
I'm at work.

166
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,507
I don't have a phone yet.

167
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,802
Fine, I'll come there.

168
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,857
Welcome.

169
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,070
Do you sleep like that?

170
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,698
I'm vain.

171
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,866
May I?

172
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,954
It's a very lovely apartment.

173
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,997
It's like Architectural Digest.

174
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,459
My...

175
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,046
She decorated it.

176
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,173
It's what I pictured.

177
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,551
So you were picturing it?

178
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,180
I took a cab to some stranger's
apartment with $6 in my pocket.

179
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,142
I was hoping it was like this.

180
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,312
I'm gonna sell it.

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,192
I was just apartment hunting.
It's gonna be hard to beat.

182
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,986
Can I fix you a drink?

183
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,074
I don't know how I feel about
getting to know you better.

184
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,077
It's 3:00 A.M. You know why you're here.

185
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,454
Do you want a drink or not?

186
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm already drunk.

187
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,423
Would you like a glass of water?

188
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,529
Hey, I can't sleep like this.

189
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,202
You were.

190
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,995
I don't want to.

191
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,373
Do you want to go?

192
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,420
No.

193
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,725
Are you really divorced?

194
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
Yes, I am. Really. Why?

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,984
You got a lot of coats in that closet.

196
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,154
She lives in California. She didn't need them.

197
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
Do you want one?

198
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,827
I was going to go to San Francisco.

199
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,870
I flipped a coin.

200
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,958
I always wanted to live here.

201
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,753
It was in all the movies, all the magazines.

202
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,005
I haven't seen any of it.

203
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,549
It's a great city.

204
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,343
How long were you married?

205
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,304
Twelve years.

206
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,725
I don't know why I thought it'd be easy.

207
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,435
It's never easy.

208
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,691
I've been through it before.
There's no children this time.

209
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,817
You?

210
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,279
No children.

211
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,499
You smell incredible. What is that?

212
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,084
Shampoo.

213
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,172
Avon.

214
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,138
I bought it in my living room.

215
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,768
In my ranch house.

216
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,356
And my two-car garage.

217
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,538
Diana?

218
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,337
They're here every other weekend.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,340
Well, not my little girl. She's at boarding
school, but the boys come.

220
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,773
Are you okay?

221
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,733
No.

222
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,033
What's wrong?

223
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,911
I lied to you.

224
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,038
Already?

225
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,001
No, I left home because I have a little girl.

226
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,837
I had a little girl.

227
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,554
I'm so sorry.

228
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,807
Yes.

229
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,394
When?

230
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,982
Two years ago.

231
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,234
The flu. Can you imagine?

232
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm so sorry.

233
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,576
I don't want to talk about it.

234
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,579
Obviously, I'm in New York City.

235
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,793
You should go.

236
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,088
It's my house.

237
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,467
Don't you have to get ready for work?

238
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,601
I don't feel like it.

239
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,453
Gentlemen, I'm going to be strict,

240
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,872
but this is Torkelson's law.

241
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,540
Take a good look.

242
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,293
You got your models, you got your bottles.

243
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,962
If you make it to lunch
without bothering anybody,

244
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,173
we'll let you have whichever you want.

245
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,135
Well, if you'll all excuse me.

246
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,805
Come on, I'll introduce you.

247
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,310
Pima Ryan, this is our art director Stan Rizzo.

248
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,688
So you'll be cutting up my work, will you?

249
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,733
Well, I try to treat it like art

250
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,985
even though it's just selling something.

251
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,654
All art is selling something.

252
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,407
No, we're actually selling something.

253
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,909
Today, it's vermouth.

254
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,119
I apologize the models have so many teeth.

255
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,163
I know you're not used to that.

256
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,332
Pleasure to meet you.

257
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,922
I'm sorry about that. He has a hard time with

258
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,090
new people.

259
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,300
No, he hates himself.

260
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,678
I don't think so. He's got a huge ego.

261
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,306
And he's a photographer.

262
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,351
Men like him don't bother me,

263
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,269
and they shouldn't bother you either.

264
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,979
Look at all you're doing here.

265
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,148
It's just my job.

266
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,901
Good morning, girls.

267
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,195
Could you take your places?

268
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,960
- Good morning.
- It's 11:30.

269
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,795
Where were you? I was worried.

270
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,046
I was sleepy.

271
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,341
Mr. Sterling's in there.
He's not to be disturbed.

272
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,513
Who are you hiding from?

273
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,182
I got two secretaries and three telephones.

274
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,310
I feel like Marlin Perkins
is chasing me on the savannah.

275
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,478
Hiding is pointless.

276
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,646
I've got work to do.

277
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,648
That's the other reason I'm here.

278
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,818
McCann represents Derby Foods.
Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

279
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,027
They're making a cookie.

280
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,195
Sounds delicious.

281
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,991
McCann also represents Nabisco.
National Biscuit Company.

282
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,659
They got the word "cookie" in their name.

283
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,869
No, they don't.

284
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,287
Do we have a shot at Derby?

285
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,663
No, it's just a cookie.

286
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,582
McCann's clients are
our clients. We're helping out.

287
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,001
You and Peter are taking them
golfing tomorrow.

288
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,127
I can't make it.

289
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,672
There's a messenger
here from your attorney's office.

290
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,215
He needs your signature.

291
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,426
Since when can't you go golfing?

292
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,970
Since Burt Peterson's the account man.

293
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,144
Good news or bad news?

294
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,521
Good news. It's almost over.

295
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,358
Well, don't settle until
you get the number you want.

296
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,195
Take it from me, no matter what she says,
you have given her the good life.

297
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,446
She'd never have had it.

298
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
Megan is not Jane.

299
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,993
So she never said you squandered
her youth and beauty?

300
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,536
Used up her childbearing years?

301
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,413
Thwarted her career? What career?

302
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,081
She's a consumer.

303
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,710
Mr. Sterling, are you
still at lunch? They're wondering.

304
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,045
She made her choices.

305
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,766
You're very good.

306
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,437
Can I help you?

307
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,149
Well, I've been told that my negatives
belong to the agency

308
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,152
and therefore processing
has to be done at your lab.

309
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,904
I'm not comfortable with that.

310
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,573
I hate to break it to you,

311
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,242
but it's not really yours anymore.

312
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,161
Don't you have a darkroom here?

313
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
Yes, but I can't do that.

314
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,336
I started off as a clerk
with a newspaper in Sarasota.

315
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,839
All I wanted was to get in that darkroom.

316
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,802
It's a nice thing to have, especially in the city.

317
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,264
So, you're a photographer.

318
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,933
I do everything.

319
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,352
I'm an art director.

320
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,230
You must show me your work.

321
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,816
I don't know.

322
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,654
I can feel the tension
of your need for my opinion.

323
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,618
I wouldn't mind you taking a look

324
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,870
if you promise to be honest.

325
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,540
Let's see how brave you are.

326
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,090
Hello? Mother? Marie-France?

327
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,142
- Bellman.
- Please come in.

328
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,729
Please, just put the bags here.

329
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,404
Thank you.

330
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,533
For you to enjoy and for him to pay for.

331
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,993
I'm not changing rooms.

332
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,536
Well, she's made plans for us.

333
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,917
Absolutely not. This isn't a vacation.

334
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,302
We'll have a contest.

335
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,013
We'll see if we can get drunker than Mama.

336
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,940
Evening, Doctor.

337
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,525
Can you hold that?

338
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,199
- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Arnold.

339
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,122
Good evening.

340
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,625
This is Diana. Arnold and Sylvia.

341
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,793
Hello.

342
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,005
Brought the whole restaurant home, did you?

343
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,927
You're not on call, are you?

344
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,263
Mitchell's CO got married.

345
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,642
The girl, very young, but very homely.

346
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,813
Good night.

347
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,191
Don, we should play squash sometime.

348
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,276
You know, if you have the energy.

349
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,195
- Arnold!
- Sounds like fun.

350
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,536
How many girls have you had in this elevator?

351
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,539
That's not what that was.

352
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
Hello?

353
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,339
I said hello. You didn't even grunt.

354
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,803
Are you in a creative mood or a bad mood?

355
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,764
I don't know what I'm doing.

356
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,225
Everything good I have
is from a long time ago.

357
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,895
So what? You think Picasso looks
at Guernica and says,

358
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,856
"Ignore that. It was a long time ago?"

359
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,861
I got nothing to show her.

360
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,487
Who cares about her?

361
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,907
You should see what she does.

362
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,536
It's so sensual.

363
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
Get your camera.

364
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,458
Why?

365
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,877
I want you to take my picture.

366
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,795
No, you don't.

367
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,172
No touching the model.

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,631
In here?

369
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,049
Well, I'm not going outside.

370
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,572
You must sit out there all the time.

371
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,783
I wanna see where you live.

372
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,752
How could I be nervous at this point?

373
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,921
I know.

374
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,715
There's a twinge in my chest.

375
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,595
A pain?

376
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,766
No, it's not that. I'm positive.

377
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,562
Are you hungry?

378
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,273
Not really.

379
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,754
Hello?

380
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,344
Of course.

381
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,138
Yes.

382
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,848
Thank you, Meredith.

383
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,354
Everything okay?

384
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,773
Yeah.

385
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,860
We have to get out of here.

386
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,407
She's coming to take her things
and I don't want to be here.

387
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,994
- Okay.
- No, look.

388
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,412
What?

389
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,750
I think if I were you,

390
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,252
this would bother me,

391
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,962
and it shouldn't

392
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,672
because it's almost over.

393
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,134
Good.

394
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,685
I want to see you tonight.

395
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,691
At my place, okay?

396
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,652
Let's go.

397
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,036
Shit.

398
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,537
We'll swing by your place on the way.

399
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,622
I'll rent.

400
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,998
You're going to rent pants?

401
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,542
I'll throw my tie over my shoulder,
and roll up my sleeves.

402
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,960
They'll love it.

403
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,670
Probably will.

404
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,693
What's the difference now?

405
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,372
Stop it this minute.

406
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,499
I have to go change for lunch.

407
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,088
It's $200 including the tip.

408
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,679
He gave me a check for $500.

409
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,805
Like a whore?

410
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,569
In the States, it's the 20th century.

411
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,446
People get divorced all the time.

412
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,866
Exactly. You can still get an annulment.

413
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,535
I'm not like you.

414
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,954
I don't spend my whole life feeling ashamed.

415
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,457
Marie-France, don't be a bitch.

416
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,876
I am not a servant here to wait on her

417
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,837
while she goes for lunch.

418
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,922
I know you don't understand this,

419
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,424
but it's for my career.

420
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,552
Good luck with your bright future.

421
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,596
Wait.

422
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,644
No.

423
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,742
It's not much. It's just the boxes,

424
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,953
Granny's cabinet, that chair, and the mirror.

425
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,290
Go. Have fun. I'll take care of this.

426
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,677
Hey, where's everybody going?

427
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,513
My mother's here. Thank you so much.

428
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,608
Do you have to smoke in here?

429
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,860
It's taking my mind off your driving.

430
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,988
I don't know why we couldn't
swing by your apartment?

431
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,365
What will the clients think?
That you're renting clubs?

432
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,326
I'll buy a set in the shop.

433
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,371
Megan's moving her things today.

434
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,667
I didn't know that was still going on.

435
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,756
They want to punish you.

436
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
And then you get mad
and you want to punish them,

437
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,927
but you know it's your fault.

438
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,764
I've been through it before.

439
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,016
How did you handle client dinners?

440
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,392
I got a date.

441
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,813
I don't have a steady,
so it's too unpredictable.

442
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,773
You don't know how much
they're going to drink

443
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,025
and suddenly you're with a floozy.

444
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,151
Golf is better.

445
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,653
Jiminy Christmas.

446
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,864
You think you're going to begin your life
over and do it right,

447
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,159
but what if you never
get past the beginning again?

448
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,786
Watch the road.

449
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,792
You filled the whole truck,
that wasn't what we agreed.

450
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,794
I told you it was gonna be more.

451
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,170
More than double?

452
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,924
- Fine, how much you got?
- I have $350.

453
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,218
That's enough for me
to leave it on the sidewalk.

454
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,012
That's extortion!

455
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,099
Lady, you are a pain in my ass.

456
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,604
Donald Draper's office.

457
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,024
I need to speak with him
immediately. It's Marie Calvet.

458
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,944
Well, I'm sorry, he's not available right now.

459
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,445
Interrupt him.

460
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,991
I can take a message.
May I say what this is regarding?

461
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,827
No.

462
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,039
There's a Marie
something on the line.

463
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,500
Marie who?

464
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,420
I got it. Get off the line.

465
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,214
Bonjour.

466
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,049
I am in desperate need of you.

467
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,468
Well, hello to you, too.

468
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,306
I need you to come to Don's
apartment with $200

469
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,224
and not a penny more!

470
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,059
Calm down. I'll send someone.

471
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,227
What did I expect?

472
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,855
Every time you get
what you want, you run away.

473
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,648
Don't say that.

474
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,400
Bring cash!

475
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,116
It's fine.

476
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,410
Look where you are.

477
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,542
Don't. I'm not ready.

478
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,336
Your subject certainly is.

479
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,838
That's Elaine. She's...

480
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,798
Overdeveloped?

481
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,763
She's not worthy of you.

482
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,224
You can see it in her eyes.

483
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,393
She doesn't want to tell you the truth.

484
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,651
Drawing is a much more rare talent.

485
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,285
I expected more.

486
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,180
- Holy shit.
- What?

487
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,307
- Where is everything?
- On the truck.

488
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,392
Pay him.

489
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,687
One hundred and eighty bucks.

490
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,398
My pleasure.

491
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,779
Don agreed to this?

492
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,323
He was very generous.

493
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,410
And you are a true gentleman.

494
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,205
Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink.

495
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,208
I hate what he did to my daughter.

496
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,460
Mon Dieu, I'm trembling.

497
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,506
You really are. It's okay.

498
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,760
What are you doing?

499
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,980
You already emptied the place.
You wanna defile it as well?

500
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,440
Please.

501
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,400
Take advantage of me.

502
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,954
- You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

503
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,833
I'm really sorry I'm late. You know that office.

504
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,210
- Should we get some wine?
- I already did.

505
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,797
I am certainly picking up the check.

506
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,591
I insist.

507
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,635
It's just, you had such good
advice for Miranda and Jill.

508
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,098
Well, they didn't have agents at all.
My advice was get one.

509
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,184
Well, whatever you did.

510
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,561
To whatever I did.

511
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,941
So, give me the lay.

512
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,777
You know, of the land.

513
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,737
There's not much to tell.

514
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,615
I haven't booked anything
in the last few months.

515
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,492
Not even pilot season?

516
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,369
Well, I turned down some
smaller parts because

517
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,164
Alan thought they'd take me
out of the running for leads.

518
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,457
I'm not in his business,

519
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,919
but I find it hard to believe
that you're losing any contest.

520
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,379
I bet he doesn't know how to get you in one.

521
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,381
I read all the time, Harry.

522
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,758
Do you read for lead parts?

523
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,760
That's just getting your name on the right list

524
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,053
with the right casting director.

525
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,139
Good agents with real track
records can make that happen.

526
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,518
Alan represents Angie Dickinson.

527
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,728
You are every man's fantasy.

528
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,273
You're like Ali MacGraw
and Brigitte Bardot had a baby.

529
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,943
You should be the most
famous person in the world right now.

530
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,486
Oh, my goodness!

531
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,115
You should be in this business.

532
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,535
I can't believe Don threw you away.

533
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,790
He's not a loyal person, but I am.

534
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,920
You don't think he could have helped you?

535
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,673
I'm willing to put my money
where my mouth is.

536
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,759
It would be much appreciated.

537
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,471
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not hungry.

538
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,890
I'd rather get to work on this immediately.

539
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,561
Well, we can work and eat. I have a pen.

540
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,938
Well, I have a room upstairs.

541
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,192
It has a phone. I could make some calls.

542
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,405
Harry.

543
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,783
I'm not interested.

544
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,080
Megan, you're a big girl.

545
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,748
Maybe you're in this situation

546
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,126
because of how you're reacting to this.

547
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,921
Hold on. Forget all that.

548
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,800
Come on. Have another glass of wine.

549
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,267
Caroline, I was busy, okay?

550
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,437
Now, how about at least giving me a pat
on the back for remembering I had a meeting?

551
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,521
Hello?

552
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,610
What are you doing here, Megan?

553
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,445
Where the fuck is everything?

554
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,571
Roger...

555
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,161
He came to help me.

556
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,955
I should go.

557
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,000
Why are you here?
I told you to go to the hotel.

558
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,087
I felt guilty that I left
you here, but obviously...

559
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,679
I'm late for a meeting.

560
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,891
I guess you don't care
that she's married to my father.

561
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,893
It wasn't my idea.

562
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,980
You don't get to stand in judgment of me.

563
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,038
Could you give us a second, honey?

564
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,300
No, thank you. Have you spoken with Megan?

565
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,844
I just walked in.

566
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,429
Well, I think I should warn you.

567
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,181
We had lunch and, uh,

568
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,058
she's not stable, Don.

569
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,353
She said a lot of crazy things
and I'm sure will continue to say them.

570
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,147
And what will she say about you?

571
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,651
Crazy things. You know, all I can say is
she really wants a job.

572
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,278
What does that mean?

573
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,739
Don, come on, nothing happened.
You know she hates me.

574
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,994
You know what? It's none of my business.

575
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,371
Well, I don't think I could have
helped her anyway.

576
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,457
She quit her soap and left New York.
It was a really dumb idea.

577
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,547
Pima?

578
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,467
Could you come in? I have the selects.

579
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,930
Could you get the door?

580
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,564
I put the ones that I like best
on the top row here.

581
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,321
I like this one,

582
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,572
but Stan doesn't.

583
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,283
Stan already showed these to you?

584
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,535
He was eager to share,

585
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,329
but he knows nothing about women.

586
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,247
What does that mean?

587
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
It was just his opinion.

588
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,339
Well, mine's the only opinion that
matters here. It's my account.

589
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,924
Of course, you're in charge. I know that.

590
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,720
Which one do you like?

591
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,391
I think number three. Top row.

592
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,940
You've never been married.

593
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,401
Nope.

594
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,112
Me either.

595
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,699
The adventures I would have missed.

596
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,285
Number four.

597
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,665
I would love to take your picture.

598
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,918
I...

599
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,796
I don't know about that.

600
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,466
The way you're looking at me right now...

601
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,515
I would capture that.

602
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,578
How are you?

603
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,126
Where is he? He was right behind me.

604
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,674
I don't want anything of yours.

605
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,518
I wasn't going to say a word.

606
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,937
I wasn't gonna give you the satisfaction

607
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,022
of knowing that you ruined my life.

608
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Megan.

609
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,902
Why did I believe you?

610
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,198
Why did I believe the things you said to me?

611
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,035
Why am I being punished for being young?

612
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,249
I gave up everything for you
because I believed you...

613
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,834
And you're nothing but a liar.

614
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:21,799
An aging, sloppy, selfish liar.

615
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,564
You're right.

616
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,150
You're gonna write me a check?

617
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
I want you to have

618
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,323
the life you deserve.

619
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,916
Are you kidding me?

620
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,043
No.

621
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,503
A million dollars?

622
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,589
Why are you doing this to me? It's not funny.

623
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,091
I don't want to fight anymore.

624
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,552
Well, I know it's not real.

625
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,471
Nothing about you is.

626
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,847
It is real.

627
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,849
Please take it.

628
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,085
Megan, I'm sorry.

629
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,171
Send me the papers.

630
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,887
I want you to be honest.

631
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,681
Should I let my hair grow out?

632
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,559
Good night, everybody. Ed, you were right.

633
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,977
Pima's a treasure.

634
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,728
Is she?

635
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,146
You don't like the work?

636
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,984
Because I was thinking, you know,
she'd be right for Butler shoes.

637
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,069
Or maybe Topaz pantyhose.

638
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,529
She's got a thing for legs.

639
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,030
Women's legs.

640
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,324
Sorry to disappoint you.

641
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,577
I'm not disappointed.

642
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,413
Neither was she.

643
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,501
Really?

644
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,420
Does that bother you?

645
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,340
No,

646
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,050
But I bet it might bother Ellen.

647
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,427
Elaine.

648
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,178
This is none of your business.

649
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,097
No.

650
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,558
It's Pima's business,

651
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,811
which turns out to be more
advertising than art.

652
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,856
She's a hustler.

653
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,108
You're jealous.

654
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,444
She tried the same thing with me,

655
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,446
but she didn't get as far.

656
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,449
And that's why I'm not going
to give her another job.

657
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,702
I don't believe you.

658
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,121
Which part?

659
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,607
Not particularly.

660
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,367
So you ordered room service?

661
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,500
I don't care.

662
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,585
She's leaving Papa.

663
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,464
I'm going to pack.

664
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,348
I don't want to hear about it.

665
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,399
You know it's a sin to be a ghoul

666
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,942
and feed on everyone's pain?

667
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,697
She's been very unhappy for a very long time.

668
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,200
At least she did something about it.

669
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,419
I'm exhausted.

670
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,379
Me, too.

671
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,465
Did you print anything?

672
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,342
They're drying.

673
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,386
You did?

674
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,097
How were they? What did Pima say?

675
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,352
She loved them.

676
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,020
How about you?

677
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,342
Do you want a drink? I just have vodka.

678
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,886
Yes, please.

679
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,140
I got you something.

680
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,433
Open it.

681
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,108
It's a New York City guidebook.
Finally start your tour.

682
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,028
Go on.

683
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,241
Can't you see I don't want anything?

684
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,748
Look, I'm pretty sure
I had a worse day than you.

685
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,124
Please don't be in a mood.

686
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,834
I'm not in a mood.

687
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,004
And you've never had a worse day than me.

688
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,715
You don't think I've felt grief?

689
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,134
You knew that about me
the first night we met.

690
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,890
I've been trying to talk myself out of it.

691
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,809
Don't.

692
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,976
No.

693
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,729
Talk myself out of what I have to say.

694
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,398
You're scared. I understand.

695
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,402
But I took care of everything today.

696
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,573
I've been separated a long time.

697
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,661
You're not

698
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,579
the first thing to come along.

699
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,374
I'm ready.

700
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,379
You're fooling yourself if you think
this'll make a difference.

701
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,339
You don't think I know what's going on here?

702
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,424
Look at this dump.

703
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,844
I know you think you deserve this.

704
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,095
I've done it.

705
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,766
I left my daughter.

706
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,185
Stop blaming yourself.

707
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,937
No.

708
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,109
I had two children. Two girls.

709
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,363
One died and one...

710
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,912
My oldest is in Racine with her father.

711
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,543
Why? Don't you want to ask why?

712
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,422
No.

713
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,515
I told you about my heart.

714
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,811
I don't want to feel anything else.

715
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,232
When I was with you, I forgot about

716
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,821
her.

717
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,700
I don't ever want to do that.
