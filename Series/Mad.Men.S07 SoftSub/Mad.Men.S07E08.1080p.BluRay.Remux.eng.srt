1
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,973
I've never worn mink before.

2
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,560
It's chinchilla,
and it costs $15,000.

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,687
How does that make you feel?

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
Nervous.

5
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,399
You're not supposed to talk.

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,778
Just show me how you feel.

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,493
Walk over to the mirror.

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,998
Look at yourself.

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,126
You like what you see.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,922
Don't open the whole coat.

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,009
Just try and make it look like

12
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,137
you're just wearing the fur.

13
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,401
Very good.

14
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,697
Now, I want you
to close your eyes

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,866
and take a deep breath.

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,660
And when I tell you,

17
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,371
you're gonna put your leg
up on that chair,

18
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,207
let the coat slide down,

19
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,670
and show me
how smooth your skin is.

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,855
Very good, Cindy.

21
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,900
Thank you very much, Cindy.
We'll let you know.

22
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,162
So, what happened?

23
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,123
Well, no woman,
even living in that shithole,

24
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,292
wants a toaster
for her birthday.

25
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
- Can you freshen this?
- Yeah.

26
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,339
And Abigail wasn't shy.

27
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,549
- That's your mother?
- Stepmother.

28
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,636
So she put the toaster
in the middle of the table,

29
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,097
and all the boarders come down
for breakfast and see it.

30
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,557
They weren't
particularly impressed.

31
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,102
Every day, one of them
would trip over that wire

32
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,520
and yank it off the table.

33
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,314
Don't go back there.
A lot of roaches.

34
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,941
Are you surprised?

35
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,943
Only by the size. There was one
making a phone call.

36
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,862
Get up, I want my seat back.

37
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:03,910
Now, toasters were
indestructible back then,

38
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,578
except for the cord,

39
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,790
which suffered from being yanked
out of the wall every morning.

40
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,042
My Uncle Mack was cheap
and thought he could fix things.

41
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,337
So he wrapped a piece
of copper wire around it.

42
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,758
Sure enough, he plugged it in
and it blew him into the parlor.

43
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,301
He was unconscious.

44
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,264
All the boarders got up,
ran to his aid,

45
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,849
but Abigail didn't move.

46
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,309
She just looked down at him
and said

47
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,561
"Happy birthday."

48
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,313
Then put the kettle on.

49
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,400
He loves to tell stories
about how poor he was,

50
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,734
but he's not anymore.

51
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,528
Is that your way of saying
you want me to get the check?

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,282
Hey, Mildred Pierce,
can I get the check?

53
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,617
- Come on.
- Be polite.

54
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,414
- Can I get you something else?
- No, just the check.

55
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,374
You have anything
by John Dos Passos?

56
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,087
Sorry about my friend. He's...

57
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,338
Witty.

58
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,340
Do I know you?

59
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,384
I don't think so.

60
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,890
She's a little old for NYU.

61
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,186
$11 .60. You must have had a lot
of hash browns, sweetheart.

62
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,812
Probably only eats once a week.

63
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,314
Let's split it five ways.

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,942
No, I think I owe someone
an apology.

65
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,235
That ought to do it.

66
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,530
That's $100.

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,326
I suppose I'm gonna have to
drop one of you off.

68
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,869
You decide who.

69
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,218
Don, let's go.

70
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,385
Yeah.

71
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,318
Good evening, Mr. Draper.

72
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,029
- Who am I speaking with?
- It's Joanne.

73
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,197
You have four messages.

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,782
At 7:30, Laura called and said

75
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,700
she has a photo shoot
in the morning,

76
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,160
so don't call after 11:00.

77
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,245
What time is it?

78
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,040
10 past, but she called again at
8:00 and said midnight was fine.

79
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,461
- What else?
- 9:30, Maxine called.

80
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,672
She met you two weeks ago
at Cosmopolitan

81
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,216
and remains intrigued
by your proposition.

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,469
And last, at 10:00,
Tricia from TWA.

83
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,720
She's on a layover.

84
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,100
- And what are you doing tonight, Joanne?
- You're very funny, Mr. Draper.

85
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,186
Give me Tricia's number.

86
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,191
So glad you could make it.

87
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,902
O'Hare's a mess.
They canceled everything,

88
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,821
so it seemed to be fate.

89
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,657
You look ravishing.

90
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,285
I feel a little underdressed.

91
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,662
Where were you tonight?

92
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,338
No, it's true.

93
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
On every single flight,

94
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,594
there's always one blanket
completely soaked in urine.

95
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,887
- In first class?
- Yes.

96
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,851
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,855
It's your fault. You scared me.

98
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,231
Do you have a towel?

99
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,654
Don't do that.

100
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,711
Another woman
you're sleeping with?

101
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,215
No, that's the woman I'm not
sleeping with. My ex-wife.

102
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,931
Hanes calls them L'eggs.

103
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,560
They're crap.

104
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,146
They're definitely not
as high-quality as Topaz.

105
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,856
They're in four test markets

106
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,901
and they're outspending you
6-to-1.

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,653
And outselling you 20-to-1.

108
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,489
It's more than the packaging.
It's the placement.

109
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,157
They're not just selling them
in drugstores.

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,326
They're focusing
on supermarkets.

111
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,952
And they're only $1 .39 a pair.

112
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,872
So we need to lower our price
and buy more ad time?

113
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,832
This is only a novelty,
and the inferior quality

114
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,376
will catch up with them,

115
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,795
but we're recommending a change
right now

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,380
while it sorts itself out.

117
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,590
Look, I know you think
I'm cheap.

118
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,717
And I know you think
Topaz are cheap,

119
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,178
although apparently
not cheap enough,

120
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,349
but I just wanna spend money
where it'll make a difference.

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,019
They got an egg.
Why don't we have a topaz?

122
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,105
Big plastic jewel. Green.

123
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,523
Maybe it's see-through.

124
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,358
And Mr. Potato Head here
can relax

125
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,194
'cause he'll still make his
quota when we launch it.

126
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,864
I'd never recommend imitation
as a strategy.

127
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,575
You'll be second,
which is very far from first.

128
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,035
Whose fault is that?

129
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,996
I told you about the development
of this product

130
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,915
and you didn't seem worried
at all.

131
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,796
Art, Marvin,
are you ready for lunch?

132
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,342
Yes, I am, Kenneth. We had
a problem, but we solved it.

133
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,223
Well, that's great to hear.

134
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,853
What do we do?

135
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,938
We keep the client.

136
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,817
How was the party?

137
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
David Bailey
wants to take your picture.

138
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,697
Well, I have plans tonight.

139
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,117
So I'll be leaving at 5:00 on the dot
and I don't wanna hear about it.

140
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,035
Wake me in...

141
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,662
You have casting in an hour.

142
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,914
Great.

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
You have lunch plans?

144
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,385
Just coffee,
if the wait's not too long.

145
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,934
No, I just thought,
I'm going to the coffee shop,

146
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,978
so I could
pick you up something.

147
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,813
Mathis, you're pouring coffee.

148
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,024
I wanted to ask you
about something.

149
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,401
You want a raise?
Stop acting like a secretary.

150
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,904
This has nothing to do
with work.

151
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,572
My brother-in-law is in town

152
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,909
and I thought you could join
Julie and I for dinner.

153
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,746
He's very handsome.
The whole family is.

154
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,498
You're setting me up?

155
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,874
He has a car.

156
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,753
It's very sweet, but I really
have to question your judgment.

157
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,880
You know, you're a catch.

158
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,132
Thank you,
but how could you think

159
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,884
this has nothing
to do with work?

160
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
I told my wife that,

161
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,555
and she said it won't matter
'cause she has a knack for this.

162
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,101
What happens if I take you up on
this offer and it goes badly,

163
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,814
or he's homely or anything
happens, good or bad?

164
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,440
Did you think about that?

165
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,194
No, I didn't anticipate
any of this, I'll be honest with you.

166
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,739
I appreciate it, but no,
thank you.

167
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,116
Tell Julie
she's very thoughtful.

168
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,417
Are you auditioning?

169
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,003
I tried to arrange a meeting,

170
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,006
but Meredith explained
how much work you have to do.

171
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,138
We met with Topaz and had
the unpleasant conversation.

172
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,309
And their solution was a
knockoff topaz container, green.

173
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,354
What was our solution?

174
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,982
We don't have one.

175
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,819
The irony is, they're being pushed
out of the bottom of the market.

176
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,612
What's the top,
department stores?

177
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
Yeah, but they're a drugstore
brand. That's what Topaz is.

178
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,161
So they're not
called Topaz anymore.

179
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,415
Tell them their idea
for new packaging was good,

180
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,709
but the new packaging
should say, "Macy's."

181
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
That's gonna be tough

182
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,629
with the stores are being
blown up by radicals every day.

183
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
You know these two.

184
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,465
People haven't stopped shopping.

185
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,760
So all I have to do is sign
Macy's. Piece of cake.

186
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,348
Doesn't McCann represent
Marshall Field's?

187
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,143
Remind them
it's a two-way street.

188
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,066
Phil was in plastics,
he's going to metals,

189
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,192
and Greg was in metals,

190
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,236
he's going to marketing
and advertising,

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,321
which is my old job.

192
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,992
That means Tom Schaeffer is head
of plastics at Dow Chemical.

193
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,827
Good for him.

194
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,537
Good for you.

195
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,581
Now's a good time.

196
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,500
He's still not up.

197
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,086
Never wake a sleeping baby.

198
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,755
I want to see him.

199
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,092
What's that?

200
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,678
We don't want you
to think of this as retirement,

201
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,514
think of it as the beginning
of your professional career.

202
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,850
I don't know what to say.

203
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,562
You say "Jack Nicklaus, out of my way.
I've got better clubs."

204
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,689
I'm very touched.

205
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,152
Ever since your mother passed away,
I haven't really enjoyed anything.

206
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,030
Honestly, Ed.

207
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,531
He thinks he's a comedian.

208
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,119
I'm just glad there's something that will
get him out of the house besides that boat.

209
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,704
Who says I'll be in the house?

210
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,873
I've got a lot of time
to make up for.

211
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,209
Daddy, I'm so glad.

212
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,962
Most men my age have had
a couple of heart attacks.

213
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,215
I'm still young enough to enjoy
things. New things, even.

214
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,342
I've started cooking.

215
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,345
Actually made myself a...
What is it, honey?

216
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,180
A Pop-Tart, Ed.

217
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
It was very good.

218
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,355
Next.

219
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,399
This is another girl.

220
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,744
Rachel?

221
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,765
I'm supposed to tell you,
you missed your flight.

222
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,851
Thank you.

223
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,107
Rachel.

224
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,776
Yes?

225
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,448
You're not just smooth,
you're Wilkinson smooth.

226
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,829
Back to work.

227
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,465
Is it morning?

228
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,055
No. Go back to sleep.

229
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,606
That's why I like surveying.
You see, I'm the outdoor type.

230
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,110
Sorry, did I wake you?

231
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,654
It's okay.
Did Eddie wake up again?

232
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,913
My dad is so old.

233
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,126
Don't worry about him.
He is going to have a ball.

234
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,004
Why did he wait so long
to do that?

235
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,298
Honey, he loved his job.

236
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,300
But you don't.

237
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,260
You're bored and angry

238
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,138
because you know it's not
what you wanna do.

239
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,224
I should
never tell you anything.

240
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,851
And I haven't gotten any writing done
in a long time.

241
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,895
So start now.

242
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,897
You've done very well

243
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,900
and let's stop pretending
like I wasn't born with plenty.

244
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,613
You could quit your job.
We could buy that farm.

245
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,198
You could write your book.

246
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,325
What book?

247
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,370
Something sad and sweet.

248
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,165
For people who don't have the
guts to live their dream.

249
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,750
Why don't you write a book?

250
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,461
You gave them your eye.

251
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,547
Don't give them
the rest of your life.

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,424
Your father was a cog
in a giant machine

253
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,051
that makes weapons and poison.

254
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,761
And you sell them.

255
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,931
I'm proud of the company!

256
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,643
And if nothing else, I'd like to
wait and see if I get a raise.

257
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,729
There's always another hurdle.

258
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,898
You're not listening to me
at all!

259
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,697
You're late.

260
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
It's five after.

261
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,367
Casting always starts on time.

262
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,369
Can't you smell
the cheap perfume?

263
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,666
Can you call Rachel Katz
at Menken's Department Store?

264
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,169
No. You know what, set a meeting.
The number's in the Rolodex.

265
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,879
It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.

266
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,297
Of course.

267
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,220
You're not the landing party
we expected.

268
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,348
What can we do for you?

269
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,643
As I was telling David here
on the phone,

270
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,854
L'eggs Pantyhose
is an unstoppable foe

271
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,981
in the affordable pantyhose
marketplace.

272
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,358
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,

273
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,945
has the high quality
to wear a department store name.

274
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,618
It is a growing
and lucrative product.

275
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,204
In three months,
L'eggs has sold a year's worth.

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,999
They're worried that L'eggs are
gonna spread all over the world?

277
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,709
That wouldn't bother me at all.

278
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,423
We were hoping McCann Erickson
could provide, at the minimum,

279
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,509
an introduction
to your department store clients

280
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,179
so we can assess their desire
for a store brand.

281
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,306
I know they'd be happy
to meet you.

282
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,975
Especially Dan Higgins.
He loves redheads.

283
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,022
Would you tell him what's so
special about your panties?

284
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,275
The benefits are listed there,

285
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,278
but basically
they're more sheer, softer,

286
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,823
and more like silk to the touch,
yet still very strong.

287
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,159
So you can pull them down
over and over?

288
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,578
You can wear them quite a few times

289
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,497
before they run or lose shape.

290
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,668
- Do you wear them, Joan?
- I do.

291
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,338
If you talk to Dan,
I'd start with that.

292
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,219
I think anyone would be
equally interested

293
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,595
in the price-per-unit,

294
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,848
which could be reduced a lot
if the demand were higher.

295
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,017
Why aren't you
in the brassiere business?

296
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,852
Excuse me?

297
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,772
You should be
in the bra business.

298
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,148
You're a work of art.

299
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,279
What she's saying is that
wider distribution

300
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,489
would mean bigger ad budgets
for us.

301
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,576
I'd set a lunch, but I think
a dinner would be better.

302
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,287
And warm him up first.

303
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,914
Send a basket of pears
to Marshall Field's.

304
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,041
The one thing Dan likes
is a nice pear.

305
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,714
This guy.
What are their billings?

306
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,174
If you take a look
at the sheet there again.

307
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,219
Yeah. Give us a minute.
Let's read this thing.

308
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,606
Where were you?

309
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,943
Shirley, you're not going to believe this,
but I walked to work today.

310
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,237
Mr. Sterling
and Mr. Donnelly are here.

311
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,239
They just walked in.

312
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,954
You wanted to see me?

313
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,998
You know Ferguson Donnelly
from McCann.

314
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,626
- Of course. Ferg, good to see you.
- Been a while.

315
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,799
Is this about the Topaz
department store route?

316
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,217
I think it's a great idea.

317
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,511
I don't know
what you're talking about.

318
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,180
Did you send Ed Baxter
a $200 set

319
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,223
of MacGregor golf clubs
from the firm?

320
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,518
Actually, I hand-delivered it.
It was a retirement gift.

321
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,773
I've got some bad news for you.
Pete's gonna take over Dow.

322
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,649
Because of the clubs?

323
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,361
No, because McCann doesn't
want you on the business.

324
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,405
Just 'cause Ed's retiring
doesn't mean

325
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,491
I can't get along
with his replacement.

326
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,992
I know Greg from metals.

327
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,703
I don't care if you know a girl
from Kalamazoo.

328
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,954
We don't want you
on the business

329
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,123
because we don't want you
on any business.

330
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,711
Look, Ferg, you're not still mad
at me for leaving?

331
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,962
That was six years ago.

332
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,547
And you never hired me anyway.

333
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,882
When you bought
Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

334
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,425
I came with the furniture.

335
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,553
People come in and out of our
doors all the time, Ken,

336
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,473
but they don't walk out with $4 million
of Birds Eye products.

337
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,308
Of course they do.

338
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,643
Fine.

339
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,187
They don't walk around
the office like their shit doesn't stink

340
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,731
and then go out
and tell the world we're, what,

341
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,650
a bunch of black Irish thugs?

342
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,487
You're gonna fire me
because I hurt Ferg's feelings?

343
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,280
It's what he is. Look at him.

344
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,157
How about a little dignity?

345
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,409
You're firing me!

346
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,036
Yes, but you'll get a generous
severance package

347
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,498
if you help Pete secure all
of your accounts, including Dow.

348
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,667
Roger said
he'd be glad to recommend you.

349
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,212
Thank you, Roger.
I appreciate your loyalty.

350
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,439
- Should we get lunch?
- I want to burn this place down.

351
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,067
I know. They were awful.

352
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,027
But at least we got a yes.

353
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,072
Would you have rather
had a friendly no?

354
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,700
I don't expect you
to understand.

355
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,204
Joan, you've never experienced
that before?

356
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,581
Have you, Peggy?

357
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,876
I don't know.
You can't have it both ways.

358
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
You can't dress
the way you do...

359
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,129
How do I dress?

360
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,257
Look, they didn't take me
seriously, either.

361
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,634
So what you're saying is

362
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,181
I don't dress the way you do
because I don't look like you.

363
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,059
And that's very, very true.

364
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,814
You know what?
You're filthy rich.

365
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,233
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

366
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,493
How was the cattle call?

367
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,495
We have to have another session.

368
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,413
You're shameless, you know that?

369
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,707
Do I have a lunch today?

370
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,084
No, but you have
a busy afternoon.

371
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,587
I scheduled
a meeting next Monday

372
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,173
with Mr. Rosenthal
at Menken's Department Store.

373
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,884
Mrs. Katz didn't want to meet?

374
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,804
Well, it was
a very awkward conversation

375
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,016
because apparently she stepped
down a few months ago

376
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,227
and passed away last week.

377
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,063
What?

378
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,857
Rachel Katz?

379
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,567
Yes.

380
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,278
I'm sorry to tell you that.

381
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,739
Last week?

382
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,916
I had no intention
of upsetting you.

383
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,459
How old was she?

384
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't know. Younger than me.

385
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,842
From the name,
I just pictured some old lady.

386
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,262
I had no idea.

387
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,435
If you'd like, they've asked
that in lieu of flowers,

388
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,979
you can send a donation to

389
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,565
the National Jewish Hospital
at Denver.

390
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,732
Do you want to do that?

391
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,572
No. Yes, sure.

392
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,785
I'm going to run down
and get you a sandwich.

393
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,297
- I'm leaving. Need anything?
- No.

394
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,342
Mathis.

395
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,678
Yes?

396
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,765
Well, if it helps you get back
into your wife's good graces,

397
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,434
I had a cancellation

398
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,604
and I'd love to join you
for dinner tomorrow night.

399
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,064
Shoot, we already made
other plans.

400
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,569
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

401
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,447
Stevie doesn't need to
come with us.

402
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,698
I'll sell his ticket.

403
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,243
- Stevie? How old is he?
- I don't know, 30?

404
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,914
- I don't know.
- Can I go?

405
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,293
Give him my number.
Tell him to call me.

406
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,211
Okay.

407
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,935
You want a menu?

408
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,730
Just coffee. And could you
get her attention for me?

409
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,814
Di!

410
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,068
Just coffee for him.

411
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,284
Evening.

412
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,663
Can I help you?

413
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,374
You look so familiar to me.

414
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,085
Do I know you from somewhere?

415
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,462
Yes, from here. The other night.

416
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,588
No.

417
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,799
I think I know you.

418
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,677
You don't need a line.

419
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,597
I know why you're here, and
it's not for a cup of coffee.

420
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,894
Vi, I'm taking my break.

421
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,424
My name is Don.

422
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,488
Excuse me, miss.

423
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,033
When are you done here?

424
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,453
You got your $100's worth.
You can go.

425
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,380
- Have fun last night?
- Yes, I did.

426
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,926
He's very handsome.

427
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,053
Don. Don?

428
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,395
- Are you okay?
- I'm done.

429
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,151
McCann told Roger to do it,
and, boy, did Roger do it.

430
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,112
They want me to give
all my accounts to Pete.

431
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm calling Jim Hobart right now.
You're the head of accounts.

432
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
Do you want to hear
something spooky?

433
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,082
Don't do anything rash, Ken.
It's just a job.

434
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,294
No, my father-in-law retires
and my wife says,

435
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,755
"I want you to quit.
You're wasting your life.

436
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,091
"You should write that novel."

437
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,802
And you know what?
I think I was gonna do it.

438
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,097
And the very next day,
they fire me.

439
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,599
Can you believe that?

440
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,810
No.

441
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,771
That's not a coincidence.
That's a sign.

442
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,525
- Of what?
- The life not lived.

443
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,989
So that's good?

444
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,950
Yeah. It's great.

445
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,203
Now I just have to figure out

446
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,455
how to drag myself
through those doors.

447
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,801
Joan, you have a call
from Dennis.

448
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,887
Dennis who?

449
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,222
I'm not sure.
His girl just said Dennis.

450
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,765
He's at McCann Erickson.

451
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
It's Dennis Ford.

452
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,147
Should I put him through?

453
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,027
No. Tell him I'm in a meeting.

454
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,167
So, Clara just left?

455
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,336
She was as big as a house.

456
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,338
Is Torkelson going to marry her?

457
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,090
He's probably just looking
the other way.

458
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,384
People do that around here
all the time.

459
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,888
I swear I found out after
you did. It came from McCann.

460
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,307
So did your millions of dollars.

461
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,685
You know, I didn't really get
millions of dollars.

462
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,021
I mean, eventually,

463
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,148
but stepped out
in smaller increments

464
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,108
to stay under that
top tax threshold.

465
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,819
I'll have to buy an apartment
building to keep any of it,

466
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,364
and then I've got to be
a landlord.

467
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,366
Sounds like a real
pain in the ass.

468
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,993
Look, I was caught by surprise,

469
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,829
but I didn't know your history
with McCann.

470
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,289
What did you do over there?

471
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,045
I never fit in. I'm not Irish.
I'm not Catholic. I can read.

472
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,424
It's good you're playing ball,
or you'd have no future.

473
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,343
In advertising, maybe.

474
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,928
You have other plans?

475
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,473
I may have
let it go for a while,

476
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,185
but damned if I don't have
something to write about now.

477
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
No, this world is boring.

478
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,564
You should write
an adventure story.

479
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,818
Do you know how great
you'll look on a book jacket?

480
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,445
I've thought about it.

481
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,782
I'm a hell of lot better at it
than I ever was at this.

482
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,577
Good for you. I'm envious.

483
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,165
I thought I was changing my life
when I went out to California.

484
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,751
Of course, now it sort of feels
like a dream,

485
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
but at the time,
it felt so real.

486
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,048
Well, that's you, I guess.

487
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,968
I know. Look, here I am.

488
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,388
And you know what?
If you get tired of the writing,

489
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,806
you can always use my name.

490
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,933
I've only good things
to say about you.

491
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,228
I appreciate that.

492
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,981
Jesus, Fillmore Auto Parts?

493
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,693
You trying to give me stuff
we don't even have anymore?

494
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,715
This is the same
as the navy one.

495
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:28,386
Don't tell Oscar de la Renta,
because the navy one is $159.

496
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,055
I can wear boots with that.

497
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,348
You know what?

498
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,477
I'll take the boots
and the tan heels,

499
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,606
the chiffon, the red
and this one.

500
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,401
Didn't you used to work here?

501
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,112
You can probably
still get the discount.

502
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,989
That's tempting,

503
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,493
but I think you have me confused
with someone else.

504
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,328
Could you?

505
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,670
Ted wants to see you.

506
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,258
Send him in.

507
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,553
Got off the phone
with Wilkinson.

508
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,472
They narrowed it down
to three girls.

509
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,432
They want me
to send over the binder,

510
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,476
but there's
120 Polaroids in here.

511
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,894
It'll make things worse.

512
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,813
They're perverts.
They love casting.

513
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,065
They can't decide? Use them all.

514
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,319
There are three women
in every man's life.

515
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,199
You did not just think that up.

516
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,452
I've had it for years,
but I think it works here.

517
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:37,122
You'd rather find new creative
than pick a girl?

518
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,291
Speaking of which, Vogue is throwing
a party in the Village tonight.

519
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,460
Cocktails at my apartment,
it's right around the corner.

520
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
Apparently,
hemlines are going up.

521
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,174
- What time?
- I'm leaving now.

522
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,884
Okay.

523
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,810
So, you're from Atlanta?

524
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,728
No, I just went to school there.

525
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,731
Emory, it's the only game
in town. How about you?

526
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,651
Me? No. I didn't go to college.

527
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,195
I went right to work.
I was a secretary.

528
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,406
That's interesting.

529
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,907
Is it?

530
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,411
Here we go.

531
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,790
This smells delicious.

532
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,585
It does.

533
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,087
Didn't you order lasagna?

534
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,922
This is just as good.

535
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,510
Do you want my cannelloni?
It's like lasagna.

536
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,761
More than veal, anyway.

537
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,514
You trying
to make this complicated?

538
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,767
I don't know why you're eating
what you didn't order.

539
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,935
Do you like veal?

540
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,272
What am I supposed to do?
Send it back like a prima donna?

541
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,941
You're just gonna
eat someone else's dinner?

542
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,361
I can either be a jerk
and send it back,

543
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,905
or eat it and look weak.

544
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,367
I don't want this to get cold.

545
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,664
Johnny said you doesn't put up
with things.

546
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,791
Really?

547
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,628
What else did Mathis say?

548
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,173
He said you were funny.

549
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,676
And that you were fearless.

550
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,646
I love veal.

551
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,184
Excuse me. Can I help you?

552
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,894
Should I take my shoes off?

553
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,896
No, that's just
for the mourners.

554
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,774
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

555
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,192
I worked with Rachel.

556
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,570
At the store?
I'm Barbara, her sister.

557
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,823
I'm Don Draper.
I'm in advertising.

558
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,036
I know who you are.

559
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,832
Excuse me, do you mind?

560
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,542
We need one more for our minyan.

561
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,043
I'd be glad to help.

562
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,296
He can't. He's not Jewish.

563
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,632
Okay. I'll go
and knock on some doors.

564
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,968
You shouldn't do it.
Let one of them do it.

565
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,803
Barbara, they're my neighbors.

566
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,641
We're sitting shiva.

567
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,186
It's a seven-day memorial period
after the funeral.

568
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,564
I've lived in New York
a long time.

569
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,815
I brought cake.

570
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,152
You did.

571
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,574
So, how is your family?

572
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,120
I got divorced.

573
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,373
And I got remarried, actually.

574
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,958
You left your wife for her?

575
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,461
No, it didn't work out that way.

576
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,590
I'm actually
getting divorced again.

577
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,551
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,933
Are those her children?

579
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,728
Yes.

580
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,522
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

581
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,108
Years ago. Before them.

582
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,198
What happened to her?

583
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,076
She had leukemia.

584
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,547
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're looking for here.

585
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,634
I just wanted to find out
what was happening in her life.

586
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,470
She lived the life
she wanted to live.

587
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,639
She had everything.

588
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,267
Good.

589
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,270
I have to help. I'm sorry.

590
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,587
Johnny Mathis.

591
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,798
How many times has he shown up

592
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,883
and people
have been disappointed?

593
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,511
"You are not Johnny Mathis."

594
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,972
I've never thought of that.

595
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,684
You don't seem like a lawyer.

596
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:54,147
I just left a firm in Boston
because they felt the same way.

597
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,694
I once quit a job
because I wanted to go to Paris.

598
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,447
Do they do that in advertising?

599
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,867
Sure. We shoot commercials
abroad all the time.

600
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,035
Well, some people do.

601
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,037
So all you have to do is

602
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,290
write something in Paris
and you can go.

603
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,167
- Am I wrong?
- Yes.

604
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,377
That's not how it works.

605
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,880
Well, next vacation.

606
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,218
I haven't taken a vacation...

607
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,888
Well, never.

608
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,727
You know what? Let's go.

609
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,437
Sure. Where?

610
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,898
To Paris.

611
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,859
Let's go to Paris, right now.

612
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,991
You think you're kidding around,
but I don't have a job.

613
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,159
I'm not kidding.

614
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,829
Okay. I'm getting the check.

615
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,748
And I'm getting my coat.

616
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,006
I can't find it.

617
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,383
I've never actually used it.

618
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,344
You've never used your passport?

619
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,525
Stop.

620
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
What? Why?

621
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,861
Flight's not till 6:00.

622
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,406
I hate to disappoint you,
but I don't need that much time.

623
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,914
I can't believe this.
I can't find my passport.

624
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,876
It's okay.
This is a romantic spot.

625
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,296
Stevie.

626
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,426
I'm sorry, but what
were we going to do in Paris?

627
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,681
I thought you were a fling,

628
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,184
but now I think
maybe you're more.

629
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,272
I don't want to sleep with you
on the night we first met.

630
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,274
That's so old-fashioned.

631
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,569
I've tried new-fashioned.

632
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,781
If I have to go back
to Boston...

633
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,575
I don't know
if I'll get this job.

634
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,995
Don't you worry. I am going
to find that passport.

635
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,831
We can go next weekend.

636
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,334
I have an interview in D.C.
next weekend.

637
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,671
- How about the weekend after?
- Perfect.

638
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,676
You really want me to go now?

639
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,015
Just call me
when you get back from D.C.

640
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,442
- I will.
- Good.

641
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,222
Ten days ago in my report
to the nation on Vietnam,

642
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,808
I announced the decision
to withdraw

643
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,561
an additional 150,000 Americans

644
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,230
from Vietnam over the next year.

645
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,318
I said then that
I was making that decision

646
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,320
despite our concern

647
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,989
over increased
enemy activity in Laos.

648
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,134
I've secured Birds Eye.

649
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,428
I think Ferguson Donnelly
is one happy man.

650
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,681
More like a man and a half.

651
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,308
As my father said, he puts
the mick in McCann.

652
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,937
Ken's here for the meeting.

653
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,856
- Did you invite him?
- To this meeting?

654
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:08,859
Hello, Pete.

655
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,154
Roger, I wanted to tell you
I won't be collecting severance.

656
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,074
You got another job?
Good for you.

657
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,450
But you're still entitled.

658
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:17,827
It wouldn't be right.

659
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,495
My signing bonus
from Dow is so big,

660
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,122
it feels like a second helping.

661
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,667
What are you talking about?

662
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,461
I wasn't just Ed's son-in-law.

663
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,630
They actually value
their relationships.

664
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,967
I suppose they need a guy
in fertilizer.

665
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,720
I'm taking Tom Schaeffer's
old post.

666
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,887
Head of advertising.

667
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,725
So, you're going to fire us?

668
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,769
No, it's going to be way worse
than that.

669
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,646
I'm going to be your client.

670
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,024
And I hate to tell you,
but I'm very hard to please.

671
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,320
Until we meet again.

672
00:42:58,743 --> 00:42:59,827
Shit.

673
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,383
Taking Fleischmann's Margarine
to the studio.

674
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,051
If you want changes,
we gotta talk now.

675
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,012
Sure, fine, just keep your voice down.

676
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,181
I commandeered these.

677
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,516
Sounds like
you had quite a night.

678
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,310
It was nice.

679
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,895
With who?

680
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,272
She's going to Europe
with my brother-in-law.

681
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,608
Julie and I
went to Paris on our honeymoon,

682
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,067
if you need recommendations.

683
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,029
I don't know where I'm going,
but you have work to do.

684
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,745
Paris?

685
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,080
Where margarine was invented.

686
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,626
First date magic.

687
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,005
I had too much wine and
I totally embarrassed myself.

688
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,549
Sounds like you had a good time.

689
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,719
I won't get on a plane
with somebody I barely know.

690
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,806
But you'd get to know him.
Sounds like fun.

691
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,268
It's nothing
a couple of aspirin won't fix.

692
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,822
Meredith,
I'm leaving for the day.

693
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,162
I got a little research
for your meeting.

694
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,623
Mr. Rosenthal
is first thing Monday morning.

695
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,000
- Who?
- Mr. Rosenthal.

696
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,545
From Menken's Department Store.

697
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,963
Pantyhose.

698
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,801
Thank you.

699
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,995
I've got this.

700
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,955
Hello.

701
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,292
I don't know why you're here,
but that won't happen again.

702
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
Wait.

703
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,296
What?

704
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,716
I...

705
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,887
I had this dream
about a woman I once knew.

706
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,391
And I found out the next day
she had just died.

707
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,186
Is that who you think I am?

708
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,481
No, I don't think so.

709
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,028
Well, I want you to think very carefully about
when you really had that dream

710
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,989
because when people die,
everything gets mixed up.

711
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,658
I don't know. Maybe.

712
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,953
Maybe you dreamt about her
all the time.

713
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,748
Maybe.

714
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,586
When someone dies, you just
want to make sense out of it.

715
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,046
But you can't.

716
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,677
I'm not saying this
to lead you on

717
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,095
or make you more interested,

718
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,515
but the next time you come
in here, please bring a date.

719
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,684
I just work here.

720
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,521
I just want to sit here.

721
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,861
Okay.
