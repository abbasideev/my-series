1
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,003
You have a patient
waiting. See?

2
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,250
I'm waiting for a follow-up.

3
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,882
If you're talking
about Mr. Casdin,

4
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,051
he has a deceased
sticker on his file,

5
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,888
as do all the other follow-ups you have
scheduled for today.

6
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:57,642
Whoops!

7
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,944
I had colds all winter.

8
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,781
I've been in this room a while,
but it's spring now, right?

9
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,493
I feel run down,
like maybe something big is coming on.

10
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:18,955
Run down? Come on, give me
something. Sore throat?

11
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,790
- No.
- Runny nose?

12
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,709
No. I know it
sounds weird, I'm a nurse,

13
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:26,588
but could you
run maybe a CBC or a thyroid...

14
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,184
Dr. Cuddy, need a consult!

15
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:43,813
Until she stops seizing,

16
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,399
may as well go back
to my office and get my diagnosis on.

17
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,942
She's urinating on herself.

18
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,111
She's having a seizure.
If she hadn't peed...

19
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,780
It's green.

20
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,494
Interesting.

21
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,903
Thirty-five-year-old woman.

22
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,364
Head of nursing
in an old-age home.

23
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,659
Neurological symptoms and "P"?

24
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,997
Oh, green pee. I get it. Nice.

25
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,500
Neuro is also written in green.

26
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,378
Does that mean she
has green neurological symptoms as well?

27
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,422
From now on, I'm gonna use two colors.
Green indicates irony.

28
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,757
Pseudomonas infection.

29
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,384
She'd have a fever. Toxins?

30
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,719
Why are we taking this case?

31
00:02:56,845 --> 00:03:00,849
Welcome, Your Lordship, we were just
preparing your morning briefing.

32
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,725
Sorry I'm late,

33
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,895
and, yes, green pee does meet
the only diagnostic requirement

34
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,856
you care about.
It's interesting.

35
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,400
But is it worth
us taking this case?

36
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,320
"Us" aren't taking anything.
I'm taking. You're accepting.

37
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,575
Okay, I accept. She has
adult-onset epilepsy,

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,786
and she really likes
those St. Patrick's Day beers.

39
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,349
Go check out the house and the office
for toxins and infections.

40
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,750
Her neuro exam was normal,
no subsequent seizures.

41
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:31,170
It's not life threatening.
It's not important.

42
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,006
Luckily, neither are you.

43
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,851
- You okay?
- Fine.

44
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,769
You and House this morning?

45
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,062
The way you were arguing?

46
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:52,108
Airing disagreements
doesn't qualify as arguing.

47
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,821
Come on, man, I'm just trying
to help. We're friends.

48
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,908
There are 400
Japanese teenagers

49
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,159
you were playing
Halo with last night

50
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,952
you're better friends with.

51
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,623
Your avatar should ask their avatars
how they're doing.

52
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,750
I consider you a good friend

53
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,836
even if we don't
hang that much outside of work.

54
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,756
I wasn't arguing with him.

55
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:15,840
You kind of were.

56
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:19,302
Fine, I was. And you know what?

57
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,553
I was right.

58
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,431
You got conned.
Methylthioninium chloride.

59
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,934
Notable side effect,
green urine.

60
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,727
She's a nurse,
she knows the dosage,

61
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:28,973
knows how to fake a seizure.

62
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,815
She pees pea soup and gets the warm
attention of doctors all week long.

63
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,776
She's a Munchausen,
and you're her mark.

64
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,982
So your insight is based on

65
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,238
discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug
at an old-age home.

66
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,044
No good reason it'd be
sitting on her desk.

67
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,785
You ever tried to pee on yourself
in public? It's not easy.

68
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,621
Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat,
we peed in private.

69
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,624
For good reason. I can spot
a fake seizure,

70
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,169
which means this was real,
which means

71
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,837
her problem is phenol.

72
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,798
Carbolic acid?

73
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,467
Yeah, maybe she
accidentally inhaled some

74
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,387
at a gout treatment
facility, circa 1890.

75
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,681
It's still in some
antiseptic throat sprays.

76
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,933
She's been chugging
it all winter for her colds.

77
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,977
Phenol explains the
seizure and the urine.

78
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,622
She'd have to drink
five bottles a day.

79
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,938
Which is why I'm sure
you won't have trouble

80
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,984
discovering the evidence of it
when you search her house. Bye.

81
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:22,949
And you can start her on charcoal
hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning.

82
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,493
Seriously?

83
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,830
Oh, you were lying
about the throat spray.

84
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,332
That does make more sense.

85
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,917
So why are you
wasting Taub's time?

86
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,045
Because I don't want him to know
that I'm wasting my time

87
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,840
disproving his fake
seizure theory. Zip!

88
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,015
Chris?

89
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,934
Chris Taub, right?

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,270
Neil Zane.

91
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,064
I was two years under you at
Collegiate High, remember?

92
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,149
Sure.

93
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,984
So you are some big
doctor here now?

94
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,571
I'm a doctor. You?

95
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,314
I was speaking at an econ course
over at the university.

96
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,534
I tripped and banged my leg.

97
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,204
I have some time. Come with me.

98
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,459
Hi. Tests back?

99
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,420
Head CT was negative.

100
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,591
What about a thyroid uptake
or abdominal ultrasound?

101
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:26,387
Sure. How about I flash
some lights in front of your face first?

102
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,912
You want me to have
another seizure?

103
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:28,973
We're gonna have to
give up the room

104
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,226
unless we can
confirm a problem.

105
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,478
Okay-

106
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,126
Damn it!

107
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,922
Oh, God.
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

108
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,634
What are you worried about? You'll have
maybe a night in jail for fraud.

109
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,761
I have to go tell one of
my employees he was right.

110
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:09,806
I'm not a Munchausen.
I'm gonna die unless you help me.

111
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:11,724
You'll have to come up
with something more original.

112
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,310
A cat predicted my death.

113
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,857
Cats make terrible doctors.

114
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,735
Oh, no, wait,
that's women. You're screwed.

115
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,615
How'd you slip?

116
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,119
I've had this
dizziness problem for a while now.

117
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,829
You get checked
for labyrinthitis?

118
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:36,040
On antibiotics for
a week. No difference.

119
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,085
- Lie down a sec.
- Whoa, whoa, I'm dizzy.

120
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,586
That's normal.

121
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,089
So what are you teaching?

122
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,632
Entrepreneurship.

123
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:48,010
I'm a CEO. OstTech Industries.
We make medical devices.

124
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,138
All right. You can sit up.

125
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,058
So, did that tell you
anything? Did I...

126
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,353
Oh, my God.

127
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,273
You just cured me.

128
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,718
I figured you had a tiny calcium deposit
in your inner ear.

129
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,610
I just shifted it around.

130
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,196
I've seen three
doctors for this.

131
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,741
- I'm buying you dinner.
- Forget it.

132
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,036
Come on. I'm also an investor in a club,
we'll make it a night out.

133
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,998
Well, I'm married, boring.

134
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,668
I know some married people
who aren't boring.

135
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:23,504
A few years back,
I was one of them.

136
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,840
Good luck, Neil.

137
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,141
If you're gonna kill me and rape me,
please do it in that order.

138
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,019
This is the cat. Debbie.
Have you heard of her?

139
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,605
Debbie? Sorry, but
without a last name...

140
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,690
She was on the news.
We found her as a kitten.

141
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,650
She lives in the nursing home.

142
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,445
She only sleeps next to people
when they're about to die.

143
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,113
Ten patients in the last year.

144
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:53,534
And then yesterday, she did it to me
while I was sitting on my couch.

145
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,830
Please. The whole staff, the doctors
even, we all know this is real.

146
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,540
Can you come back later?

147
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,586
I have some business I'm conducting
with the Prince of Nigeria.

148
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,840
Just watch this video.
It'll prove I'm not lying.

149
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,386
Dr. House, I am begging you.

150
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,728
Chest.

151
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,568
Quick, before she goes without attention
for eight seconds.

152
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,694
House.

153
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:36,327
- She's faking. The cat told me.
- Listen.

154
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:43,501
Soft breath sounds.
Means it's bronchospasm.

155
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,714
You can't fake that.

156
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,054
Debbie the cat
spends most of her time

157
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,347
just prowling the halls,

158
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,391
the queen of
her own private world.

159
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,851
I gotta say, I don't think
the changes they've made

160
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,561
to American Idol
really work for me.

161
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,356
When Debbie climbs on a patientk bed
and goes to sleep,

162
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,817
we call the loved ones
and tell them to come in.

163
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,903
You wanna treat her?
She's a nut job.

164
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,905
Don't we all have quirks?

165
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,783
Aren't those eccentricities
what make us human?

166
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,744
<i>It's like Debbie's here on Earth
to bring people to the other side.</i>

167
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,705
The doctors that we spoke to
also agree that the cat...

168
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,873
Nut jobs get sick, too.

169
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:28,421
So you think this
cat story is nonsense,

170
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:31,465
and you admit she faked her
earlier symptoms,

171
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,926
but you still think
she's actually sick now?

172
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,388
Well, anything would sound ridiculous
if you said it in that voice.

173
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,224
Confirm she's faking
or I'm gonna have to kick her out.

174
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,767
There's that voice again.

175
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,519
I'll give you 24 hours.

176
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,272
Consecutive?

177
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,947
What are you doing?

178
00:10:55,072 --> 00:11:00,328
No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die. Bronchospasm. Go.

179
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,705
- Bronchitis.
- No cough, no fever,

180
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,415
and Blofeld didn't
smoke a cigar.

181
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,627
He might have. Dude had a lair,
means he was rich.

182
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:13,299
Rich people enjoy a good stogie,
sometimes send them as gifts.

183
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,634
Hey, Taub, did that sound like

184
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,679
I was awkwardly trying to segue
into making a point?

185
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,639
- Yes.
- Emphysema.

186
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,767
Lungs were clean on the CT.

187
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,020
Dogs can be trained to predict
diabetic comas, epileptic seizures,

188
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,190
they can smell cancer. It is possible
there's something to this cat.

189
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,650
It's more possible
it was just a coincidence.

190
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,612
Ten million nursing homes,
hundred million pet cats,

191
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,072
one of them was bound
to pick a few winners.

192
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,074
Debbie was able to predict
there was something wrong

193
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,368
with the patient before you were.
Is that a coincidence, too?

194
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:44,663
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything,
it might have caused the deaths.

195
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,040
We should've
listened to Ted Nugent.

196
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,585
Yeah. It could be cat scratch fever,
or visceral larva migrans.

197
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,545
Maybe it didn't kill everyone
at the nursing home,

198
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,255
but it may be killing Morgan.

199
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,967
The worms hop from the cat to the
cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.

200
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,844
Those cigars were for me.

201
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,179
Hey, that reminds me.

202
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:04,558
Why is some fancy CEO sending you
a box of Cuban cigars?

203
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,685
Is it related to
your money worries?

204
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,645
What money worries?

205
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,815
Extrapolating from the fact that he's
been skipping his morning muffin,

206
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,985
I'd say that he lost almost all
his money in the market last year.

207
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,987
I'm on a diet.

208
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,409
I'm also extrapolating from the online
portfolio you forgot to log off,

209
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,661
but it's mostly the muffins.

210
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,705
Scope her for
worms in the lungs.

211
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,380
We could help out in there.

212
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,882
Yeah, it takes
at least four people

213
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,469
to look inside a crazy woman's lungs
for imaginary worms.

214
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,222
So, you're in
a good mood again.

215
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,809
Do you need another speech
about what a great friend I am?

216
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,439
I'm telling my wife
we don't need to downsize,

217
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,315
but maybe we do.

218
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,559
You really lost all that money?

219
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,810
I don't care about the money,
I just feel bad for Rachel.

220
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,574
She married a guy in one situation,
ended up with another.

221
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,534
- That's hard on anyone.
- Thanks,

222
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,979
makes me feel much better,
hearing my wife's a gold digger.

223
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,705
No, I just meant she married

224
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,374
this master-of-the-universe
successful surgeon,

225
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:15,045
and now he's basically a flunky
for this mad scientist,

226
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,923
who saves lives,
so that's good.

227
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,386
There are no worms
in the lungs.

228
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,891
What else could
cause bronchospasm?

229
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,267
Severe acid reflux.

230
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,685
No esophagitis,
it's not reflux.

231
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,395
Why are you
pushing a crash cart?

232
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,523
Because patients sometimes crash,
and they haven't yet invented

233
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,277
a crash tractor for me to drive wildly
around the hallways.

234
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,282
Why are we in the
coma patients' room?

235
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,830
You actually think the cat is going
to predict someone's death?

236
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,626
No. I know the cat is not going
to predict anyone's death.

237
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,753
And then I will have
scientifically disproved...

238
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,638
You didn't keep this patient
despite the cat,

239
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,507
you kept this patient
because of the cat.

240
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,092
You're scared there's
something to it.

241
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,471
If I could prove the non-existence
of an omniscient God

242
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,890
who lovingly guides us
to the other side, I would.

243
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,226
Cat version will have to do.

244
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,604
Are you scared?

245
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,689
Cats' brains are
always in alpha mode.

246
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,318
The few scientific tests that have
seemed to confirm psychic phenomena,

247
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,653
that's where it takes place.

248
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,378
Please tell me that you were kidding,
so I won't have to fire you.

249
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,865
I was kidding.

250
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,784
We still have
a human patient, right?

251
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,286
- Airborne allergens possible?
- Skin test was negative.

252
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,532
Lungs may be more sensitive.

253
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,540
Or House just screwed up.

254
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,876
If you misinterpreted the breath sounds
as soft instead of loud,

255
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,546
it's laryngospasm
instead of bronchospasm.

256
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,589
Which she can
get from a simple panic attack,

257
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,216
which she was having.

258
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,970
I also heard the lung sounds, too, Taub.
You saying I screwed up?

259
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,014
"Screwed up" is maybe
too harsh, but yes.

260
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,268
Don't you
wanna check their charts?

261
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,603
Of course not,
this is a double-blind.

262
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,440
I don't want to even subconsciously
signal to Teddy which one's the sickest.

263
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,150
Her name's Debbie.

264
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,736
Are those welts
on that guy's arm?

265
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,613
Were they here
when we got here?

266
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,537
He has a severe cat allergy.

267
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,501
That never happened.

268
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,794
Look at Debbie.

269
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,638
Good news, Mr. Limpert.

270
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,724
When you don't die tonight,

271
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,352
you will finally have done something
good for the world,

272
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,522
as opposed to your
life as a fireman.

273
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,318
Foreman's airborne allergen theory
makes the most sense.

274
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,821
Do a methacholine
challenge on Catgirl to check it out.

275
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,997
I told you to
get rid of Death Cat.

276
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,542
- You see a cat?
- I see a litter box.

277
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,587
This is a disability,
Dr. Cuddy.

278
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,674
- I can't make it to the men's room...
- You pee on the mice, too?

279
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,261
Well, now, you see, the mice actually
prove that I don't have a cat.

280
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,763
Are these...

281
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,059
Are these the genetically modified
lab mice from oncology?

282
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,770
Genetically modified
for tastiness.

283
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,692
Get rid of the cat,
and get rid of your patient.

284
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,819
My team is doing
a methacholine challenge.

285
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,113
Your team just completed
a methacholine challenge,

286
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,282
which came up negative.

287
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,576
Who told you about
the test? Taub?

288
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,745
I'll never say. But yes.

289
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,665
Her airway's clamped
down. I heard it.

290
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,830
We kick her
onto the streets, it could happen again.

291
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,419
Wish there was
a "lawsuit cat," it could warn you.

292
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,630
I'm sorry, but if you
won't escort her out,

293
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,341
I'll have to get
security to do it.

294
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,103
You're joining me
for a goodbye smoke.

295
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,938
I don't smoke.

296
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:05,275
Fine, if you don't want the seventh
graders to think you're cool.

297
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,491
I went through your purse.

298
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,952
Horoscopes, good-luck charms.

299
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,788
You went to a good college,
good nursing school,

300
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,290
so you weren't always
a superstitious idiot.

301
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,709
I'm not a superstitious...

302
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,670
How about four years,
that sound right?

303
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,423
That's when you switched
from the family insurance plan

304
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,799
to the one you're on now.

305
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,301
I was married, I got divorced.

306
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,889
Two years before that,
you got chickenpox shots,

307
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,184
which you only
get in adulthood when you have a kid.

308
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,437
Or I should say
when you had a kid

309
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,689
because no kid
has come to visit you.

310
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,067
Which all makes me think
something bad happened.

311
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,948
It was my stepson, Timothy.

312
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,037
What happened?

313
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,039
He was in school.

314
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,752
He was having
his morning snack, and he choked.

315
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,215
And the teachers saw it, and they did
everything that they were supposed to.

316
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,384
He shouldn't have died.

317
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,221
You wanna make it make sense.

318
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,851
What's wrong with that?

319
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,313
It's meaningless
is what's wrong.

320
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,066
What's wrong is that it doesn't
do a thing to bring your kid back,

321
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,736
or put you and
your ex together again.

322
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,493
Rash on your neck.

323
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,205
Probably not enough for Cuddy.

324
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,543
- Can't breathe.
- Hey, Doc.

325
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,548
Breath sound soft to you, Doc?

326
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,011
Hooray, you're officially sick.

327
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,312
Churg-Strauss fits best.
Here's the plan.

328
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,564
Taub, change the litter box.

329
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,484
This is pathetic.

330
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,946
You're still punishing me for calling
you out on the green urine lady?

331
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,698
Nope, this is for
ratting me out to Cuddy.

332
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:20,577
I'm not asking you to apologize,
just scoop some poop out of a box.

333
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,329
Just clean it.

334
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:24,790
Let House do it.

335
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:25,755
Yeah, that'll happen.

336
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,294
He won't just continue to let
our room smell like cat pee.

337
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,421
I'll clean it next time.

338
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,299
I'm out of here.

339
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,643
Now that you've delivered
that important lesson,

340
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,397
I'm gonna go
test the patient. Whoa!

341
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,067
What, you think
your bag's going to die now?

342
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,652
Now you're punishing me

343
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,029
because you think I'm superstitious?
What do you care?

344
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,990
It's not so much
about me caring, per so,

345
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,326
it's more about me wondering
why you're such a credulous idiot.

346
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,247
Thirteen, start the patient on steroids
for the Churg-Strauss.

347
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,667
Unless we have something
we need to argue about?

348
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,841
This is good stuff.

349
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,175
The best.

350
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,510
It's made from
the distilled sweat of

351
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,513
recently-laid-off
hedge fund managers.

352
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,973
Aren't you happy
you came out tonight?

353
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:27,269
Yeah. I wasn't actually going to,
but not the greatest day at work.

354
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,440
I used to have
an office like this.

355
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,399
Used to?

356
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,192
When I was a plastic surgeon.

357
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,029
But one day, I took
stock of my life and...

358
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:41,033
Oh, screw it.

359
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,537
I had an affair with the daughter
of one of my partners.

360
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,749
They signed a non-disclosure,
I signed a non-compete.

361
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:52,544
And the funny thing is
I wound up telling my wife anyway.

362
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,050
You like your job?

363
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,720
Same as you, same as everyone,
it has its ups and downs.

364
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,391
You're lying
to make me feel better.

365
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah. It's the best. I'm in charge,
you know. I'm a kid with toys.

366
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,359
Speaking of which,
what do you think of the prototype?

367
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,444
It's amazing.

368
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,571
You gotta make it
a half-inch smaller, though.

369
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,240
- You serious?
- I got small hands,

370
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,909
6.5 gloves,
like women surgeons,

371
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,554
which are your
fastest-g rowing market.

372
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,414
Me and the girls would have to use
two hands to hit the switch.

373
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,086
Why do I bother paying
the idiots that work for me?

374
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,671
Put down that crap
you're drinking,

375
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,758
because I am breaking out
the really good stuff.

376
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,148
What's wrong?

377
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,567
I went to the bathroom.
My urine...

378
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,653
- Green again?
- It's brown.

379
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,115
I didn't do anything. Honest.

380
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,664
I'm just a girl
who can't say no.

381
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,126
It is possible
she's still faking.

382
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,169
She didn't fake
the bronchospasm.

383
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,214
You think she's faking some stuff,
but not other stuff?

384
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,757
Maybe she's Unchausen?

385
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,052
I'm just saying the brown urine
doesn't make sense.

386
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,229
- What?
- Nothing.

387
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,441
We've ruled out every
possible cause for brown urine.

388
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,068
No blood in the urine,
liver and kidneys fine.

389
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,154
Brown could be fecal. Fistula.

390
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,321
We checked.

391
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,449
How do we know
the urine is still brown?

392
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,160
Had to be. Once
you've gone brown...

393
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,873
If we've ruled out everything
that can make the urine brown,

394
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,416
what if it just looked brown.

395
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,754
If the green dye never left her system,
what plus green makes brown?

396
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,381
Purple.

397
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,885
Strep bovis infection
from colon cancer.

398
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,429
Paraneoplastic syndrome
would explain the bronchospasm.

399
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,355
We scoped
her when we checked for the fistula,

400
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,600
there's no tumor.

401
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,268
Oh, no.

402
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,188
I wasn't scared
by the umbrella, either.

403
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:19,316
What? Not everything's
about you, Kutner.

404
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,360
I realize it's stupid.
I just don't know everything,

405
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,446
- I don't want to invite...
- Great.

406
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,031
I thought your
superstitiousness

407
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,324
had to do with your
folks being killed,

408
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,077
but "you're stupid"
works just as well.

409
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,289
Why is there a ladder here?

410
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,001
Whoops. Forgot that one.

411
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:43,215
Scopes don't work as well as pillcams.
Give her one, find the tumor.

412
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,219
Come with me, Tiny Taub.

413
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:08,406
Sorry, I was late again. I've got
a long commute from the poorhouse.

414
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,325
Knew it when I hired you.

415
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,494
You'd eventually
miss the money,

416
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,497
being the big shot
like your new CEO friend,

417
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,333
if that nightclub
stamp on your hand is any indication.

418
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,752
- Don't worry, I'm not quitting.
- I know.

419
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,756
A guy who signs a non-compete instead of
just telling his wife that he cheated

420
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,081
doesn't have the guts to quit.

421
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,801
Bad example. I did tell her.

422
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,303
From guilt, not from courage.

423
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,931
And bravely running
to Cuddy behind my back,

424
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,434
and arriving heroically
late every day.

425
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,770
Cowards make lousy employees.

426
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,354
Well, maybe you're a coward,
maybe you're quitting.

427
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,316
Either way, I'm screwed.

428
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:56,163
You'll note how Faster,
Pussycat! Kill! Kill!

429
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,874
Has snuggled up
by coma guy over there.

430
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,586
More importantly,
she did yesterday as well.

431
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,005
And he's still breathing.

432
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,673
We done?

433
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,106
Thank you for showing me this.

434
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:28,403
But maybe she's just confused
in this new environment.

435
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,075
In 1844, a preacher
in upstate New York

436
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:38,205
added up some dates in the Bible
and predicted Jesus' return.

437
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,041
His followers gave away
all their possessions

438
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,751
and showed up in a field.

439
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,836
Guess who didn't show.

440
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,463
So the preacher said
that he miscalculated,

441
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,149
and they went right
back the next month,

442
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,674
but with more followers.

443
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,052
Every time he was
irrefutably proved wrong,

444
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,262
it redoubled everyone's belief.

445
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,432
I know I sound just like them.

446
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,102
But I also know you're wrong.

447
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,732
Something terrible
is gonna happen to me.

448
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,747
You trying to prove
to her she's not dying?

449
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,625
That would be dumb,
as she might be dying.

450
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,960
This woman lost her kid.

451
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,504
Why are you attacking beliefs that give
her a little bit of comfort?

452
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,923
I don't care if her superstitions
make her feel better.

453
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,550
- I just want her to think more clearly.
- Oh.

454
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,396
Maybe that can make her
as happy as you are.

455
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,975
Where are we going?

456
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,559
Experimenting.

457
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,816
Stop it, Dr. Wilson.
It's just not cute anymore.

458
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,279
You already experimented
on the coma guy.

459
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,864
- Haven't you proved your point?
- Not to the patient,

460
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,408
and not to the
millions of idiots

461
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,952
who drooled over that news item
about the magic cat.

462
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,537
Why are you so
obsessed with this?

463
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,943
Can't you just call
her an idiot and leave everyone alone?

464
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,834
Hey, look, kids, therapy cat.

465
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,629
You're a liar. Therapy animals
are dogs, not cats.

466
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,424
Aren't you feisty?
This one's special.

467
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,136
If she likes you,
interesting stuff happens.

468
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,765
No. Okay. Kids,
playtime's over.

469
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,461
You know what,
this is a good thing.

470
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,399
Because either you're
starting to doubt yourself,

471
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,108
which is healthy, or...

472
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,485
I don't believe
in the legend of Goodbye Kitty.

473
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,071
Or you're starting to give a crap
what other people think,

474
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,596
which is just another way of saying

475
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,059
you give a crap
about other people.

476
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,995
I'd love to hear more of your theory,
but I don't give a crap.

477
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,122
Also, the pillcam's back.

478
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:50,128
Polypoid. Raised edges.

479
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,921
Raised edges are
actually necessary,

480
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,673
since that's the opening
to the appendix.

481
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,302
How many times are we
gonna watch this? There's no tumor.

482
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:58,928
Oh, my God,

483
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,931
the Death Cat is attacking your legs,
you're gonna die.

484
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:03,892
Maybe it has something to do

485
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,936
with that little red dot
dancing around down there.

486
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,147
Oh, my God, the death laser

487
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,873
is attacking your legs,
you're gonna die.

488
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,817
We're wasting time
looking for cancer.

489
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,403
She's still walking around,
she's still pretty healthy,

490
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,946
maybe it's something minor.

491
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,866
Maybe we're not wasting time.

492
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,785
We wouldn't have
seen a flat lesion.

493
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,039
Skin cancer could have metastasized
to the intestines.

494
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,332
Cool.

495
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,793
Check for melanomas.

496
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:53,108
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty. Come here. Here, kitty.

497
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:09,541
What?

498
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,500
It's not cancer.

499
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,001
We found spider veins
on her back.

500
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,628
They weren't there
when she came in.

501
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,755
Spider veins means Cushing's.

502
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,259
Could cause an abdominal
disturbance, brown urine.

503
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,136
But the bronchospasm?

504
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,597
Cushing's myopathY-

505
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,724
It's uncommon, but...

506
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,061
Wait a second.

507
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,731
You didn't wake me up to tell me
a symptom that's not killing her.

508
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,608
What else is going on?

509
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,985
I think she's dying.

510
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,205
I just told you,
it's Cushing's. We treat...

511
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,158
I don't mean because
of the spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.

512
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,803
If that's my
high school gym teacher...

513
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,494
It's your coma patient.

514
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,914
He was stable for a year-and-a-half,
and he just died.

515
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,000
The cat was right, House.

516
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,840
Here, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss.

517
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:02,177
Say "puss" one more time. It's the
sixth "puss" that really does it.

518
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:05,472
You're right. Sulking
will solve everything.

519
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:08,308
That cat sat on my lap,
and that cat knows something.

520
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,060
- You believe it now?
- Yesterday, it was all a coincidence.

521
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,355
Yesterday, it was, till I
unintentionally proved it wasn't.

522
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,525
Patient must have Cushing's. We have
to figure out whether it's based in...

523
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,778
A cat's nose is powerful, could smell
liver or kidney failure.

524
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,698
Exactly. Except that if you'd glanced
at the nursing home files

525
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,782
I had faxed over this morning,

526
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,410
you'd know that most of the patients'
livers and kidneys were fine.

527
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,204
- What else?
- The MRis aren't telling us

528
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,249
if the Cushing's is in
her adrenals or her brain.

529
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,665
So check her ACTH.

530
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,292
The cat's vision
is at the blue end of the spectrum.

531
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,170
ACTH is 11.7.
It's too close to tell.

532
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,547
And we can't treat the wrong organ,
'cause that won't solve anything.

533
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,633
She could have
a cortisol storm, could kill her.

534
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,552
Well, maybe, as the senior fellow,
you could have made sure

535
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,305
that my doors were closed so that I
could be concentrating on the cat

536
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,932
instead of looking for the cat.

537
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,977
You all right?

538
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,356
Your nose.

539
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,657
What'd he say?

540
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,911
Sounds like he said,
"Do you like cranberry juice?"

541
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,538
Crap.

542
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:15,416
Cheaper than fake blood.
And more cran-tastic.

543
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,627
Don't ever leave my door open
like that again.

544
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:20,338
You're playing pranks
and this woman could be dying.

545
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,174
So have Chase do
a venous sampling in her brain.

546
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,926
If he finds something,
it's there,

547
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,929
if he finds nothing,
it's the adrenals.

548
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,851
I'm not who I used to be.

549
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,523
I'm scared.
It's not a way to live.

550
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,527
I wanna come work for you.

551
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,073
Jeez, Chris,
you didn't think...

552
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,326
I didn't mean to imply
that I could hire you right now.

553
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,287
You said you needed
guys like me.

554
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:56,165
I know, but you
don't have an MBA,

555
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,209
and I just hired
a Chief Medical Officer.

556
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,878
Then let me invest in that laser
scalpel start-up.

557
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,839
I got money saved,
not a ton, but...

558
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:06,843
We put in a two-million-dollar minimum
for the first round of financing.

559
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,221
Look,

560
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,850
I guess I could take you on,
on a smaller number,

561
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,518
but you have to understand

562
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,103
it wouldn't be
some quick payoff.

563
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,857
Yeah, I know. I know it's not gonna
change my life overnight.

564
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,901
I just need to
start changing it.

565
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,489
Okay, then. Let's start.

566
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,830
What exactly are you hoping to find
inside your dead coma guy?

567
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:40,043
Catnip, chew toy... I don't know,
that's why I'm looking.

568
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,963
Your patient had a cardiac arrest
during the venous sampling.

569
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,716
We got her back, but
her heart's still tenuous.

570
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,093
- That tell us anything?
- She's weak, possibly dying.

571
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,928
So nothing.

572
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,765
- What about the ACTH?
- Slightly elevated.

573
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,017
It confirms the Cushing's
is in the brain. Go.

574
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,227
Are you sure
that it's Cushing's?

575
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,897
You'd expect central body obesity,
she's in good shape.

576
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,733
If it had a normal presentation,
there wouldn't be a cat involved.

577
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,942
So it's the brain,

578
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,945
means the next question is whether
to remove her pituitary right now...

579
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,866
That's not a question for me,
that's a question for the patient.

580
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,951
Now present both sides,
let her decide.

581
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,203
All right.

582
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,792
I've got to stop
telling you my theories.

583
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,502
You always just
try to prove me wrong.

584
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:25,963
You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass
getting bigger at the full moon?

585
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,965
I confirmed that one,
photo's on my blog.

586
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,731
Normally, you'd be up
in the patient room,

587
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,052
hectoring her on what to do,

588
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:33,721
instead you're up to your elbows
in some irrelevant dead guy,

589
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,683
who may or may not be
connected to a magic cat,

590
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,060
because you want to prove to me
that you don't care.

591
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:42,855
Case is over. I'm exploring
a scientific mystery.

592
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,066
I put up with your obsessions,

593
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,026
I even encourage them,
for one reason,

594
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:51,614
they save lives. I don't know
what you're doing now.

595
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,917
Cushing's means your body is
overproducing a hormone called cortisol.

596
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,337
The recommended course of action
is to suppress it with drugs.

597
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,464
And that will cure it?

598
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,342
Just treat it.
It could come back.

599
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,928
The only permanent solution is

600
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,723
to cut into your brain and remove
your pituitary gland,

601
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:19,016
but surgery's dangerous.

602
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,061
Your heart stopped
on the table once already.

603
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,689
I want the surgery.

604
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:28,609
This thing is gonna kill me
if I don't kill it first.

605
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,321
Because of the cat?

606
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,034
Do you wanna tell me
what an idiot I'm being?

607
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,119
No.

608
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,583
I really believe that there are things
that science can't understand,

609
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:49,046
that there is a role for faith and
prayer, but it's in the waiting room,

610
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,299
not the OR.

611
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,805
There's a reason I got sick.

612
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:02,185
There's a reason for all the bad things
that have happened to me.

613
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,939
I don't know what that reason is,
but I know that if there isn't one,

614
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,526
if there's no greater
purpose in the world,

615
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,572
then it's not a world
I wanna live in.

616
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,285
I'll schedule
an operating room.

617
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,808
You're early.

618
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,770
I'm not staying long.
I'm quitting.

619
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,317
- You got a new job?
- No.

620
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,861
Well, then you're not quitting.

621
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,280
I'll see you
back here tomorrow.

622
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,158
You're not accepting
my resignation?

623
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,827
Easier this way.

624
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,454
It avoids the whole thing
where you panic, run back and grovel,

625
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,332
and I punish you,
and then take you back.

626
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,586
Bye.

627
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:17,677
Bring donuts. Everyone loves
those bear claws.

628
00:36:56,257 --> 00:37:00,636
Here, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss. Puss?

629
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:46,933
Mr. Taub?

630
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,268
I've been waiting 15 minutes.
Where's Neil?

631
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,479
Neil doesn't work here anymore.

632
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,064
But he's the CEO.

633
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,525
I'm sorry. I wish
I could help you. Sorry.

634
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,529
This is crazy.
I'm investing with his company.

635
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,740
He doesn't have a company.

636
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:05,242
He worked here, but he
was a receptionist, a temp.

637
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,203
- Where is he?
- He's in custody.

638
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,580
I really am not
supposed to say anything else.

639
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,457
I went to high school with him.

640
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:14,043
That's what everyone
else thought, too.

641
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:17,004
I'm guessing you also
cured his ear problem?

642
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,092
Did you give him the money yet?

643
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,593
No.

644
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,355
I was right,

645
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,316
and more satisfyingly,
you were wrong.

646
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,527
It was coincidence.

647
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,446
That cat was not
predicting deaths,

648
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,811
it was just trying
to keep warm.

649
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,492
Yes, dead people are
renowned for their warm glow.

650
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,619
They are if they're feverish,

651
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,371
like three of
the patients were.

652
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,874
Or if they are wasting away,
like the other eight.

653
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,668
- Wasting doesn't...
- It does,

654
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,171
if it means someone sticks
a heating blanket on you.

655
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,968
Congrats. Because of your
crazy obsession with this cat

656
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,773
you've solved
a completely trivial mystery.

657
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,222
Completely trivial?

658
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:11,976
My God, it's clearly
only partially trivial.

659
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,562
Debbie climbed on Morgan, too,

660
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:15,887
which means she was overheated.

661
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:19,442
So what causes flushing,
mimics every Cushing's symptom

662
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,777
except central body obesity?

663
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,613
Cancer.

664
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:28,034
A corticotropin-producing
carcinoid tumor of the intestine.

665
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,995
But your pillcam
didn't find anything.

666
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,457
Means it must be somewhere
the pillcam couldn't go.

667
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,625
The appendix.

668
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:39,754
Congratulations.
You probably saved her life.

669
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,715
You definitely
saved her needless surgery.

670
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,842
Yes, I did.

671
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:48,304
What's the OR extension number?

672
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,555
Just curious.

673
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,858
Thank you.

674
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:06,363
I wouldn't come here for thanks,
that would be ungracious.

675
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,658
It's more about gloating.

676
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,079
You were about to cut out
a piece of your brain

677
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,873
just to chase some
crazy superstition.

678
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,084
But I didn't.

679
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:21,796
You didn't didn't
do anything. I stopped it.

680
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,091
And what made you do that?

681
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,719
Science. Logic. Reason.
Pick any three.

682
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:33,474
A cat chooses that exact moment
to sit on your computer.

683
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,018
Maybe that's science
and logic and reason,

684
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,145
or maybe it's something else.

685
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,400
You're an idiot.

686
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,615
I looked up the preacher
from New York State.

687
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:53,077
His followers never faded out.

688
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:55,412
They became the
Seventh-Day Adventists.

689
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,833
A major religion.
That man changed the course of history.

690
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,586
Because his followers
were as deluded as he was.

691
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,801
Maybe he just gave them
something to live for.

692
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,848
Feel better.

693
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,759
Kutner!

694
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,186
Cat pee on my chair?

695
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,688
- Blood on my face?
- Fake blood.

696
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,778
You pay for the dry-cleaning.

697
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,787
Why are you still alive?

698
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:19,914
I'm not sure.

699
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,541
I guess he was impressed
you stood up to him.

700
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,585
And got a cat
to pee on his chair.

701
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,379
Yeah. A cat.

702
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,184
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
