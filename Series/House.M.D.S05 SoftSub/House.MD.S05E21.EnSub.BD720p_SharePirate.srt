1
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:38,289
You made your point, now how about
letting us do our job?

2
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:41,501
Our point will be made when your company
stops tearing down this mountain.

3
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,420
Then who's gonna
feed our kids? You?

4
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:44,713
If you really cared
about your kids,

5
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,079
you'd want them to have air to breathe
when they grow up.

6
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,633
What did you say,
you son of a bitch?

7
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,719
You guys aren't the problem.

8
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,679
You're being hurt
more than anyone.

9
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,431
You breathe in
that coal dust...

10
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,725
Coal is the dirtiest
energy on Earth.

11
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,562
Gonna need some backup.

12
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,731
Not enough for you thugs to assault
the environment?

13
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,107
Doug, please, don't.

14
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,945
Susan? Susan, you okay?

15
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,118
She needs to get to a hospital.

16
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,964
She's just dehydrated. We have medics
here. Let them give her fluids.

17
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,247
She has no pulse.

18
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,001
Either unhook your arm
or I'm gonna break it off.

19
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,836
Either way,
this protest is over.

20
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,921
The protest is over, come on!

21
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,053
All right.

22
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,979
- What happened?
- You passed out.

23
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,815
It's okay. Just dehydrated.

24
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:50,570
You know we'll be back.
We'll be back!

25
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,335
Hey, stop screwing around.

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,670
I'm not screwing around.
I just can't...

27
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,845
I can't stand up.

28
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,062
I need to push back
our getaway.

29
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,858
No, you don't. I found you a board,
perfect size to learn on.

30
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,776
I'm just postponing.
O'Neil, from Philly General,

31
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,736
wants me to get a patient
in to see House.

32
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,696
So?

33
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,030
I owe him a favor.

34
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,741
He's taken about a dozen of my referrals
over the last year.

35
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:22,203
I meant, so, that's five seconds
to hand House the file,

36
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,581
30 for him to question
your real motives,

37
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:25,790
a minute for witty comments

38
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,585
comparing the length of your legs
to Thirteen's...

39
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,752
Plenty of time left over
for the shore.

40
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:32,119
I need to make sure he doesn't toss
the file in the trash

41
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,339
as soon as I'm out of sight.

42
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,925
Babe, can't you repay the favor
on another case?

43
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,429
After last week, I could really use
a break from this place.

44
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,763
We both could.

45
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,309
Once I'm sure
he's really on the case,

46
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,894
then we're out of here.

47
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,980
And these legs, and every other part
of me, will be all yours.

48
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,695
He's seen three
different specialists.

49
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,614
Interesting.

50
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,408
Almost as interesting as you trying
to step into Kutner's shoes

51
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,410
just days after
he stepped out of them.

52
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,662
I am not shoe shopping,

53
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,873
I'm just trying to repay a favor
to his referring doctor.

54
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:07,999
What's the mystery?

55
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:11,711
The nutcase spends all his free time
wreaking havoc at toxic waste dumps.

56
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:12,879
Tox screen's negative.

57
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:16,049
No neurological, muscular or
cardiovascular abnormalities.

58
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,760
The guy cares about the environment,
that makes him a nutcase?

59
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,136
He's a single guy in his 20s,

60
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,764
he cares about getting
his hybrid waxed by girls

61
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,089
who care about the environment.

62
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,892
See? Not a nutcase.

63
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,602
He's probably just faking
so he can sue the cops

64
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,811
and get a six-figure
settlement.

65
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:29,979
If he was trying
to fake an illness,

66
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,399
why would he consent to be seen by the
best diagnostician in the country?

67
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,527
Now look who's trying
to get her hybrid waxed.

68
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,988
We need to do a vestibular
caloric test,

69
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,699
see if the balance problem
starts above or below the neck.

70
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,369
And when I say "we,"
I mean you.

71
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,955
You're the one with a favor
to repay, not them.

72
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,381
I'm going to be injecting ice-water
in your ear canal.

73
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,716
If the resulting eye movements
are at all erratic,

74
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,427
then the balance problem's
in your inner ear.

75
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,888
Those in every room?

76
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:04,973
I think so.

77
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:09,018
Can you get rid of them?
Preferably from every room?

78
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,230
They use over 30 pesticides
to grow commercial flowers.

79
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,815
You'd think the medical industry
would be a lot more...

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,191
Concerned with medicine?

81
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,944
Let's fix your body, then you can
go back to fixing the Earth.

82
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,028
This is gonna get
a little uncomfortable.

83
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,280
I just spent 14 hours
chained to a tire.

84
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:22,907
Most doctors would recommend...

85
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,701
Our planet's headed
for destruction.

86
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,620
Coastlines underwater,
a million species extinct.

87
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,416
Whoa! Feels like
I'm tumbling head over heels.

88
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,960
It's normal. Sometimes
this test causes vertigo

89
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,548
and nausea.

90
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,511
Cameron just brought me a case.

91
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,680
Cameron is happy in the ER.

92
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,766
There's no way she wants her nose
back on your grindstone.

93
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,562
Egg-white omelet, no bacon,
whole-wheat toast.

94
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,856
I say it's not
my grindstone she's after,

95
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,941
and not her nose
she wants on it.

96
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,318
She and Chase are practically
living together.

97
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,489
What did you just order?

98
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,033
An omelet.

99
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,202
Since when do you
pass on the swine?

100
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:12,582
And wheat toast? Might as well eat
a sheet of sandpaper.

101
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,877
Yes, but I don't like eating the
same thing two days in a row.

102
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,713
Your bro's nurse
not loving the love handles?

103
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,715
I'm just not
in the mood for bacon,

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,259
and you are obviously trying to avoid
talking about Kutner,

105
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,929
which is odd because you spent a whole
week obsessing about why...

106
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,098
He's no longer on my team.

107
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,641
I'm sorry he's
no longer on my team.

108
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,518
There's nothing else
to talk about.

109
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,606
You're wearing the watch he gave you
for Secret Santa.

110
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,650
Five functions,
including a stopwatch

111
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,361
to time how long it takes you
to ask me if I'm okay.

112
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,822
You gonna order?

113
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,159
Not hungry.

114
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,040
It's just weird.
She's brought cases before,

115
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,875
but he's never made her
run the tests.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,795
Maybe he's looking for someone to mother
him after what happened.

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,254
The only kind of
mothering House wants

118
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,257
involves a bullwhip, leather diapers
and a credit card.

119
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,677
Mommy's home.

120
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,558
Test made the patient lose
his lunch, but his calorics are normal,

121
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,924
his inner ear is fine
and he still can't balance himself.

122
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,729
How many normal test
results do we need

123
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,731
to know the patient's
a granola-filled phony?

124
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,483
He's not lying
about his symptoms.

125
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,729
And you know this because...

126
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,778
She changed her shoes.

127
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,739
If he was faking, he'd have vomited
on the other side of the bed.

128
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,827
Sparring with the police and chaining
yourself up for days can cause stress.

129
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,592
Stress screws with
the heart and arteries.

130
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,956
Carotid atherosclerosis
could cause a loss of balance.

131
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,291
Wouldn't show up on CT or MRI.

132
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,294
It could also be our
only warning before a massive stroke.

133
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,839
Do a Holter
and a carotid doppler,

134
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,716
see if his heart skips
for more than the Spotted Owl.

135
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:50,429
Although I didn't
say "we," if I had...

136
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,903
Sorry if this is
screwing up the test.

137
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,407
Been hiccupping a lot lately,
but not as bad as this.

138
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,659
How much is a lot?
And how long is lately?

139
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,786
It's been on and off
for about a week.

140
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,830
Maybe a few hours a day.

141
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,832
Did you tell the doctors
in Philly about it?

142
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,877
They didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

143
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,134
Hey, so we're still
leaving tomorrow, aren't we?

144
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,553
I'm not sure.

145
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,848
The referring doctors didn't realize
that his hiccups were...

146
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,016
HICCUPS?

147
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,227
With this duration and intensity,
most likely pathological,

148
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,062
and it could mean it's serious.

149
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,690
Are you avoiding me?

150
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:43,941
No.

151
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,902
So, I shouldn't be
at all concerned

152
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,446
that you're treating another
doctor's patient for hiccups

153
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,532
instead of going on
the vacation I spent a week planning?

154
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,663
There is a reason I need to stay
with this case a while longer,

155
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,875
but I can't tell you
what it is.

156
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:06,797
So, you admit you lied to me,
now you're asking me to trust you.

157
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,634
Yes.

158
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,722
Okay-

159
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,983
No sign of heart
or arterial problems,

160
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,194
but he's been hiccupping
on and off for over a week.

161
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,657
Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back
to your shift at the ER,

162
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:35,342
except, as far as the ER is concerned,
you're on vacation, right?

163
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,995
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned
about the patient.

164
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,206
Explains why you ditched Chase
and came to the differentials,

165
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,371
not why you ran the tests.

166
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,959
You told me to.

167
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,044
Well, I'm not your boss,

168
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,087
something you usually
take great pleasure in pointing out.

169
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:49,257
Hey, you don't still
have the hots for me, do you?

170
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,678
I care about the patient and I care
about the people who work on your team,

171
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,221
they've been through
a lot lately.

172
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,431
- I just thought I...
- Was Florence Nightingale

173
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,725
and you're gonna nurse us back
to spiritual and mental oneness.

174
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,571
That would make sense if we were having
this conversation a week ago.

175
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,188
Think what you want,
that I'm here to get a job,

176
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,232
that I'm here to wrap you
in swaddling clothes.

177
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,528
Problem is, I think neither.
Because neither makes sense.

178
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,949
The only thing
that does, doesn't.

179
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,710
Pathological hiccups plus inability
to balance, go.

180
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,796
What she said.

181
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,424
Brain would connect the two.

182
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,927
It could if Cameron
hadn't already CT'd his head.

183
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,971
Empty as her
boyfriend's calendar.

184
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,015
What does this have
to do with Chase?

185
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,641
- Nothing.
- Not sure yet.

186
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,185
Patient is
on a jihad against commercial flowers,

187
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,645
he's picketed
several nurseries.

188
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,731
Organophosphate poisoning
can cause both hiccups and...

189
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,774
No GI problems,
no hypersalivation.

190
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,943
It's possible it's not
connected to a protest.

191
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,738
MS wouldn't show on the CT,
and his name is Swanson.

192
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,866
Scandinavians have an increased
susceptibility to MS.

193
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,035
Better theory than,
"He's faking it."

194
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,372
The clogs have it.
Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.

195
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,045
I guess we'll just
continue to twiddle our thumbs.

196
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,964
God, I hope that's a euphemism.

197
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,257
How am I supposed to
do a lumbar puncture

198
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,925
on a patient with
intractable hiccups?

199
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:18,262
I'm trying to figure out
what that could be a euphemism for.

200
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,015
You'll find a way.

201
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,983
You're not worried House is gonna be
pissed you're helping me do the test?

202
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,152
He said find a way,
and you did.

203
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,280
How do you think
House is doing?

204
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,823
That why you're here?

205
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,325
Yeah.

206
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,869
No, it isn't.

207
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,122
Even if House was messed up
by Kutner's suicide, it wouldn't matter.

208
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,334
He already thinks
life is nasty, brutish and long,

209
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,003
and misery helps
his diagnostic skills.

210
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,173
All of which you know,
so, why are you here?

211
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,300
Which answer would you believe?

212
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,677
If you want Kutner's place,
it's fine by me.

213
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,722
I could use someone else
with the stones to stand up to House.

214
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,768
But you've got to know that's gonna blow
up your relationship with Chase.

215
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,604
All I did was postpone
a three-day trip.

216
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,606
With Chase, to be with House.

217
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,862
- What are you doing?
- Ordering IV chlorpromazine.

218
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,656
This could still be
neurological.

219
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,658
You can cloud
his mental status.

220
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,984
You wanna get the needle in his spine
or you wanna talk?

221
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:34,213
You and House been talking
about filling Kutner's slot?

222
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,258
Yeah, we went straight
from the funeral to Human Resources.

223
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,232
You interested
in getting back on the team?

224
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,389
I'm interested in knowing
if Cameron's interested.

225
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,475
She's been running
all the tests for House's case.

226
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,853
Well, she hasn't said
anything to me.

227
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:53,691
But I guess the referring doctor might
have asked her to keep an eye on him.

228
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,071
Do you think Cameron's
in love with House?

229
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,908
That is a ridiculous question.
She's in love with you.

230
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,037
Are you in love with House?

231
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:10,666
That is an even more
ridiculous question.

232
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,128
Two questions, zero answers.

233
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,756
I think I can
extrapolate from there.

234
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,897
Dr. House?

235
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,901
Sorry, I'm just
the zone delivery guy.

236
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,528
I'm Doug Swenson's wife.

237
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,075
His history said the environmental
kamikaze was single.

238
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,661
He probably didn't
want me to worry.

239
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,498
He told me he was in jail
with some of the other protesters.

240
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,082
Yeah, well, no worries there.

241
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:57,755
He's in jail a lot.
Not so often in the hospital.

242
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,591
I searched his e-mail, and I found
the referral to you yesterday.

243
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:04,011
You must really love your husband,
and travel by rickshaw.

244
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,263
Only took you 18 hours
to get here.

245
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:13,729
Who eats kale? It's so bland
it doesn't even taste like kale.

246
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,066
I had to find somebody to take care
of our 4-year-old son.

247
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,735
Doug's all right, isn't he?

248
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,736
I have no idea.

249
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,196
I know he's an idiot,

250
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,282
and now I've learned that he's a liar,
so we're making...

251
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,702
Who told you
that I was in here?

252
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,206
The doctor in the office next to yours
said that you might be here.

253
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,714
I got it figured out.

254
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,758
That mean we don't
need to do the LP?

255
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,678
I was talking to her.
You're not even supposed to be here.

256
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,054
You want us to stop or not?

257
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,057
What? I don't care
what you do with him.

258
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,101
You're not doing a favor
for a doctor in Philly,

259
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,020
you're doing a favor
for an oncologist in North Jersey.

260
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,730
I'm spying on you for Wilson?

261
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,233
Spying, pre-emptive
grief counseling...

262
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:02,111
Wilson sees you 10 times more than I do,
he's a better liar,

263
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,780
and he wouldn't have
to cancel a vacation to do it.

264
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,243
Good points. Also doesn't
explain the diet.

265
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,704
What does any of this
have to do with my husband?

266
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,163
Nothing.

267
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,043
Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag, or did
you keep your maiden name?

268
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,462
- He's married?
- Yep. Got a kid, too.

269
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,840
Double threat,
ecu-freak and deadbeat dad.

270
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:23,841
House!

271
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,760
- Sorry, parentally challenged.
- No, his neck.

272
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,807
It's torticollis,
reaction to the chlorpromazine.

273
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,684
That's not just a spasm,
it's swollen.

274
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,563
Crunchy.

275
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,775
It's definitely not MS.

276
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,153
Crunching sounds were caused by an air
leak between his lungs.

277
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,154
The leak in his mediastinum

278
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,780
could've been caused
by prolonged hiccups.

279
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,226
More likely it was
the neck spasm.

280
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,643
Most likely
it was there all along.

281
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,827
We just didn't notice
until the other symptoms made it worse.

282
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,122
So, what causes loss of balance,
pathological hiccups,

283
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,124
and a hole in
his Gloria Steinem?

284
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,335
He was protesting
a lumber mill last fall.

285
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,337
Sarcoid's been linked
to pine forests.

286
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,213
No, his AC levels are normal.

287
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:05,132
Progressive systemic sclerosis?

288
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,009
Guy practically lives
in industrial waste sites.

289
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,594
If a solvent got absorbed
through his lungs,

290
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,347
caused
an autoimmune firestorm...

291
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,350
Start him on IV methylprednisolone
for systemic sclerosis.

292
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,101
Do a full work-up to confirm.

293
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,020
- By myself?
- Without yourself.

294
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,691
Grab a bat. Grab some pine.

295
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,137
Time to bring in
the first string.

296
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,533
Why?

297
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:35,162
You obviously want to be here.
I can't figure out why.

298
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,873
So I want to see where you go
when you can't be here.

299
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,314
You know what vacation
means, right?

300
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,817
You here because of House,
Chase, or overtime issues?

301
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,904
He's very concerned.
Chase, not House.

302
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,863
If it's all right with you,

303
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,449
I'd rather communicate with Chase
by communicating with Chase.

304
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,205
Are you in love with House?

305
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,086
You are not concerned about me.

306
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,754
You're marking your territory.

307
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,799
You shouldn't be
involved with House,

308
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,592
neither should I,
neither should anyone.

309
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:36,056
You and Chase are good together.
Don't screw it up.

310
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,356
When are you gonna stop this?

311
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,774
How can you ask me to stop?

312
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,986
You're in a hospital.
You have a son.

313
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,990
The steroids ought to get him
breathing normally again.

314
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,409
But autoimmune diseases
are serious.

315
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,704
Might not be a bad idea to take
some time at home, rest up.

316
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,039
I can't just quit.

317
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,793
Do you hate us that much?

318
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,796
I love you, and I love our son.

319
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,134
But why should he matter more
than everyone else's?

320
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,802
He does.

321
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,012
Why?

322
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,016
Because he's biologically
connected to me?

323
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,435
There's no rational reason.

324
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,812
He's our son.

325
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:29,526
And he's going to need to drink clean
water and breathe clean air.

326
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm doing this for him, too.

327
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,791
Come on in, House.

328
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,378
Because who else is it going to be
at 10:30 at night?

329
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,589
And, no, thanks, I already ate.

330
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,091
I didn't ask you to dinner.

331
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,635
But you were going to.

332
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,179
And when I explained
that I'd eaten hours ago,

333
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,765
you were going to move on
to your real entree,

334
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,725
rifling through my kitchen.

335
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:06,647
Hmm.

336
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,066
Inviting me to
search your kitchen.

337
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,734
Means you know
that I'd find nothing,

338
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,694
or you know that
I'd find something,

339
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,073
so you're hoping that I'm gonna assume
the former and I won't bother to look.

340
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,537
Or it means it's late,
I'm tired,

341
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,081
I know you're here
to advance some paranoid theory

342
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,959
based on a single egg-white omelet,
and I'd like to get it over with

343
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,335
so we can both go to sleep.

344
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,795
Your single-omelet theory

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,841
conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll
you had for lunch today,

346
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,009
a vegetable
and grain gag-a-thon.

347
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,555
The Warren Commission found no evidence
of a second lunch,

348
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,307
possibly because it was stolen
from the doctors' lounge.

349
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,351
You're not getting any fatter,

350
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,562
your medical records
were clean.

351
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:47,855
You checked my...

352
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,233
You're alone tonight,
so it's Kutner.

353
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,654
How could Kutner
have any conceivable...

354
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,865
Your patients live,
your patients die,

355
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,951
you float above it all
like a medical colossus.

356
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,536
But a fellow doctor dies...

357
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,829
That's brilliant.

358
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,665
Kutner was a wake-up call
that if I didn't eat healthier,

359
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,792
I might kill myself.

360
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,836
Mortality is mortality.

361
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,842
And ice cream is ice cream.

362
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,471
Full-fat content.
Quadruple-fat content.

363
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,769
Stuff you haven't eaten
just proves you haven't eaten it.

364
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,898
You were hoping
for evidence of stuff I have eaten?

365
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:31,983
First door on the right.

366
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,157
Excruciating pain
in his left leg.

367
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,783
Acute onset,
about 10 minutes ago.

368
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,827
What are you doing to him?

369
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,206
I assume they were checking
for vascular pulsation.

370
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,208
Either it's negative
or he's a big wuss.

371
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,960
It's not a tumor
or an aneurysm.

372
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,255
Metabolic bone disease?

373
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,590
Bone density's normal.

374
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,884
But the bone covering
might not be.

375
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:02,471
If it's osteomyelitis, an infection
eating away at his periosteum...

376
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,307
Explains the pain. Odds are it's
a subclinical infection

377
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,352
that we made worse
with the steroids we gave him.

378
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,772
Start him on IV antibiotics, x-ray
his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.

379
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,058
Cameron's already
done a full set of lower body x-rays.

380
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,194
Infection obviously flared,
do them again.

381
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,949
Even if I had changed my diet,

382
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,369
what possible reason
could I have for hiding it from you?

383
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,963
Ankle, tibia, fibula,
all look normal.

384
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,840
No inflammation,
no signs of osteo.

385
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,970
Hang in there,
we're almost done.

386
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,892
You and your wife,
you talk about stuff?

387
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,227
Sex.

388
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,937
No. Anything else.

389
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,063
Money.

390
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,401
I'm gonna go way out
on a limb here.

391
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,903
Foreman not a Chatty Cathy?

392
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:04,908
Normally, it doesn't matter.
Last week, it did.

393
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,832
You want to date men,
good chance talking won't be...

394
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,004
His femur's fractured.

395
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,423
That's impossible. It's the hardest bone
in the body.

396
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,299
And he broke it lying in bed.

397
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,310
How can you have a broken femur
without so much as a bruise?

398
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,521
Whatever broke it
had to do it from within.

399
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,398
Osteogenesis imperfecta?

400
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,963
Brittle bones
wouldn't cause hiccups,

401
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,527
plus we'd have seen
abnormal coloring in the sclerae.

402
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,945
Which leaves cancer.

403
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,947
Since when does bone cancer
cause hiccups?

404
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,907
Which means it's
not bone cancer.

405
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,951
Or it's not cancer.

406
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,204
House is right. It'd be hard to find
a guy outside Chernobyl

407
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,373
who'd been exposed
to more carcinogens,

408
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,043
pesticide plants,
nuclear waste sites.

409
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,463
Tell Chase to repair the break.

410
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,214
You two prep him for chemo.

411
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,217
You want to blast him with chemo for a
cancer we don't even know he has?

412
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:08,055
No. I want to blast him with chemo for
a cancer that explains the symptoms.

413
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,605
Lntramedullary nail.

414
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,274
Hold on.

415
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,735
That your House imitation?
Some late-breaking epiphany?

416
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,863
Just need you to get
a bone biopsy before you insert the pin.

417
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,073
For a broken leg?

418
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,866
House is prepping him
for chemo.

419
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,409
Thought it
might be worth checking for cancer

420
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,995
before pumping him full of poison.

421
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,705
Does Cameron agree with House?

422
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,582
Cameron's not on
the case anymore.

423
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,126
Oh.

424
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,010
Still enjoying your
day off, I see.

425
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,720
Why are you prepping him for chemo?

426
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,265
The more interesting
question is, why do you care?

427
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,809
You're not even sure
that it's...

428
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,228
What I mean is,
why do you care from here?

429
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,833
You can monitor
the patient from home.

430
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,064
What's the difference
between here and home?

431
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,108
You're not at my home.

432
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,567
This has nothing to do with...

433
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,985
Any other differences?

434
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,403
Hmm.

435
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,156
There's less medical equipment,
more training bras,

436
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,076
and more Vegemite sandwiches.

437
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,787
Actually, technically,
right now Chase is here,

438
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,914
but that's because I called him
and you didn't know that,

439
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,919
and it's irrelevant to my point,
which is you and Chase are over.

440
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,964
You are wrong.

441
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,051
You decided that his single drawer
of clothes is one drawer too many.

442
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,469
But you don't have
the guts to tell him,

443
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,766
so you're emotionally walking away
instead of actually walking away,

444
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,103
which is stupid because only one
of those is good for your heart.

445
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,737
He's gonna ask me to marry him.

446
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,994
I was looking for
some thick socks, found the ring.

447
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,582
And you want to say no.

448
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,626
So I circle right back
to his single drawer of clothes...

449
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,504
I don't want to say anything.
I don't want him to ask.

450
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,883
Not now.

451
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:13,930
Kutner... We're all
a little freaked out.

452
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,517
We go home, we just want
to hug someone.

453
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,936
We just want to know
everything's gonna be okay.

454
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,985
I don't want him to propose
just because he's scared.

455
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:30,864
Oh.

456
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,334
She's got a headache, fever,
she's completely exhausted.

457
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,753
Tell him about
your chest, honey.

458
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,505
Her breasts are really tender.

459
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,843
You guys have a hot tub?

460
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:52,802
No.

461
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,179
So you must go
to the gym a lot?

462
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,555
Not in years.

463
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,268
But maybe when you
travel on business, you zip on down

464
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,145
to that complimentary
hotel spa.

465
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,355
No.

466
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,482
Sorry, did you just say yes?

467
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,192
What the hell is
wrong with her?

468
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,237
Got a minute?

469
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,030
He doesn't.
What's wrong with her?

470
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,116
Sorry, I'm sure she's
got a medical crisis,

471
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,495
and I need more time to figure out some
leading questions for your wife.

472
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,665
What's going on with Cameron?

473
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,709
She doesn't want back on my team,
and she doesn't want to jump me.

474
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,171
Okay-

475
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,631
What?

476
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,719
You ask a question, I rule out two
possibilities, and you're satisfied?

477
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,931
That means you don't
want an answer,

478
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,684
you just wanted to know
there wasn't a particular answer.

479
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,811
Either you were worried
that she wanted back on my team

480
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,522
or you were worried
she wanted back on me.

481
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,565
This isn't
a medical crisis, is it?

482
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:52,362
Could be. A lot of STDs
hang in the balance.

483
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,913
I give up.
Vinegar compresses four times a day.

484
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,791
Any chance I could
just leave it at that?

485
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,587
No. Pseudomonas folliculitis.

486
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,966
It's a skin infection from
crowded and contaminated hot tubs,

487
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:16,553
which you obviously use,
but not with your husband.

488
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,141
Tried to help a sister out.

489
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,773
The nuclei were
all normal-sized,

490
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,984
bone cells are
well-differentiated.

491
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,028
No dysplasia means no cancer.

492
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,571
That's good, isn't it?

493
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,739
We hope so,

494
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,742
although it also means we still
have no idea what caused the break.

495
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,368
How does it feel?

496
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,578
It hurts.

497
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,070
Is it supposed
to look like that?

498
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,462
No, but it's probably just residual
bleeding from the surgery.

499
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,088
We should be able to...

500
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,887
Need two units of FFP,
right away.

501
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,347
Oh, my God. What's happening?

502
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,556
He's bleeding out.

503
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,063
Means it's gotta be cancer.

504
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,523
It's gotta be, except it's not.
The biopsy was negative.

505
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,525
Biopsies can be wrong,
symptoms can't.

506
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,818
All signs point to cancer,

507
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,446
but you can't blast a cancer
you can't find.

508
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,575
Sure you can. Prep him for
total-body irradiation.

509
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,619
You do realize that's insane.

510
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,914
Not unless you think the cancer's
cleverly hiding outside his body.

511
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,457
Steroids already weakened
his immune system.

512
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:30,251
That much radiation will kill him
before it kills the cancer.

513
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,420
And if he doesn't have cancer,
we could cause one,

514
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,214
or destroy his
immune system altogether.

515
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,019
The guy could die
from an infected toenail.

516
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,250
So you'd rather do nothing,
just let him die on his own?

517
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,844
I'd rather make
his cancer worse.

518
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:47,018
Give him insulin-like growth factor,
make any tumor or malignancy grow.

519
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,978
Grows big enough,
we can find it.

520
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,665
That's like pouring
gasoline on a fire.

521
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,941
At least total-body irradiation
is an actual treatment.

522
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,364
His idea is better. Pour away.

523
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,714
I've lost my mojo.

524
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,801
Have you retraced your steps?

525
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,719
Does your cleaning lady
check your pockets before...

526
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,723
I was clueless about Kutner,
I was wrong about Cameron,

527
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,770
Taub just came up with an idea that I
should have seen long before he did.

528
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:33,314
No one saw anything
coming with Kutner,

529
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,066
you hardly ever see
Cameron anymore,

530
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,778
and you hired Taub to come up with ideas
that you wouldn't have come up with.

531
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,489
And I have no idea
why you're eating carrots.

532
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,782
Good.

533
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:46,828
I'm losing my mind,
all you got to say is, "Good"?

534
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,706
House, a guy you worked
with for two years, who you mentored,

535
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:53,293
and, yes, possibly even cared about,
just blew his brains out.

536
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,713
You can't find the reason,
can't find the meaning in it,

537
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,006
because sometimes
there isn't any.

538
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,217
Sometimes this is all there is.

539
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,887
You should be losing it.

540
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,890
You'd be crazy
not to be off your game.

541
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,725
But your mojo's
right where you left it.

542
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,436
Just keep playing with it.

543
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,523
I gotta go. Help yourself.

544
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,614
I know this is a tough process.

545
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,200
At the first sign
of any tumors or masses we can...

546
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,118
Start saying prayers?

547
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,884
- It's gonna be okay. Once we can...
- No, it is not gonna be okay.

548
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,414
You're growing his cancer.

549
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,416
This isn't the doctors' fault.

550
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,713
I've exposed myself to a lot
of bad stuff. I knew the risks.

551
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,136
I want my life
to mean something,

552
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,055
and if that means
I'm destined to...

553
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,436
He's in V-tach, and no pulse.
Grab the paddles.

554
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,854
Oh, God.

555
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,692
Charging. Clear.

556
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,487
Charging. Clear.

557
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,076
I've been looking for you.

558
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,286
And I've been
thinking about you.

559
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,750
Just hadn't reached
the looking stage yet.

560
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,252
Which is the problem.

561
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,257
You asked for a day,
I gave you two.

562
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:26,094
You told me you had a secret you
couldn't share, I respected that.

563
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:27,554
Now I don't know what's worse,

564
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,764
blowing off our vacation
to hang around House,

565
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,209
or continuing to blow it off when
he won't hang around you.

566
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,893
If you think I'm the
least bit interested in House...

567
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,521
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

568
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,983
I know this looks bad and...

569
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,986
I don't care how it looks,
I care what it is.

570
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,321
And you're not
telling me what it is.

571
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,782
I'm trying to trust you, but...

572
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,371
I just...

573
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,960
I need a little more time.

574
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,923
No.

575
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:10,471
This has nothing
to do with House.

576
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:15,893
Yeah, well, it has nothing to do
with me either, not anymore.

577
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,694
Let me know
when I can come pick up my things.

578
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,129
Nothing on the echo.
We drew a troponin level,

579
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,964
no signs of
myocardial ischemia.

580
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,257
All the tests were normal.

581
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,763
Loss of balance, pathological hiccups,
air leak between the lungs,

582
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,016
broken femur,
now tachycardia. Go.

583
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,522
Come on, give me something.
Give me a bad idea,

584
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,483
maybe I can turn it
into a good one.

585
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:13,576
Fine. Open him up,
put in a defibrillator.

586
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,036
That's permanent and risky.

587
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,455
We don't even know what,
if anything, is wrong with his heart.

588
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,748
Redo all the tests.

589
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:22,460
In the meantime, open him up,
put in a defibrillator,

590
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,296
so he can live long enough
for you to finish the tests.

591
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:44,190
Balance organs, nerves,
lungs, bones, heart.

592
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:49,278
Things you use
to make bratwurst?

593
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,948
There's no sign of infection,

594
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:54,742
it's not a metabolic
or autoimmune disease.

595
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,370
It's definitely not cancer.
I think.

596
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,830
Definitely not cancer.

597
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,292
Aren't you gonna pick?

598
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:05,378
I'm thinking.
Is there a ticking clock?

599
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,298
You already put your money in.

600
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,467
You never do that
until you decide.

601
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:12,760
That's very observant of you.

602
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:13,925
Too bad you distracted me.

603
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:17,473
Now I'm thinking I might
change my mind.

604
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,603
There's nothing healthy
in that machine.

605
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,397
No, there's not.

606
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:33,197
Gummi Bears.
You hate Gummi Bears.

607
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,576
People can change.

608
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,077
No.

609
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,871
And more importantly,
I hate them.

610
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,665
Oh, fine.
Then I won't offer you any.

611
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,670
You manipulative bitch.

612
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,008
You're not suddenly
eating healthy because you want to.

613
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:55,344
You're eating healthy
because you know I don't want to.

614
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,347
I've been mooching food
for 10 years,

615
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:02,435
so either something started bothering
you this week or you're...

616
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,105
Screwing with you.
It needed to be done.

617
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:10,568
After Amber died, I withdrew,
tried to change everything,

618
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,488
hoping I'd sort it out,
find some deeper truth.

619
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:14,739
It was a mistake.

620
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,408
I should have gone back
to normal, to here and now.

621
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,994
Because that's all
we can ever really count on.

622
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,873
Things need to get back
to normal in your life.

623
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:28,211
And what could be more normal
than me screwing with you,

624
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,879
and you figuring it out?

625
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,216
You manipulative bitch.

626
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:52,527
We need to put in
a cardioverter defibrillator.

627
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,655
It'll keep your heart beating
while we keep looking.

628
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,656
What does that mean?

629
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:59,951
It means, even if
we figure this out,

630
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:04,413
you'll have to stop protesting anywhere
not near a hospital.

631
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,669
Hi. Got a few questions.

632
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,796
We're about to start doing...

633
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,965
A hopefully pointless
medical procedure.

634
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,177
Your life and my mojo
hang in the balance.

635
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:22,640
Pesticides are evil, which means that
commercial flowers are doused in evil,

636
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:26,227
but plant life is
nature's answer to evil.

637
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,604
So you have a garden.

638
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,565
No. We live in an apartment.

639
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,152
- A window box then?
- No.

640
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:37,864
Potted plants?

641
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,615
Nothing.
The commercial growers...

642
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,020
Yeah, they're evil.
Yeah, got it.

643
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,245
House, I really don't think
we have time for this.

644
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,708
Your marriage sucks.

645
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,211
Thank you.

646
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,464
All marriages suck.
Your marriage sucks.

647
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,174
- No.
- I love her.

648
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,303
He loves a tree in Oregon
more than he loves you,

649
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,096
but he can't have sex with it.

650
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,390
Unless it's
that slutty oak outside Portland.

651
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,392
You want to get to your point?

652
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:07,810
She's had enough.

653
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,938
She's gonna leave, maybe she's just
not putting out, whatever.

654
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,190
You gotta make it right.
Right away.

655
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:16,694
You gotta compromise
that precious flower principle.

656
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,322
Never.

657
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:22,867
Once.

658
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,625
Three weeks ago.
Our anniversary.

659
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,210
I missed the dinner
to be at that rally.

660
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:37,214
You planned it for months.
You were mad, really mad.

661
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:42,303
I bought you flowers.
I brought them home.

662
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,597
You were gone,
so was your suitcase.

663
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:48,225
I tossed them,
bought you the earrings.

664
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:50,436
Roses?

665
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,316
Yes.

666
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,235
You have sporotrichosis.

667
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,571
It's an infection
from the thorn of the rose,

668
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:04,659
which by any other name
is still a cheap marital aid.

669
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,202
The flowers are what gave me...

670
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:09,288
Lesion on your eighth
cranial nerve knocks out your balance,

671
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,375
another on your phrenic nerve
gives you serial hiccups.

672
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,661
We then spread it to your bones
and heart with steroids

673
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,504
and insulin-like growth factor.

674
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,631
Please tell us that
this is good news.

675
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,217
It's good news for him,

676
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,469
it's good news for
future generations.

677
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,722
It's crappy news for you.
He's gonna be fine.

678
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,350
And he'll never
doubt himself again.

679
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,193
There you go.

680
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:45,992
Damn. I was hoping
to interrupt something.

681
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,789
Your favor's repaid,
patient's cured.

682
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:55,418
He's already packing for another
Earth Day extravaganza next week.

683
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:58,337
He almost died. He can't take a few days
at home with his family?

684
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:02,633
People only change after a trauma if
they wanted to change before the trauma.

685
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,636
Or if they've watched too many
After School Specials.

686
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,929
You talking about Chase?

687
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,222
I'm talking about you.

688
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,392
You lost husband number one,

689
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,310
no surprise that the death
of a colleague

690
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,439
would make you question
another long-term lease.

691
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:17,898
You teaching
commitment classes?

692
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,483
'Cause I thought
you were too busy with your lecture...

693
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,277
I'm sure that was
going to be hysterical.

694
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,445
Let me just give you
the Cliff Notes.

695
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,948
Don't try to dump him
by dumping cases on me.

696
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,118
I told you, I never
wanted to dump Chase.

697
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,454
Absolutely.
You wanted him to dump you.

698
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,457
It's totally different,
much less guilt.

699
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,501
Either way, you're out
of reasons to avoid him.

700
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:41,380
Kutner was a pretty
dumb one to begin with.

701
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,890
I should never have
postponed our vacation.

702
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,145
I should never have planned it.

703
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,901
I found the ring in your sock.

704
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:12,161
I didn't want you to propose
out of some sort of knee-jerk reaction

705
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:13,662
to what happened to Kutner.

706
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,751
Well, I guess you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

707
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,503
I'm not. I...

708
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,467
I don't care how it happens,
I just want it to happen.

709
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:33,099
Are you proposing to me?

710
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:37,228
I'm proposing that

711
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,815
you propose to me.

712
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:45,694
After I broke up with you?
After you ruined my planned proposal?

713
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,821
You expect me to...

714
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,531
I'm not expecting.

715
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,159
I'm hoping.

716
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:22,106
Yes.

717
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:57,868
Solved another case,

718
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,829
busted Wilson.

719
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:07,044
Looks like you're not
losing it after all.
