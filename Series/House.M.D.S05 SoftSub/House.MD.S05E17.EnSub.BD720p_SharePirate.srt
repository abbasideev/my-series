1
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,557
Am I going to have
to give a speech?

2
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,226
You're the publisher,
can't you do it?

3
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,019
I can warm them up,

4
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,689
but you're gonna have to get over
this fear of public speaking

5
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:23,149
before the book tour.

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,195
Everybody! Can I have
your attention? Thank you.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,531
Tim has a few words to say.

8
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:31,991
There you go, Tim.
They're warmed up.

9
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,286
Well.

10
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,790
What do you say
at a time like this?

11
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,084
Seriously, what do you say?

12
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,962
You could thank
people for coming.

13
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:45,797
Thank you, Nick.

14
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,133
Actually, I'm always
thanking Nick.

15
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,302
A man famous not only for
his ruthless editor's pen,

16
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:54,806
but his patient handholding
of crazy authors.

17
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,331
You'd think that
after three novels,

18
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:59,144
I'd start to develop
a little confidence, but...

19
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:02,313
For a book like this,
we are happy to supply the confidence.

20
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,690
Bestseller.

21
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,026
Well, that's not
going to happen.

22
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:08,111
What?

23
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,196
Come on. Short stories
don't make money.

24
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,240
Short stories weren't making
money back in 1908.

25
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,825
You'd have to be
mathematically illiterate

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,201
to think they'd do
as well as a novel.

27
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:19,831
Okay, Nick, let's step away from the
champagne before somebody gets hurt.

28
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,668
You slaved over this book
right next to me.

29
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,233
Why would Northrop even publish it if
it's only going to tank?

30
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,257
Have you failed to notice
you're our star author?

31
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,885
Obviously, Elaine wouldn't
want to offend you.

32
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,011
Honey...

33
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:40,852
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't know why I said that.

34
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,020
He's joking.

35
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,689
Nick knows as well as anyone
what you have done is art.

36
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,691
So is folding paper
into animal shapes,

37
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,359
but you don't expect
to make a living off it.

38
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:49,725
What the hell
is wrong with you?

39
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,780
You really think someone who goes
through 10 assistants a year

40
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,032
and doesn't return
her own children's phone calls

41
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,659
would give a damn about the state
of the American short story?

42
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,411
Please, be quiet.

43
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,668
I think something's wrong.

44
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,296
That title was a mistake, too.

45
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:10,548
People are going to
compare you to Salinger.

46
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,760
And boy, are you going
to come up short in that one.

47
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:19,849
Honey?

48
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,853
Call 911. Help! We need help!

49
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:00,139
Cameron brought
this up from the ER.

50
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:02,642
Doesn't look like
a friendship bracelet.

51
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,477
It's Phineas Gage.

52
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,403
The most famous case study
in medical history.

53
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,477
You're telling me
this patient got a rail road spike

54
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,845
drilled through
his frontal lobe?

55
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,902
No, no trauma, but he does have
frontal lobe disinhibition.

56
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:13,945
Just like Gage.

57
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,790
Gage was a different person
after the spike.

58
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,365
Argumentative, impulsive.

59
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,326
Whereas our guy became
a different person after chardonnay.

60
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,120
He was sober when
they brought him in.

61
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,664
There's also the nosebleed,
the collapse.

62
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,165
- MRI show anything?
- Nothing.

63
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,543
Good. What fun would that be?

64
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:30,587
So the tumor's not in
the cool neighborhood.

65
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,963
It's cool
neighborhood adjacent.

66
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,923
A well-placed tumor
in the nasal cavity,

67
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,550
eroding into the brain
could do the damage.

68
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,887
Go stick a scope up
Phineas' nose and see what you find.

69
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,897
Daddy, I'm always going to win if you
keep telling me what your cards are.

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,525
Then suppose I tell you...
While I tickle you!

71
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,986
Mr. Greenwald, I'm Dr. Taub
and this is Dr. Kutner.

72
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,322
We're here for another test.
Sorry about that.

73
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,949
You don't look sorry.

74
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,160
Um. No offense.

75
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,287
Although you do look
kind of cheerful.

76
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,705
It's a little creepy.
Should I want a doctor

77
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,332
who's
excited about how sick I am?

78
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,626
- I'm not...
- We're going to put this up your nose,

79
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,461
scan for any problems.

80
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,839
I can assure you that we are completely
unexcited about that.

81
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,591
Excuse me, sweetie.

82
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,843
She has an auditory
processing disability.

83
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,638
Marika Balika.
You have to get off the bed.

84
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:26,059
This might be
slightly uncomfortable.

85
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,019
Honey, do you mind
if I step out?

86
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:29,437
I have to make sure
the final arrangements

87
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,147
are in place
for the breast cancer walk.

88
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah. You do that.

89
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:36,986
I'll pretend to be macho while a guy
stuffs three feet of plastic up my nose.

90
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,197
It's too bad
it's not your nose.

91
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,282
Lots more room to maneuver.

92
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,494
I guess the walk
can wait 10 minutes.

93
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,579
Or in a sensible world,
even longer.

94
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,499
Just how does tying up traffic for
six hours stop breast cancer?

95
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,209
You know how it works,
people donate.

96
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,712
Why not spend six hours building houses
for Habitat for Humanity?

97
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,173
Or is it wrong to help two groups
of people at once?

98
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,884
I'll bet there are those
who have breast cancer and no home.

99
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,803
It's my job, Nick.

100
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,513
You walked yourself last year.

101
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,639
To be supportive.

102
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:08,226
Because I knew you
wouldn't have sex with me if I didn't.

103
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,312
I'm going to make my call.

104
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,191
Make this go away.

105
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,987
God, that honker
really is huge, isn't it?

106
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,075
Wednesday night.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,828
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie
versus the Incinerator.

108
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,496
I can't.

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,915
Let me rephrase.
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie...

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,501
I understand
Monster Truck code.

111
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,711
Do you understand "can't"?

112
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,422
Not when it follows
Low-Down-Blue-Meanie.

113
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,216
Is the world coming
to an end Tuesday night?

114
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,760
- Otherwise, Wednesday...
- All right.

115
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,680
It's not "can't,"
it's "don't want to."

116
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:49,684
The fact is,
I just don't like monster trucks.

117
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,103
Yes, you do.

118
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,229
No, I don't.

119
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,106
You've always liked
monster trucks.

120
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,441
No, you've always liked them.

121
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,735
I've tolerated them.

122
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,946
Seriously, I can only watch
so many hyped-up dune buggies

123
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,742
crush so many motor homes without
feeling the urge to go see La Bohéme.

124
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,702
And I hate opera, too.

125
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,413
What are you hiding?

126
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,166
I'm not hiding it,
I'm saying it loud and proud.

127
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,792
Death to monster trucks.

128
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,627
No nasal cancer.

129
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,087
And no marriage either,

130
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,423
if our patient keeps saying everything
that comes into his head

131
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,550
without regard
for the consequences.

132
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,844
You always led me to believe
you were one of a kind.

133
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,055
Luckily, jerkiness is
a temporary condition for this guy.

134
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,639
No, it's not.

135
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,350
We may be able to fix his impulse
to say his thoughts out loud,

136
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,561
but he's always gonna be
the guy who thinks them.

137
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,314
But he's also
gonna be the guy who doesn't say them.

138
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,858
If he spent his whole life
constructing a nice-guy persona,

139
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,028
isn't that as much
who he really is as anything else?

140
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,822
You would argue that.
You're all persona.

141
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,034
I agree with Wilson.
This guy's a Harry Potter.

142
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,412
The sorting hat was going to put Harry
in Slytherin, based on his nature.

143
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,748
He refused,
so he ended up in Gryffindor.

144
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,041
Through choice.

145
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,377
There's damage somewhere
in his brain. Go find it.

146
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,881
Are you sure you understand?

147
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,634
No, I'm lying. Except, I can't.

148
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,428
You ask me questions.

149
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:11,015
While I talk, you look at my brain
activity to see where it's screwed up,

150
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,392
then you're gonna
cut the screwed up part out to test it.

151
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,394
It's depressing,
but it's not rocket science.

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,854
I think he understands.

153
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,023
I don't mean to be abrasive.

154
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,776
Especially since
you're such a pleasure to imagine naked.

155
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,528
- Again, sorry.
- It's okay.

156
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,822
Thank you for understanding.

157
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,573
I'd do you, though.

158
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,742
Really, my apologies.
This stuff just comes out.

159
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,869
- It's okay.
- House paged?

160
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,040
Whoa. I would do her in a minute
with fudge and a cherry on top.

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,418
Would someone please explain
to this woman?

162
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,670
There's only so many
apologies I can...

163
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,505
He has frontal
lobe disinhibition.

164
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,841
I've already embarrassed
myself with one doctor.

165
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,092
Whom I am at this moment

166
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:50,304
imagining with you in a king-sized bed
with a mirror on the ceiling.

167
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,474
I am so, so sorry.

168
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,319
But if I couldn't have
both of you together,

169
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,562
you would definitely be
my first choice.

170
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,646
Where's House?

171
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,531
It's like trying not
to think of an elephant.

172
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,360
Not that you're an elephant. Your
breasts, in fact, are all Homo sapiens.

173
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,405
- House isn't here.
- He wouldn't have paged me

174
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,074
if he couldn't watch
and enjoy the...

175
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:19,250
Your tush is like
the pistons in a Ferrari.

176
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,511
You're welcome.

177
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,013
That was for my benefit?

178
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:33,931
- You're 40 years old...
- Thirty eight.

179
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,099
And the administrator
of a hospital.

180
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,309
Dean of medicine.

181
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,019
People don't get
personal with you.

182
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,980
Except for me, and you dismiss me
as a jerk who's jerking you around.

183
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,773
But that guy can
only tell the truth.

184
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,776
And he prefers your body to that
of a smoking young hottie.

185
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:49,614
So that was your way of saying
I look good today?

186
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,618
You didn't get
the slightest kick out of that?

187
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,454
Don't be ridiculous, House.

188
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,086
I hope you know
your pistons are second to none.

189
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,548
I'm okay. I'm not jealous
of Cuddy's pistons.

190
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,217
Starting baseline activation.

191
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,552
You sure? You looked upset.

192
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,763
What he was saying
was obnoxious.

193
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,139
You've never been
called attractive?

194
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,726
He didn't call me attractive,
he cast me in his mental porno.

195
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:19,685
That's what "attractive" means.

196
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,562
It means
"I'm attracted to you sexually."

197
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,855
"Attracted" can also mean,

198
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,858
"I'm attracted to the whole
package, to who you are."

199
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,361
Slight elevation
at transaxial 60.

200
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,695
It could.

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,114
It never does. It's what
women choose to hear, not what men say.

202
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,992
Actually, it's exactly
what men say, if they have any brains.

203
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,369
All right, we have
enough for a baseline.

204
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,703
What can we ask him
that's indiscreet,

205
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,373
but that
he won't hate us for knowing?

206
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,376
Nick, do you vote
the same way as your wife?

207
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,794
God, no.

208
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,629
Good. He's spiking at 30.

209
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,756
She believes I voted
for Hillary Clinton in the primary,

210
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,174
and Obama in the general.

211
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,551
You're thinking
I'm secretly Republican, right?

212
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,719
Wrong.

213
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,389
I secretly don't vote ever.

214
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,393
Wait, you're 46
and you've never voted?

215
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,771
Your voice is no longer attractive
to me with that note of disapproval.

216
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,690
Although I'm sure
that will pass.

217
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,649
Look at that.

218
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,735
There's a spot on the cingulate gyrus
that's not lighting up.

219
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,570
One vote makes a difference?

220
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:12,536
Not mathematically...

221
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,531
Okay, Nick,
we've got what we need.

222
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,950
We can't biopsy that,
it's too close to the brain stem.

223
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,452
Could be neurosarcoidosis.
At least it's treatable.

224
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,829
So we give him steroids
and if we're right,

225
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:23,582
we should start seeing
his symptoms improve within half a day.

226
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,671
What are you looking at?

227
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,381
I find your strong attachment

228
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,134
to a working democracy
to be extremely sexy.

229
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,927
You smooth talker.

230
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,765
Do you think
my nose is too big?

231
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,685
Relax. He also implied
my bedside manner was a little off.

232
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,895
You don't agree
with that, right?

233
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:45,855
No.

234
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,692
No one's ever mentioned
your nose before?

235
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,985
You're a plastic surgeon.

236
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,112
- They tell me it suits my face.
- It does.

237
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,823
Maybe. Maybe that's just
the social contract.

238
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:56,948
You tell me I look great,

239
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,993
I tell you
you're a people person.

240
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,747
- How can you know the truth?
- You could ask for the truth.

241
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,116
What do you think of my nose?
Please tell me the truth.

242
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,084
It's fine, it's a nose.

243
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,795
Just proving a point.

244
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,054
Anyone sitting here?

245
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,473
Just my persona.

246
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,811
You know, it's amazing
the way people cling on to insults.

247
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,731
Or what they think are insults.

248
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,858
So that wasn't an insult?

249
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,736
I'm not suggesting that
like our patient,

250
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,780
you're hiding a dark,
sarcastic core

251
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,491
beneath a candy shell
of compulsive niceness.

252
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,951
I'm not always nice.
I'm not nice to you.

253
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:44,663
Because you know nice bores me.
Hence, still nice.

254
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:48,084
No, I'm suggesting
that you have no core.

255
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,712
You're what whoever
you're with needs you to be.

256
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,881
Okay, I guess that
could be insulting.

257
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,217
But the interesting
question is why.

258
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,761
Why do you think the world will end
in chaos and destruction

259
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,346
if you're not there to save it?

260
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,724
Because when my parents
put me in the rocket, and sent me here,

261
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,769
they said, "James, you will grow
to manhood under a yellow sun."

262
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,271
And why did you lie
about monster trucks?

263
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,439
I didn't.

264
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,525
I checked your
appointment book.

265
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,734
You've got tomorrow
night marked off,

266
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,778
but you didn't put down
what you were doing.

267
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,029
So you thought
someone might look at the book...

268
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,908
I'm playing racquetball
tomorrow night with Taub.

269
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,910
Why would you hide that?

270
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,912
Because the world
revolves around you.

271
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,372
I devote time to anyone else,

272
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,916
you'd end up stalking me
and harassing them.

273
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,043
You say that as though
it wouldn't be fun.

274
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,254
And maybe I didn't
want to rub your nose in the fact

275
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:36,590
that we'd be doing
something you can no longer do.

276
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,342
Because I'm nice.

277
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,642
I thought you said
the steroids were gonna help him!

278
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,395
Is it his heart?

279
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,939
EKG says heart's fine.

280
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,816
It's gotta be the kidneys.

281
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,776
We need to get him on dialysis.

282
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,319
Oh, God.

283
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,325
He's on dialysis
and he's stable.

284
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,036
We know
it's not systemic sclerosis.

285
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:07,538
Hey.

286
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,874
Cyrano de Berkowitz.

287
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,292
Let it go.

288
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,671
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia could
explain brain and kidney problems.

289
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,591
CBC showed normal
white blood cells.

290
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,303
So how long have you been
playing racquetball with Wilson?

291
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,138
Four or five times.

292
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,723
Could be diabetes.

293
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,516
Or a congenital
metabolic disorder.

294
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,936
Congenital disorders generally don't
wait till you're 46 to manifest.

295
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,356
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter
has a neurological condition.

296
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,860
First of all, Wilson played tennis
on his college team,

297
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,654
and you are a Jew.

298
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,781
You're not athletic.

299
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,742
Run to the end of
the hall and back, I'll time you.

300
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,661
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest
left-handed pitcher of all time.

301
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:52,791
Sandy Koufax is all you Jews
go on about, Sandy Koufax.

302
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,919
And the Holocaust. It gets old.

303
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,422
There are dozens of congenital
conditions that fit our parameters.

304
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,466
We can't spend time
gene-testing for all of them

305
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,631
especially when we're only
guessing it's congenital.

306
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,304
Is a Z-shot offensive
or defensive?

307
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,597
It's both.

308
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,766
You suspected that
was a trick question.

309
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,643
But I could have said neither.

310
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,811
Diabetes makes more sense.

311
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,731
We can narrow the testing
down to 40 likely candidates.

312
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,233
Test for peripheral
nerve damage.

313
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,400
He's got brain damage,

314
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,819
he's likely to have peripheral nerve
damage no matter what the cause.

315
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,113
Yes, that's why we should not
test him for it.

316
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,865
Test the daughter.

317
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,700
Kutner runs the nerve test.

318
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,827
Taub, you may be right
about the diabetes.

319
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,331
Take supper away from our patient
and run a glucose tolerance test.

320
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,543
Oh, and the nurses
have been working so hard,

321
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,294
you can do the blood
draws yourself.

322
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,838
They have to be done
every couple of hours.

323
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:40,798
You're punishing me

324
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,342
because you're jealous that I'm spending
time with your best friend.

325
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,677
That would be petty.

326
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:48,556
I'm punishing you because now you've
joined my best friend in lying to me.

327
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,725
Let me know when you're ready
to confess everything.

328
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,653
These can become
either hot or cold.

329
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,739
As soon as it starts to feel
uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.

330
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,616
But you don't think
there's something wrong with me.

331
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,077
No, baby.
They're testing you to help Daddy.

332
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,079
Yes. What you're doing
is very important.

333
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,290
It's like the better you do,

334
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,500
the better we know your dad is.

335
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,295
It's okay.

336
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,591
I'll start with heat.

337
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,140
I know it's not his fault.

338
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,934
I know what he says
is involuntary, but...

339
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,895
It doesn't help.

340
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,898
Inside he's still the same man.

341
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,900
Yeah, that's the problem.

342
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,153
Apparently he's been
thinking this stuff all along.

343
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,824
Whoever that same man is, it's not the
person I thought I was married to.

344
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,242
You Okay?

345
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,623
She should be feeling
something by now.

346
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:59,835
What does that mean?
Is she sick too? Marika?

347
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,046
Honey?

348
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,716
You're burned, why didn't you tell me
it started to hurt?

349
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,009
I wanted to help Daddy.

350
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,845
You said the better I do,
the better Daddy has to be.

351
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,221
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,850
I'm starving.

353
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,935
It's the only way
we can do the test.

354
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,271
Good thing it's you
and not Dr. Hadley.

355
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,857
Could you keep her
away from me?

356
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,652
I have a rich imaginative life.

357
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,446
- I'd rather not share it.
- We all have thoughts.

358
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,366
I know we all have
sexual thoughts.

359
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,950
We have ignoble thoughts.

360
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,662
I just don't want those
to be who I am to people.

361
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:35,829
Especially not to my wife.

362
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,998
I understand, I don't think it would be
fair to define me

363
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,291
by my passing thoughts.

364
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,001
My real choices are my actions.

365
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,838
And I've never done anything
to hurt her, I've never cheated.

366
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,633
You're kidding me,
you've cheated?

367
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,842
What?

368
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,052
No.

369
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,099
Why would you say that?

370
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,431
Because you look
guilty as hell.

371
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,558
Are you serious?

372
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,726
Of course you're serious.

373
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,561
Yes, everyone knows.

374
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,231
God, they must think
you're a creep.

375
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,526
They might not know,
they might be idiots.

376
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,944
I just say these things.

377
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,415
Why'd YOU page me here?

378
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,252
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition.

379
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,837
He seems to be dead.

380
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,964
Why'd YOU page me here?

381
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,300
I need you to update me
on the patient's condition

382
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,970
while hitting this
against the wall.

383
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,681
This is the only place
we can do both.

384
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,766
I finished the last blood draw.

385
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:42,229
I expect the people
who work for me to rise to a challenge.

386
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,065
Unless they don't
expect to work for me.

387
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,377
Last blood draw
was at 6:00 a.m.

388
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,881
His sugar levels never rose
above 120 all night.

389
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,429
So the glucose was normal.

390
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,806
It means you were wrong
about diabetes.

391
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,516
I still think it's
the endocrine system,

392
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,060
maybe I just got
the wrong gland.

393
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:26,648
You were going for thyroid
instead of pancreas? It makes sense.

394
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,200
Fine! I'm not playing
racquetball with Wilson!

395
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:37,618
I was never playing
racquetball with Wilson!

396
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,079
I have never played
racquetball with Wilson.

397
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,501
I thought it would be helpful
if a department head owed me a favor,

398
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,544
but it's not worth this.

399
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,341
Not bad.
You put on a good show.

400
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,718
You studied up,
Wilson actually booked a court.

401
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,137
If you were really
a racquetball player,

402
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,224
you'd know that you're holding
a squash racquet.

403
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,853
Tell Kutner to do
a thyroid reuptake scan,

404
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,648
then go grab a nap
in one of the on-call rooms.

405
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,610
We're taking you to do a thyroid
reuptake scan. We think your...

406
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,487
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain

407
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,405
why my daughter has
a bandage on her hand.

408
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,366
You just said you wanted
to run some test.

409
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,410
If I'd known it would involve pain,
I'd have said, "Hell no."

410
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:21,453
It's a mild burn.

411
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,997
Since Marika has a neurological
disability, like you,

412
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,291
- we needed to make sure.
- She has no disability.

413
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,086
Nick, you know about her problem
with auditory processing.

414
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,921
Auditory processing?

415
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,132
That's code, for "I can't stand thinking
my daughter's not perfect."

416
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,218
The therapist said
Marika's test scores...

417
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,136
Were indeterminate.

418
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,598
She doesn't have a disability.
She daydreams.

419
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:46,395
She gets below average marks in school
because she's below average.

420
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,106
Every parent
thinks their child is above average.

421
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,274
- Nick!
- Do they have any idea

422
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,569
what the word average means?
Somebody has to be under it.

423
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,862
Nick, shut up!

424
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,160
Honey.

425
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,456
I'm not saying you're stupid.

426
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,126
Your mother's not
the sharpest crayon in the box,

427
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,878
and she does great.

428
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:17,217
See, this is why
I told your mother to keep you at home.

429
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,094
Didn't want you here.

430
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,388
Marika.

431
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,640
Marika, wait.

432
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,767
Get her...

433
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,060
You're burning up.

434
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,815
Your lungs are full of fluid,
we need to get it out.

435
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,650
I need 200 milligrams
of furosemide

436
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,569
and two milligrams
of morphine, stat.

437
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,532
- His temperature is 103.
- Infection.

438
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,326
The steroids must have
forced it into the open.

439
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,994
What kind of infection?
It could be anything.

440
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,121
Staph aureus,
tuberculosis, strongyloides.

441
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,748
Go back to Phineas
and get a history.

442
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,625
We got a history.
He hasn't been out of the country.

443
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,834
Get a detailed history.

444
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,086
No one at home is sick,
no one at work is sick,

445
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,731
there's no sign of ticks
or mosquitoes.

446
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,548
Get a more detailed history.

447
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,834
Ask him again.
And again, until he remembers something.

448
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,511
Not you. Kutner can do it.

449
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,640
You're going to be busy
with something else.

450
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,773
I'm here to invite you
to lunch.

451
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,858
Why?

452
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:22,699
I've been made. House sent me
back to you as a double agent.

453
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,415
Anything wrong?

454
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,833
Eyes are a little red.

455
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,085
There's a shocker.

456
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,921
I haven't had a good night's sleep
since this thing started.

457
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,799
You should get
some rest yourself.

458
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:39,967
That's a good idea.

459
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,470
This is going to take
some time, it will be pretty exhaustive.

460
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,639
Are you afraid of
what you might say while I'm here?

461
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:46,807
Yes.

462
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,143
Are you telling me there's something
worse than what I've already heard?

463
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,647
No, I don't know
what I'm going to say.

464
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,816
I don't know how I'm
going to hurt you next.

465
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,861
I think we should be around each other
as little as possible right now.

466
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,826
This is pathetic.

467
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,952
I know.

468
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,540
Tell Marika
I love her very much.

469
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,084
She understands that.

470
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,794
I don't think she does.

471
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,507
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

472
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,342
Yeah.

473
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,735
Guy leads a boring life.
They stay home a lot.

474
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,155
No travel, no exotic pets.
No nearby standing water.

475
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
You sound pleased about something.
Can we get to that part?

476
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,951
His wife rescues dogs.

477
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,829
Among others, a big Rottweiler,
who's taken over the house.

478
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,164
Our patient hates it.

479
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,291
- Was the wife there to hear this?
- No.

480
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,584
Too bad. Keep going.

481
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,295
The dog marks its territory
all over the living room.

482
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,504
I asked what the odds were

483
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,424
that he would've put down food or drink
where the dog could reach.

484
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,134
He said he put
a glass of juice on the floor

485
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,260
while he was fixing
the television.

486
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,554
- The dog was fixing the television?
- Yes.

487
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,722
Patient's eyes red?

488
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,807
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.

489
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:14,186
Bacterial. You lucked out.

490
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,979
Start him on doxycycline.

491
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,648
If he improves,
we'll know we were right.

492
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,570
I told Wilson you sent me
to get information.

493
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,155
And now you're telling me.

494
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,033
What does that make you,
a quadruple agent?

495
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,494
He let me print out
his e-mails.

496
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,620
Wow. Excellent.

497
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,747
Information
he wants us to have.

498
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,791
Did he let you print out
his deleted e-mails?

499
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,167
- No.
- Go back there...

500
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,615
As long as I was sitting there,

501
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:42,047
thought I'd print them anyway.
Top one's the one you're looking for.

502
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,593
"I confirm Wednesday
at 7:00 p.m."

503
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,472
It's outgoing
to JGonzalez@NYMercy.net.

504
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,726
There's a Joan Gonzalez
in oncology. It's a consult.

505
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,270
Secret consult at 7:00 p.m.?

506
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,524
Oh, Joan is perky.

507
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,652
You're wrong, there was
a patient file attached.

508
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:04,611
Where?

509
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:05,946
It was password protected.

510
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,072
No.

511
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,784
Wilson doesn't password
protect his patient files.

512
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,789
I'm the only one
he'd expect ever to look there,

513
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,747
and he knows there's
only one patient I'd want to check on.

514
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,458
You think Wilson's sick?

515
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,503
If Wilson had cancer,

516
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,713
there'd be no reason for him to drive
three hours to Manhattan.

517
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,091
He knows he could pull strings here
to get the best treatment.

518
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,301
Six articles by Gonzalez.

519
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:31,596
"Managing suicidal thoughts
in oncology patients."

520
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,641
"Suicidal ideation in
children with leukemia."

521
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,101
I don't want to ask this,

522
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,855
but have you ever had reason to think
he might be depressed?

523
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,691
No. Get out of here.

524
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,913
Your fever's down
and your lungs are clearing.

525
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,000
How long before this
brain thing goes away?

526
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,376
Infection's gone.

527
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,880
The damage the infection did,
you'll have to live with.

528
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,883
You telling me
you can't fix this?

529
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,426
There's got to be a way...

530
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,262
We'd need to remove the damaged area
in your cingulate gyrus,

531
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,472
but it's too close
to the brain stem to risk surgery.

532
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,141
You can't risk it?

533
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,351
But I could shop around,

534
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,645
and maybe some better doctors
at a better hospital...

535
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,481
The brain stem controls the body's
involuntary systems.

536
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,067
The slightest mistake
could kill you.

537
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,819
Even if you survive,

538
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,238
you may never be able to breathe
on your own again, you may never...

539
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,740
I get it.

540
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,075
I know this seems
like a lot to deal with right now,

541
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:38,538
but people have adapted to living with
all kinds of neurological deficits.

542
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,875
Hey, at least we can promise you
it won't get any worse.

543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,169
Get the hell out of my room.

544
00:25:55,972 --> 00:26:00,685
Your assistant said that you were
out of the hospital taking a walk.

545
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,022
- Is there an emergency?
- I don't know, is there?

546
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,235
You never take a walk unless you got
something you need to think about.

547
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,572
Maybe you just don't have a good
statistical sampling of my walks.

548
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:16,910
The other thing you do when you need to
think is you come to my office.

549
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:17,994
Apparently, this is something

550
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,082
you can only discuss with
Gonzalez at New York Mercy.

551
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:30,215
Taub. Another graduate
of the House School of Being a Dick.

552
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,424
Private dick.

553
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,470
Look, I'd love to stay for the full
inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.

554
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,311
Of course you need hot coffee,
it's 45 degrees outside

555
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,815
and you left your
coat upstairs. Why?

556
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,859
You're going to tell me
why I forgot my coat?

557
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,862
Once you get outside,
the cold would have reminded you.

558
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,031
Could have gone back,
but you didn't.

559
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,534
You chose to be uncomfortable.

560
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,538
Now why would someone
choose that?

561
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,791
Because they hate themselves?

562
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,002
Has it ever occurred to you that
when I don't share something,

563
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,129
it might not be meant
as a challenge?

564
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,047
It might just mean
that I'd like there to be

565
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,260
one molecule of my life
that goes unexamined by Gregory House.

566
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,819
Nick Greenwald. I hear you're
the guy in charge.

567
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,365
I'm the patient
with the disinhibition.

568
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,784
If you're here to say thanks,
you're welcome. Now go away.

569
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,953
I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.

570
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,163
Oh.

571
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,664
All the more reason to go away.

572
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,542
They're talking about
sending me home.

573
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,546
To what? A life where I'll
continually drive away anyone who might,

574
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,715
for a second, care about me?

575
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,592
Those are the breaks.

576
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,765
You could operate.

577
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,935
You could die.

578
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:10,398
So I'm either better or dead?
I'm okay with that.

579
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,408
I've always been kind of
an impatient guy.

580
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,953
But I've worked hard
to keep my mouth shut.

581
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,540
I've made my wife happy.
I've made my little girl happy.

582
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,544
I want that back.

583
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,297
Otherwise, it's no life.

584
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,934
I want you to remove
a small problem.

585
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:51,689
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

586
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,317
Your boss is. You could assist,

587
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,653
I'm sure you'd like
to add to your resume.

588
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,738
It's too near the brain stem.
Nobody's going to touch it.

589
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,908
Your boss would.
He's an egomaniac.

590
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,536
I know 'cause I keep
seeing him at the club.

591
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,204
He just needs a little push.

592
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,624
I'm sure by now you've kissed
his ass sufficiently.

593
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,838
Would you like me to phrase it
as "you're politically gifted"?

594
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,714
I could do that.

595
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,343
You want me to help you?

596
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,013
Tell me why.

597
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,723
Why what?

598
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:26,933
Why you care?

599
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,644
The puzzle's solved,
the guy's alive.

600
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,979
And the odds of coming out
of this surgery

601
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,314
with that
same status aren't that great.

602
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,317
My patient has
a quality of life issue.

603
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,904
He says awful things.
Hardly a medical condition.

604
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,784
When he leaves here,
he's going to lose his family.

605
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,911
He's going to alienate
the people he works with.

606
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,540
And if he ever finds a friend who's
willing to put up with his crap,

607
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,041
he'll be lucky.

608
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,463
Until he drives them away, too.

609
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,761
I'll see what I can do.

610
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,040
You've apparently got this
whole coat thing backwards.

611
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,918
I may have overreacted.

612
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,046
You definitely overreacted.

613
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,964
I knew you'd meet me halfway.

614
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,174
But it made me think.

615
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,053
You only snap
on one subject, losing people.

616
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,931
So I went back to the Intel.

617
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,392
It's true there's only one doctor named
Gonzalez at New York Mercy,

618
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:55,647
but there's a Javier Gonzalez
who's a nurse in the psych ward.

619
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,691
Now who could you lose
who'd end up there?

620
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,238
Maybe the reason I don't always open up
to you is because it's redundant.

621
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,864
Daniel Wilson.

622
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,367
Once you've got a name,

623
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,495
it's amazing how much stuff
you can learn on the phone.

624
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,915
I mean,
if you're a doctor and you lie freely.

625
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,959
They found your brother
sleeping in the lobby

626
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,211
of an office building in Manhattan.

627
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,671
He got aggressive
when they asked him to leave,

628
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,507
and the cops took him
to the Mercy psych ward.

629
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:25,426
There've been new anti-psychotics
developed since he ran away.

630
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,680
He's been on them
for a couple of days. And by tonight,

631
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,765
he should be in shape
to talk to me.

632
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,393
But you're not sure
if he wants to.

633
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,398
I'll be in New York in a few hours,
I guess I'll find out.

634
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,567
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

635
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,026
House, you and I,

636
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,447
we don't have the
normal social contract.

637
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,533
I don't expect you
to tell me the lies that...

638
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,119
I'm fully capable
of lying to you.

639
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,704
I've lied plenty of times.

640
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,956
I mean collaborative lies.

641
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:59,752
Giving someone a hand who maybe needs
to deceive themselves, just a little.

642
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,298
For two days,
I've been thinking about

643
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,300
how Danny's going to
react when he sees me.

644
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:08,094
If I said that
to anybody else, they'd say,

645
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,388
"Don't worry,
it'll all be all right."

646
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,515
You wouldn't.

647
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,727
Because it might
all go horribly wrong.

648
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,814
Yeah.

649
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,817
Yeah, it might.

650
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:27,405
In which case,
you might want some company.

651
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,372
Your heart's beating.
First hurdle passed.

652
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,751
Now we need to know
if you can breathe for yourself.

653
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,964
Oh, thank God.

654
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,427
Now, do you know who you are?

655
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,057
Nick Greenwald, former S.O.B.

656
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,101
Thank you.

657
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:02,690
Now I can go back to my beautiful life
with my beautiful wife.

658
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,943
Maybe she'll stop whining
and cut me some slack

659
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,321
now that I've risked my life.

660
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,366
It doesn't make sense.
We removed the problem.

661
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,035
We removed the damage.
Maybe we were wrong about the problem.

662
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,162
I need to believe
we can get through this.

663
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,413
Temperature's 94.5.

664
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:20,041
Do you really think I'm stupid?

665
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:24,337
Honey, you're not stupid,
you're just... Please don't do this.

666
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:25,463
Could be the effect
of the surgery.

667
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,006
Do you at least
respect me, Nick?

668
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,851
What do you think of
what I do for a living?

669
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,261
I think people who publicize
important things

670
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,473
are people who can't do
important things themselves.

671
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,558
Honey, stop. Don't.

672
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,935
Do you regret marrying me?

673
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,187
- 94.2.
- Sometimes.

674
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,231
- Everybody wonders.
- Get me a heating blanket.

675
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,732
Do you even love me?

676
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:45,692
Yes.

677
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,652
I don't know why.

678
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,653
Aud...

679
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,114
Wait. Let me...

680
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,492
V-tach! Get me the paddles.

681
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,957
Clear.

682
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,713
Echo says his heart
is structurally fine,

683
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,131
but his temperature
is still dropping.

684
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,757
He's headed for hypothermia.

685
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,762
I can't reach House.
It just goes to voice-mail.

686
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:12,885
Means we were wrong
about infection.

687
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,655
His temperature's
just going up and down

688
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,180
because something's
playing with his thermostat.

689
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,945
Which means
the brain damage is spreading.

690
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,600
What causes brain damage
and nosebleed,

691
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,477
and involves the lungs,
heart, and kidneys?

692
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,271
Cancer. We could text him.

693
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,480
It's not cancer.

694
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,775
Normal PSA, normal blood smear,
colonoscopy normal.

695
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,444
Do a full body scan.

696
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:30,862
House hates full body scans.

697
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,822
- House isn't here.
- House is right.

698
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,991
Everybody's got three or four
meaningless anomalies

699
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,156
that'll come up on a scan.

700
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,077
Chasing each one will take
time we don't have.

701
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,371
Feel free to send him an IM.

702
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,629
You told me you saw your brother once,
after he disappeared.

703
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,547
Thirteen years ago.

704
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,800
I used to go to Princeton
whenever I could.

705
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,677
I must have hit every
homeless shelter in town.

706
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,930
Then one day, I'm just sitting
at this deli having a sandwich,

707
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:42,475
I look out the window
and there he is.

708
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,269
He was gone by the time
I got outside.

709
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,354
That's why you were so eager,

710
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,689
when I told you there was
a job in Princeton.

711
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,107
I thought it was just my charm.

712
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,070
That's the team,
shouldn't you answer?

713
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:57,532
They've already texted me to say
they're doing something stupid.

714
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,326
Small abdominal aneurysm.

715
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,651
Irrelevant. What else you got?

716
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,371
A cyst in the pleura
around the lungs.

717
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,581
Also irrelevant.
Couldn't cause any of the symptoms.

718
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,166
There's a density in the liver,

719
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,960
could be a vascular
malformation.

720
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,671
If he's got multiple AVMs, screwed up
blood flow would explain everything.

721
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,673
We can only spot them
with angiography.

722
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,216
We'll have to do targeted
scans with contrast,

723
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,259
and then embolize each one.

724
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,510
Can we do that
before he freezes?

725
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,262
We'll find out.

726
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:24,976
The spell-correct on Kutner's phone
has got a hair-trigger.

727
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,770
Either that, or the patient
has a "cyclone"

728
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,439
in the "floral" of his lungs.

729
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:36,612
You took a walk in 45-degree weather
and you left your coat behind.

730
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:40,908
Go ahead.

731
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,994
I think you were
punishing yourself.

732
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,038
I think you wanted to feel what it
would be like to be homeless

733
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,915
in a New Jersey winter.

734
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,294
That tells me guilt.

735
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,630
That tells me
something happened.

736
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,886
The schizophrenia started
when he was a teenager.

737
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,471
When he was in college,

738
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:03,890
he was on meds,

739
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:07,310
but he'd still think a professor was out
to get him because he got a B,

740
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,312
or he would fight with his roommates
because he never showered.

741
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,605
Where were you?

742
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,814
Med school.

743
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:18,029
He called me every day,
talked for hours.

744
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:20,114
I didn't have hours.

745
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,490
Interesting.

746
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,411
Later for that. Go on.

747
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,955
I was tired of being the guy
that everybody counted on.

748
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,207
So one night Danny called...

749
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,921
One night Danny called,
crying, upset about something.

750
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:39,425
I had to study for an exam.
So I hung up.

751
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,261
Took my things, I went to the library

752
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,763
where I wouldn't have to hear the phone
ring.

753
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:46,599
I wonder how that turned out.

754
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:48,004
My mother called me
the next day,

755
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,311
Danny had run away
and left his meds behind.

756
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:55,691
Which I knew meant that he would never
be able to choose to come back,

757
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,528
because he'd be so
detached from reality.

758
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:04,158
So you made your one effort to live
a normal, selfish life,

759
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,410
and the universe
immediately smacked you down.

760
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:10,206
And because we're wired
to find meaning in semi-random events,

761
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,334
you decided never to be
that careless again.

762
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,545
You don't think
that's a little facile?

763
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:20,633
Actually, I don't.
I think you did it consciously.

764
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:24,428
You developed your
people pleasing talents

765
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,598
the way an Olympic athlete
develops his muscles.

766
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:30,601
Talk about an overreaction
to a single event.

767
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,645
It was a pretty big event.

768
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,065
Hanging up the phone? That's what
you're blaming all this on.

769
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,402
That's the behavior
you've been trying to correct.

770
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:42,613
As though nothing else
went wrong in your brother's life.

771
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,199
Of course he overreacted,
too, but...

772
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,537
His glucose was normal.

773
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,791
We're not talking about
my brother anymore, are we?

774
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:02,174
It's House. AVMs don't
explain his glucose.

775
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:05,636
Since this is a significant moment
in my life and all, I'll...

776
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,679
Yeah.

777
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,004
I think I'll just go in and...

778
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:09,140
Explain that.

779
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:10,516
Right.

780
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,979
We have given him steroids.
His glucose should have been elevated.

781
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,441
That wannabe cyst
you found in the whole body scan,

782
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,326
without the glucose,
it's an irrelevant cyst,

783
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,653
with the glucose,
it's a relevant fibroma.

784
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,613
He has Doege-Potter Syndrome.

785
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,575
His fibroma is secreting
human growth hormone

786
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,161
which acts like insulin,
lowering his glucose.

787
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,955
That doesn't explain
the organ failure, the brain damage.

788
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,541
This whole thing
is an overreaction.

789
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,836
That one small fibroma,
it's benign,

790
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,255
but his body's acting
like it's an invader.

791
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,508
His antibodies went to war against it
and got carried away,

792
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,636
attacked his other systems.
Take out the fibroma,

793
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,681
he'll be a happy
hypocrite again in no time.

794
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,565
Maybe I should call a cab.

795
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,525
Your wife's probably just late.

796
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,818
Yeah.

797
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm sorry about,

798
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,369
you know, things I said.

799
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:18,334
I have a conspicuous nose.

800
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,086
It suits your face.

801
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,594
I'm sorry I'm late.

802
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,596
Traffic.

803
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,771
I have some good news.

804
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:40,773
I was going to tell you,
and then you got sick,

805
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,400
it didn't seem like
the best time.

806
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,570
I've been offered
a better position.

807
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,533
I'd be coordinating cancer
awareness walks in three cities.

808
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,036
That's great. Congratulations.

809
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,288
I know you've worked
hard for this.

810
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,582
Thank you.

811
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,588
Is Marika okay?

812
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,591
I'm sure she's moved on.

813
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,474
Kids are so resilient.

814
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,579
You Okay?

815
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:39,999
I'll be seeing Danny
again next week.

816
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,042
I'd like you to meet him.

817
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,335
Sure.

818
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,045
Sounds interesting.

819
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,965
Go on.

820
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,968
I thought seeing him again
would change everything.

821
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:54,305
It'd be wonderful
or terrible. Instead...

822
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:59,602
We're just strangers.
It's kind of anticlimactic.

823
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:03,189
Which is better than terrible.

824
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:09,945
Go on.

825
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,283
Does it bother you
that we have no social contract?

826
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,828
My whole life is
one big compromise.

827
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:20,080
I tiptoe around everyone
like they're made of china.

828
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,790
I spend all my time analyzing.

829
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,292
"What will the effect be
if I say this?"

830
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,961
And then there's you.
You're a reality junkie.

831
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,963
If I offered you
a comforting lie,

832
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,174
you'd smack me
over the head with it.

833
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,051
Let's not change that.

834
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,178
Okay-

835
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,597
No. See, this...

836
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:41,268
If you were implementing
a social contract, you'd say that,

837
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:45,773
but only because
it makes me feel better.

838
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,736
It's kind of fun watching you
torture yourself.

839
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,530
Do you think things will work out
with my brother?

840
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:54,657
No.

841
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:59,662
But when it does go wrong,
it won't be your fault.

842
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:01,914
Thanks, House.

843
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:05,376
You do actually
like monster trucks?

844
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:06,710
Absolutely.
