1
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,530
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

2
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:30,949
Come on, honey,
you're gonna throw him off.

3
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:33,451
It's okay, I'm almost done.

4
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,081
A little more light
on your hips.

5
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,165
God.

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,793
Why couldn't you have come up with this
before I had two kids?

7
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:44,921
You look amazing.

8
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:51,553
Okay, I think... Yeah, I'm done.
Want to come take a look?

9
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,561
I can't.

10
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,021
You first.

11
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,690
No, we'll look together.

12
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,658
I don't understand.
I thought...

13
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:14,743
What the hell is that?

14
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,077
Honey, it's okay.

15
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,162
This is not what we discussed,
or what I paid for.

16
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,749
I don't understand. I think
this is one of the best I've ever done.

17
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:21,875
I want my money back.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,586
I'm sorry, but this is not
some department store photo studio.

19
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,337
And this is not my wife.

20
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:27,505
Yes, it is.

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,051
You asked me to paint her exactly
as she looks. That's exactly what I did.

22
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,679
Honey! Stop it!

23
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,723
What's going on? Brandon.

24
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:41,311
That check better be in my mailbox
by Friday, or I'll be back.

25
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,314
Come on.

26
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,066
- What happened?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,819
They saw the painting,
and they just freaked out.

28
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:54,824
Brandon, what is this?

29
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,785
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

30
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,913
What's wrong with it?

31
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,497
Why is this in here?

32
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:44,249
First column, last entry.

33
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,628
Today is going
to be a good day.

34
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,384
This him?

35
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,094
- No.
- Yes.

36
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,888
She means,
are you the private investigator

37
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,724
whose bills I've tried
to slip through as medical expenses?

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,477
Oh. Hi. I'm Lucas Douglas, Pl.

39
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,564
This hospital is not putting
a private investigator on retainer,

40
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,982
nor is it going to pay any more

41
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,025
phony repairs
on vending machines,

42
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,694
cryostats, or elevators.

43
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,363
Information saves lives.
Saving lives saves money.

44
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,782
No, saving lives costs money,

45
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,994
which is why I'm trying to make sure
there's still some left.

46
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,662
You want your own personal Pl,

47
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,415
you're gonna have
to pay for him yourself.

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,292
- Sorry.
- No, I understand.

49
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,502
Hey, I like the shoes,
by the way.

50
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:30,962
Oh.

51
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,257
Thank you.

52
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,554
You don't like her shoes,
you like her legs.

53
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,848
It sounds less creepy
if you say shoes.

54
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,766
Less creepy, more gay.

55
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,393
That's my firm's motto.

56
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,937
What is a cryostat?

57
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:52,942
No idea. Whoever fixed ours
is about to get stiffed.

58
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:08,249
There's no distorted perspective
in any of his other recent works.

59
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,792
Not much talent either.

60
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,878
It's like the symptom
just came on.

61
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,756
Acute onset visual agnosia
points to a stroke or brain tumor.

62
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,799
MRI revealed
no stroke or brain tumor.

63
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,286
We should do another
with contrast.

64
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,761
If he's like the other
struggling artists I've known,

65
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:20,887
he's also into drugs.

66
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,514
We should...
What are you looking at?

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,058
Apparently a moron.

68
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,810
One, ER routinely tests for drugs.

69
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,938
If it was positive,
we wouldn't be looking at this file.

70
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:34,108
Two, who pays 12% interest
on a car loan?

71
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,527
How did you...
Did you run a credit check on me?

72
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,196
No, that would be illegal.

73
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,407
Interestingly enough, paying someone
to run it for me, though...

74
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,913
What? It's part of my job.

75
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,414
Your job
is to diagnose patients.

76
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,540
Which I do with a team.

77
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,418
How am I supposed to know
how best to utilize that team

78
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,712
if I don't know
everything about them?

79
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,840
Say that Van Gogh turns out
to have neurosyphilis,

80
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,385
and our last vial of penicillin
is in a storeroom

81
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,805
at the end of a 20-mile hallway
with a two-foot-high ceiling.

82
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,140
You've discovered that one of us
has been hiding the ability

83
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,142
to stretch or
shrink themselves?

84
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,854
No, I would never
out someone's superpowers.

85
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,524
This, on the other hand...

86
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,195
You crawled 20 miles?

87
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,863
My name's in the Guinness Book.

88
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,740
I'll bet that
really impresses the babes.

89
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,617
I didn't do it
to get the babes.

90
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,245
No, that would cheapen
the purity of your achievement.

91
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,206
Sorry to interrupt, but we have
a patient with a probable brain tumor.

92
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,042
Who needs an MRI with contrast.
We've established that.

93
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,877
What do you got on Taub?

94
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,088
I got nothing on Taub.

95
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,131
Could also be environmental.

96
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,425
We should check his studio
for toxins, mold, fungus...

97
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,830
Taub's wife,
on the other hand...

98
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,760
House.

99
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,929
That's enough.

100
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,058
Dad's right.
This is no time for gossip.

101
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,519
Patient desperately needs our help.

102
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,063
Check his head and his house.

103
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,107
- Can't Lucas...
- No.

104
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,608
He's very busy.

105
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,487
If there is a tumor,
this test will show us...

106
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,822
Is that stuff dangerous?

107
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,907
This is just
the contrast material.

108
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,953
There is a small risk
of an anaphylactic reaction.

109
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,080
I could stop breathing?

110
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,583
Don't worry. We're prepared
to deal with whatever happens.

111
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,169
You know, I did some drawings
this morning and they seem fine.

112
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,129
So, maybe it was just a reaction
to something I ate.

113
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,964
How many people you know
have reactions like that

114
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,489
to something
they ate for breakfast?

115
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,425
But if I'm getting better...

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,801
You'll continue to get better.

117
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,446
If you're not,
we need to know why not,

118
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,805
so we can start
treatment immediately.

119
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,432
Baby, let them do the test.

120
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,531
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

121
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,742
Not without lead showing up
in the blood work.

122
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,454
Nothing in the medicine cabinet
except some harmless toiletries.

123
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,248
No signs of mold
or fungus anywhere, either.

124
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,333
You think House really
got something on your wife?

125
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,795
No, not that I care if he did.

126
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,215
Wait, your wife's doing
the doorman in your bed,

127
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,759
and they're sweating all over the sheets
that you paid for and...

128
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,677
- My wife's not doing the doorman.
- How do you know?

129
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:09,222
We don't have a doorman.

130
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,058
And I just do, okay? Drop it.

131
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,395
In college, my friends and I came up
with an Inverse-Square Law.

132
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,772
Sounds like a real fun group.

133
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:21,317
The girls who you think
are the most inhibited, straight arrows?

134
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,763
They're the ones
you hook up with.

135
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,529
Are you saying
my wife's a slut?

136
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,281
I'm saying if my wife was a slut,
I'd want to know.

137
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,620
His place was clean.

138
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:34,038
So is his head.

139
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,416
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

140
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,461
A neurological symptom
with no apparent neurological cause.

141
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,005
Time course means
we can rule out cancer and MS.

142
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:44,966
That just leaves
toxins or drugs.

143
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,844
You called Thirteen a moron
for thinking it was drugs.

144
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,929
Yeah, when she said it,
she had other options.

145
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:53,015
And I really just wanted a segue
into her stupid loan and your...

146
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,861
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

147
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,310
Once the blood gets reabsorbed,

148
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,915
pressure goes down,
symptom goes away.

149
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,814
He'll never consent
to petrosal vein sampling.

150
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,359
Really?

151
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,237
He was nervous
about an injection of contrast.

152
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,990
Is his girlfriend hot?

153
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,908
I'm not talking fever, here.

154
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,910
I mean, is she all curvy and perky?

155
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,413
Very. And if he dies,
it's good news for all of us, but...

156
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:18,291
That explains
why all his paintings suck.

157
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,001
And what's wrong with him.

158
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,544
Where are you going?

159
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,296
To tell him
he may have a massive brain tumor.

160
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,422
He doesn't.

161
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,800
I know. I'm not a moron.
It's drugs.

162
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,515
You seem to have
a massive brain tumor.

163
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,766
Who are you?

164
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,852
He's Dr. House.
He's pleased to meet you.

165
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,812
We've found no trace
on any of your imaging,

166
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,689
so we need to cut
your head open.

167
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,026
It's risky,
but it's the only way to save your life.

168
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,194
No.

169
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,945
Wrong answer.

170
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,110
I'm not allowed to say no?

171
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,407
You're not allowed
to not be terrified.

172
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,410
There's only two good reasons
not to be terrified in a hospital.

173
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,831
You're delusional, but then you're
not afraid of contrast material either,

174
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,792
or you know you're fine.
Since we haven't told you you're fine,

175
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,670
you obviously have information
that we don't have.

176
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,675
What drugs are you on?

177
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:06,923
His drug tests were clean.

178
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,467
Drug tests only test for drugs
they've made tests for.

179
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,135
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:15,348
Hottie thinks that
he's a great artist,

181
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,183
selling art
to the rich and tasteful.

182
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,685
She's stupid enough
to be fooled by the canvasses,

183
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,355
but bank accounts don't lie.
He needed money.

184
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,440
There are not many jobs you can do
that don't require time,

185
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,775
training and intelligence.

186
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,194
And I know you're not
a news anchor or supermodel

187
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,531
because those jobs seldom cause agnosia.
He's a guinea pig.

188
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,909
Companies pay him
to test their untested drugs.

189
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,501
Did Hottie
go for a pee or coffee?

190
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:47,421
'Cause either way, I don't think
we should waste any time on denials.

191
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,134
The clinical trials
were supposed to be safe.

192
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,928
The drugs are about to be approved
by the FDA.

193
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,889
"Drugs"?
How many trials are you on?

194
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,350
Three.

195
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:05,022
Admirable. Not many idiots
have that much ambition.

196
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,774
You've been symptom-free
since your admission,

197
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,360
so whatever you took
has probably cleared your system now.

198
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,903
You'll be fine.

199
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,113
Keep him overnight
just to make sure,

200
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:15,032
and get the names
of all the trials he's been in.

201
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,410
You gonna tell Heather?

202
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,412
Couldn't,
even if I cared enough to want to.

203
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:37,179
Not bad.
You almost made it the whole day.

204
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,556
What did you find out?

205
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,808
The point is to see
how everyone reacts.

206
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,435
You may go get
the rest of the gang.

207
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,686
Cut the crap, House.

208
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,483
Your wife
has a separate bank account

209
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,609
in her name only.

210
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:53,863
She's been making weekly cash deposits
for about a year now.

211
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,157
No withdrawals yet.

212
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,202
That's it? A bank account?

213
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,871
A secret bank account.

214
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,873
What makes you think
it's a secret?

215
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:08,002
Because if it wasn't
you would call it "the" bank account.

216
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:12,298
Damn, always forget to use
the right article when lying.

217
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,342
It's not secret.
We're refurnishing.

218
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,907
We set the budget,
set up an account.

219
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,887
I just couldn't make it to the bank
the day we opened it.

220
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,599
You're spending
almost $100,000 on furniture?

221
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,310
Yes.

222
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,230
What happened?

223
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:31,400
I don't know. He was fine,
then all of a sudden he started seizing.

224
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,985
He said you told him
he was better.

225
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,404
What's happening?
What's wrong with him?

226
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,992
She is hot.

227
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,457
Obviously, the drugs
weren't out of his system.

228
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,783
None of these drugs,
nor the drugs they're derived from,

229
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,753
- are known for causing seizures.
- By themselves, no.

230
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,422
But three unproven,
untested drugs?

231
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,966
It's like The <i>Mod</i> Squad,
no one can stop them.

232
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,510
It's ridiculous that
they let people take

233
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,261
potentially dangerous
drugs for money.

234
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,888
Just to short circuit
that discussion,

235
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,413
people should not be testing drugs
because they're desperate.

236
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:06,519
But people won't test drugs
unless they're desperate.

237
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,562
We need drugs
to save children and puppies,

238
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,900
ergo we need desperate people,
ergo welfare kills sick children.

239
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:17,029
- First drug...
- Why don't we call it Bisexidrene?

240
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,408
Clinical trials involve
experimental drugs.

241
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,533
Means they don't have
comforting, catchy names yet,

242
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,079
just random,
unmemorable trial numbers.

243
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,330
Go ahead.

244
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,707
Bisexidrene is designed
as an anticoagulant.

245
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,794
Phase one indicated some risk
of nausea, ED and insomnia.

246
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,753
Second drug...

247
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,463
Cuckoldisol.

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,883
- She is having an affair?
- Worse.

249
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,387
Sex can be dismissed as hormonal
or emotional, can be easily regretted.

250
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,347
Money is always
a calculated decision.

251
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,890
My wife has
her own bank account

252
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,559
that House doesn't
think I know about.

253
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,436
Shocking. Discuss.

254
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,230
Drug B is an autoimmune treatment,
almost no side effects.

255
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,023
But even if it's doing
what it's supposed to be doing,

256
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,734
it doesn't mix well
with anticoagulants or anticonvulsants.

257
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,986
Which is the third drug?

258
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,864
World's-sorest-knees-isil.

259
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:01,073
Cuddy used to have that title,
by the way.

260
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,367
There's a million ways
these drugs could interact,

261
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,952
if they're doing
what they're supposed to.

262
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,198
If they're not, two million.

263
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,414
And it'd be interesting to know
which of those interactions

264
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,780
was causing the problem.
Unfortunately, we don't have to.

265
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,315
We just have to stop
the interacting.

266
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,175
- If we don't know which...
- We stop them all.

267
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,921
Put him on dialysis,
clear out his system.

268
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,590
Rapid detox risks arrhythmia,

269
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,924
another seizure,
hepatic failure...

270
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,219
Difference is we know what
those risks are. Put him on dialysis.

271
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,475
Dialysis. You use that
for kidney failure, right?

272
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,018
Don't worry,
your kidneys are fine.

273
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,504
He's not worried
about his kidneys.

274
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,062
He's worried about
how he's going to explain

275
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,356
the dialysis to his girlfriend.

276
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,774
I just don't want her to worry.

277
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,651
You mean you don't want her
to leave you.

278
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,488
What's wrong with that?
I love her.

279
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,656
It's not like I've lied to her
about anything important.

280
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,866
I am an artist.

281
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,494
I've sold plenty of paintings
in the past,

282
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,621
I just hit a bit
of a dry spell lately, so...

283
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,414
So tell her that.

284
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,832
He can't.

285
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,084
He wants her to be happy, too.

286
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,878
He's telling her
what she wants to hear.

287
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,302
You didn't know.

288
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,595
No.

289
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,263
What are you gonna do?

290
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,508
She's not sleeping around,
she's not gambling it away,

291
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,558
she hasn't even
spent any of it,

292
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,019
so I don't see a reason
to do anything.

293
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,424
You don't think
a conversation...

294
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,605
How many people do you know

295
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,359
in completely happy
and fulfilled relationships?

296
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,236
- None.
- I am.

297
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,656
Most people cling to some storybook
notion of what a relationship is.

298
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,366
You can't have
an imperfect thought.

299
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,326
You can't have a private zone.
You can't...

300
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,496
Steal money and hide it away
in a secret account?

301
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,874
She makes me happy.
I make her happy. It works.

302
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,292
Because we don't do storybook,

303
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,586
and I don't plan
to poke into her business.

304
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,887
You were right
about the dialysis.

305
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,597
He made it through the night
without any more seizures

306
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,723
or visual symptoms.

307
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,350
And I'm gonna be just as right

308
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,185
after breakfast
up in my office.

309
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,951
The only difference is I'm gonna be
right in front of other people.

310
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,274
Which means you're not here
to talk about the medicine.

311
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,817
You can screw with me
all you want at work,

312
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,610
but stay out of
my personal life.

313
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,737
What did she say?

314
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,022
Did you just hear what I said?

315
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,533
I heard the part about "You can screw
with me at work all you want."

316
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,138
- You want my advice?
- Of course not.

317
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,328
Good, because I have no idea
what you should do.

318
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,871
I only know
what you're going to do.

319
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,456
- You're gonna...
- I said I didn't want your advice.

320
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,874
I said this is not advice.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,210
You are going to forgive her
for opening that account,

322
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,712
and you're gonna confess
everything you've done

323
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,597
and then you're gonna
beg her to forgive you.

324
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,174
What purpose
could that possibly serve?

325
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,178
None, which is why I'm not saying
you should, but you will.

326
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,476
<i>What's your end game?</i>

327
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,437
Where are you?

328
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,438
I'm at the track.

329
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:40,816
That's like six miles away.
How cool are these things?

330
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,651
I feel like an idiot.

331
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,658
I'm not giving you
any more of my stuff.

332
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,994
Do you have those
night vision goggles?

333
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,495
<i>No.</i>

334
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,496
You're lying.

335
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,373
You like making him miserable.

336
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,876
You like driving
people away from you.

337
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,419
He deserved to know the truth.

338
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,064
There was no truth
until you dug it up.

339
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,547
<i>You do know that stuff exists</i>

340
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,966
<i>even when you can't see it, right?</i>

341
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,509
It was a truth
that mattered to him

342
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,927
and a truth
that mattered to her,

343
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,512
why did it matter to you?

344
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:14,266
First of all, stop saying "a" truth.
There is only one truth.

345
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,934
That may be true for you.

346
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,979
Miserable people
save more lives.

347
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,649
If your life has meaning,
your job doesn't have to have meaning.

348
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:25,110
Screw-ups are more palatable
if you have someone's arms to go cry in.

349
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,154
That makes sense.

350
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,073
Usually, I have more
of a fight on that one.

351
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,367
So why are you making
Taub miserable?

352
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,451
I just said...

353
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,411
<i>He left his last job
to save his marriage.</i>

354
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,665
If his marriage falls apart, you think
he'll be working harder for you?

355
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,958
Or you think he won't be
working for you at all?

356
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,173
His head and neck
are completely swollen.

357
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,634
I need a Trach kit.
His throat's closing.

358
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,433
- Can't find any landmarks.
- Just start cutting.

359
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,436
- An exploratory trach?
- We don't have a choice.

360
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,981
- I got it.
- Here.

361
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,493
<i>His face is so swollen
it's squeezed his tear ducts shut.</i>

362
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,203
<i>We've been lubricating
his eyes by hand.</i>

363
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,373
We've started him on steroids, IV,
and cream to reduce the swelling,

364
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,416
but it's having limited effect.

365
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,711
Negative for thrombosis and Chagas.
Could be infection.

366
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,670
Cultures still negative.

367
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,506
Could be his immune system's
on hyperdrive, cytokine storm.

368
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,175
Why would you pay
for a three-year gym membership

369
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,010
and only go twice?

370
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,516
Sorry.
You guys still diagnosing?

371
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,684
I thought
we finished hours ago.

372
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,519
You remember, when we decided
it was the unproven,

373
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:45,232
unapproved cocktail of drugs he's
been downing like... Like a cocktail.

374
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,526
He just completed
a total dialysis.

375
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,736
If it was the drugs,
he'd be better.

376
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,237
Or he'd be worse.

377
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,949
I take it none of you
saw Trainspotting.

378
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,743
You think swelling
is a symptom of withdrawal?

379
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,348
You think it's a coincidence
that three new symptoms cropped up

380
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,580
as soon as we took him
off the drugs?

381
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,664
It's possible some
of the symptoms...

382
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,416
Either the drugs are the answer

383
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,781
or the drugs are a coincidence.

384
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,669
If it's one, we have to find
a better way to detox him.

385
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,672
If it's two, we have to know
which symptoms are withdrawal related

386
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,382
before we can formulate
a diagnosis.

387
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,885
Which means we have to find
a better way to detox him.

388
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,762
So how do we do it?

389
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,263
Hair of the drug that bit him.

390
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,222
That's ridiculous.

391
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,475
If it is the drugs, they're dangerous,
and they've already caused...

392
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,351
That's why we're
gonna put him back on the drugs,

393
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:22,686
then wean him off again.

394
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,146
Just much slower.

395
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,233
Why are you looking at him?

396
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,486
Try it out.

397
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,489
You heard the boss. Go!

398
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,410
- Taub...
- I didn't talk to her.

399
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,046
Why are you...

400
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,339
Excuse me.

401
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,090
Uh, sorry.

402
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,475
He does look like me,
doesn't he?

403
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,559
You gave him your hat?

404
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,603
I needed you out of here
so I could go through your desk.

405
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:05,854
Of course.

406
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,690
Nice blouse.
I really like that color on you.

407
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,818
Tell House that if he wants to know
what I'm doing,

408
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:11,819
all he has to do...

409
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,322
It's not House. It's me.
I was... I don't know.

410
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,200
I was thinking maybe we could
get together for a drink or something.

411
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,786
I wasn't sure exactly
what you like to do, so I thought...

412
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,247
- You'd spy on me?
- No, no, not spying.

413
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,583
More like research. I think it's a good
idea to get to know a little bit more

414
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,627
about a woman
before you ask her out.

415
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,922
Show you care about more
than just what she looks like.

416
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,092
As romantic
as you make that sound,

417
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,302
pretty sure
that what you're doing

418
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,097
is not so much
caring as creepy.

419
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,056
That's not fair.

420
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,766
You were scrounging
through my desk.

421
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,060
What the hell am I going to find out?
You went to Michigan.

422
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,104
You like your sandwiches
a little light on mayo.

423
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,689
You stay in touch
with your mother.

424
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,107
You rented <i>The English Patient</i>

425
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,901
and you gave money
to Amnesty International.

426
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,236
There's not one thing
I can find out in here

427
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,656
that you wouldn't tell a co-worker
while riding in an elevator.

428
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm not a creep.
I just thought you seemed interesting.

429
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,914
I'll go now.

430
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,250
Yeah, these...

431
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,677
I'll give you
embarrassing info on House.

432
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,845
In exchange for...

433
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,263
No. No need for a date.

434
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,099
You'd be employing me,
so I'd have all the time in the world

435
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,602
to ask you all about
you and it would fall

436
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,354
under the category of socializing,
instead of creepy stalking.

437
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,064
- And I'd be paying you?
- I know it's weird.

438
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,192
But if you pay me while I check you out,
it's all cool.

439
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,358
And you'd get value.
You'd get leverage against him.

440
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,487
Help you keep him in line.

441
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,156
You think I need help
keeping House in line?

442
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,324
No.

443
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,952
Nope. I'm sorry.

444
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,747
This hospital can't afford...

445
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,498
Oh, whatever you can afford.

446
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,255
How did you know I liked roses?

447
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,049
I was in your house last night.

448
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,551
No, I'm kidding.

449
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,471
Who the hell
doesn't like roses?

450
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,361
I forgot to tell you,

451
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,489
the Parker Quartet is going to play
at the library fundraiser.

452
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,245
That's it? It was your idea.

453
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,539
They'll be great.

454
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,375
Mmm-hmm.

455
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:37,839
You Okay?

456
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,594
I couldn't find
the letter opener.

457
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:47,265
I went through some of the drawers
in your desk, looking for it.

458
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:52,354
There were a bunch of statements
in there from Jefferson Mutual.

459
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,532
I was so close.

460
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,076
To what?

461
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:10,038
You've got $83,000 socked away
in a secret account.

462
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,665
Not anymore.

463
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,253
I wanted to keep it a surprise,

464
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,633
but I bought you the car.

465
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,555
Uh...

466
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,266
The one that I...

467
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:36,231
I knew you would never buy it yourself,
so I've been saving.

468
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,317
And it's gonna be delivered
on Friday.

469
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,991
You are amazing.

470
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:48,827
Lucky you.

471
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,210
We've gradually
reduced your dosage.

472
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,587
You're actually drug-free now.

473
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,339
I feel great. Thanks to you.

474
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,592
All part of the job.

475
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,344
Your blood pressure is normal.
Can you sit up?

476
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,849
Hey!

477
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,476
What are you...

478
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,443
What happened to his face?

479
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,320
Question is,
what happened to his hormones?

480
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,989
We're gonna need
an ice pack in here.

481
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,196
<i>We can rule out
the clinical trial drugs at this point.</i>

482
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,164
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

483
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,333
So unless the drugs found
a hiding place under the stairs...

484
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,960
Drugs could have set off
a dormant neurological condition.

485
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,923
Good point.
Coming clean causes a lot of damage.

486
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,133
Alienation, divorce...

487
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,469
My wife's buying me a car.

488
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,847
- I was talking about the patient.
- You were wrong.

489
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,016
The divorce was metaphorical.

490
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,143
What about
Kluver-Bucy Syndrome?

491
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,978
Bilateral lesions
in the temporal lobes.

492
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,481
Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality
are the key symptoms.

493
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,233
Good thing he's got
that girlfriend.

494
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,159
If it's Kluver-Bucy,
his brain will melt down,

495
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,653
he'll try to swallow
his own hands

496
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,822
and she can take care of him
for the rest of his talentless life.

497
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:07,948
You owe me an apology.

498
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,950
Any rationalization
you had for meddling

499
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,743
in my private life disappeared

500
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,949
when she had good reason...

501
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,287
You're right.

502
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,583
Fact is,
nothing I said applies.

503
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,210
You had no reason
to forgive her,

504
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:24,047
therefore no reason to seek forgiveness,
no reason to be an idiot.

505
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,095
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain
the seizure or the cytokine storm.

506
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,471
Withdrawal complications.

507
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,015
Then again,
she is handing you a giant gift

508
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,462
that you don't think you deserve.

509
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,639
The fact that the MRI showed no lesions
on the temporal lobe tends to rule out

510
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,021
your "lesions
on the temporal lobe" theory.

511
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,899
The damage can be a circulatory issue,
rather than structural.

512
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,943
We wouldn't see that
on the MRI.

513
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:45,944
Foreman's right.

514
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,737
Go call your wife,
tell her you're not coming home,

515
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,657
say you have to give
a patient a cranial MR angiogram,

516
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,326
then say good night
and hang up.

517
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:20,061
Odd that a man who can't run
would own so many pairs of sneakers.

518
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,105
You mind hanging this up
when you're done?

519
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,609
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

520
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:29,446
No, you don't.
I ordered us Indian.

521
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,033
Not too embarrassing.
Just something credible.

522
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:37,037
Well, if you hand her that,
she's not gonna need you anymore.

523
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,247
If I don't hand her anything,
she'll think I'm incompetent.

524
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,459
I don't care if she thinks
you're incompetent.

525
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,336
This isn't gonna work.

526
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,129
It's worked so far.

527
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:47,923
I'm not good at lying.

528
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:48,882
I know.

529
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,760
That's why your cover is
that you want to do her.

530
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,679
I like her.
I don't want to do her.

531
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,890
Then what's the point
of liking her?

532
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,809
I meant I don't just want to do her.
I like her.

533
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,437
What do you think
you're gonna find out about her?

534
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,942
Something personal,
something embarrassing.

535
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,278
I spend half my life
negotiating with that woman.

536
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,156
Anything I can use
to scare her into saying yes.

537
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,246
Okay-

538
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,791
"Okay"?

539
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,378
You're okay with being paid twice
to facilitate blackmail?

540
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,297
I'm okay. I don't believe you.
But I'm okay.

541
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,760
You're doing this
for the same reason I'm doing this.

542
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,595
We'll see who gets there first.

543
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,936
Here it is. Circle of Willis,
the vessels are narrow.

544
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,189
Narrow for you, normal for him.

545
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,607
If there were problems
with the vessels,

546
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,132
he would have had symptoms
long ago.

547
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,861
- Not if something else changed.
- Like?

548
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,821
His heart.

549
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,781
He could have recently gotten
an intermittent arrhythmia.

550
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,450
I know "heart" and "head" start
with the same three letters,

551
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,036
but you've got to read
all the way to the end.

552
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,801
The experimental drugs
cause an arrhythmia

553
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,581
which causes low blood pressure.

554
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,250
Combine that
with those narrow vessels,

555
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,918
the brain doesn't
get enough blood.

556
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,753
That causes
all of his symptoms.

557
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,547
If we can trigger the arrhythmia
and identify it,

558
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,174
we might be able to stop it
from killing him.

559
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,095
- Been home?
- No.

560
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:21,474
Good. Do an EP study.
Find the arrhythmia.

561
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,314
We're gonna insert three
electrical catheters into your heart.

562
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,857
Tell Dr. Hadley I'm sorry.

563
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,568
She understands,
and you should tell her yourself.

564
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,133
Maybe I should tell
Heather about it.

565
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,404
You're gonna be fine.

566
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,867
She's so supportive, she's so great.
All I do is lie to her.

567
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,369
What happens if you tell her?

568
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,246
I don't know.

569
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,956
You love her, right?

570
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,333
More than anything,
and she loves me.

571
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,710
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens,

572
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,962
she either forgives you
or she leaves you.

573
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,049
At best, you wind up
exactly where you are right now.

574
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,052
It's noble to want to confess.
Really, it is.

575
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,679
But if the result's
just damage and pain,

576
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,973
that's not noble, it's selfish.

577
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,520
Stimulate right atrium.

578
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,772
Normal conduction.

579
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,149
How long you plan
on keeping me from going home?

580
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,443
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

581
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,653
one who won't do
anything stupid?

582
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,075
Guilt fades quickly.
By Wednesday, you'll be fine.

583
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,995
Right ventricle.
And why do you want it to fade?

584
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,122
Why do you suddenly care
about my marriage?

585
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,166
Because if it ain't broke...

586
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,918
You obviously think
it is broke.

587
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,461
And you obviously
think it ain't.

588
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,296
Your marriage
is like a broken toaster.

589
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,382
Bread keeps popping out,
and you keep calling it toast,

590
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,759
which is weird because you've put
your bread in a lot of toasters,

591
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:40,470
and apparently you don't see any
difference. It's kind of fascinating.

592
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,013
He's going into V-tach.

593
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:42,972
What's wrong?

594
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,183
Good news, test is working.

595
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,852
Your heart's freaking out, but it's cool
that you're still conscious.

596
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,562
Try to overdrive.

597
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,439
Didn't work.

598
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,865
This might burn a little bit.
Charging to 60. Clear.

599
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,367
Ow!

600
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,120
Going again. Charging to 120.

601
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,247
Have you been dyeing your hair?

602
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,917
- No.
- House. Clear.

603
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,252
Right.

604
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:16,589
Your hair's growing in red.

605
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,969
His heart rate is stabilized.

606
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,263
Does your theory include
any genetic mutations

607
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,682
that could cause
his hair to change color?

608
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,644
Then either
he's lying about dyeing

609
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,230
or just dying.

610
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,777
Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy.

611
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,238
Melanin affects hair color.
What affects melanin?

612
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,323
- Hormones.
- Hormone panels were all normal.

613
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,491
Age.

614
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,368
He's turning prematurely crimson?

615
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,578
A genetic disorder.

616
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,622
Waardenburg Syndrome causes
arrhythmias and can change hair color.

617
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,291
And make you deaf. Next.

618
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,544
I found a long QT interval.
I think it's Romano-Ward Syndrome.

619
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,421
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.

620
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:57,672
But not the ginger nut.

621
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,467
If he's got Romano's,
he's got at least five gene mutations.

622
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,760
It's not a big leap to think he has
others that would give him the hair.

623
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,847
It also gives him the likelihood
of sudden and unexpected death.

624
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,767
Beta blockers don't work.
His heart can't handle an ICD.

625
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,269
Pete Best.

626
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,194
Good God, has none of you
ever read a history book?

627
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,488
The original Beatles drummer.

628
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,865
A bunch of nerves
controls the tempo of the heart.

629
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,451
They're all playing in time,
except one dude who can't keep the beat,

630
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,953
wrecks the whole thing,
so we hire Ringo.

631
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,747
Pete Best was actually
a great drummer.

632
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,458
But I assume you mean the patient
needs a cardiac sympathectomy?

633
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,792
I probably should have
just said that, huh?

634
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:38,129
You start cutting nerves, you risk
his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating...

635
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,716
So he saves a fortune
on karaoke machines and deodorant.

636
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,843
You think he's stable
enough for surgery?

637
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,388
If he was, he wouldn't need it.

638
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,810
Wow.

639
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,942
- Wow.
- Yeah.

640
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,778
Do you have
any brothers and sisters?

641
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,112
One sister.

642
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,948
He told me he was
on the lacrosse team.

643
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:09,285
In high school. In college he just
cheered the lacrosse team on to victory.

644
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,870
- Wow.
- Yeah.

645
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,540
How was your relationship
with your dad?

646
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,875
Fine.
You have three more questions.

647
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,168
How was your relationship
with your mom?

648
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,336
Fine.

649
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,630
When did you lose
your virginity?

650
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:24,300
Not something I discuss
with co-workers in an elevator.

651
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,595
And...

652
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,806
And...

653
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,977
You know, don't you?

654
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,440
Bit of a wasted third question

655
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,110
'cause the answer is
"Know what?"

656
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,778
Okay, bear with me here,

657
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:47,740
because some people sometimes consider
my thought processes complicated.

658
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:51,077
I'm into you
'cause you're hot and smart,

659
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,413
in that order,
but both are needed.

660
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,039
Photos can be retouched,

661
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:58,918
and House is an evil genius,
which makes this photo suspicious.

662
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,670
And yet you're not suspicious.

663
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,714
Which means either you're not
smart enough to be suspicious,

664
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,467
in which case,
I am less interested in you.

665
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,137
Or you're not suspicious
because you know

666
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:12,015
this is actually
a doctored photo of House.

667
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,310
In which case,
I am more interested in you.

668
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,395
But I'm wasting my time
because you know

669
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,063
this is a game
we are playing on you

670
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:22,108
and I am busted
and I'm screwed.

671
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,571
I know the photo's a fake.

672
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,365
I know this is a game.

673
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,159
Sorry.

674
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,455
Too bad.

675
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,459
Good bye.

676
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:50,219
So you knew that I wasn't
gonna give you anything worthwhile?

677
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:53,264
And you were never gonna give me
anything worthwhile?

678
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,893
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

679
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,562
I wanted to screw with House.

680
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,609
By wasting my time?
That doesn't make sense.

681
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:10,281
No.
There must be another reason.

682
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:12,408
Hmm.

683
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,286
Is it okay
if I sit back down here?

684
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,167
<i>Your heartbeat's out of control.</i>

685
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,712
We need to surgically sever the
connection between your heart and brain.

686
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,174
We believe it's necessary,
but you need to know the ramifications.

687
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,093
You'll never be able
to feel angina.

688
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,303
You may not know
if you have a heart attack,

689
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,430
may not be able
to get help in time.

690
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,808
Where are my regular doctors?

691
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:37,934
Regular doctors?

692
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,894
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.

693
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,063
Why aren't they telling me this?

694
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,899
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley,
and this is Dr. Taub.

695
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:50,279
What are you talking about?
I've never seen you before in my life.

696
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,704
We can't do the surgery.

697
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,455
We're back to where we started,
visual agnosia.

698
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,207
We need to re-examine
neurological disorders,

699
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:03,209
- something slowly progressing.
- This isn't progressing.

700
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,169
It's there,
then it's not, then it is.

701
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,839
It's a new symptom, intermittence.

702
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,007
It's irrelevant.

703
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,884
Since when
is a new symptom irrelevant?

704
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,845
Since it points towards
the same disease.

705
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,596
Intermittence can fit
with Romano-Ward.

706
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,181
We still need to do
a sympathectomy.

707
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,142
Maybe we missed something, toxins.

708
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,602
When?
When you checked every bottle,

709
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,439
every can, every tube of paint,
or when you detoxed him twice?

710
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,524
Maybe there was
a batch of toxic paint

711
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,109
that he used up
a few months ago.

712
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,027
Then he would have been
sick months ago, not now.

713
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,779
He's lost weight
since he got here.

714
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,573
That's a symptom of trying
to cram hospital food

715
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,032
down a throat
he can barely get air down.

716
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,200
It's not a symptom,

717
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:40,079
but what if the toxins were stored
in his fat cells a year ago,

718
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:44,500
and now they're being
released into his bloodstream?

719
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,503
So where are you gonna
get this old paint, the city dump?

720
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,673
On his old paintings.
We know he hasn't sold one in ages,

721
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:54,051
but there weren't many in his studio.
He's hid them somewhere.

722
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,180
If you're wrong,
he could drop dead

723
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,266
from Romano-Ward at any moment.
You okay with that?

724
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,518
Just give me a few hours.

725
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:03,936
You got one.

726
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,945
I need to talk to him alone.

727
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,948
It's about your work.
Your paintings.

728
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,619
I need to look at all the ones
you've sold recently.

729
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,292
Honey, can you
give us a minute?

730
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,294
To talk about your paintings?

731
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,924
Brandon, please.
Tell me what's going on.

732
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:46,145
I've only sold two paintings
in the last three years, since we met.

733
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,106
One was to my cousin.

734
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:52,151
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

735
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,946
Two, three at a time.

736
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,121
Why did you lie to me?

737
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,623
I want to be...

738
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,587
The way you look at me,
the way it makes me feel...

739
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:16,384
I want to be what you see
when you look at me.

740
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,057
You think I'm that shallow?

741
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:28,855
When I look at you, I see you.

742
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,161
So,

743
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,958
where are the ones
you didn't sell?

744
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,965
It's not the paint,
it's the drugs.

745
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,299
He's not on the drugs

746
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,300
I know it doesn't make sense,

747
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,666
but I'm looking at his paintings
for the last six months.

748
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,597
They're normal
April, June and August,

749
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,809
but they're distorted
May, July, September.

750
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,228
Every other month,
he was having visual agnosia

751
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,356
because every other month, he was
on all three drugs simultaneously.

752
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:38,401
The statin was one month on,
one month off.

753
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,194
I don't know why the symptoms
keep coming and going,

754
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,946
but it is the drugs.

755
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,323
They're hiding
under the stairs.

756
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,117
In the fat?
That doesn't make sense.

757
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:47,482
<i>These drugs aren't fat soluble.</i>

758
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,620
I said stairs, not closet.

759
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,498
What was the last drug he was on
before the drugs he was on

760
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,749
<i>when the symptoms started?</i>

761
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,001
I'm not sure, I think...

762
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,419
Antacid.

763
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,963
- How do you know?
- It makes sense.

764
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,674
Also, I'm looking at the file.

765
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:07,638
Yes.

766
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:12,852
It's Dr. House.

767
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,937
Wake him up. We're done.

768
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:18,149
No, no, he says he needs surgery,
but not this one.

769
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,567
Did he give any specifics?

770
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:22,486
Abdominal surgery
to remove a bezoar.

771
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:27,992
It's like a hairball,
but it's made up of undigested food.

772
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,036
You can get it
if your stomach acid's low,

773
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,330
which Brandon's was
because of an experimental antacid.

774
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,708
<i>The fruit and vegetable
fibers and skins</i>

775
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,044
<i>get stuck together
and form a ball.</i>

776
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,880
<i>It gets sticky,
ferments, grows.</i>

777
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,507
<i>It starts sucking up
some of the pills he'd taken.</i>

778
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,802
<i>Some are never heard from again,
but some get released.</i>

779
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,929
<i>For the last week,
it's basically been giving him</i>

780
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,682
<i>massive doses
of all three at once.</i>

781
00:39:56,437 --> 00:40:00,066
That is why I won't
let Cameron buy a cat.

782
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,359
He should be fine.

783
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,865
Are you glad
he told you the truth?

784
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,825
Yes. Of course.

785
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:16,040
But were you happier
before you knew?

786
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,093
About 10 more feet.

787
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:30,012
I do know what it looks like,
so maybe this whole blindfold thing...

788
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,140
Shh. My gift, my rules. Bump!

789
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,185
All right,
if you don't like the color,

790
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,510
apparently we can exchange it,

791
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,980
but I'm hoping... You ready?

792
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,360
Ta-da!

793
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:48,823
Do you like it?

794
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,414
Baby, are you okay?

795
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,425
We need to talk.

796
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,285
She didn't buy it.

797
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,786
Damn.

798
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,081
So, you didn't get anything?

799
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:42,543
Nothing.
We probably overstepped.

800
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:45,337
You're really not
the cheerleader type.

801
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:49,508
On the other hand, I figured she
probably wouldn't figure me as the.

802
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:54,096
"Photoshopping a photo and planting it
in a college paper" type either.

803
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,141
Yeah. About that,

804
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,853
I took a little trip
to your alma mater.

805
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,192
You took a little trip
150 miles?

806
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:10,779
Online, by phone.
I meant I did research.

807
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,786
That's a real photo, isn't it?

808
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,333
Wow, that is humiliating.

809
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,046
There was a girl.

810
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,049
Even more so.

811
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,676
That's too bad. You wanted her
to see you in a different light,

812
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,679
and not only didn't she see it,

813
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,557
but she didn't even believe
it was possible.

814
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:43,604
You know, people hate people
who have theories about people.

815
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,822
You want me to back off?

816
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,908
Would you?

817
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,743
I barely know you.
