1
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,070
- It's way too fast.
- It felt good.

2
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,156
If we can clear the stage,
quickly please.

3
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,699
Maury, it's too fast.

4
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:32,704
It's exactly the same.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,826
Then slow it down.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,281
Everything all right, Jeremy?

7
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,747
Sure. Ready whenever you are.

8
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:38,873
From the allegro please.

9
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,006
What's his problem?

10
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,716
His back's not 100%.

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,468
He can't talk to
the conductor like that.

12
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,261
No, he can't.

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,221
She could.

14
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,479
You okay with the lift?

15
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,606
I'll be fine unless
you mess up the timing.

16
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,448
My timing is perfect.

17
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,492
Was last night.

18
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,747
Moment of truth.

19
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,521
Damn it.

20
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,526
Penelope, are you all right?

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,328
She can't breathe.
Call the doctor!

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,586
Are you gonna ignore me
all day again?

23
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,795
I help you.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,755
You tried to kill Chase.

25
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,175
Doing what you wanted,
that's all, boss.

26
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,722
- I exist.
- No, you don't.

27
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,726
I acknowledge my
subconscious exists. Now go away.

28
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,689
Saying it is one thing.
Living it is another.

29
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:14,862
You're not rational.
Not completely.

30
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,027
Put the phone on the receiver,

31
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,515
send the hookers home
and get dressed.

32
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,288
- We've got a case.
- I'm taking a personal day.

33
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,082
21-year-old star of the New York Ballet
collapsed on stage.

34
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,793
I love ballet.
But as someone may have mentioned,

35
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm taking a personal day.

36
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,006
Cuddy said get your ass
in or you're fired.

37
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,716
She's not going to fire me.

38
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,177
She's not going to fire you?
If you don't go to work?

39
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,845
- Okay.
- How long, do you figure,

40
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,181
till I just disappear?

41
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,936
Hold on.

42
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,605
No tumors or punctures
in the lungs,

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,858
no bruising,
no sign of trauma, no STDs.

44
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,195
And supplemental oxygen's
only gotten her saturation level to 60.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,364
Lungs keep collapsing
despite a chest tube.

46
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,740
ER ruled out the obvious,

47
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,617
white count and temp
are normal, so no pneumonia.

48
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,161
The coffee's burnt, Thirteen's wearing
cherry-flavored lip gloss.

49
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,747
Foreman's staring at you.
Any of that helpful?

50
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,082
House.

51
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,211
- STD?
- We just said the tests were negative.

52
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,496
- You think we should...
- No.

53
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,715
She's a dancer.
What about dehydration?

54
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,884
What about
a pulmonary contusion?

55
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,220
CT showed no inflammation
on the lungs.

56
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,305
What about dehydration?

57
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,227
BUN and creatinine
are elevated but within range.

58
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,939
Hey. I'm just
the irrational part of your brain,

59
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,441
but elevated means high, right?

60
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,069
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

61
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,115
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

62
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,400
Go treat her for the obvious.

63
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,910
IV fluids and
antibiotics for pneumonia.

64
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,083
We're like Magic and Kareem.

65
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,171
Mr. Pietramala,
you have kidney cancer.

66
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:00,301
Wow. Is that a bad one?
I mean, they're all bad, but...

67
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,804
The door was closed
for a reason.

68
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,932
Well, now it's open for a reason.
We need to talk.

69
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,101
He just told me
I have kidney cancer.

70
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,562
Then you'll obviously need
a moment to process.

71
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,022
House.

72
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,734
I'm hallucinating.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,530
I'm... I'll be right back.

74
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,204
I need you to sit in
on my differentials,

75
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,581
double-check everything I do.

76
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,041
You can't treat patients...

77
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,459
It's gotta be sleep apnea.

78
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,745
I get a good night's sleep,
and I still feel exhausted.

79
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,422
Lack of delta sleep
can lead to hallucinations.

80
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,758
Do you have any other
neurological symptoms?

81
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:41,759
Don't think so.

82
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,718
- Aphasia?
- No.

83
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,969
- Memory loss?
- No.

84
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,804
- Irritability?
- Yeah, that one.

85
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,306
Don't deflect.
He cares about you.

86
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,224
- You shouldn't be practicing.
- You care about him. Tell him...

87
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,768
- At least until...
- Enough.

88
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,814
Don't give me the look.
I told you I was hallucinating.

89
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,942
Who were you talking to?

90
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,071
Someone who's not actually here,
beyond that seems irrelevant.

91
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,865
Your mind made a choice.
It means something.

92
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,159
You know he's just
gonna keep asking.

93
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,285
Kutner.

94
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,624
Good choice. He feels bad.

95
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,875
You gonna help me or not?

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,253
Yeah.

97
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,717
I could eat from this place
seven days a week.

98
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,470
We practically do.

99
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,888
You can order tomorrow night.

100
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,766
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.

101
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,520
I have my husband's sperm.

102
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,691
Your dead husband's?

103
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,778
We froze it when
he got diagnosed.

104
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,741
And you kept it? All this time?

105
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,911
I used to think,
if I didn't find anyone...

106
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,121
You found someone.

107
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,247
I know.

108
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,042
- But...
- What if it goes wrong?

109
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,421
What if I turn out to
be a radical anarchist

110
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,882
with a secret family,
and that I age backwards?

111
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,804
Nobody plans on
getting divorced.

112
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,891
I didn't plan
on my husband dying. But he did.

113
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,604
So, you're saying
you want a pre-nup?

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,191
In liquid form?

115
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,658
What if it's not sleep apnea?

116
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,785
Trauma from your
motorcycle accident?

117
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,788
Vicodin abuse?
You need to be admitted.

118
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,665
I know you're wrong
about sleep apnea,

119
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,830
which means you know you're wrong
about sleep apnea.

120
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,878
You're scared.
Tell him you're scared.

121
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,884
I can't sleep with you here.

122
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,193
Did it work?

123
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,904
Do you see someone
standing beside me?

124
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,614
No.

125
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,740
Then no.

126
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,993
So what's next on your list of things
it's not?

127
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,205
Patient's not responding
to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.

128
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,956
So run a test to confirm
it's pneumonia.

129
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,626
We can't do a bronc
because her lungs are still collapsed.

130
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,586
Transtracheal aspiration.

131
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,630
That's basically waterboarding.

132
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,672
It is pretty radical.

133
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,175
It's a great idea.

134
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,804
Regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,807
Somewhere between
regular and you.

136
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,101
So what's the problem?

137
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,228
Everything okay?

138
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,065
No. Our patient can't breathe.

139
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,652
Either do the test
or come up with a better one.

140
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,202
So we're down to
infection, trauma,

141
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,247
MS, schizophrenia, or pills.

142
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,458
Schizophrenia usually
manifests younger.

143
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,335
That's why it's further
down the list.

144
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,463
I can confirm an infection
with a simple blood test.

145
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,049
An infection can
be treated, cured.

146
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,803
Means you've still got a job,
means you've still got a life.

147
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,639
Doesn't make it a better idea,
just a nicer one.

148
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,141
This the rational you talking?

149
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,395
Can't do this on my own.

150
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,486
When we inject the water
it's gonna feel like you're drowning.

151
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,863
But it'll be over
in a few seconds.

152
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,073
And then it'll be better?

153
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,199
A little.

154
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,326
Hold her shoulders
down a little.

155
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,583
Ready?

156
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,803
You're doing great.
Here comes the liquid.

157
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,269
Taub.

158
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,228
I slipped.

159
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,771
- Oh, no.
- What?

160
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,356
Her skin came off.

161
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,163
Her skin's sloughing off
faster than

162
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,123
we can replace it
with the artificial skin.

163
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,291
Could be autoimmune.

164
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,543
ANA was negative.

165
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,086
Focus on the lungs.

166
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,840
You want us to ignore the fact
that she's lost 80% of her skin?

167
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,093
We know it's not lung cancer.
Could be a liver tumor.

168
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,305
Eats through to the lungs.
Get an ultrasound of her liver.

169
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,182
If you find masses,
get a biopsy.

170
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,017
We can't just ignore the skin.

171
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,352
It's obviously
the most significant

172
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,228
and dangerous
symptom right now.

173
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,107
I don't think it is a symptom.
I think we caused it.

174
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,317
By doing what?

175
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,611
I prescribed antibiotics.

176
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,990
Toxic epidermal necrolysis? That's a
one-in-a-million reaction.

177
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,202
Yeah, well,
maybe this is the one.

178
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,080
Get swabs of her
old skin to confirm.

179
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,391
Where the hell were you?

180
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,892
I do have a practice.

181
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,437
Ballerina has toxic
epidermal necrolysis.

182
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,189
Are you sure?

183
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
About to be.

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,525
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,235
I feel guilty.

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,194
You didn't do anything wrong.

187
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,071
You prescribed antibiotics.

188
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,115
Any other doctor would have done
the exact same thing.

189
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,118
"Any other doctor"?
Words can hurt, you know.

190
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,873
I have no reason to feel guilty.
It doesn't make any sense.

191
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,999
Unless there's something wrong

192
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,210
in the limbic area of my brain.

193
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,378
Guilt as a symptom?

194
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,588
It's consistent with MS.

195
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:59,219
And since the blood tests were negative,
I have to apologize.

196
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,097
If I feel better, then you're right.
I'm just feeling an emotion.

197
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,560
If I feel nothing,
means my limbic brain is shot.

198
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,243
I'm Dr. House.

199
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,539
Anyone explain to you
your status?

200
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,335
They found a mass
in my liver, cancer.

201
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,337
They said they think
they can treat it.

202
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,214
And that the skin
is starting to take.

203
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,175
I'll be able to dance again.

204
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,012
She's half-dead and she's wondering
if she'll ever plié again.

205
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,056
Healthy priorities.
Let the mocking begin.

206
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,269
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:56,902
I treated you for infection
before confirming that you had one.

208
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,696
That's why you lost your skin.

209
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,826
I know you're in pain. I know
that I caused it. I'm sorry.

210
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,121
Very nice.

211
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,418
Thank you.

212
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,550
Nothing.

213
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,353
Maybe you didn't mean it.

214
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,146
I meant it.

215
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,564
Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm...

216
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,485
Couldn't. The artificial skin
was too thin, she'd bleed out.

217
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,737
Why were you talking
to the patient?

218
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,948
I think skinless women are hot.

219
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,116
Do a transjugular liver biopsy.

220
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,410
If she bleeds, at least
it stays in her veins.

221
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,874
Did you just check
with Wilson again?

222
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

223
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,383
I felt nothing. It's MS.

224
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,260
Apologies aren't supposed
to make you feel better,

225
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,761
they're supposed to make
the other person feel better.

226
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,179
In order to make
you feel better.

227
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,265
Fine. You want to do
an LP to confirm

228
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,268
or is guilt enough to start
filling prescriptions?

229
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,066
Last mass, about a centimeter
to your right.

230
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,195
Problem?

231
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,489
Short burst of flutter.
We're almost done.

232
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,491
Entering the right hepatic vein.

233
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,954
Cameron kept her
dead husband's sperm.

234
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,292
She doesn't like yours?

235
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,377
She likes his better.

236
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,797
Or at least she wants
to hang on to it

237
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,259
in case mine is
unfaithful or something.

238
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,928
Wow.

239
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,225
Advancing two centimeters.

240
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,311
You gotta let her do it.

241
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,105
If you don't, you'll be stuck
with her forever.

242
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,190
I want to be stuck
with her forever.

243
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:03,111
She married a dying guy.
She has issues.

244
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:08,825
You cannot leave her.
Ever. For any reason.

245
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,493
Because then you're
not just the guy who left her,

246
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,246
you're the guy
who killed her kids.

247
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,208
That's not a good rhythm.
Get out.

248
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,878
Narrow complex tachycardia.
She's gonna crash.

249
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,719
Liver biopsy
was negative for cancer.

250
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,638
But the procedure sent
her heart into A-Fib.

251
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,723
We don't know it was the biopsy
that caused the heart problem.

252
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,975
Maybe the heart caused
the lungs to collapse.

253
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,727
Why is Wilson here?

254
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,938
You were looking for cancer.
I thought it'd be helpful if...

255
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,397
- We didn't find cancer.
- Yes,

256
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,483
which you reported
to me five seconds ago.

257
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,151
I thought I'd let him
finish his hols d'oeuvre

258
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,653
before getting the bouncer
to take care of him.

259
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,363
Until we can
regulate the heart,

260
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,928
we can't get any
meaningful pictures,

261
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:48,949
so we can't tell...

262
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,784
Metoprolol can correct
irregular heart.

263
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,661
Tried it. Didn't work.

264
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,162
Is Cuddy making him oversee...

265
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,580
No.

266
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,583
Heart's too irregular for MRI,
other scans wouldn't...

267
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,503
Then you're
making him oversee your choices.

268
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,839
You don't trust yourself. Why?

269
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,136
Wilson, get out.

270
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,262
Are you sure?

271
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,640
Do I need your approval
to throw you out?

272
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,606
You happy now?

273
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,027
There's only one time her heart's going
to be perfectly still for our pictures

274
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,445
and that's when she's dead.

275
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,950
If it's not MS,
severe mental illness

276
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,785
and Vicodin are
all that's left.

277
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,540
Mental illness means you can
no longer practice medicine.

278
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:44,129
Vicodin means detox, which means pain.
For the rest of your life.

279
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,048
Which means you can no longer
practice medicine.

280
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,601
Are you saying we
should kill her?

281
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,728
No.

282
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,192
If we stopped her heart, we could get
our pictures and then restart it.

283
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,778
What if we can't restart it?

284
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,613
Then she stays dead.

285
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,949
We restart hearts all the time.

286
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,119
It'll take four minutes for us
to MRI her entire heart.

287
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,581
And we only have three minutes
until there's brain damage.

288
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,876
You sure about this?

289
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,002
Yeah.

290
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,758
Gonna stop her heart
so I can MRI it.

291
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:34,888
I think it was her idea. The pneumonia
was her idea, almost killed the patient.

292
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:35,972
"Her"?

293
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,140
Oops.

294
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,480
Kutner was secretly a woman,
that's why he killed himself.

295
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,567
It's Amber.

296
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,821
Your subconscious picked
my dead girlfriend?

297
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,907
Yeah, the irrational part
of my brain

298
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,075
works like the rational
part of yours.

299
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,159
How about that?

300
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,870
It raises questions.

301
00:17:58,995 --> 00:17:59,913
It answers questions.

302
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,122
Who cares?

303
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,625
I've got competing ideas.
They can't both be right.

304
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,461
Everybody gets competing ideas.
Everybody has doubts.

305
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,173
So is it regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

306
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,175
It's on the upper end
of you radical.

307
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,344
Do you have any alternative?

308
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,055
Nothing that anyone in my head
has come up with.

309
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,474
Then you're as safe
as you can be.

310
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,600
Great.

311
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,897
You get the LP results back?

312
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,524
Yeah.

313
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,049
It's a big shock.
You don't have MS.

314
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,237
But while I had your blood sample,
I checked Vicodin levels.

315
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,446
Way too high.

316
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,781
I need the pills.

317
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,200
Not an argument. He knows
that's not an argument.

318
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,701
It could still
be schizophrenia.

319
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,329
House, if you're
on anti-psych meds,

320
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,705
you're not going to
be able to practice...

321
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,998
I know.

322
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,918
You'd prefer
electroshock therapy to rehab?

323
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,337
I'd prefer something
that could actually work.

324
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,547
You're rationalizing.

325
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,006
No kidding.

326
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,844
I know that you're afraid of the pain,
but electroshock...

327
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,889
Don't give me the cancer voice,
that overly earnest tone.

328
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,310
Heart attack, stroke,
seizure, death or worse.

329
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,062
Worse? Double death?

330
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,439
You live but you damage the only thing
you care about:

331
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,191
Your rational mind.

332
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,449
I'll make some calls.

333
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,249
I'll actually be dead?

334
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,210
Just your heart.
And just for a little while.

335
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,670
Hopefully.

336
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,107
I had an idea.

337
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,943
Stop having ideas.

338
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,320
Insulin shock.

339
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,616
Yes, that's marginally
less dangerous than ECT,

340
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,035
- puts you in a coma, could cause...
- It could work.

341
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
If you had psychosis,
which you don't.

342
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,123
I have no diarrhea,
no sweating, no vomiting,

343
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,250
none of the symptoms
of Vicodin overdose.

344
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,753
Yeah, except the
"I see dead people" thing.

345
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,755
I've been popping pills
for years.

346
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,050
I've only been seeing things for days.
Something changed.

347
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,427
Vicodin addiction
is still more likely.

348
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,679
So we're no longer
dealing in absolutes.

349
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,389
House, I'll be up
in five minutes,

350
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,434
then we can talk about how you'd
rather be in a coma than in rehab.

351
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,064
Actually, if you could be up here
in two, that'd be really helpful.

352
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,065
Why?

353
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,069
Because I'm about to put myself
into insulin shock.

354
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,654
Left atrium is fine.

355
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,489
Left coronary artery also fine.

356
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,282
- We're almost at three minutes.
- Keep going.

357
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,034
- Chordae tendineae clear.
- Right atrium is fine.

358
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,744
- I gotta start her back up.
- We have some time.

359
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,913
- We're over.
- Right coronary artery is fine.

360
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,122
The three-minute threshold
is a guideline.

361
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,999
She might have less.
We have to stop.

362
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,210
What's that by the aorta?

363
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,795
- I don't see anything.
- I'm restarting her heart.

364
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,713
That's a shadow!
Two centimeters...

365
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,220
You're only scared because you know
this is going to work.

366
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,607
We're over three minutes.

367
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,616
I need glucose in here!

368
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,183
You could have died.

369
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,321
It worked. Where are my pants?

370
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,034
Are you sure?

371
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,328
She's been everywhere
I've been for days.

372
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,288
She's not here. Ergo...

373
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,874
This was not
the next rational step.

374
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,043
Now who's being biased?

375
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,545
You wanted me to detox
as much as I wanted...

376
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,799
I forgot how to do my zipper.

377
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,967
Any other
neurological deficits?

378
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:09,347
You don't seem to annoy me as much
as usual. Not sure that's a deficit.

379
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,392
And I'm all better.

380
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,231
- Is she really gone?
- Absolutely.

381
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,026
I can feel myself
repressing all kinds of icky things.

382
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,694
I check out, don't I?

383
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,701
Damn.

384
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,488
He didn't see anything.
He saw an artifact on the monitor.

385
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,670
It was a shadow on her heart.

386
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,047
She'd already been
technically dead for three minutes.

387
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:47,009
I thought keeping her alive took
precedence over prolonging the photo op.

388
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,094
Any brain damage?

389
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,429
No, all tests indicate that...

390
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,598
Obviously you had more time.

391
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,766
Best of luck.

392
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,355
I assume we can't kill her again,
take more pictures.

393
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,731
You don't want to
check with Wilson?

394
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,568
- Good one.
- It's something, a lesion.

395
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,319
Tumor, scar tissue.

396
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,029
Could be an abscess. Infection.

397
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,756
Explains why it's invisible
in the blood.

398
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,284
It's doing its damage
behind closed doors. Sealed off.

399
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,494
See, the problem
with speculation is

400
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,457
you make a "spec" out of you
and some guy named "Lation,"

401
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,749
which really doesn't
affect me at all.

402
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,043
We have to guess.
It's all we've got.

403
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,129
We can't do a biopsy.
Last time we went into her heart

404
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,214
she had a major cardiac event.

405
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,509
Which just leaves...

406
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,601
What are you looking for?

407
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:37,560
I don't know yet.

408
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:43,941
Picture doesn't change. She lies there
in pain, he sits there worried.

409
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,030
Nothing changes.

410
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,079
I just had an epiphany.
All by myself.

411
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,664
Popped into my head
out of nothing.

412
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,124
Care to share?

413
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,375
He's too devoted.

414
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,795
Too devoted?
You think he feels guilty?

415
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,005
Right, I'm being cynical.

416
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,382
People can care because they care,
and not because they cheated.

417
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,719
Theoretically true,
but gonorrhea fits better.

418
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,763
No. No STDs. We tested her.

419
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,139
You tested her blood.

420
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,641
That is the test.

421
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,726
That's not where
her problem is.

422
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,522
Gonorrhea disseminated
to her heart.

423
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,483
If it got walled off in an abscess,
it'd be invisible.

424
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,486
And would look like a shadow.

425
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,614
No need to test her again.
But we can check Prince Charming.

426
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,992
Once you confirm,
cut the abscess out of her heart.

427
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,374
Here are your onion rings,
extra well done.

428
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,750
Thank you, Molly.

429
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,211
And another beer
when you get a chance. I'm celebrating.

430
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,463
Alone?

431
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,548
Thank goodness.

432
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,181
Don't tell me, I was right.

433
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,350
Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.

434
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,060
And everyone's a winner.

435
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,311
He's not too happy about it.

436
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,897
He insists he's never cheated,
must have gotten it from her.

437
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,107
Don't think so.

438
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,233
Timing would fit.

439
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,068
He's got no symptoms
and she's dying.

440
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,945
Lying would fit, too.

441
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,030
He's not hanging out
in her room anymore.

442
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,451
What does it matter?
You were right.

443
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,817
We're prepping her for surgery.

444
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,041
I saw guilt in him.

445
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,757
If he's not actually guilty,
I wasn't right, I was lucky.

446
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:36,095
House, you made
a brilliant deduction about her heart.

447
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,389
And if I was just lucky...

448
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,487
Enjoy yourself.

449
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,867
<i>It's later than you think.</i>

450
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,705
Enjoy yourself.

451
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,501
While you're still in the pink.

452
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,632
The years go by.

453
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,179
As quickly as a wink.

454
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,349
Enjoy yourself

455
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,268
Wilson, come get me.

456
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,647
<i>It's later than you think</i>

457
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,663
I know a nice facility
outside Philly.

458
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,540
I went to undergrad
with one of the directors.

459
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,877
Thanks.

460
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,976
How many shirts do I need?

461
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,480
They said three.
They have laundry.

462
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,358
Like living with Mom again.
Delightful.

463
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,735
It's probably Foreman.

464
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,074
He's unavailable.

465
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,826
Tell him the infection's
made her septic.

466
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,786
We can't remove the abscess
until we get her BP up,

467
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,712
and it's not responding
to fluids, it's not...

468
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,289
He's off the case.

469
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,711
Patient okay?

470
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:32,837
Yeah.

471
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,422
He's lying.

472
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,932
Why don't I feel scared?

473
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,937
I'd say you're unaware
of what you're feeling at this moment.

474
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,359
I feel like crap, my life is falling
apart, but I don't feel scared.

475
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,903
Not of the rehab, anyway.

476
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,865
We've always been able
to find a way to cheat.

477
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,955
It won't work.

478
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,957
You want it to work this time.

479
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,625
Do we?

480
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,379
House, it's your only option.

481
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,841
And what do I do
if my only option won't work?

482
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,428
You don't give up.

483
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,852
It's either that or electroshock
every six hours.

484
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,813
Good night, Wilson.

485
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,900
What if we put her on
a heart-lung machine?

486
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,067
She's septic.

487
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,402
We don't need
a heart-lung machine.

488
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
We need a blood vessel
holder-together machine.

489
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,782
We could try
a high-dose dopamine.

490
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,450
It's a vasoconstrictor.

491
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,702
It'll close the blood vessels
so she won't bleed out.

492
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,705
Her heart can't take
that much dopamine. It'll explode.

493
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,999
And if we don't
use the dopamine, it'll implode.

494
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,335
Is House really done?

495
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,628
Sounded that way.

496
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,382
Dopamine it is.

497
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,737
It's late and I'm tired.

498
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,615
Can we get to the talking part
of this conversation?

499
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,203
I quit.

500
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,412
Great.

501
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,459
My nanny is off
the clock at 7:30.

502
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:39,964
So your week off, bigger desk,

503
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,677
tighter nurses' uniforms,
or whatever

504
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,137
other stupid thing
you're about to demand

505
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,098
is gonna have to wait until...

506
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,517
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

507
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,769
who makes you feel
good about yourself.

508
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,064
Screw you.

509
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,196
Don't do this.

510
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,656
I'm hallucinating.

511
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,785
From the Vicodin?

512
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,081
Ruled out everything else.

513
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:25,050
We can admit you through the ER

514
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,428
under a pseudonym.
No one has to...

515
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:31,682
I'll cheat, scam,
find some way to keep using.

516
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,267
These people know
what they're doing.

517
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,102
These people don't know me.

518
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,396
You do.

519
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,525
She's not your keeper. She has
no responsibility for you.

520
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,155
I need you.

521
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,704
Let me call my babysitter.

522
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,219
Blood pressure is 90 over 60.

523
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,304
We know.

524
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,641
I'm just saying, it's still 90 over 60.
It's holding.

525
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,351
Abscess is intact.

526
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:17,978
Doesn't look like any of
the surrounding tissue is affected.

527
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,730
She's gonna be fine.

528
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:20,898
Doctor.

529
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,372
We've got a problem.

530
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,882
Lie down.
I'll get you some tea.

531
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,303
Yeah, then I'll be better.

532
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,774
You really think she hasn't searched
this place for your secret stash?

533
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:13,200
I already did this room,
and the bathroom and your bedroom.

534
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,871
Where should I look
in the kitchen?

535
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,293
Coffee cup. In the top shelf.

536
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,422
That was a test.
I already did the kitchen.

537
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:30,217
Nicely played. She'll think
you've come clean, given her everything.

538
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:33,637
There's more.

539
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:37,224
Don't. You're hurting already.
It'll only get worse.

540
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,977
House, you should
tell me where it is now,

541
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,772
because you won't have the will
to tell me in two hours.

542
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,779
In my shoes. In the closet.

543
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,659
It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

544
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,129
It's okay. Hold my hand.

545
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,234
Am I Okay?

546
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,197
We were able to successfully remove
the abscess from your heart.

547
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,923
But the dopamine
caused the blood vessels

548
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,618
in your hands and feet to clamp shut.

549
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,539
We need to amputate or the gangrene
will spread, and you'll die.

550
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,418
My feet?

551
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,797
And your hands. I'm sorry.

552
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,803
No. I'm a dancer.

553
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,764
The tissue can't be saved.

554
00:34:58,889 --> 00:34:59,890
No.

555
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,940
We know what House would do.

556
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,442
House would have
never woken her up to ask for consent.

557
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,319
If you can't live with the answer,
don't ask the question.

558
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,321
You're saying
we should accept her decision?

559
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,281
Bold idea, I know.

560
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,283
Maybe we can get the boyfriend
to convince her to do it.

561
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,869
Yeah, boyfriends get
everything they want.

562
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,499
Forget it. The boyfriend
doesn't want to talk to her at all.

563
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,709
Where are you going?

564
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,253
Home. The case is over.

565
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,421
No, it's not.
Not until we come up

566
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,674
with something that might work.

567
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,676
It's a shame that she might die

568
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,428
because House has some personal crap
to work through.

569
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,264
Technically, if she dies,

570
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,266
it's because House
has some personal crap to work through

571
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,644
and we weren't smart enough
to get the answer without him.

572
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,204
False alarm.

573
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,998
Drink this.

574
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,375
That's your advice? Drink this?

575
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,254
It's ginger.
It'll ease the nausea.

576
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,339
You know what
would calm the nausea?

577
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,303
Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma.

578
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,183
Don't pretend
you didn't see it.

579
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,476
I saw it,
which means you saw it.

580
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,021
Send her away.

581
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,864
Too bitter.
I already have enough bitter.

582
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,073
I'll add some honey.

583
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,124
You're pathetic.

584
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,501
If you want the pill,
just send her home.

585
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:56,089
But you can't, because that would be
admitting defeat to her.

586
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,314
Now this is interesting.

587
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,275
If you take the pill,
you don't deserve her.

588
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,780
If you secretly take the pill,
you don't deserve anyone.

589
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,870
No!

590
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,495
No. No!

591
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,938
This isn't going to work.

592
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,024
It might work.
That's all we're going for.

593
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,109
Vasodilators can...

594
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,903
Big jump from reopening
to reanimating.

595
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,030
I'm out of the ulnar.

596
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,784
Not seeing any clearing.
This won't work.

597
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,953
This probably won't work.

598
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,238
Radial artery's really tight.

599
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,207
Don't go too fast. If it clots,
she loses the hand.

600
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,626
If it clots, she's dead.

601
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,590
I can't believe it.

602
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:21,883
What?

603
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,846
It might be working.

604
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,403
Can you stop?

605
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,323
The breathing.

606
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,660
Air goes in, air goes out.

607
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,287
Use your nose.

608
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,916
You're supposed to feel like crap.
You're doing great.

609
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,297
- And after?
- You come back to work.

610
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,508
What if I can't?

611
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,097
Opioid dependency
can make you think

612
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,308
you have more pain
than you really have.

613
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,603
You're going to be okay.

614
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,314
You're telling me what I want to hear,
with no evidence.

615
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,399
I'm telling you what I
believe to be the truth.

616
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,650
With no evidence.

617
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,070
You're hardly the most
unbiased observer.

618
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,363
Neither are you.

619
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,367
I'm your hospital's
biggest asset.

620
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,789
Is that why you think I'm here?

621
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,083
That's why you're here, that's why
you're lying to me about...

622
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,586
I haven't lied
to you in 20 years.

623
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,754
Sure you have.

624
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,161
Which means that
you just said that

625
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,429
because you want to tell me what
you lied to me about 20 years ago.

626
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,683
You're an ass.

627
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,060
Am I wrong?

628
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,565
I wasn't in your
endocrinology class.

629
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,529
You sat next to me.
I cheated off you in the mid-term.

630
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,823
I audited your
endocrinology class.

631
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,326
Why would you...

632
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:16,706
Because I thought you were
an interesting lunatic even then.

633
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,838
I'm not here protecting
hospital property.

634
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,725
We're alone.

635
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,355
We've been alone all night.

636
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,859
No, I mean Amber.

637
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,529
She's gone.

638
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,925
Where's Jeremy?

639
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,051
He left.

640
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,433
You Okay?

641
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,990
The surgery worked.

642
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,283
Congratulations.

643
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,040
I can't do it.

644
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,379
You have doubts.

645
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:47,714
You don't?

646
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,342
No.

647
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,429
That's

648
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,433
naive.

649
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:02,729
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you. I love you.

650
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,356
That's how I feel right now,

651
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:09,444
but I don't know.

652
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,908
I'll wait until you do.

653
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:22,374
I can't know. No one knows.

654
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,086
I do.

655
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:38,598
I'll see you in later?
I have some papers to push for you.

656
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,395
Thank you.

657
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,317
You want to kiss me, don't you?

658
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,780
I always want to kiss you.
