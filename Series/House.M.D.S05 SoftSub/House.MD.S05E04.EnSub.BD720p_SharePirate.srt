1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,758
Do you see them anywhere?

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:09,719
Why don't we go back to their house,
wait for them there?

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,430
Yeah, because they'll
probably answer the door

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,307
the 16th time I knock.

5
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,609
There they are.

6
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:30,407
Hi. I'm sorry
I followed you here.

7
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,052
I just really wish you could give me
a few minutes of your time.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,914
I know you never agreed
to make it an open adoption,

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,999
but I just figured
maybe you never had a choice.

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,710
I mean, it's China, right?

11
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,012
- What did he say?
- He wants you to leave them alone.

12
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,475
Please.

13
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:00,770
I just want 10 minutes.

14
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,814
Learn what you're like,
tell you about my life.

15
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,870
He said they have no daughter.

16
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,665
I am sorry you wasted a trip.

17
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,293
I know that's them.

18
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,047
How does that work?

19
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,262
How do I pray?

20
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,723
You make a wish
and lift the Buddha.

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,315
I wish they could understand
how badly I need this.

22
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,578
Now make the wish again.

23
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,998
If you cannot lift the Buddha this time,
your wish will be granted.

24
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,179
Are you okay?

25
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:03,017
Picked Cameron's pocket down in the ER.
Came up with a doozy.

26
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,811
Your mother called. Twice.

27
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:08,231
But she's still healthy. This
25-year-old woman, on the other hand...

28
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,149
Her messages sounded
kind of urgent.

29
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,987
Well, that's the way women sound
when their spouse of 50 years dies.

30
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,909
Your dad died? Are you...

31
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,579
Yep, fine. Our patient,

32
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,582
who's been known to take
a few drinks on non-occasions,

33
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,751
vomits blood and collapses
on a trip to China.

34
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,254
Chinese surgeons cut
out a foot of bowel,

35
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,256
but the pain is worse
now than it was before.

36
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,049
House, call your mom.

37
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,593
What are you, my mom?

38
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,637
We can continue
this differential in five minutes.

39
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:43,391
Are those bags under your eyes?
You were up all night.

40
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,642
You told her, didn't you?

41
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:49,397
I don't know what your daddy issues are,
but don't deflect them on me.

42
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,566
Told his wife
he's been getting some strange.

43
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:54,027
She kicked
his adulterous tuchus to the curb.

44
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,112
Seriously? You told her?

45
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,613
Yes, I told her,

46
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,406
but, no, she did not
kick me to the curb.

47
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,909
We stayed up late talking.
We're going to continue talking.

48
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,703
Much like House should be doing
with his mother right now.

49
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,705
Anybody read Chinese?

50
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,082
Otherwise, we have no idea
what these doctors did to her.

51
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,128
Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right?
Get it translated.

52
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,922
What about Meckel's diverticulum?

53
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,924
If the surgeons didn't remove
the diverticulum,

54
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,884
it could cause pain, bleeding.

55
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,802
Too high up for a colonoscopy.

56
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:22,597
CT could miss it.
Ultrasound's fastest.

57
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:24,349
And since I'm the fastest
with the ultrasound...

58
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,851
House.
Let me do the ultrasound.

59
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,616
You need to deal
with your dad and stop...

60
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,522
I'm not deflecting
because I'm avoiding something deep.

61
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:34,484
I'm deflecting
because I'm avoiding something shallow.

62
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,695
Seriously, I'm fine.
I didn't even like the man.

63
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,451
No Meckel's.

64
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:46,663
You there for the rice
or the re-education camps?

65
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,123
I was there to track down
my biological parents.

66
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,502
Like a salmon returning
to the stream where it was born.

67
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,129
Did you become whole again
or did you get eaten by bears?

68
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,215
They denied my existence.

69
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,721
Four parents and not one of them
taught you to cover your mouth.

70
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,308
My God, it looks like
they cut you in half.

71
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,102
Doctor, we're her parents,
I'm...

72
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,687
I'm just a technician.

73
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,852
Her doctors will be by later,
you can schmooze then.

74
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,817
Can you let them know
that we went by her apartment,

75
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,319
collected all her medications...

76
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,863
I'm a technician and a doctor.

77
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,407
You went through my apartment?

78
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,743
We found alcohol.
We thought you'd quit.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,912
- Did her drinking cause this?
- No.

80
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,457
Can you tell her it did?

81
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,259
Licorice root.

82
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,762
No, thanks, I'm good.

83
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,682
I threw it to you for a reason.

84
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:51,477
It's what the Chinese doctors gave her.
It contains glycyrrhizin.

85
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,313
They were treating her for SARS?

86
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,735
Not very effectively.
But SARS explains the cough,

87
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,238
causes hypoperfusion, which explains
the ischemic bowel. It's perfect.

88
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,115
Lung involvement
isn't very severe.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,993
Okay, well, so call it ARS.

90
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,287
Start her on ribavirin
and interferon.

91
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,714
I'm sorry about your father.

92
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,673
I'm not.

93
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,135
Are we done emoting now?

94
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,803
If there's anything
I can do, just...

95
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,307
You know, you're right.
I don't think I can sleep alone tonight.

96
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,644
Tell me that is liquid Vicodin.

97
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,229
We're giving IG shots
to everyone

98
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,065
who came in contact
with your patient.

99
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,069
Shockingly, none of the nurses
volunteered to administer yours.

100
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,322
It goes better
in a large muscle.

101
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,574
Drop your pants.

102
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,245
You know, I usually pay
tens of dollars to hear that.

103
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,920
The funeral's tomorrow.

104
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,254
My mom called you?

105
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,299
There is a 3:40 flight
out of Newark.

106
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,928
If you leave now,
you can be in Lexington tonight.

107
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:09,013
Your mother wants you
to deliver a eulogy.

108
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,517
Eulogy, from the Greek
for "good word."

109
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,646
Now if she'd asked me to deliver
a bastardogy, I'd be happy to...

110
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,398
Then be a grownup.
Call your mother back

111
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,734
and tell her
you're sick with grief,

112
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,099
but you're too busy
to be there.

113
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,695
She knows when I'm lying.

114
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,405
Then start writing.

115
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,707
I yanked my
brother and sister out of college?

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,752
Can you please tell them
I'm not dying?

117
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,463
You have SARS.
I'm wearing a mask.

118
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,091
It's a big deal.
Cut them some slack.

119
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,843
But I am going
to be okay, right?

120
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,053
That's what all
this stuff is for.

121
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,658
We're gonna need
the names and numbers

122
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,931
of everyone you came
in contact with

123
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,892
here and in China.
Flight numbers, dates.

124
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,271
That doctor that I coughed all over,
is he gonna be all right?

125
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:00,022
So far, he's fine.

126
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,705
It's back.
This is where the pain all started.

127
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,208
She's tachycardia.
Get a crash cart in here!

128
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,837
What's going on?

129
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,256
I need to know what's going on.
That's my daughter.

130
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,846
Her liver's failing.
It's not SARS.

131
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,118
I am not doing this
because I care.

132
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,839
Cuddy drugged me. She...

133
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,180
My mom didn't call Cuddy.
She called you.

134
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,976
I knew you couldn't stay away.
I knew you loved me too much.

135
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,603
I'm doing this for your mom.

136
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm not doing this at all.

137
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,564
If there was something
to be done,

138
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,067
I would have done it
in the year he spent dying.

139
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,320
You took my Vicodin?

140
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm in pain.

141
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,790
One?

142
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,046
So the Vicodin is my leash.
One will take the edge off,

143
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,297
but it won't give me
enough relief

144
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,424
for an escape
back to Plainsboro.

145
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,183
Where's my phone?

146
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,604
It's the team,
it's their ring tone.

147
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:08,818
Forget it.
The patient's blood is on your hands.

148
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,618
<i>House? You there?</i>

149
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,495
I'm being held against my will.
Call the police.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,289
Nicole had a clot
in the hepatic vein.

151
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,873
Chase sucked it out,
saved her liver.

152
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,167
No signs of a tumor
or venous malformations,

153
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,794
- nothing that could cause...
- She's an addict.

154
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,005
- Drugs and alcohol wouldn't...
- She's a smoker.

155
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,716
Combine smoking with
any one of a dozen genetic disorders

156
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,001
and she's a clotting machine.

157
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,427
Multiple blood clots
would tie together

158
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,178
bowel ischemia,
lungs and the liver.

159
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:38,180
<i>We need to pinpoint
which defect she has</i>

160
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,349
so <i>we can start her
on the right anti-coagulant.</i>

161
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,434
Draw blood.

162
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,395
Let's find out which genetic gift
her genetic parents gave her.

163
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,481
Thanks for calling.

164
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,987
My ring tone for you
is Dancing Queen by Abba.

165
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,037
Nicole?

166
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,625
I need to pee.
Pull over at the next stop.

167
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,132
I'll just pee on the floor.

168
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:20,097
You bought used floor mats?
That is brilliant.

169
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,186
There's a rest stop
in five miles.

170
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,118
- Cane.
- The restroom's right there.

171
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,787
You can make it on your own.

172
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,918
I suppose I could
talk about the summer

173
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,961
he decided
he wasn't speaking to me.

174
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,798
Two months. Not one word.

175
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:56,217
Anything he wanted to say,
he typed up

176
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,928
and slipped under
my bedroom door.

177
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,014
You don't want to say anything,
don't say anything, but go.

178
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,642
Tell your mom you're sad.
For her.

179
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,644
Just by being there
I'd be lying.

180
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,439
She wants to think, for a moment,
that she had a happy family.

181
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,484
So give her a gift. Lie.

182
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,696
Give me my cane,
I'll go to the damn funeral.

183
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,846
I said I'd go to the funeral.
I didn't say when.

184
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,438
We have these two categories,
inside and outside.

185
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:53,065
Patients stay inside,
then, when they're better,

186
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,733
we let them go outside.

187
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,945
Thanks, but they don't
let you smoke inside.

188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,613
So why don't you go back there

189
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,158
and give me five minutes outside?

190
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,209
Make a fist.

191
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,886
Such a beautiful day, we thought
we'd do all our doctoring outside.

192
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,557
People stare at me
any time I'm out with my family.

193
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,810
It's like a puzzle. Which one
of these things doesn't belong?

194
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,770
Belonging is overrated.

195
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,399
I was adopted by a white family
when I was nine.

196
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:40,446
I like being different. The view's
better from the outside looking in.

197
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:48,245
Must be easier to be different
when you're a success.

198
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,582
Is that a problem?

199
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,043
This is why we prefer inside.

200
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,430
You actually keep a flashlight

201
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,682
that doesn't need batteries
in the trunk?

202
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,977
Next to the jacket,
emergency water,

203
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,939
nail clippers,
toothbrush, space blanket.

204
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,982
When things go wrong,
I like to be ready.

205
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,779
Will you please hold the flashlight
for a minute?

206
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,627
You know, those aren't
just my car keys.

207
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,837
My house keys
are on there, too.

208
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,589
Amber gave me that key chain.

209
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,216
No, she didn't.

210
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,760
Not unless your pet name
for her was "Volvo."

211
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,273
A man who would lie about a gift
from his dead girlfriend...

212
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:01,777
ls probably responding to a childish,
pointless act of petulance.

213
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,613
The struggle to resist one's captors
is never pointless.

214
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:11,287
Well, I hate to break it to you, Che,
but simple delay won't work.

215
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,039
Your mother will hold the funeral
till we get there.

216
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,753
My father was a punctual man,
beholden to time.

217
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,715
Two minutes late for dinner,
you didn't eat.

218
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,260
My mother would never disrespect him
by starting the funeral late.

219
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:30,556
Yeah, you clearly have no issues
to work through.

220
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,143
Come on, forget the keys.
Call a locksmith.

221
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,894
We'll go inside
and play Guess that Smell

222
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,314
with the truckers
while we're waiting.

223
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,857
Join me on the dark side.

224
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,944
Dark side's done, House.

225
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,655
I'm delivering you to your mother,
and that's it.

226
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,200
I've moved on.

227
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,649
What do you think
House would send?

228
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,835
The Gentle Comfort arrangement
or the Warm Thoughts bouquet?

229
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,213
I mean, if he wasn't an ass.

230
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,550
Send one of those giant cookies
shaped like a coffin.

231
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,053
His mom would believe
it was from him.

232
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,013
I didn't tell you
so you could send anything.

233
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,459
Just wanted you to know
the extent

234
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,600
to which the man is disconnected
from the human race.

235
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,102
Took a six pack of FFP
to stop the oozing.

236
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,395
She's bleeding and clotting?

237
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,606
Plus schistocytes on her smear
means it's DIC,

238
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,649
which means she's got cancer.

239
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,108
She's young.
It could be leukemia.

240
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,194
Normal WBC
makes that less likely.

241
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,737
Belly pain points
toward a GI tumor.

242
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:27,946
House already
did an ultrasound.

243
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,824
He wasn't looking for a tumor.
Go run a CT.

244
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,701
I don't buy it.

245
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,412
CT can find small intestinal cancers
that an ultrasound...

246
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,872
I don't buy House.

247
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,419
When my father died, I wound up
killing a patient. And I hated the man.

248
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:46,674
Whatever House says or doesn't say,
I'm sure the guy's a mess.

249
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,345
So he was a bastard.
He was still your father.

250
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,640
You're biologically programmed
to have feelings for him.

251
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,433
No, I'm not.

252
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,560
Feelings aren't rational.

253
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,145
I know you have trouble
with anything

254
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,398
that can't be
quantified and counted.

255
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,608
He's not my biological father.

256
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,823
I figured it out when I was 12.

257
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,076
Of course. You're a brilliant,
socially-isolated 12-year-old,

258
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,911
and you create
a parallel universe

259
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,663
in which your life
doesn't suck.

260
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,415
I looked at the facts.

261
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,044
First of all, he was deployed
on training exercises off Okinawa

262
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,796
during the time
I had to be conceived.

263
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,508
And since you're 150 years old,
air travel was impossible.

264
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,511
His second toe was
longer than his big toe.

265
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,971
Mine isn't.

266
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,099
This is sad. You don't believe
your mother screwed around.

267
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,685
I have a distinctive
red birthmark on my scalp

268
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,229
that matches a certain
friend of the family.

269
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,733
If you believed this story, you wouldn't
be telling me about his birthmarks,

270
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,444
you'd be telling me
about the genetic testing you had done.

271
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,696
And since you haven't mentioned it,
obviously, you didn't do it,

272
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,323
because you don't want to...
House, what are you doing?

273
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,660
Get your... Get off the...
There's a cop.

274
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,542
Uh-oh!

275
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,630
<i>Nicole, lie still.
This will only take a few seconds.</i>

276
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,259
One-millimeter cut
through upper abdomen.

277
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,137
She was adopted when the parents
thought they couldn't have kids.

278
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,430
Then they had three more.

279
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,640
She took the message as,
"Thanks for playing,"

280
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,434
"but we have our
real children now."

281
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,811
And the real children
probably think they were accidents

282
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,021
while she was hand-picked.

283
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,939
Everybody's got problems
with their parents.

284
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,150
She's an addict.
Something went wrong.

285
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,070
And it has to be the parents?
Magnifying pancreas.

286
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,676
I'm not saying
the parents screwed up.

287
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,409
You're saying you like her, so you
don't want her faults to be her fault.

288
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:41,497
But they're someone's fault, and
the only other people you know are...

289
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,959
I think we may need
to call House again.

290
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,798
You lost track of your speed?

291
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,969
I think that was Hitler's excuse,
"Lost track of the Jews."

292
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,554
No one held him responsible.

293
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,931
I'm not playing, House.

294
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,390
You were protecting me.

295
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,477
Anybody in their right mind
would have ratted me out.

296
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,729
I'm just trying
to speed things along.

297
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,856
You are going to this funeral.

298
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,576
Make it fast. I don't want to miss
the anal cavity search.

299
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,745
Looks like a mass
in the pancreas.

300
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,413
<i>Not to me. This is radio.</i>

301
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,207
And I want a full play-by-play.

302
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,959
It's fluid-filled.

303
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,210
Could you get out of the car,
please, sir?

304
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,815
Officer, if you want to give me
a ticket, I totally understand.

305
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,422
Just get out of the car, sir.

306
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,258
- <i>Cyst?
- Large cyst.</i>

307
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,759
Something going on there?

308
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,303
Wilson's getting arrested.
How large?

309
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,889
SUV-sized or mid range-sedan?

310
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,474
Seriously? What did you do?

311
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,810
I'm obviously joking.

312
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,187
If Wilson was getting handcuffed
on the hood of his car,

313
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,106
would I be carrying
on a differential?

314
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,191
Diameter's at least
eight centimeters.

315
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,944
Is it in the tail or the head?

316
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,112
<i>The head.</i>

317
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,406
You, too, sir, out of the car.

318
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,908
We've got a construction site.

319
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,119
A steamroller is plowing...

320
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,413
Out, now.

321
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,252
No cane.

322
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,893
James Evan Wilson. There's a warrant
for your arrest in Louisiana.

323
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,862
What are the traits
of a steamroller?

324
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,281
Powerful.
Maybe pancreatic cancer.

325
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,241
Great idea.
Except the only symptom

326
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,036
it matches up with
is being steamroller-ish.

327
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,722
You don't think House
is onto something?

328
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,664
I think he thought
he had an idea.

329
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,835
I also think his metaphors are tough
enough to decipher after he's said them.

330
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,480
We need to be focusing
on the medicine.

331
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,630
No answer.

332
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,257
There's not going to be an answer.
They've been arrested.

333
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,342
He was joking.

334
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,427
He reacted to
the size and location.

335
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,180
That's what we should be focusing on,
not playing Madlibs

336
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,683
while our patient's exploding "noun"
destroys her life-sustaining "noun."

337
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,310
I'll try to get Wilson
on the line.

338
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,022
What if it's not how
a steamroller works, but what it does?

339
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,565
Clears things.

340
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,610
It's a waste of time.

341
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,245
I need that phone call.

342
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,373
I'm a doctor.

343
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,709
When someone tries to call you
three times, it's code for.

344
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,087
"Pick up the damn phone
before someone dies."

345
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,506
I'm sure there's other
smart doctors.

346
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,091
You'd be surprised.

347
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,885
You told me you'd
taken care of this.

348
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,470
I did.

349
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,639
The first words
you ever said to me.

350
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,683
I took care of it.

351
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,601
You must have
screwed up somehow.

352
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:56,525
Sir? Not to hurry you,
but we need to be at a funeral in...

353
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,695
Nobody is going anywhere
or taking any phone calls

354
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,780
till I hear back
from Louisiana.

355
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,949
It's a really old warrant.

356
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,394
Isn't there a statute of limitations
on this kind of thing?

357
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,162
It's suspended
when you flee the state.

358
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,833
I didn't flee the state,
I left the state,

359
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,668
because I don't
live in the state.

360
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:18,839
And the charges were
just so minor...

361
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,801
"Vandalism,
destruction of property, assault..."

362
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,178
There is a simple explanation.

363
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,514
There was a medical convention
in New Orleans.

364
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,433
You don't need
to explain to me.

365
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:30,758
I was fresh out of med school.

366
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,328
I didn't know anybody
at the convention.

367
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,522
You heard the man, Wilson.
You don't have to explain.

368
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,566
I am not going to sit here
wasting time

369
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,235
just so you can avoid
your father's funeral.

370
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,114
He's my father.

371
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,408
I have the right
to avoid his funeral.

372
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,243
Not if your mother's alive,
you don't.

373
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,914
Okay. Explain.

374
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,876
Did House react
to the eight centimeters?

375
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,920
He whistled. It's huge.
Anyone would think so.

376
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,089
House doesn't whistle
because he's impressed.

377
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,091
Means he wasn't expecting it.

378
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,385
Means he changed his mind
at that point.

379
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,180
A single super-sized cyst
ruled out a diffuse process,

380
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,681
like scleroderma or lupus.

381
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,475
Rule out diffuse process,
you're stuck with single process,

382
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,185
affecting just the pancreas.

383
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,312
Gallstones
or pancreatic divisum.

384
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,355
Whatever he asked next
would have narrowed that down.

385
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,565
He asked about location.

386
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,609
Heads, it's gallstones.
Tails, it's divisum.

387
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,944
It's at the head.
She's got gallstones.

388
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,696
The steamroller means
potholes, means...

389
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,490
Relax. We got it.

390
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,617
You figured out
she's got gallstones?

391
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:35,457
I was at the hotel bar,
trying to unwind with a drink.

392
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,710
There was this guy
who kept playing

393
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,214
Billy Joel's <i>Leave</i>
a Tender Moment Alone on the jukebox.

394
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,049
<i>Leave a Tender Moment
is a good song.</i>

395
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,176
It's a great song.
He was out of line.

396
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,678
<i>Not as good as Scenes
from an Italian Restaurant or...</i>

397
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:52,724
So I asked the man to stop.
Politely.

398
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,726
Yeah, you yelled politely.

399
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,937
I was polite
the first couple of times.

400
00:23:57,062 --> 00:24:00,524
But courtesy made no impression
on this ass.

401
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,737
So I threw a bottle
into the mirror,

402
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,657
which successfully
conveyed my message.

403
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,493
And smashed
a 10-foot antique mirror.

404
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,955
And set an example for two
other patrons, who threw shot glasses...

405
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,165
I had nothing
to do with that fight.

406
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,501
The assault charge
was totally bogus.

407
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,087
And I paid for the mirror.

408
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,547
I think I have the picture.

409
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,968
I assume you're the guy
who was playing the song.

410
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,470
No, I was the guy
who bailed him out.

411
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,181
That's how we met.
I was in jail.

412
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,476
This guy was a total stranger to you,
and you bailed him out?

413
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,436
It was a boring convention.

414
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,272
I had to have somebody
to drink with.

415
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,649
And there's the foundation
of our entire friendship.

416
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,694
If you hadn't been bored one weekend,
it wouldn't even exist.

417
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,738
Hey, with 3,000 people
at that convention,

418
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,991
you were the one I thought
wasn't boring. That says something.

419
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,493
It also says something that you lied
to me about getting the charges dropped.

420
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,246
I got a lawyer, he cut a deal.
You didn't call the guy?

421
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,915
You have to show up at the arraignment.
Everybody knows that.

422
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,793
Everybody
with your misdemeanor experience.

423
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,753
You can go.

424
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:04,963
What?

425
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,757
He's a fugitive from justice.

426
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,302
That whole story was lies.
He stabbed a man.

427
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:14,014
Louisiana doesn't want to pay
to get you back.

428
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,142
Forget Louisiana.
He was driving recklessly

429
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,311
through your comatose village.

430
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,646
What, do they put lead
in the jelly donuts here?

431
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,565
Stop acting
like such an ingrate

432
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,109
and go pay your respects
to your father.

433
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,530
CT confirmed gallstones.

434
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:35,035
Normally not dangerous, almost everyone
has them, but sometimes...

435
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,328
They kill you?

436
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,039
Yup. Unless I take them out.

437
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,665
We do it laparoscopically.

438
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,835
Um...

439
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,381
How long has her urine
been brown?

440
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,383
Kidneys were fine
this afternoon.

441
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,843
They're not now.

442
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,305
It's not the gallstones.

443
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,602
Well, of course
it's not gallstones.

444
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:01,978
Who thought it was gallstones?

445
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,188
You said "steamroller."

446
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,190
I also said
"construction site."

447
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,943
Gallstones could cause
a pancreatic cyst.

448
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,154
Just turn around.
The thing is two hours over already,

449
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,156
and that's the third time
we've passed that colonial

450
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,325
with the cross
burning out front.

451
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,785
I'm not lost.

452
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,412
I'm not talking about
what caused the cyst.

453
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,289
I'm talking about
what the cyst caused.

454
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,249
<i>Everything-</i>

455
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,209
Cysts are symptoms,
not diagnoses.

456
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,921
Unless it's a multiple cyst
with connections to other organs.

457
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,256
Like a steamroller.

458
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,383
That's a long road
down to the kidneys.

459
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,885
How do we prove it?
Won't be visible on a scan,

460
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,512
Chase isn't gonna go
groping around

461
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,797
when she's got kidney failure.

462
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:37,889
Bubbles.

463
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,058
- Is that your new stripper name?
- Yes.

464
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,978
And also, we inject bubbles into
the cyst and follow where they drift.

465
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,104
If they end up in her other organs,

466
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,022
we know you're right,
cut it out, she's fine.

467
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,233
Bubbles is right. Go echo.

468
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,737
I'm not lost.

469
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,423
Nicole, you gotta stay still.

470
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,841
I'm nervous.

471
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,844
You're not nervous.
It's the DTs, isn't it?

472
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,473
I haven't had a drink
since I got here.

473
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,895
Good heavens.
We haven't missed it after all.

474
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,939
It's like the end of
<i>A</i> Christmas Carol.

475
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,369
I'm so glad you're here.

476
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:46,791
It's a load off of my mind
just to see you.

477
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,170
Thank you, James.

478
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,047
Mom, how could you
delay the funeral?

479
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,633
Honey, your dad is dead.
He's not going to care.

480
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,510
Do you know what
you're going to say?

481
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,763
I don't know.
Just let the minister,

482
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,556
or one of his buddies
from the Corps...

483
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,849
You're talking.

484
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,976
I don't care
that you didn't like him.

485
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,771
He was your father
and he loved you.

486
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,273
The war is over, Greg.

487
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,735
Please do this for me.

488
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,907
Stop looking so worried.

489
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,702
I know he's gonna
make me proud.

490
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,747
I'm sure you know him better
than I do.

491
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,921
Her liver's been compromised.

492
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,547
And the DTs
will cause her muscles

493
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,966
to continue to twitch,
even under sedation.

494
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,052
We need to paralyze her
to do this procedure.

495
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,678
I wanted to stop.

496
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,806
A phenobarbital coma
will not only allow us

497
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,392
to inject the cyst,
it'll treat the DTs.

498
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,019
When she wakes up,
she won't be in withdrawal.

499
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,772
We've seen her through
withdrawal before.

500
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,941
We've seen her
through everything.

501
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,069
We've been supportive,
we've been combative.

502
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,279
We've picked her up from bars
in the middle of the night,

503
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,740
we've let her spend
the night in jail.

504
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:08,123
I used to say it would be okay,
that I'd get it together.

505
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,958
I don't say that anymore.

506
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,087
Let's make you healthy.

507
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,297
Then we'll worry about
making you sober.

508
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,593
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

509
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,929
I am not talking.

510
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,851
We were strangers.
We shared some geography 30 years ago.

511
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,311
Right.
He had no influence on you at all.

512
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,939
The father who was compulsive
about punctuality.

513
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,609
His issue, which I deliberately
made not my issue.

514
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,445
Thereby making it your issue.

515
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,655
Compulsively showing up
four hours late,

516
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,533
ignoring discipline,
ignoring rules...

517
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,160
Oh, God. He's here.

518
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:46,494
Who's here?

519
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,914
The one you're pretending
is your father?

520
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,043
Nice pick,
he looks like Sean Connery.

521
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,423
So, back when you were devising
this fantasy, did you tell your father?

522
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,633
"Dad, I refuse
to recognize your existence"

523
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,053
"because I've chosen
James Bond as my dad?"

524
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,265
I used different words.

525
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,392
What?

526
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,104
Hearing your own son
hates you so much

527
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,982
he's replaced you in his mind?

528
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:19,110
That's gotta suck.
How did he take it?

529
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,029
I already told you.

530
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,406
He didn't speak to me
for a summer.

531
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,501
It means more to me
than I can say

532
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,336
to have all of you here today.

533
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:43,801
And now our son, Gregory,
would like to say a few words.

534
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,098
Greg?

535
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,953
There's a lot of people
here today,

536
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,080
including some from the Corps.

537
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,750
And I notice
that every one of them

538
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,753
is either my father's rank
or higher,

539
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,090
and that doesn't surprise me,

540
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:29,764
because if the test of a man is
how he treats those he has power over,

541
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,060
it was a test my father failed.

542
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,899
This man you're eager
to pay homage to,

543
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:45,405
he was incapable of admitting
any point of view but his own.

544
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,617
He punished failure, and he
did not accept anything less than...

545
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,840
He loved doing what he did.

546
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,011
He saw his work as some kind of

547
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,888
sacred calling,

548
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,684
more important
than any personal relationship.

549
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,900
Maybe if he'd been a better father,
I'd be a better son.

550
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:30,158
But I am what I am because of him.
For better or for worse.

551
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:36,080
And I just... I just wish...

552
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,827
Put it back.

553
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,287
Well, he's not gonna miss it.

554
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:19,415
I'm done enabling. You can't even
let them put him in the ground

555
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,584
without making it
serve your agenda.

556
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,753
You really wanna do this
in front of everybody?

557
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:25,755
You wanna punish me or them?

558
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,646
How can I still feel surprise?

559
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:45,316
You would take even this,
a moment of real human grief,

560
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,693
and turn it into a farce.

561
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:50,405
Oh, cut the crap.
You enjoy what I do.

562
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,930
I never had to force you,
you like coming along for the ride.

563
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,076
Yes, that's why
I'm cheering you on now.

564
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,413
This is about you needing
to be prepared for the worst.

565
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,415
So you become an oncologist.

566
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,209
No surprises there,
the worst happens all the time.

567
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,336
But Amber,
she was young and healthy.

568
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,713
Her death came out of nowhere.

569
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,381
Don't bring Amber into this.

570
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,841
And you weren't ready.

571
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,801
That makes you angry.
The world sucks,

572
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,469
and you didn't have time
to brace yourself.

573
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,680
What happened out there
is your show.

574
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,224
You're scared to death
of losing anyone that matters,

575
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:20,184
so you dump the person
who matters the most to you.

576
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,603
I'm not scared to death,
I'm moving forward.

577
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,523
Because no one can take away from you
what you no longer have.

578
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,818
Your father's death
is about you.

579
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,236
Amber's death is about you.

580
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,321
I can't imagine why someone
wouldn't want to be your friend.

581
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,742
Admit it. You're angry
and you're scared of losing me.

582
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,161
- I'm not angry, I'm not scared.
- Admit it.

583
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,662
- I'm not afraid.
- Admit it!

584
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,956
- I've lost people. It happens.
- Admit it. Admit it!

585
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,750
What are you, five?
Stop repeating...

586
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,961
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.
Admit it. Admit it. Admit it.

587
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,755
Come on, admit it! Admit it!

588
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,763
Still not boring.

589
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,435
Did you know I was
going to do that?

590
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
Because I didn't know
I was going to do that.

591
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,773
I know you have trouble
losing people.

592
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,400
In New Orleans,
I saw you carrying

593
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,986
this express package
around the conference,

594
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,032
and you wouldn't let it go,
but you wouldn't open it,

595
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,201
so I peeked at
the return address.

596
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,077
Diamond, Fairbarren.

597
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,496
Divorce attorneys.

598
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,165
Your first wife had just served you
with papers.

599
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,834
Did you know that
when you bailed me out?

600
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,213
Were you doing
something nice for me?

601
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,048
What did I say
about being boring?

602
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,468
We owe your mom an apology.

603
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,431
Hello. It's House.

604
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,933
<i>How'd the bubble test go?</i>

605
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,894
The problem wasn't the cyst.
It's advanced dilated cardiomyopathy.

606
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:47,480
We did a three-dimensional echo,
showed a mass in the left atrium.

607
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,273
<i>Looks like an atrial myxoma.</i>

608
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,944
But the ultrasound images are
a little grainy, so it's hard to tell.

609
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,195
House?

610
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,947
The images aren't grainy.

611
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,323
They sure look grainy.

612
00:35:57,448 --> 00:36:00,117
I've seen pictures of you
where you looked tall.

613
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,536
It's an iron overload,

614
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,746
creates speckles on the image,
makes it look grainy.

615
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,582
<i>Also makes her pancreas fail,
her blood clot, her intestines...</i>

616
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,417
Atrial myxoma is more likely.

617
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,002
MRI for a better view.

618
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,462
<i>Then call me back
and tell me you're embarrassed</i>

619
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,048
because my eyesight
is better 500 miles away.

620
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,260
<i>I need a phone number.</i>

621
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,853
I'm a doctor in New Jersey,
treating one of your clients.

622
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,480
Young woman looking for
her biological parents.

623
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,315
You know,
you could just wait for the MRI

624
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,193
to have your curiosity satisfied.

625
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:38,447
What person who is nothing like me
are you saying that to?

626
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,242
Did the parents look tan?

627
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:44,370
The disease she has is genetic,
<i>which</i> means they should have it, too.

628
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,330
They don't look more tan
than anyone else.

629
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:47,582
Discolored teeth?

630
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,251
They're farmers. Their village
doesn't even have a dentist.

631
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,461
Right. Thanks.

632
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:56,048
But if it matters,
I'm not convinced they were her parents.

633
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,008
Why not?

634
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,843
<i>Because they said
they had no daughter.</i>

635
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:02,346
The man was adamant, and the woman
seemed confused and frightened.

636
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,806
Thank you.

637
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,102
Differential.

638
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:11,105
Say you're
a middle-aged Chinese woman.

639
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,940
- Fine.
- Say it.

640
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,026
I'm a middle-aged
Chinese woman.

641
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:18,613
Girl comes to you,
says that she's your long-lost daughter.

642
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,156
Why would you be frightened?

643
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:26,454
I'm frightened because she's a threat,
maybe she knows something.

644
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,123
She hasn't seen you
since she was an infant.

645
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,625
Maybe an inheritance issue.

646
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,168
They're peasants.

647
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:37,256
Her very presence is a threat.
She...

648
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,550
What year was she born?

649
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,801
'83.

650
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,637
She's not supposed to be alive.

651
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:47,516
China introduced
the One Child Policy in 1979.

652
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,894
Say they didn't want a girl.

653
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,479
They tried to kill her.

654
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:52,844
But maybe the baby doesn't die,

655
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,024
maybe the father panics,
or regrets it,

656
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,443
takes the baby to an orphanage,

657
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,808
maybe he doesn't tell his wife.

658
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:01,781
Who freaks out like
she's seen a ghost 25 years later

659
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:02,990
when the girl shows up.

660
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,576
But why does attempted murder
from 25 years ago

661
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,411
suddenly become relevant
to her health now?

662
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,580
Maybe they gave her
something toxic.

663
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,499
It would have
to be fat soluble.

664
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,671
This is fun, isn't it?

665
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,304
Let me see the MRI.

666
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:26,347
We don't have one.

667
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,512
She started vomiting
as soon as we started the scan.

668
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,979
Then let her vomit through the MRI.
That's what nurses are for.

669
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:36,107
Her parents tried to kill her.

670
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:40,820
I don't know how, but I know it
caused her to get sick 25 years later

671
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,280
trying to lift a Buddha.
Explain.

672
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:47,827
I already had this conversation
with Wilson. Just go with it.

673
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:48,995
Poison?

674
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,329
Buddha wouldn't make it worse.

675
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,248
Maybe the weight stressed her back,
which...

676
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:55,084
Makes sense if she's never
lifted anything in her life.

677
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:58,421
She actually didn't get sick till
she tried lifting it that second time.

678
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:00,047
I'm guessing
the weight changed.

679
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,970
Anyone have Taub's pager number?

680
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,346
What's up?

681
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,140
Maybe give him a call.

682
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,351
If he tosses that switch on the MRI,
she's dead.

683
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,978
X-ray her brain.

684
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,065
Pins.

685
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,526
Push them through
the soft fontanel of an infant,

686
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:24,405
you skewer the brain,
and the hair hides the entry wounds.

687
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,865
It's the perfect crime.

688
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,470
She's had them in her
all these years.

689
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,617
What changed at the temple?

690
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,703
Same thing that changed
in the MRI.

691
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,372
<i>Shockingly,
not all religious leaders are honest.</i>

692
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,857
<i>I'm guessing these particular monks
are bilking the faithful</i>

693
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,877
<i>by pushing a magnet
up Buddha's butt.</i>

694
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,363
<i>There's another one
under the table</i>

695
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,839
<i>that'll repel or attract,
depending on how you shift it.</i>

696
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,507
<i>When she picked up that magnet,</i>

697
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,675
<i>it moved one of the pins deeper</i>

698
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,011
<i>into the sympathetic nervous center
of her brain.</i>

699
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,576
<i>This sent a signal
through the nerves</i>

700
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,057
<i>to the blood vessels
in her small intestines</i>

701
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:55,644
that caused the symptoms in China
and in the giant magnet we call an MRI.

702
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,104
She's lucky.

703
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:02,610
We're all screwed up by our parents,
she's got documentation.

704
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,158
The pins will be removed surgically,
and she'll be fine.

705
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,036
We'll wake her from the coma
after the operation.

706
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,747
Is there any way
you could not tell her?

707
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:18,125
Please. She's fragile.

708
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,213
She desperately wanted to know
her biological parents.

709
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,799
For her to find out
that they wanted her dead,

710
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,468
I don't know
what that'll do to her.

711
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,929
She may not be
as fragile as you think.

712
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,055
We know our daughter.

713
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,642
See this pin here?

714
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:38,062
It's been pressing directly
on her addiction center.

715
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:41,232
It's not her fault,
and it's definitely not your fault.

716
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:42,983
She's not who you think she is.

717
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,129
I hear your patient's
going to be all right.

718
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:10,177
Is that why you're here?
A colleague checking up on a patient?

719
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,431
Something going on?

720
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:15,724
I'm celebrating.

721
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,152
My mom hated him, too.

722
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,865
Your DNA test showed no match?
That's incredible.

723
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,159
At the age of 12,
you actually figured out

724
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:35,202
your father
wasn't your birth father?

725
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,122
That's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

726
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,833
Why should it depress you?

727
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,126
It doesn't depress me.

728
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:46,714
It doesn't make any difference at all.
That's what depresses me.

729
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:55,598
Well, I guess nobody gets to choose
who their parents are.

730
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:02,104
I'm not even sure anymore
we get to choose who our friends are.

731
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:11,155
I spoke with Cuddy.
She hasn't filled my position yet.

732
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,700
If you're coming back
just because you're attracted

733
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,328
to the shine of my neediness,

734
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,915
I'd be okay with that.

735
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,754
I'm coming back
because you were right.

736
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,926
That strange, annoying trip
we just took

737
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,136
was the most fun I've had
since Amber died.

738
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,350
You hungry?

739
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,487
Wilson.

740
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,780
Yeah?

741
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,951
My dad's dead.

742
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:01,664
Yeah. My sympathies.
