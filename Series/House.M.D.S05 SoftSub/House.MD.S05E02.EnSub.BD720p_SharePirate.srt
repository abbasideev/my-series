1
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,084
<i>Bring it up
about six more feet.</i>

2
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,087
<i>Okay, go ahead
and start dropping it.</i>

3
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,928
Whoa. Whoa!

4
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,054
Class is over.

5
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:17,931
What's going on? Who are you?

6
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:21,392
I'm a doctor. Did you have
a corneal transplant five years ago?

7
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,393
Yes.

8
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,604
Every other patient who had
a transplanted organ from that donor

9
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,607
is either dead or dying.
You got a purse?

10
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:31,903
I feel fine.

11
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:34,697
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

12
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:14,153
One living, one almost dead,
four fully dead.

13
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,030
Nothing in common
except their donor.

14
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,325
Carl got a new heart and lung,
liver kills him.

15
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,287
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

16
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,706
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

17
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,458
And Frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

18
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,919
he got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

19
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,629
All within eight months
of each other.

20
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,089
And in each case,
serious complications

21
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,674
came on suddenly
and without warning.

22
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,009
Which means arrhythmia,

23
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:38,428
massive pulmonary embolus,
or cerebral bleed.

24
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,680
What did Wilson do for me?

25
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,371
If the donor had an infection
that somehow slipped by screening,

26
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,313
it could lay dormant.

27
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:49,606
Five organs systems hit,

28
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,609
would need five infections for it
to somehow slip by screening.

29
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,737
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

30
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,780
made me see the colors
I never knew...

31
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,346
None of the donated organs were hit.

32
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,284
Means whatever they got
came from the donor's blood.

33
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,410
That wouldn't help us
narrow down what...

34
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,954
It narrows down who.
Corneal transplants are bloodless.

35
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,200
Means Apple's gonna be fine.

36
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,167
You secure enough in that
theory to send her home?

37
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,628
Guess we could wait till we figure out
what's wrong with Frank.

38
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:15,340
On the other hand,
Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh,

39
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,985
and how many colors are there, really?

40
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,343
Once you've got
red, blue and green...

41
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:21,262
He paid for your lunch, liked
monster trucks and was your conscience.

42
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,263
Autoimmune disease.

43
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,515
ANA at autopsy
of all four victims were normal.

44
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,143
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

45
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,354
Antiphospholipid antibodies normal.

46
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,480
Then that leaves cancer.

47
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,689
Cancers have names.

48
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,192
They have a progression.
They affect specific organs.

49
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,612
Bone cancer can't turn into
liver cancer. Forget cancer.

50
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,615
It's cancer.

51
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,700
It's not cancer.

52
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,585
You're right, of course.
What was I thinking?

53
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,246
No single type of cancer
blew up three organs in the chest

54
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,082
while also herniating
the fighter's brain stem.

55
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,125
- The fighter's irrelevant.
- You don't like coincidences?

56
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,795
It'd be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

57
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,004
had nothing else
wrong with them,

58
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,840
like being an idiot, which leads
to getting your head knocked off.

59
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,008
The others had cancer.

60
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:03,096
Four autopsies and about 1,000 lab tests
say it's not cancer.

61
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,098
Redo the 1,000 tests
and the four autopsies.

62
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,266
Taub and Kutner, check out the donor,
find out which cancer...

63
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,895
He didn't die of cancer. His head got
chopped off in an industrial accident.

64
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,022
Find out which cancer
would have killed him.

65
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,187
Check the home and office
for carcinogens, toxins...

66
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,192
He's been dead for four years.

67
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,236
I assume his home has been rented
to someone else by now.

68
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,071
Find out which cancer
killed them.

69
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:23,950
Did I forget you?

70
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,828
You can check out
the patient's eye.

71
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,049
You can put this on Dr. O'Shea.

72
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,801
And some chips.

73
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,804
- Forget your wallet, House?
- No.

74
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,225
I'll take care of it.

75
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,729
Check.

76
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,565
Why are you following me?

77
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,737
Word is
you're into monster trucks.

78
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,739
- My kids like it.
- But not you?

79
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:06,325
Predator's okay, but I think
the California Crusher is over-rated.

80
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,709
Are you checking me out?

81
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,877
You're astute.

82
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,839
- No.
- How many pills did you just take?

83
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:23,092
Vicodin, opioids, some B12.

84
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,053
Need a little kick
in the afternoon.

85
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,680
You got a problem with that?

86
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,892
I think I'm falling in love.

87
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,393
Her right eye's failing.

88
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,020
No, it's not.

89
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,946
Everyone else's transplanted
organs were fine.

90
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:36,981
Means her eye is fine.

91
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,146
We need to remove the eye.

92
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,817
It's her only working eye.

93
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,487
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

94
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,614
I thought
this way was less insane.

95
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,993
Do you have some ethical problem
with what I'm doing

96
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,578
that you can express
in a unique way,

97
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,288
which might actually make me think
that I'm wrong,

98
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,706
even though
I'll never admit it?

99
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:54,665
Yes.

100
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,293
You are funny.

101
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,880
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

102
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,045
<i>You want to come over and watch
Prescription Passion</i>

103
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,092
at my place tonight?

104
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,635
You know I'm not gay, right?

105
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,261
Neither am I.

106
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,430
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

107
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,932
I'm not coming over
to your home.

108
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,683
I'll grow on you.

109
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:20,608
"L-P-E..."

110
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,902
Do I have to be
in the same room with him?

111
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,613
Whatever he's got, you've got.
Fifth line.

112
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:26,948
Are you sure?

113
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,117
Pretty sure. Fifth line.

114
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:34,497
Am I going to die?

115
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,125
Could we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

116
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,835
Like, maybe, the fifth line.

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,340
"F-E-O-S-P."

118
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,302
Damn.

119
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,721
I'm sorry.
We need to remove your eye.

120
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,265
MY eye?

121
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,435
A moment ago, you thought you were
dying. Blind is actually good news.

122
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,645
Unfortunately, he's wrong.

123
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,105
You just did the test...

124
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,565
But she didn't squint.

125
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,130
Which means the eye
thinks it's fine.

126
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,067
It was wrong.

127
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,944
I know. But the eye doesn't think.
The brain thinks.

128
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,572
Which means thinking's wrong,
the brain's wrong.

129
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,448
Which means
it's spread to the brain.

130
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,993
Which means it's too late
for us to remove the eye.

131
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:16,622
Which means we're gonna have to
remove your whole head.

132
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,292
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt.

133
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:29,343
Hallucination.
That's a brain thing, right?

134
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,473
Five hundred different things
can cause hallucination,

135
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,892
doesn't mean it's neurological.

136
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:39,520
It does if one of the other
organ recipients also had a brain issue.

137
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,022
Did he just drop his hands?

138
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,024
No. None of them
had brain issues.

139
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,610
If his pupils dilated,
if his pupils were fixed,

140
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:46,736
if there's a twitch...

141
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,821
He got hit in the head, he died.

142
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,615
No mystery,
that was your point.

143
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,243
Yesterday. You live, you learn.
Who shot this?

144
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,495
The guy who runs the gym
has a camera.

145
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,497
Uploads the nasty stuff online.

146
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,417
Can't see the dead guy's face.

147
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,920
If I can't see his face,

148
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,005
can't see the twitch,
can't see the pupils...

149
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,090
We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

150
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:11,093
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

151
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,179
and then somehow
tie both those things

152
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,388
to the construction
worker's liver,

153
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,183
and then possibly meander over
to Frank's pancreatic failure.

154
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:21,145
But nothing causes
simultaneous brain and heart problems.

155
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,480
Cancer made no sense.

156
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,649
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

157
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:25,983
That makes no sense.

158
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,573
I know. I was making a point.

159
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,451
Oh, good,
I thought you were an idiot.

160
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,538
Why are you talking?

161
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, what? The guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

162
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,087
I might be a genius
who just happens to have

163
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:49,173
a passion
for fixing coffee machines.

164
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,342
No, I'm obviously not,
but that's rude

165
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,511
to make assumptions
about people.

166
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,138
Donor's history came up clean.

167
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,059
Did he just laugh?

168
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,686
No, no, I sneezed.

169
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,813
He's a genius coffee repairman.

170
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,274
A coffee repairman
who wears Argyle socks?

171
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,777
I thought I already talked about
not judging.

172
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,283
What kind of idiot wears Argyle socks
with construction boots?

173
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:20,746
I'm not an idiot.
I'm just not good at disguises.

174
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,457
Who is he?

175
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,502
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

176
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,337
Why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

177
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,048
Because I wanted to find out
what you guys found out

178
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,800
before I found out
what he found out,

179
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,428
so I can find out
if I need a private investigator.

180
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,471
So, new.

181
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,515
The donor has no history
of unusual infections,

182
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,600
no international travel
in the 12 months...

183
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,815
Well, seriously,
that's how I sneeze.

184
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,361
He was in Madrid
and the Bahamas.

185
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,904
Credit card receipts
showed no...

186
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,989
The girlfriend paid.

187
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,035
There is no girlfriend.

188
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,473
She was his high-school sweetheart.

189
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,160
High-school sweetheart is married
to his best friend.

190
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,872
I know.
She had a kid four years ago.

191
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,123
Timing fits.

192
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,291
She's still pretty hot, though.

193
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,616
You find out anything medical?

194
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,461
Kid has a tummy ache.

195
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:11,714
Also, the dead guy
was exposed to mercury,

196
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,050
mold and anhydrous perchloric acid

197
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,635
because their sex pad was
next to a garage that was demolished

198
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,596
after those toxins were found.

199
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,059
Oh, yeah, that will be $2,300.

200
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,644
I'll get you a check.

201
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,063
No, I don't take checks.

202
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,773
You think I'm gonna
stop payment?

203
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:32,777
- Aren't you?
- Of course I am! $2,300? It's insane.

204
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:35,321
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing match

205
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,739
from four different angles.

206
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,492
30 percent of the crowd
paid by credit card. I got their names.

207
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,701
Four of them
had digital cameras,

208
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,704
which I composited like NASA did
for the pics of Mars.

209
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,539
You know, the rovers and all that.

210
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,837
<i>Pupils were dilated.</i>

211
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:52,922
But he didn't drop his hands,

212
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,131
means he maintained
muscle tensity...

213
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,466
Say it.

214
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,551
You were right.

215
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,886
God, that was petty of me.

216
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,179
He maintained muscle tensity,

217
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,145
but was momentarily distracted
when he got hit.

218
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,421
That's a temporal lobe seizure.

219
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,226
Does that Pl guy mean
we don't have to break

220
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,472
into people's homes anymore?

221
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,020
It's the whole reason
you went to medical school.

222
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,355
I'm not gonna take
that away from you.

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,440
He's better than we are.

224
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,399
He costs more.

225
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,067
I'm gonna biopsy the brain.

226
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,110
No.

227
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,194
Say it.

228
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,946
You were right. But, no.

229
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,950
Temporal lobe controls
speech, hearing, memory.

230
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,618
She loses those things,

231
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,703
she's gonna be a terrific date,
but beyond that...

232
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,747
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable,

233
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,834
nothing to hear, nothing to say,
nothing to look back on.

234
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,795
You're right.
She has so much to live for.

235
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,674
Do we have another patient who is
almost finished with all their living?

236
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,552
So it's okay to stab his brain
because he's old?

237
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:43,305
No, it's okay to stab his brain
because he's dead if you don't.

238
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,182
Get the widow to say yes.

239
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:47,893
No.

240
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,729
The lung inflammation is a complication
of the pancreatic failure,

241
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,440
which is reversible.

242
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,358
This is actually
his best chance.

243
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,651
If we can find
out what's wrong...

244
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,820
How can a test
that will probably kill him...

245
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,779
I didn't say...

246
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,282
You said it was extremely risky.
What does "extremely" mean?

247
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,700
Please.

248
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,413
I'm sorry. I can't.

249
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,498
I have a husband.

250
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,084
I have a two-year-old daughter.
Her name is Julia.

251
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,627
You'd be saving her mother.

252
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,048
I think you're lying.

253
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,302
You haven't had one visitor, not
one phone call since you've been here.

254
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,137
Does she have a child?

255
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,185
No, but her life is still worth...

256
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,478
More than my husband's?

257
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,396
I lied to save my life.
Wouldn't you?

258
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,106
Not at another human being's expense.

259
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,858
No, you just rob me
of my only chance

260
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,985
so your husband can struggle to breathe
for a few more days.

261
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,570
Just shut up!
I don't want to hear...

262
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,571
- Ladies...
- ...from you anymore.

263
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:41,655
- You want to hate me...
- Shut up!

264
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,782
- ...so you won't feel guilty.
- Frank!

265
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:44,628
Give me a scalpel.

266
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,660
Frank!

267
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,886
He's coding.

268
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,139
Clear.

269
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,766
Clear.

270
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,226
Clear.

271
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,727
- Frank!
- Clear.

272
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,313
Clear.

273
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,190
Clear.

274
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,700
- Did you get the consent?
- No.

275
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,912
Tell Foreman to get it.
Old people are scared of black people.

276
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,705
It won't matter.
Patient's dead.

277
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,963
Save the brain.
I don't need consent for an autopsy.

278
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:07,866
Well, at best, we're gonna bat
one for six on this one.

279
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,368
Thin slices
through the parietal

280
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,911
and temporal lobes were clean.

281
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,122
Occipital and frontotemporal
regions were also...

282
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,374
Brain's clean. Moving on.

283
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,711
To where? We've gone from
making no sense to making less sense,

284
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,116
and then taking
a step backwards.

285
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,425
Each of these people were killed
by one thing that attacked one organ.

286
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,884
But never the same organ.

287
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,428
Could the donor have had
two things wrong?

288
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,054
Or six things wrong?

289
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,182
Metabolic diseases specialize,

290
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,935
everything else specializes,
but cancer plays the field.

291
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,186
You're back to cancer?

292
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:39,231
Metastasis is just a fancy word
for "screws around."

293
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,317
- Any type of cancer?
- I don't know.

294
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,985
There would be
evidence of cancer.

295
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,528
There is.
We just haven't found it, yet.

296
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,448
You need it to be cancer so you
have an excuse to talk to Wilson.

297
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,118
Give me something else that explains
this constellation of patients,

298
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,364
then you can call me an ass.

299
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,245
I didn't call you an ass.

300
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,872
Perforated intestine.

301
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,084
If this thing started as normal bacteria
living in the intestines,

302
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,419
but got into a blood vessel

303
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,463
through a vascular anomaly
in the bowel wall,

304
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,633
then they would affect every organ
through the bloodstream.

305
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,968
Screws up everything.
For everyone.

306
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:14,391
Okay, it's a long shot.
It is possible I'm an ass.

307
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,519
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

308
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:20,522
We checked Apple inside and out
when she came in. She's clean.

309
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:21,899
Anomaly would have
to be intermittent

310
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,359
or they all would
have died within a day.

311
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,195
If she starts getting abdominal pains,
shove a tube up her rear

312
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,571
before it can get away.

313
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,490
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

314
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,866
Everyone else is dead.

315
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,825
Not everyone.

316
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,788
The one thing this donor gave
to each of these people was his DNA.

317
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,123
Anyone else have his DNA?

318
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,712
You want to do a colonoscopy
on a healthy four-year-old?

319
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,130
She has a tummy ache.

320
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,465
If Kutner's right,
it's not a tummy ache.

321
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,512
It's a fatal brain or heart or lung
or liver or pancreas ache.

322
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,597
I'm not gonna scare the hell
out of the poor kid's mom

323
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,433
because of a long-shot corollary
to a long-shot theory.

324
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:03,649
Fine. Tell her the truth. Then ask
if Daddy knows who the real daddy is.

325
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,208
Does she have to be awake?

326
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,502
We need her to
tell us when it hurts.

327
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,714
She'll get over it.

328
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,508
Your husband might not have.

329
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,851
What if a kid wants ice cream?

330
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,478
Sign outside says "closed."

331
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,689
Dr. O'Shea's not right for you.

332
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,023
What did you find out?

333
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,349
Why are you investigating him?

334
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:51,572
Because I need to know
if he lends money interest-free.

335
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:52,577
What did you find out?

336
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,492
I want some ice cream.

337
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,620
Not until you learn to read!

338
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,041
You're supposed
to trust friends.

339
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,210
I don't know the guy.
I've got no logical reason...

340
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,130
To be his friend? Have you never seen
an Afterschool Special?

341
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,631
That is part of the pleasure
of friendship.

342
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,675
Trusting without
absolute evidence,

343
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,386
and then being rewarded
for that trust.

344
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,846
You're taking pictures of a guy

345
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,611
who's having an affair
with his own sister

346
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,725
and you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust?

347
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,352
There are two types
of people that hire me.

348
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,229
No, actually, there are three types
of people that hire me,

349
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,939
but the third type's irrelevant
to the point I want to make.

350
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,692
Do you have a special rate plan
for being a pain in the ass?

351
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,486
One type wants to find
out that they're right,

352
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,412
one type wants to find
out that they're wrong.

353
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,447
Which type am I?

354
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:34,823
You're the third type.

355
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,492
You lead with
the irrelevant types?

356
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,160
You're the type who doesn't care
if you're right or wrong

357
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,526
because they've hired me
to investigate the wrong person.

358
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,663
That's an actual type?

359
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,248
You want me to
check out Wilson.

360
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,491
You want to find out if he's...

361
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,661
How do you know about Wilson?

362
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,545
What do I do for a living?

363
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,589
You've been checking me out?

364
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,300
Have I been paying for that?

365
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,010
So far you haven't
paid for anything.

366
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,805
You want to find
out if he's pining.

367
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,515
You want to find out
if there's something about him

368
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,320
that will tell you
he's going to come back.

369
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,393
Or something you can use
to make him come back.

370
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,857
Is there?

371
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:15,322
No. No, there's nothing. Sorry.

372
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,496
That will be $900.

373
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,213
I gotta go.
I'll get you a check.

374
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,432
Colonoscopy was clean.

375
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,268
Then that just leaves cancer.

376
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,061
The fact that the kid's
colonoscopy was negative

377
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,271
doesn't prove anything.

378
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,857
Yes, the fact that it
didn't prove anything

379
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,502
didn't prove anything.
Excellent point.

380
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,485
We don't know
if the kid inherited anything.

381
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,405
Even if she did, Kutner's theory
is that the thing's intermittent.

382
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,740
The opening would have to be open
shortly before death.

383
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,618
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

384
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,621
until shortly after death,
and that seems like an obstacle.

385
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,665
What if there was
a way around that?

386
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,918
Then we're kind of
all sweating over nothing.

387
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,004
Not around death,
around death as an obstacle.

388
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,006
We need to see
his colon at work.

389
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,383
You do know what
"death" means, right?

390
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,676
Without a living system,

391
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,002
there's not enough pressure
to get fluid all the way up.

392
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,515
Life, we can't create, yet,
but pressure's easy.

393
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,828
We use the same
high-pressure water jet

394
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,561
we use to test
cardiac workload.

395
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,900
I mean, he's not gonna be awake
to tell us where it hurts, but...

396
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,318
- That's not gonna...
- Do it.

397
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,630
It's kind of stuck.

398
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,006
It's more than stuck.

399
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,091
That bowel's been dead
for six hours.

400
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,469
No matter what you shoot up there,
it's closed.

401
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,107
- This is nuts.
- It's adjustable.

402
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,364
It's working.

403
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,574
Yeah. Wow.

404
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,370
Well, not much.
Increase the pressure.

405
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,750
The endoscope is bowing.
Push on his stomach.

406
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,837
Those are normal bodily fluids.

407
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,839
Yeah. Normal bodily sewage.

408
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,758
Put the pressure back on.

409
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,723
That's the end. No leaks.

410
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,642
Wait, what's that?

411
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,247
It's just dark
because I'm at the end.

412
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,522
What if you're not at the end?
What if it's a core lesion?

413
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,691
Maybe a little more pressure?

414
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,277
Not too much.
If it is the end and we...

415
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,869
<i>It's finally accelerating.</i>

416
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,955
<i>Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.</i>

417
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,790
Breathing is labored.

418
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,792
Colonoscopy's still showing no leaks.

419
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,085
What if it is autoimmune?

420
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,172
What if we don't have conversations
we've already had?

421
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,842
Four out of the five didn't linger.
They got sick and died.

422
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,386
We don't have time to dismiss things
we've already dismissed.

423
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,929
Nothing fits.

424
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,682
See, that's an example of a conversation
we've already had.

425
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,726
She's sick, something fits.

426
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:31,643
MS?

427
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,020
No!

428
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,522
Okay, from now on,
no one says anything

429
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,315
unless no one
has said it before.

430
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,912
- Where are you going?
- You guys start immunogels on her CSF

431
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,789
to look for hidden
protein markers,

432
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,125
then start sequencing her genes.
I'm going to start treatment.

433
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,668
- Treatment for what?
- Cancer.

434
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,795
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.

435
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,799
It's something. Which means
we should treat her for something.

436
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,277
She's fine. Where's her chart?

437
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,362
You rang emergency
to get her chart?

438
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,822
I know, that was bad of me.

439
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,866
But I'm pretty sure the chart's supposed
to be attached to the bed

440
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,536
so that gimp doctors don't have to look
all over the place while patients die.

441
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,838
Thank you so much. And some
peppermint tea when you get a chance?

442
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,722
I need you to sign something.

443
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,225
Consent to chemotherapy.

444
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,186
You found cancer?

445
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,145
No.

446
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,357
Then you have
tests indicating...

447
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,317
- No.
- Then why should I sign it?

448
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,902
That's a good question.

449
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:06,696
And deserves
a complicated answer.

450
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,492
Placebo effect.

451
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,744
People have confidence in doctors,

452
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,414
they have confidence in diagnoses,
confidence in medicine.

453
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,793
Sometimes they get a little better
just because they think they will.

454
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,046
And that can make us think that
the wrong answer is the right answer,

455
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,714
which is very bad.

456
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:30,178
So, you do have proof that
it's cancer but you can't tell me

457
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,598
because it might affect
the way I react to the medicine?

458
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,852
If that were true,
and it would certainly make sense,

459
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,396
do you think I could
tell you that it's true?

460
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,826
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

461
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,327
20/200 vision.

462
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:58,290
Didn't you cover all this personal stuff
with Dr. Foreman?

463
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,500
You don't care
who I used to be?

464
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,211
You're a post-corneal transplant
math teacher.

465
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,089
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

466
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,550
I was an architect.

467
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,808
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

468
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,518
The world was ugly.

469
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,441
You think the world would be
any different if your leg was fine?

470
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,027
No.

471
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,905
You think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

472
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,991
I mean, the doctors told me

473
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,661
that my life was going to be
so much better once I could see.

474
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,998
I would date, I would dance.

475
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:45,212
But the guys I hated dancing
with before, I hated dancing with after.

476
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,840
My parents were still dead.
I was still alone.

477
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,093
You're fun.

478
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,262
You don't seem
all that different.

479
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,727
I haven't given up.

480
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,609
Wilson's got a new job.
Hasn't started yet, but...

481
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,152
So, who are we following?

482
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,987
See that lady up there?

483
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,280
You point at the target?

484
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,992
No. I'm following the one halfway
in-between that point and that point.

485
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,499
Pretty. Who hired you?

486
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,501
No one. I just like her.

487
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:25,710
You're stalking her?

488
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:29,005
No, no, I followed her
out of that bookstore back there.

489
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,342
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

490
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,470
So what else can you tell me
that I might care about?

491
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:38,348
He attends this grief counseling thing
twice a week

492
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,643
where they go around the room
and cry about who's dead.

493
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,687
Cameron's been to his house
several times.

494
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:47,816
They just talk about death
and losing loved ones.

495
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,414
What... What are you...

496
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,833
If she turns her head,
she's gonna see

497
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,598
that we're walking
in the wrong direction.

498
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,004
No, no, she won't.
I'm very nondescript.

499
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,005
Well, I'm not.

500
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,090
Well, then,
you stay four feet behind me.

501
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,967
How do you know
what they're talking about?

502
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:18,138
I'm in the same grief counseling group.
I recently lost my mother.

503
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,182
You'd get laid more often
if you told them you lost a kid.

504
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,684
I didn't lose a kid.

505
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,894
You're a Pl, you can't lie?

506
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:28,023
I can lie,
I'm just not all that good at it.

507
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:32,235
Dr. (Buddy's been over to Wilson's twice
and phoned a bunch of times.

508
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,321
Foreman called him.
And the rest of the time.

509
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,698
Wilson's been reading
meditation books

510
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,534
and magazines
about restoring barns.

511
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,827
Are you following me?

512
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:41,953
- No.
- No.

513
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:42,912
Are you lying?

514
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,497
- No.
- Yes.

515
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,666
Lesson one, commit.

516
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,752
It's making me uncomfortable.

517
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:49,878
Sorry.

518
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,132
<i>You' re very New! -</i>

519
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,508
More uncomfortable.

520
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,261
She's not your type.

521
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,305
Your type is much
stupider than her.

522
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,390
What did Wilson say about me?

523
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,767
You've never come up.

524
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,103
In the grief counseling,
or in the other...

525
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,939
Anywhere. I got three bugs in his home
and one in his car.

526
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,109
If I didn't know you,
I wouldn't even know you existed.

527
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,694
Which is good news.

528
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,060
Only two things you ignore,
things that aren't important,

529
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,283
and things you wished weren't important,
and wishing never works.

530
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,466
She's better.

531
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:37,801
I could tell at once.

532
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,969
Vomiting is a side effect
of the chemo.

533
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,263
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

534
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,599
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

535
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,309
I guess it's working.

536
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:49,187
Can't believe it. It's cancer.

537
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,563
It's not cancer.

538
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,079
Labs show
that our patient is healthier.

539
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:09,416
She's gonna get sicker.
Then she's gonna die.

540
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,209
- I brought Thai food.
- What did you see in her?

541
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,462
Nothing. It's not cancer,
all the tests say it's not cancer.

542
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,131
They've always
said it's not cancer.

543
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,091
Treatment proves it's cancer.

544
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,843
Treatment proves
it could be cancer.

545
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:20,802
It's not cancer.

546
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,303
This was your diagnosis.

547
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,304
I never thought it was cancer.

548
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,931
You treated for cancer.

549
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,016
I thought that what she had
acted like cancer.

550
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,977
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it would respond like cancer.

551
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,770
It did. Because it's cancer.

552
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:34,983
We have to find something that
walks like cancer, talks like cancer,

553
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,735
tastes like cancer,
but isn't cancer.

554
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,405
No, we don't.
Better is better, who cares why?

555
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,158
I do. And so does Tetrault.

556
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,325
Who?

557
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,036
- The dead tuba player.
- Tibalt.

558
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,999
The point is, he died last,
but he died,

559
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,167
which means she's gonna die, too.

560
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,294
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

561
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,130
There's a cancer drug
that's used off-label for arthritis.

562
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,548
There's no record of arthritis.

563
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,467
Did you interview
all the tuba students?

564
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,385
If he had joint pain in his hands,
he couldn't have played.

565
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,678
Then it wasn't in his hands.

566
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,054
Then why do we care
about his students?

567
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,599
One of them is Canadian,
brought him methotrexate,

568
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,058
so he could hide his arthritis.

569
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,644
He already couldn't
afford his insurance.

570
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,230
And that little piece
of business cost me $700.

571
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,596
I'm gonna pass it on
to the patient with a steep mark-up.

572
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,568
This makes no sense.

573
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:19,694
I know.

574
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:25,283
She's dead, unless we can find
what's cancer, but not cancer.

575
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,333
Something's missing.

576
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,965
I need an epiphany.

577
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,223
What are you billing out at?
$300 an hour? Here's $400.

578
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,058
There are other oncologists.

579
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,268
Better oncologists.
But I need you.

580
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:00,735
Let me describe the symptoms,
problems, issues,

581
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,278
and you say whatever
you feel like saying

582
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,239
until something triggers
an idea in my head.

583
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,281
That's not the way it works.

584
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,116
You have a way
of thinking about things.

585
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,620
It's sloppy, it's undisciplined,
it's not very linear,

586
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,873
it complements mine, drives me
down avenues I wouldn't otherwise...

587
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,792
House, please go away.

588
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,044
Cancer, but not cancer,

589
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,547
responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no...

590
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,637
How are you?

591
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,935
Don't do this, please.
Please don't do this.

592
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,396
I'm trying to move on.

593
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:43,570
By hanging out with Cameron, and talking
to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me?

594
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,118
Lull

595
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,913
I paid a private investigator
to spy on you.

596
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,208
You didn't.

597
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,669
You want to move on from me,
you gotta deal with me, talk to me.

598
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,212
You had no right.

599
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,965
We're not friends anymore.
There's no trust to be breached.

600
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,094
I can have you followed,
I can call you names, tell your secrets.

601
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:12,974
Foreman did a CT.

602
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,477
Temporal and frontoparietal regions,
normal. Occipital lobe, normal.

603
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,647
I have the right
to walk away from you, House.

604
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,900
There is a world beyond you,
you need to realize that.

605
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,696
And even if you don't,
I'm moving on.

606
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,949
The next time you knock,
I'm not answering.

607
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,372
Nothing yet. Keep talking.

608
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,134
I'm sorry.

609
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,430
You charge me for listening in
on my own conversations?

610
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,349
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

611
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,642
How many friends do you have?

612
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,060
Seventeen.

613
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:59,771
Seriously? You have a list?

614
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,065
No, I knew this conversation
was really about you,

615
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,150
so I just gave you an answer
so you could get back

616
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,735
to your train of thought.

617
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,946
Well done. I have one. Had one.

618
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,823
Friends are important,
you're gonna miss...

619
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:11,949
Shut up.

620
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,119
Friends allow you
to not sit in a room by yourself.

621
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,537
Are you charging me for this?

622
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,247
- Are we friends?
- No.

623
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,624
Then, yes.

624
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,459
Do you want to be my friend?

625
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,624
No. You scare me a little.

626
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,750
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me.

627
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,756
We can talk,
we can be two human beings talking.

628
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,008
I'm with him.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

629
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,052
Yes, you did.
I was in the middle of a sentence.

630
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:34,263
Yes, I did.
You were repeating yourself.

631
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:35,932
I'm grateful. Make your point.

632
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,267
It's like that "cancer, but not cancer"
thing you were talking about.

633
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,770
Friends are friends,
customers are customers,

634
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,772
and everything else
is everything else.

635
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:44,440
If it's not,
nothing is nothing.

636
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,446
And anything can be anything.

637
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,493
10:10, stop the clock.

638
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:56,494
What?

639
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:59,205
The world is not as ugly
as she thinks it is.

640
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,171
Cancer, but not cancer.

641
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,426
It doesn't make
any sense, unless...

642
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,637
Brain, but not brain.

643
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,223
Occipital lobe's normal,
but her eyes suck.

644
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:18,891
That lobe should
be compensating.

645
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,393
Since it's not,
that tells me that

646
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,937
something's in there
that shouldn't be in there.

647
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,857
Brain, but not brain.

648
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,150
Why are you in my office?

649
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:30,528
To find the anomaly, I need
to chop off the top of her head.

650
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,030
Pretty sure I need
your approval for that.

651
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,575
I'm going to trust
your first instinct.

652
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,952
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

653
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,955
I'm ordering her cancer treatment
to be continued.

654
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,960
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

655
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,254
Cancer stem cells are real.

656
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,839
They explain everything.

657
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,549
They're like
embryonic stem cells,

658
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:52,633
they can become
whatever they want.

659
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,969
The donor had them,
the recipients got them.

660
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,013
<i>They floated around,
they landed on an organ,</i>

661
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,474
<i>got bathed in cytomes,
partially differentiated.</i>

662
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,726
<i>And the key word
there is "partially."</i>

663
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,270
<i>In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.</i>

664
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,689
<i>In the tennis player
they became heart, but not heart.</i>

665
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,566
<i>Stop me if you've
figured out the pattern.</i>

666
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,567
<i>They looked as
if they belonged,</i>

667
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:11,013
<i>but they weren't
doing their jobs.</i>

668
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,154
<i>And when they were
really needed, boom.</i>

669
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,532
Chemo worked
because the cells were basically tumors,

670
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,075
chemo shrunk them.

671
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,580
You're still gonna say no,
aren't you?

672
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:23,956
You have no proof.

673
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:24,961
I have the brain scan.

674
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,501
The normal brain scan.

675
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,461
This is why I need
to take off her head.

676
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,213
To treat?
Or to prove you're right?

677
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:31,214
To treat.

678
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:35,134
Chemo's not killing anything,
it's just hiding the real problem.

679
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,469
She's gonna crash.

680
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:40,181
If we wait until she does crash,
it might be too late.

681
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,600
So, the next step is what?

682
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,686
I say no, and then you do
something to make her crash,

683
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,147
so that I'll think
you've proven your theory?

684
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,440
I would never do that.

685
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:50,817
No. You won't.

686
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:16,944
She's crashing.

687
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,780
<i>You might want to check her IV.</i>

688
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:06,744
<i>From here, it looks like saline
instead of chemo.</i>

689
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,038
Yeah, they look identical.

690
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,248
<i>Still,
you should probably check.</i>

691
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,753
You switched her meds?

692
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,922
<i>How could I? I had no access.</i>

693
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,590
Close her back up.

694
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,133
<i>Do the surgery.</i>

695
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,301
There's no reason.

696
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,011
<i>There's no reason not to.</i>

697
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,389
<i>The stupidly dangerous part
is already over with.</i>

698
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,265
We're ready
with the neural net.

699
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,581
Is that someone's brain?

700
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,875
Except for the part
that isn't brain.

701
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,383
Hey, that's the patient I...

702
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,636
You said she'd be fine.

703
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,304
I'm a better liar than you are.

704
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,181
I swapped her meds.

705
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,474
I mean,
she's got a brain problem?

706
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,810
- I could have killed her.
- Yeah.

707
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,606
The neural net will show us
how fast her neurons are firing.

708
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:21,777
If there's something in the way,
say brain that's not brain,

709
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:25,281
her normal neural impulses
will be sucked into a vortex,

710
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,658
because they're
unable to do their job.

711
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,160
The computer
will then process it,

712
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,662
give us a picture
of where to cut.

713
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:32,913
Cool.

714
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:34,707
Excuse me?

715
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,293
Sorry, I thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

716
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:41,422
You think all this is amazingly cool
and you have no one else,

717
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,800
so you're paying a guy to listen.

718
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,179
Sorry, just trying
to save you some cash.

719
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,221
I'm on the clock?

720
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,222
Yeah, why wouldn't you be?

721
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,058
You think this is
interesting to me?

722
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,726
<i>House.</i>

723
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:57,104
I see it. Can you get it?

724
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,606
I think so.

725
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:01,067
Turns out you didn't kill her.

726
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:05,029
Cool. You owe me $5,000.

727
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,755
Why are you just standing there,
Dr. House?

728
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,843
How'd you know who it is?

729
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,179
I can smell you.

730
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,433
Yeah,
like you're a field of roses.

731
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,816
Peppermint tea.

732
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,360
You ever hear
of the boy who cried wolf?

733
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,570
Never really bought that.

734
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,365
I don't care how often a kid cries
he's being eaten by a wolf,

735
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,075
Mom's gonna come running.

736
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,165
The world is ugly.

737
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,336
People kill, they go hungry.

738
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,384
Just proving a point.

739
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:15,391
People are asses.

740
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:16,976
Why are you telling me this stuff?

741
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,854
Because the world isn't as ugly
as you think it is.

742
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,898
Your transplanted cornea is fine,
your eye is fine,

743
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:26,026
but your brain
wasn't working right.

744
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,362
I'm gonna take the gauze
off your eyes now.

745
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,282
- It's gonna be bright.
- I know.

746
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,826
The brain cells
that weren't brain cells

747
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:37,955
were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

748
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,167
After the transplant,
you could see, but not see.

749
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,502
I could see, I could read.

750
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:48,382
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray. I don't know.

751
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,302
What I do know
is that you were not seeing

752
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:52,845
what everyone else was seeing.

753
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,557
And now? Things are gonna be

754
00:41:58,184 --> 00:41:59,310
beautiful?

755
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:02,021
Things will be what they are.

756
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,501
How do I look?

757
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,799
You look sad.

758
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,406
Hey.

759
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,327
Is there any way
I could put you on retainer?
