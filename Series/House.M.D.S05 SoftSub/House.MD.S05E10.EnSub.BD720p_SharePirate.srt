1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,840
Do you want a lean body for summer?
Well, the time to start is now.

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:09,678
No gimmicks, no crash diets,
and absolutely no drugs.

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:11,596
Think healthy, and be healthy.

4
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,722
You can start now,

5
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,184
just pick up the phone
and become the best you you can be.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,770
Cut! Going again.

7
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,647
Sorry.
Did I mess up the commercial?

8
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,148
No, it's fine. Are you okay?

9
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:24,776
I think it's cramps.
Oh! I'm burning on my side.

10
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,320
Sit down, take a few minutes
and catch your breath.

11
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,697
Everybody else, keep running.

12
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:29,656
We're not filming.

13
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,283
We don't do this for the cameras,
we do it for ourselves.

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,010
We can't go again
with him sitting there.

15
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,622
Fine. But that felt phony.
At least let me get a little workout,

16
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,457
maybe if I'm breathing
as hard as they are

17
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,793
I won't seem like
such an evil taskmaster.

18
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:43,586
All right, take five, guys.

19
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:46,756
How you feeling?

20
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,133
I think I'm ready to do this.

21
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,720
You sure? That's it.
That's the way to fight through.

22
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:56,224
All right, concentrate on those knees,
lean into it and lift.

23
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,977
- Lifting. Lifting. Lifting.
- Come on, push it!

24
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,020
Come on,
you're almost at the top.

25
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:04,482
Those eight steps are the difference
between fat and thin.

26
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:10,113
Seven, six, five, four, one more.
Nice job!

27
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,699
Feel that burn?

28
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,659
That's your body
carving out its new shape.

29
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:15,660
New shape.

30
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,705
Don't sit, just take it slow
on the way down.

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,206
On, boy.

32
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,421
Are you okay?

33
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,223
You Okay?

34
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,643
Any idea why we're getting
half as many requests for you as usual?

35
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,311
Democrats' health care plan?

36
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,022
At least we have one case
that looks intriguing.

37
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,399
30-year-old fitness trainer
suddenly can't breathe,

38
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,610
collapses and breaks her ankle.

39
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:34,280
That's it? You're not gonna argue
why this case is beneath you?

40
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,991
No point, I'm in an elevator.
I can't run away.

41
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,868
You can't run away anyway.

42
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,537
That's just mean.

43
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,795
Why are we still together?

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,047
We are going to our office.

45
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:55,385
Pronoun confusion, starts kicking in
once you pass the childbearing age.

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,138
Now that's just mean.
My office was recently destroyed.

47
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,100
I thought I'd use the office
of the doctor directly responsible.

48
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,685
I think the patient
holding the gun to my head

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,450
was actually the one
directly responsible.

50
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:09,357
My desk won't fit in his cell.
You can use our outer office.

51
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,787
Where's Foreman and Thirteen?

52
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,455
Own in the R.

53
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,261
Thirteen started
her clinical trials today.

54
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,695
What's Cuddy doing
in your office?

55
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,502
Other than throwing off
the fang shui

56
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,047
with her ass that faces
all eight sides of the Bagua at once?

57
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,591
These walls aren't soundproof.

58
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,925
I'm well aware.

59
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,927
Normal CT means
that her lung problem

60
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,388
has the distinction of having
nothing to do with her lungs.

61
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,516
Steroids. No one looks
this fit without cheating.

62
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,852
Anabolic steroids
hack away at the immune system,

63
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,229
left her open
to a pulmonary infection.

64
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,442
Wow. Muscles and curves.
My penis is so confused.

65
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,651
She's not on steroids.

66
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,778
Her program's all about
getting in shape naturally,

67
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,322
exercising, eating right.

68
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,865
And you know this because?

69
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,618
She has infomercials
to sell her DVDs.

70
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:02,869
What? I'm up late a lot.

71
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,164
And you actually believe
what you see on TV? Go run the labs.

72
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,167
The labs are back
and there's no sign of steroid use.

73
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,419
Can someone please
read her file?

74
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,255
Can someone please stop
back seat differential-ating?

75
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,506
What about allergies?

76
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,718
She goes jogging every morning,
inhales car fumes during rush hour.

77
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,889
Perfect, except that she was jogging
half a mile from the nearest road.

78
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,850
In the cold.

79
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:30,438
Cold air hits the lungs, sets off
an attack, exercise-induced asthma.

80
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:34,025
Nice try, except EIA doesn't
account for the elevated BP.

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,152
If you'd read the file...

82
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,031
Come on, before the shrieking harpy
melts my brain.

83
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:45,161
- Her BP's fine.
- I know.

84
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,205
Exercise-induced
asthma actually fits.

85
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,040
I know. You know.
She can't know.

86
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,708
The only good way
to test for EIA

87
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,961
is to recreate the conditions
in which the attack occurred.

88
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,589
But we can't exactly make her
run out in the cold on a broken ankle.

89
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,882
Get creative.

90
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,709
It's gonna be okay.

91
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,760
Any shortness of breath?
Tightness in your chest?

92
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,095
Feeling pretty good, actually.

93
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,221
Not even breathing hard.

94
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,466
O2 sats and lung capacity
are still well within range.

95
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,225
Cuffs slipping down,
you wanna stop for a moment?

96
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,936
Rather not.
Haven't had any exercise in two days.

97
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,022
Take it you don't get
a lot of fat in your diet.

98
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,315
I take it from your tone
you think that's a bad thing.

99
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,650
Do you ever indulge?

100
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,194
There's more to life
than indulging your every whim.

101
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,157
I didn't say "every." But a whim every
now and then can make life a little...

102
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,783
You okay? Trouble breathing?

103
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,286
No, I feel fine. Why?

104
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:16,294
No pulse. This isn't asthma.

105
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,384
There are a lot of other people
in the trial?

106
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm taking over the people that already
started it at Mercy, so I'm pretty full.

107
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,849
Stop.

108
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,352
One more time. No talking.

109
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:40,109
I shouldn't be here.
It's nepotism.

110
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,112
I know the guy running the drug trial,
so I get a spot.

111
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,658
You have Huntington's,
so you get a spot. Stop.

112
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:52,038
One more time.
Just the fingers, no mouth.

113
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,651
The point of this thing
is to improve neural cell longevity,

114
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,170
which doesn't matter much
before symptoms,

115
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,213
so you should give
my spot to someone...

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,297
Shut up.

117
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,843
Stop.

118
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,388
You can stop feeling guilty.

119
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,559
Your best tapping rate
was .004 taps per millisecond.

120
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,355
Means your nerves
have started degenerating.

121
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:38,334
You want to work in here?
Fine. Me, too.

122
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,172
We'll split the desk 50-50.
That side's yours, this side's mine.

123
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,590
You're right.

124
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,010
There's plenty of space here,
neither one of us needs all of it.

125
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:52,557
That's your strategy? Taking
the high road? It's not going to work.

126
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,642
Huh? Did you say something?

127
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,354
I couldn't hear you from all the way
over here on my side of the desk.

128
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,772
Patient's heart stopped.

129
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,233
We shocked her back to sinus rhythm,
she's stable.

130
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,944
Test didn't set it off,
her EKG was normal.

131
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,115
Well, she's consistent.

132
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,659
Lung problems have nothing to do
with her lungs,

133
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:14,078
heart problem that has nothing to do
with her heart.

134
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,913
Something is
strangling her system.

135
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,582
Carcinoid tumor.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,877
Find it, cut it out.

137
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,347
Can a leaking breast implant
cause joint pain?

138
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,642
No, and she clearly
doesn't have implants.

139
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,853
Or joint pain. What's going on?

140
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,646
Got another patient.

141
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,608
I set up an online
second opinion clinic.

142
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,611
People who don't like or trust
their doctors e-mail symptoms,

143
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,280
I can knock off four or five cases
over lunch,

144
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,574
clear two grand by e-mailing them back.

145
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,201
Ascending colon's clean.

146
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,452
That's gotta be illegal.

147
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,163
Only in nine states,
and this isn't one of them.

148
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,999
Legal notice spells out
it doesn't replace doctor's visits,

149
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,001
so there's no opportunity
for malpractice.

150
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,169
How come you haven't said
anything about this?

151
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,796
It's no big secret.
I guess I'm just not very chatty.

152
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,925
You told us when you renewed your
subscription to National Geographic.

153
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,761
Small intestine looks clean,
moving into the pylorus.

154
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,138
So you don't mind
if I tell House?

155
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,182
Actually, House may sort of mind.

156
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,143
Because I sort of set it up
in House's name.

157
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,604
Nothing in the bile duct.

158
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,732
And by "set it up in his name,"
you mean?

159
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,526
I mean, it's Dr. Gregory House's
Second Opinion Clinic

160
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,280
with medical advice
direct from Dr. Gregory House.

161
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,617
You're insane.
With two days to live.

162
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:35,743
House's never gonna find out.

163
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,370
He will if I tell him.

164
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:42,208
Or you cut me in for 30%,
and I keep your secret safe.

165
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,626
That's blackmail.

166
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,002
Yes.

167
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,799
Moving into the... Whoa.

168
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,970
That's her stomach?
It's the size of a shot glass.

169
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:58,349
Because our patient's
a big, fat cheater.

170
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,566
Subtle. No way you geniuses
could have spotted this.

171
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,653
Gastric bypass surgery,
she had her stomach stapled,

172
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,989
then had the records
from her files pulled

173
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,949
so it wouldn't ruin her DVD sales.

174
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,034
Can you do this outside?

175
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,413
I could. But that would defeat
the purpose of doing it here.

176
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,832
Where are the smart guys?

177
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,292
If you mean
Foreman and Thirteen,

178
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,586
apparently the first appointment
of the drug trial is an all-day thing.

179
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:28,879
I said yes to this?

180
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,214
Her gastric bypass
procedure could cause...

181
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,217
Forget the bypass,
treat her like a fat girl.

182
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,970
Should we treat her like
a 60-year-old Asian man, too?

183
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,179
She's not fat.

184
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:41,392
Not on the outside, but on the inside
she's still tons of fun.

185
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,646
When she was obese,
she probably had Type 2 diabetes,

186
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,398
could have left her
with permanent nerve damage.

187
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:52,153
Ten points for doing what I said,
minus ten points for doing it badly.

188
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,865
If this was diabetes-induced nerve
damage, it would've kicked in years ago.

189
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,408
Have you seen my balls?

190
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,829
Can you hold on a second?

191
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:06,042
My balls. Have you seen my balls?
The giant one and the red one.

192
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,327
Your plan isn't going to work.

193
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,544
Of course it is.

194
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,470
I try to make you miserable
to make you leave.

195
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,149
You deny that it's
making you miserable,

196
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,653
you try to make me miserable
so I'll stop making you miserable.

197
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,135
And eventually you will leave,

198
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,429
citing reasons
that have nothing to do with misery.

199
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,264
You're not bothering me.

200
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,516
Step one, complete.

201
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:28,397
I'm gonna call you from my cell.
And then I will come back in here.

202
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:32,193
Hey. Yeah, I just had to explain
to him that I had his balls,

203
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,780
and he's not getting them back.
Excuse me.

204
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,198
Sleep apnea explains...

205
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,283
Apnea would've disappeared
when she shrank.

206
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,119
Not if it destroyed
the musculature of her trachea.

207
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,872
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain,
the resulting neurological damage...

208
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,123
She been snoring?

209
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,249
She didn't mention it.

210
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,127
Did she mention feeling tired
after a full night's sleep?

211
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,087
No, but...

212
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,713
This isn't apnea.

213
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,300
And this is a stupid room
to be doing a DDX in.

214
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:07,645
Cliff notes. Gastric bypass
only makes her skinny on the outside.

215
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,814
On the inside
we have heart and lung issues

216
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,524
not caused by heart and lung issues.

217
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,818
Private area, House.
It can wait.

218
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,320
You need to consider side-effects
from her gastric bypass surgery.

219
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,655
Forget the bypass.

220
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,490
Let the dying girl finish.

221
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,450
- You said forget the bypass...
- Shh.

222
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,911
Dr. Thirteen has the floor.

223
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,289
Bypass could create malabsorption
issues, leads to low potassium.

224
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,834
Very stupid.
Her potassium is fine.

225
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,420
But her intestines aren't.

226
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:36,298
Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption
by creating a blind loop of bowel.

227
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,009
It ulcerates during exercise,
bacteria get loose in the blood stream,

228
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,469
migrate to the heart and lungs.

229
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,388
Very not stupid.

230
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,641
Bacteria in the bowels means
there's bacteria in the poop.

231
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,518
Get some and test it.

232
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,083
He could have come up with SIBO
anywhere else in the hospital.

233
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,227
You didn't need to come down here
and screw with us.

234
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:55,568
But her wrong idea led to his right one.
It was a vital screwing.

235
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,739
We think your surgery might have caused
an infection called SIBO.

236
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:06,412
A stool test will help us to confirm.
Put some of what you're full of in here.

237
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:12,042
If surgery could somehow
make you taller, wouldn't you do it?

238
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:17,256
Sure, but I wouldn't call a meeting
of the Lollipop Guild

239
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,884
and tell them they can grow
if they work real hard at it.

240
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,052
I don't tell anyone
not to get gastric bypass.

241
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,222
I tell them how to get healthy,
how to improve their lives.

242
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,975
Yeah, by telling them to do
what you were unwilling to.

243
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,685
I was willing to do anything.

244
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,980
Thyroid hormones, crash diets,
none of it worked.

245
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,024
My body was like a prison.

246
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,613
When I got the surgery, I got healthy
and when I got healthy, I got happy.

247
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,574
I'm not sure you're happy.

248
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,203
But if you are, being healthy
didn't do it, being pretty did.

249
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,746
Poop in the bedpan.

250
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,042
House's office? Really?

251
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,586
Did he send you here
to beg for it back?

252
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,111
There are dozens
of other doctors...

253
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,883
Other doctors actually use their offices
for crazy stuff like seeing patients,

254
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,469
not throwing a ball against the wall
and calling it work.

255
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,763
It's his process.
That ball saves lives.

256
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,640
Did he give you talking points?

257
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,600
Yeah, but I added
one of my own.

258
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:14,146
Don't take his office and pretend like
all you're doing is taking his office.

259
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,607
You chose his room
because you want to be there.

260
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:20,736
But sitting near him and hoping
isn't going to get it done.

261
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:26,700
Leave here now
or I'll take your office.

262
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,410
No, you won't.

263
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:35,668
The boob lady e-mailed me again,
complaining of chronic fatigue now.

264
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,003
She's convinced
the implants are responsible.

265
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,588
- They're not.
- I told her.

266
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,924
She says something is
and if I don't find out what

267
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,260
she's gonna complain
to the Licensing Board.

268
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,803
- It's not funny.
- It is.

269
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,931
You just can't appreciate it because
it's going to destroy your career.

270
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,769
What happened? Did he call Foreman
clean and articulate again?

271
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,062
It is surprising.

272
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,565
Clinic patient's just whining.

273
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,732
What's the poop?

274
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,734
It's going to take about an hour
to spin down the sample.

275
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,486
What are we looking for?

276
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,196
You don't know?

277
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,367
I'm doing my famous Socrates impression.
Think I really nailed the accent.

278
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,703
High fat content
indicates SIBO.

279
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,330
And what does fat do in water?

280
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,373
It floats.

281
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,125
And what else floats in water?

282
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,131
The correct answer is a duck.

283
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,927
If it doesn't float,
Kutner missed the boat.

284
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,230
Looks like I was wrong
to dismiss apnea.

285
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,817
You guys can stay up all night
gloating in the sleep lab.

286
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,284
What about all that scar tissue
around the implant, could that be...

287
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,494
That amount of encapsulation
is perfectly normal.

288
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,701
I gotta tell her something.

289
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,248
Tell her to find a decent plastic
surgeon who can correct the placement...

290
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,876
Yeah, that's what she wants to hear,
she's sick and she's lopsided.

291
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,210
Tell her it's a virus.

292
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,796
It probably is, and it'll
get her off your back for a few...

293
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,715
Emmy's EEG is flat-lining.

294
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,761
Where would she have gone?

295
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,226
Hey, I looked for you guys in
the control room, but you seemed busy.

296
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:19,188
Get off of there, last time you
exercised you had a cardiac incident.

297
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,357
- I feel fine.
- You felt fine last time.

298
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,567
I only slept a couple of hours
but I feel great.

299
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,693
Can I get
one of those machines?

300
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,098
You're running on
a broken ankle.

301
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,154
It doesn't hurt.

302
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,572
And your leg is bleeding.

303
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,497
You feel that?

304
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,581
What does that mean?

305
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,673
The numbness in her left foot
is ascending into her leg.

306
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,258
How'd she manage
to sneak out for a run?

307
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,011
She said she needed
to use the bathroom.

308
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,639
You two get the results
of the sleep apnea test,

309
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,265
or did those need to use
the bathroom, too?

310
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,726
Alpha waves on the EEG
ruled it out.

311
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,148
I was mixing some hydrogen sulphide
for good and valid reasons

312
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,317
and must have spilled some
on my side.

313
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,860
Did it waft over to your side?

314
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,153
Cunning plan.

315
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,989
You do realize it's going to stink
for hours, on both sides.

316
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,200
Oh! Would you look at the time?

317
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:17,538
I hope your patient isn't still sick,
forcing you to stay here all night.

318
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,877
Ascending numbness means
her nerves are breaking down.

319
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:24,837
Or her brain.

320
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,005
- Or both.
- We've gotta go.

321
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,882
Let me finish,
I'll meet you down there.

322
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,636
You were 15 minutes late yesterday.
I don't want you to develop bad habits.

323
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,842
Appreciate the life lesson,

324
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,432
but 15 minutes, give or take,
isn't going to make a difference.

325
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,144
Get started on your other patients,
I'll be down there when we're done here.

326
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,522
Way to know where your bread
is buttered, sister. Up high.

327
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,488
If the problem is in her brain,
it could be MS.

328
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,775
Or early onset Parkinson's.

329
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,778
But if it's her nerves,
it could be transverse myelitis.

330
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,655
Or a million other things.

331
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,074
We're gonna stay in the dark
until we can figure out

332
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,577
if her electrical problem
is in her power station

333
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,246
or in the high tension wires.

334
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:06,545
Power station's the brain,
wires are the nerves. Run an NCV test.

335
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,177
The test will measure
the amount of time it will take

336
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,387
this electrical impulse
to travel along your nerves.

337
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,931
- Will it hurt?
- No. Give me your arm.

338
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,308
You can ask nicely.

339
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:25,355
I learned in med school,
you don't actually cure with kindness.

340
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,943
You're right, I'm a hypocrite.

341
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,488
But I don't have a choice.

342
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,948
Not really interested
in your rationalizations.

343
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,452
If I'm open about the gastric bypass,
no one would listen to me anymore.

344
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,287
You mean no one
would buy your DVDs.

345
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:44,166
It's not about the DVD sales.
I'm helping people.

346
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,670
My clients are making themselves
healthy. They're living better lives.

347
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,216
Can you honestly tell me
you've never done anything hypocritical?

348
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,762
I'm sure you had good reasons.

349
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,435
Give me your arm, please.

350
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,652
Keep your arm raised.

351
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,156
Does this mean something is wrong
with my nerves?

352
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,451
No. It's your muscles.

353
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,788
We don't need to run this test.
It's not what we thought.

354
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,355
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate myasthenia gravis.

355
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,648
Yeah.

356
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,108
Also could be
some kind of toxin.

357
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,485
Excuse me. Are you going up
to the personnel floors?

358
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,779
I'm going to see Dr. House.

359
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,304
Do you have an appointment
with him?

360
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,157
We've been emailing.

361
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,410
Joint pain and fatigue
thanks to these.

362
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:03,704
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Oh, now this.

363
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,083
He's actually downstairs.

364
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,918
Gone. Gone for the day.

365
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,171
But we work for him,
we can set you up in the ER.

366
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,511
The antibiotics will make her feel
better, she's out of here by morning.

367
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,471
- If it is a staph infection.
- It's gotta be.

368
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,726
She has sleeves of tattoos and piercings
from God knows where.

369
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:29,605
She has muscle weakness,
could indicate myasthenia gravis.

370
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:36,737
I had the weirdest dream, you guys did
the test in a reasonable amount of time

371
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,740
and came back here
before I had time to fall asleep.

372
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,743
You guys still smell that?

373
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,371
Maybe you should just let her
have your office?

374
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,165
Or...

375
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,042
She sends one of yours to the hospital,

376
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,377
send one of hers to the morgue.

377
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,213
It's not myasthenia gravis,

378
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,258
her breathing's improving
and the weakness is in her extremities.

379
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,263
Could be a botulinum reaction.

380
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:07,225
I don't think sabotaging your
boss' office is a wise counterattack.

381
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:11,396
All that is needed for evil to succeed
is for good men to do nothing.

382
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,440
She probably used a lot of Botox
to tighten up her skin.

383
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,611
True. Could also be
any kind of heavy metal toxicity.

384
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,572
PSP or arsenic
from eating too much seafood,

385
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,824
cadmium from bad bottled water,

386
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,869
lead or nickel
from canned fruits or natural grains.

387
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,876
I don't think replacing that
was part of the renovation plans.

388
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,294
It is now.

389
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,590
Lucky for us, we can treat all those
toxins with the same thing, chelation.

390
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,478
You never showed up.

391
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,021
Get out of my house.

392
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,356
I wanted to find proof

393
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,025
that you were slipping back
into your self-destructive pattern,

394
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,902
confirm you weren't
worth my time.

395
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,447
Instead I found this.

396
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,994
You've followed
all of my instructions to the letter,

397
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,997
probably better
than any patient I have.

398
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,833
So why are you the only one
who can't show up for appointments?

399
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,918
I came down right after
I was finished with House.

400
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,295
You were in your office
with another patient.

401
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,674
And there was another patient
in the waiting room.

402
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,801
Janice.

403
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,387
I'm well aware
of what's going to happen to my body

404
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,792
over the next eight to 10 years.

405
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,308
I do not need a visual reminder
every time I walk into that place.

406
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,314
That's understandable.

407
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,943
It's human.

408
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,656
And you need to get over it.

409
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,326
Now, you show up on time tomorrow
or you don't show up at all.

410
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:59,504
Your mom is leaving. You're gonna
regret this the rest of your life.

411
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,928
The chelation didn't work,
her muscles are still deteriorating.

412
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:12,142
Rules out toxins. So what else that can
go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?

413
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,852
Why aren't we doing
this in your office?

414
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:18,065
Obviously because it would be stupid to
do this in an office with no furniture.

415
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,985
Cuddy overreacted
to my overreaction.

416
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,863
Coronaro-cardiac fistula.
Even a small hole could cause...

417
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,741
They start in the lungs,
not the heart.

418
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:32,204
And why are you leaning
on a 45 degree angle away from Foreman?

419
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:33,955
I'm sitting straight.

420
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,458
Trouble in the Land of False Hope?

421
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,628
Everything is fine.
Austrian syndrome.

422
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,590
Nice deflection, but our patient
doesn't drink, she's a health nut.

423
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,551
And even if I was a cynical guy
and thought she was a liar,

424
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:50,055
I would have done a tox screen which
would've come back negative for alcohol.

425
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,890
You should come to
these gatherings more often,

426
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,767
keep you from
looking like an idiot.

427
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,149
You making book or did something else
happen to our patient?

428
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,901
Personal.
I'll put it on vibrate.

429
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,279
Guillain-Barre.

430
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:11,159
Usually starts as a muscle pain patients
compare to the pain of over-exercising.

431
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,662
So who's paging you? Your wife?

432
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,747
Does it worry you
that she paged Kutner first?

433
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,459
Guillain-Barré fits, patient
didn't notice the initial symptoms

434
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,212
because it's no different
than how she feels every day.

435
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,423
Her muscle weakness
is the precursor to full paralysis.

436
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,094
Gastric bypass
probably set it off.

437
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:34,516
At what price beauty?
Go start her on plasmapheresis.

438
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,608
<i>She put the lime in the coconut.</i>

439
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,193
<i>She drank it all up.</i>

440
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,572
<i>She put the lime in the coconut
She drank it all up.</i>

441
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:52,534
Deedee? Can you stop singing?

442
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,413
Musical automatism, she could
be having a partial seizure right now.

443
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,455
You need to get House.

444
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,707
Deedee!

445
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,126
Yelling at her is not gonna be
an effective treatment.

446
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,545
She's faking.
It's a cry for attention.

447
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,005
Her brain could be misfiring.

448
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,924
Right, a rare neurological disorder
is far more likely

449
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,217
than a cry for attention.

450
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,511
I mean, nothing about this woman
screams "look at me."

451
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:14,097
On the other hand, look at her.

452
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:20,812
She needs a full neurological work-up.
Get House.

453
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:28,695
Ultimate irony. I killed myself
trying to make myself healthy.

454
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,990
You're not dying, okay?
This disease is manageable.

455
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,077
Better start getting used
to that wheelchair.

456
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,495
Self-pity doesn't suit you.

457
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,705
Just take me down to the...

458
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,500
No.
You're strong enough to walk.

459
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,420
Come on, get your ass
out of bed and walk.

460
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,311
Could be an aneurysm,
we've got to control her blood pressure,

461
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,188
start her on
a calcium channel blocker.

462
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,774
Or you could tell House.

463
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,359
I can't tell House.

464
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,818
You'll be in trouble.

465
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,612
On the other hand, she's sick.

466
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,780
She's singing.

467
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,991
And bleeding out of her ears
and losing her hair.

468
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,701
And an aneurysm doesn't explain
her joint pain.

469
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:17,869
Wilson's disease does.

470
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,287
No Kayser-Fleischer rings.

471
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,330
Anorexia.

472
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,748
Now you're just desperate.

473
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:25,085
Biliary tumor causing
paraneoplastic syndrome.

474
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,298
That might actually fit.
I'll scan to confirm.

475
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,301
- You'd do that for me?
- You don't have the time.

476
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:37,681
Which means I can ask for 25%
of your income and you'll give it to me.

477
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:49,150
You going over the fence?

478
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,570
It took three visits,
but I finally convinced the contractor

479
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:57,075
that I'm Cuddy's boss and all the office
renovation plans need to go through me.

480
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,286
You did do the math
on this, right?

481
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,788
Screwing with her office
means her renovations will take longer,

482
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,915
means she'll be
in your office longer.

483
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,795
See there? I'm having a bidet put in
instead of a toilet.

484
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,548
Not in addition to, instead of.

485
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,633
You want to know
what happened to the old toilet?

486
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:17,304
She'll be with you
where you claim to not want her.

487
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,224
I smashed it
with a sledgehammer.

488
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,518
I think
in some ancient cultures

489
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,396
that was actually considered
a proposal of marriage.

490
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:32,485
Is this fun for you?
Analyzing everyone else's fun away?

491
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,572
Ask her out,
it'll cost the hospital a lot less.

492
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,246
I brought some visitors.
Cheer you up.

493
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,125
It's okay, come on in, guys.

494
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,669
We're all staying on your plan.
Nobody's cheating.

495
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:53,673
That's great. You're on my arm.

496
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,386
We found out about your gastric bypass.
How could you lie to us like that?

497
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,348
The doctors told you?
You're really hurting my arm.

498
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,267
You're not the best you
you can be.

499
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:08,229
You're a fraud.
You're a self-hating fat person.

500
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,522
You're really hurting me.

501
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,024
Feel the burn.

502
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,693
Burn. Burn.

503
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,153
Help. Help!

504
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,031
Burn. Burn! Burn!

505
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,741
- Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
- Help!

506
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,497
Get off of me!
Get off of me! Get off of me!

507
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,173
Mood congruent hallucinations.

508
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,716
Means it's not Guillain-Barré.

509
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,552
Which means whatever it is,
it's now in her brain.

510
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,390
Where are you going?

511
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,558
Sorry. Treatment.

512
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,770
Does Foreman schedule your appointments
by numbers on the clock,

513
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,605
or just by when
I'm in the middle of something?

514
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,526
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time
for you. Could be CNS lymphoma.

515
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,237
So losing the 200 pounds
was just a coincidence?

516
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,034
What about a prion disease?

517
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,831
If her brain is slowly turning
into a Swiss cheese,

518
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,874
there's not a lot we can do.

519
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,752
There are some
possible treatments.

520
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,796
Get a brain biopsy to confirm.

521
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,632
You are not cutting
into this woman's brain before you test.

522
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,717
That is the test.

523
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,265
Not for CNS lymphoma, which is
a perfectly legitimate diagnosis,

524
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,600
one you can test for non-invasively.

525
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,769
You're, obviously,
not opposed to being invasive.

526
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:34,607
Rule out CNS lymphoma first,
then rule out astrocytoma,

527
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,317
then rule out
other brain tumors...

528
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,405
I hereby declare them
ruled out.

529
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,865
Run the tests.

530
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,742
You can do a brain biopsy,
but only as a last resort.

531
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,708
Start running down Cuddy's list
of "Diseases it's not."

532
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,633
You're not stopping me
for medical reasons.

533
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,431
You're stopping me
because you have the hots for me.

534
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,854
You're still here
because you have the hots for me.

535
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:16,316
Evidenced by the fact that
I'm the one who moved into your office.

536
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,318
It's the biggest office.
And I'm not the one that...

537
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:22,989
Why are you dressed like that? Why do
you try so hard to get my attention?

538
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,076
Are you screwing with me?

539
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,204
Are you screwing with me?

540
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,247
Depends on your answer.

541
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,296
Everybody knows
this is going somewhere.

542
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,886
I think we're supposed
to kiss now.

543
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,304
We already did that.

544
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,483
Seemed like the
logical next step.

545
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,734
Really?

546
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,323
I'm an idiot
for being surprised.

547
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,328
Can you leave these?

548
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,193
I'll keep coming.
But can you change my appointment time?

549
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,404
Can't. Schedule's full.

550
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,866
You're stuck with her,
might as well get to know her.

551
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,502
Your head MRI was clean,
means you don't have CNS lymphoma.

552
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,670
What's next on the list?

553
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,839
Other types of brain tumors.

554
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,132
Can we stop at the cafeteria?

555
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,342
I can have something
brought up for you.

556
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,677
- What do you want?
- Chocolate cake.

557
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,602
You can't give up.
We're going to figure this out.

558
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:01,105
What am I supposed to be hoping for?
That you find a brain tumor?

559
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,566
What else could it be?

560
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,737
You were so hard on me
about lying.

561
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:11,032
How about you take some of
your own advice and tell me the truth?

562
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,368
What's next on the list?

563
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,413
Prion disease.

564
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,875
And if that's what I got?
How bad?

565
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:25,421
There are a few treatments.
But there's no guarantee.

566
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,591
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,430
And you won't let me
have a piece of cake?

568
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,824
Where's Cuddy?

569
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,368
It's not CNS lymphoma.

570
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,577
I know.

571
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,996
She's getting worse,
you want me to find Cuddy

572
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,332
and get her approval
for the brain biopsy?

573
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,880
When you were philandering
with impunity, how did that feel?

574
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:15,430
Superficially, I loved it,
but deep down I think I was miserable.

575
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,598
Why? What's going on?

576
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,808
You weren't miserable.

577
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,772
You gave something away
to make a relationship work,

578
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,525
you rationalized
that you're getting something back.

579
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:33,197
Okay. I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval
for the brain biopsy.

580
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,409
Leave them there.
I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.

581
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,248
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate
seven different things.

582
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,125
Cuddy doesn't always
get what she wants.

583
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,627
Bad idea to get into a power play
with somebody who has the power.

584
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:50,715
You're fired.
Just reinforcing your point.

585
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,594
Whatever personal drama you're playing
out, you'd be a lot smarter to...

586
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,765
I thought you said
she was sick.

587
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,984
Sick people don't
spontaneously get better.

588
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,737
Yes, they do,
it's called an immune system.

589
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:16,574
Sick people who are sick enough
to make it to me

590
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,075
don't spontaneously get better.

591
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,537
Not as pithy, but yeah,
technically more accurate.

592
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,706
What's the last thing
you gave her?

593
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,500
I took her for a MRI
looking for...

594
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,752
MRis detect, they don't treat.

595
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,462
What did you give her
after the MRI?

596
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:33,132
I didn't give her anything, she got
depressed at the lack of direction.

597
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,593
We went to the cafeteria
for some chocolate cake,

598
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,888
took her to her room,
hung a banana bag, let her rest.

599
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,767
You gave her cake?

600
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,143
She asked for it, I figured...

601
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:47,605
You figured you'd let me play
20 questions instead of just telling me.

602
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:01,786
Feeling crappy again?
I've brought your cure.

603
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,124
I'd give you an IV
of the stuff,

604
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,920
but the frosting tends to get stuck
in the little tube.

605
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,171
Is this a joke?

606
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:16,551
It's not a joke, not a lie,
not an attempt to defraud in any way.

607
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:21,389
Just an actual licensed physician
with an actual diagnosis.

608
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,975
Hereditary coproporphyria.

609
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:34,026
Your face is genetically blessed,
your body chemistry is slightly less so,

610
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,531
doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme
that I can't pronounce,

611
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:42,159
but it's apparently important
for your liver and everything else.

612
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,704
Treatment is a high-carb diet,
rich in sugar.

613
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,957
When you were a porker,
you were self-medicating.

614
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,042
So this is treatable?

615
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,003
We just have to reverse
your gastric bypass

616
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,881
and get you back on a high-carb,
glucose enriched diet.

617
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:58,384
The best you you can be
is a lot more you.

618
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:02,847
Open the hangar,
here comes the plane.

619
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,974
There's nothing else
you can try?

620
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,812
No. There's a drug that manages
the symptoms but it's not a cure.

621
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,315
Let's try that.

622
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,571
You don't want to have
the surgery?

623
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,743
Understand.

624
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,079
There's not many people
who have the guts to admit

625
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,540
they'd rather be pretty than healthy.

626
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,084
Income's better
and you get more action.

627
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,047
We'll start you
on your drug treatment right away.

628
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,930
I bought it.
I bought that it was really about

629
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,681
trying to make people's lives
a little better.

630
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,167
You're surprised
she's superficial?

631
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,769
You're a plastic surgeon.
This is the human condition.

632
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,228
No, she's a freak.

633
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,354
Every time you put someone under
to bob their nose,

634
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,899
you were risking their life.

635
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,568
What?

636
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,695
No singing. She's better.

637
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,787
No one was supposed
to let my patient leave her bed.

638
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:09,080
She had a respiratory arrest,

639
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,124
we coded her nearly 20 minutes,
but she didn't make it.

640
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:19,465
House is an unemotional child
incapable of intimacy or romance.

641
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,634
Trust me. It's done.

642
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,219
It's perfect.

643
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,724
I like the desk.
A lot of character.

644
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,602
That's not the one I ordered.

645
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,440
This is my desk
from med school.

646
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,276
You have it in storage
or something?

647
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,570
My mom did.

648
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:43,656
That was sweet of her
to do that.

649
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:48,035
She didn't. My mom has no idea
I'm redoing my office.

650
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,221
I lied to you the other night.

651
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:14,020
That woman in the waiting room,
she didn't freak me out about my future.

652
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:19,150
She freaked me out
about my past.

653
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:22,445
Your mother.

654
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,699
Must have been horrible
watching her die.

655
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,368
I wanted her to die.

656
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:38,169
She just yelled so much.

657
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:43,215
And for no reason. Just screamed at me
in front of my friends.

658
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:49,513
My father tried to explain to me
that her brain was literally shrinking,

659
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:54,310
that she didn't mean it,
that it was the disease.

660
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,853
But I didn't care.

661
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,608
I hated her.

662
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,532
I never said goodbye,

663
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:14,121
and she died
with me hating her.

664
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,556
Did Chase test
for the biliary tumor?

665
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,642
He said it was negative.

666
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,770
She was stable
when he left her.

667
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,688
We should have found more time,
we should have...

668
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,732
House is gonna kill us.

669
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,152
Slowly

670
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,489
and painfully.

671
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,287
You're not only idiots, you're frauds.
Fraudulent idiots.

672
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:58,332
Fraudulent idiotic killers,
as it turns out.

673
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,293
- House, this was really my...
- Your fault, yeah!

674
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,712
For pretending to be me
when you're not even competent.

675
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,591
And your fault for not ratting him out
while the patient was still alive.

676
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:15,766
What she had was easily treatable,
she could have been fine.

677
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,102
Damn treatment's so simple.

678
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,274
It might still be possible.

679
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,276
House?

680
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:29,196
House?
House, she's clearly dead.

681
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,076
Oh, God! Oh, God!

682
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,745
She was dead.

683
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:40,416
She wasn't dead.
She wasn't even sick, you moron.

684
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:45,296
Seriously, how good was she? No
formal training. At least not in acting.

685
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:46,589
Did you see their faces?

686
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,216
I think we may have
an anal hygiene violation there.

687
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,051
So the CT?

688
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:54,805
That was from a patient three years ago.
That was hard to find.

689
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,348
But the hair, makeup,

690
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,894
getting Chase and Cameron
to play along, much easier.

691
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,314
We deserved it.
I'll take down the website before...

692
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:06,984
Take it down? You kidding?
It's way too lucrative to shut it down.

693
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,361
For Chase, for me.

694
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:13,407
I earn 50% for letting
you use my name.

695
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:17,578
Chop, chop, go to work,
first dollars go to expenses.

696
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,456
I booked our little thespian
here for two full days.

697
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:21,916
That's three G's I owe her.

698
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,713
And you still got
three hours left.

699
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,633
Do I?
