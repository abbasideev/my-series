1
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,093
Who picked this dump?

2
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,427
You suggested it.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,222
I suggested you look into it.

4
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:13,765
Sorry, the online reviews...

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,726
Were obviously written by some geek
in their own marketing department.

6
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,478
Next time,
call someone you know.

7
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:21,106
Stop relying on a computer
to do your job for you.

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,065
Brightsize Apparel,

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,983
eight sexual harassment suits
in two years.

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,670
- Who asked for the meeting?
- They did.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,410
Patty Michener,
President of Women's Majority.

12
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:37,414
And, wow, do you guys need me.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,792
Nine men?

14
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,837
No one thought it might be a good idea
to put a suit on one of the gals

15
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,256
from the steno pool to make
it look like you give a damn?

16
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,800
We've made it a priority
to promote more women, but...

17
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:51,594
Well, from now on,
you have me standing beside you.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,973
Which is good, because your problem
is a national problem.

19
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,307
With all due
respect, Miss Michener,

20
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:59,811
I'd hardly call a few isolated
incidents a national problem.

21
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,982
Six out of 10 victims
never even report harassment,

22
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,650
this is bigger than
just eight women.

23
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,235
That still only means 20.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,945
Not enough for you?

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,907
How many asses does
your corporate policy allow you to grab?

26
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,617
Tell you what
you're going to do,

27
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:17,120
you're gonna settle with anyone
you haven't settled with,

28
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,414
you're going to fire
any man who's even been accused.

29
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:20,582
Somebody, help me!

30
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,542
Please, help me!
I can't get them off!

31
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,880
Please help me! Help me, please!

32
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,799
Somebody help me! Get them off!

33
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,470
You gonna call an ambulance
or you just gonna sit there and stare?

34
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,765
Help me, please!

35
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,899
Wilson's back. You gonna...

36
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,609
Been gone two months,

37
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,988
he can wait till I finish slaying a guy
in a skullcap and a pair of tights.

38
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,241
On a video game you stole
from the pediatric ward?

39
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:40,662
On advice of counsel, I assert
my privilege pursuant to the Fifth.

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,769
When was the last time
you talked to him?

41
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,714
Uh, I think it was after...

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,633
When did his girlfriend die?

43
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,178
He wanted time alone.

44
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,389
I considered being
a horrendous pain in the ass,

45
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,891
but I didn't want to
tread on your turf.

46
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,643
We got a case.

47
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,936
I got to remember
to close the blinds.

48
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,771
Just got a call
from Patty Michener,

49
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,439
from Women's Majority,
the women's rights...

50
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,150
- We know who she is.
- I dated her.

51
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,694
Well, not really dated her,

52
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,989
more metaphorically raped her
by having a penis.

53
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,533
- You did, too.
- Her assistant flipped out,

54
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:21,411
ripped off her clothes
in front of a roomful of businessmen.

55
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,121
Either she cracked under the whip,

56
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,249
or she started to realize
that her evolutionary purpose

57
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,626
is to arouse men,
not to castrate them.

58
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,791
Send her to psychiatric...

59
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,379
Anemia, bradycardia,

60
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:34,966
and abdominal pain
aren't psychiatric symptoms.

61
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:38,595
Then it's the latter,
send her to my apartment.

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,971
I'll give it to Segal.

63
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,223
House actually wants a case,
and you're saying no?

64
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,893
House has more important
things to do.

65
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,061
Sorry, can't help you.

66
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,772
You need a specialist
to remove those kinds of warts.

67
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,066
Preferably one with
experience spelunking.

68
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,659
Hallucinations,
possible memory loss,

69
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,912
tests show anemia,
slow heart rate,

70
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,915
and a stubborn refusal
to shave her pits.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,374
Have you seen Wilson?

72
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:12,128
No, but I have seen
the patient's frequent flyer balance.

73
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,672
Eastern Europe, Asia,
third-world countries,

74
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:15,997
sometimes more than one a day.

75
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,967
No fever means it's
not a tropical disease.

76
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,470
If it's not where she went,
maybe it's the work hours.

77
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:21,971
Could be amphetamine abuse.

78
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,015
She's probably popping
them like breath mints.

79
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,475
You haven't been by his office?

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,646
Is Wilson hallucinating
ants crawling all over him, too?

81
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,107
Tox screen's cleaner
than the windows she won't do.

82
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,525
Her job keeps her
constantly on the road,

83
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,237
probably living off of
airline peanuts and diet soda.

84
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,865
Severe B12 deficiency
could cause all her symptoms.

85
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,390
Why is everyone leaping to conclude

86
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,453
a strong career woman's been made sick
by her strong career?

87
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,705
It's not B12.
It's an insulinoma in her pancreas,

88
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,248
it's making her hypoglycemic.

89
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:52,752
Great, now everyone knows.

90
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,838
You knew the patient had cancer?

91
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,840
Is that what she said?

92
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,425
I thought she said,

93
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,553
"I'm suddenly and irrationally defending
the patient's strong career,"

94
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,223
"even though in reality
she's just a glorified grunt"

95
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,517
"because I'm trying to convince myself
that it's okay not to have a life,"

96
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,520
"'cause I don't have a life,
because I was tested for Huntington's"

97
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,897
"and my life span's
been cut in half."

98
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,610
Been waiting two months
for her to say that.

99
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,215
Hallucinations,
anemia, bradycardia...

100
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,698
<i>Hyper segmented pews
says that Taub's fight.</i>

101
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,074
Pump her full of B12,

102
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,744
see how a strong career woman's
been made sick by her strong career.

103
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,674
Are you okay?

104
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,634
It could be years
before you see any symptoms.

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,844
Why wouldn't you tell us?

106
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,470
I don't have Huntington's.

107
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,890
Are you lying to us?
Because it's none of our business.

108
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,101
If it's none of your business,
I shouldn't have to answer questions.

109
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,936
And I wouldn't have to,
except House doesn't want to answer

110
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,312
questions about Wilson.

111
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,440
He's deflecting
his own problems onto me.

112
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,608
Are you deflecting now?

113
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,862
Time for the B12 cocktail
and my life lesson.

114
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,445
No, Patty'll do the hearing,

115
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,162
she just needs to be
the lead-off witness so she...

116
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,914
Okay. I'll lock it down today.

117
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,250
Need you back in bed.

118
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,754
My boss has a big Beijing trip,
I've been planning it for months.

119
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,547
I was just tired
and dehydrated...

120
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,882
Yeah, whenever I
lose some shut-eye,

121
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,926
I pound my legs clawing
at imaginary ant colonies.

122
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,596
You have a severe
B12 deficiency.

123
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,556
Get back in bed.

124
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,198
I'm sure your boss
can do without you for a few days.

125
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:48,242
It's not about her,
it's about me.

126
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,453
I want to be there,
I want to matter.

127
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:54,457
Yeah, I mean, without you, who knows how
much starch they'd put in her shirts?

128
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,877
I'm sorry, I'm sure your boss
depends on you for...

129
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,587
- I need to get up.
- No, you need to stay in bed.

130
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:03,758
Please, where's the bed pan?
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, I just...

131
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,302
I just had a bowel movement.

132
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,472
It's okay,
B12 deficiency can cause sudden...

133
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,352
That's not a bowel movement.

134
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:24,237
My patient is still fighting in the
feminist trenches, but the war is over.

135
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,240
Yesterday's sluts are
today's empowered women,

136
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,493
today's sluts are celebrities.
If that isn't progress...

137
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,994
I'm leaving.

138
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,873
What, you're gonna take
another two months?

139
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,960
Boy, you're really milking
this bereavement thing, aren't you?

140
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,506
I mean, good for you.
Take all the time you need.

141
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,631
I'm resigning.

142
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,553
Maybe moving out of New Jersey,
I don't know yet.

143
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:52,140
Okay, that's
an understandable reaction.

144
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,183
It's not a reaction,
it's a decision.

145
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,102
I'm writing Cuddy
my resignation right now.

146
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,897
I'm just back for the week to wrap up
my clinical and administrative duties.

147
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:04,861
You of all people should know,
this is bereavement 101.

148
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,347
You think that
a change in venue...

149
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,323
Well, that spares me
decades of psychoanalysis.

150
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,075
I'm not saying
you're not in pain.

151
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,743
You're saying
my pain's a cliché.

152
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,453
I'm saying that pain fades.

153
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,913
Did yours?

154
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,623
Physical pain is different.

155
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,542
I'd rather have
my leg chopped off.

156
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,918
You don't know that
'cause you haven't felt...

157
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,295
Neither have you.

158
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,716
Sorry,
patient's got a rectal bleed.

159
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,176
- I'm busy.
- We need you to...

160
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,219
Actually, as you can see,
I'm not busy.

161
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,181
It was just a euphemism
for "get the hell out of here."

162
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:41,981
This is your grief talking,
and, yeah, it is a bit textbook.

163
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,859
So before you give away all your
possessions to the Salvation Army...

164
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,068
My girlfriend's dead.

165
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,696
I'm glad you've read
that book before, I haven't.

166
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:52,116
I'm late to meet Dr. Olan to brief him
on the case I'm handing over.

167
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,079
Bye.

168
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,177
It doesn't bother you
that House wouldn't take

169
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,179
just two seconds
to talk about the patient?

170
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,597
Wilson's dealing with a lot.

171
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,932
And our patient may be dying.

172
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,298
She was bleeding out her rear,
we're looking up her rear.

173
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,603
You think we needed House's expertise
to set us on this course?

174
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,438
Her heart rate's slow,
bleed should have made it faster.

175
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,690
And it can wait
till after we know where it came from.

176
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,859
And after he's done
dealing with personal issues.

177
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,361
Yeah?
That the way it works around here?

178
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:31,447
We get cut slack
while we deal with personal issues?

179
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:34,825
You're not the boss.

180
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:39,330
Boss gets to make the rules,
boss gets to ignore...

181
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:44,460
She's bleeding from nowhere.

182
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,672
You did an endoscopy?

183
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,923
And a colonoscopy.

184
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,091
- CT scan?
- Ordered.

185
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,884
But it shouldn't show anything
the endoscopy didn't.

186
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,428
- We can't do a CT scan.
- Why not?

187
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,681
We don't need a CT scan,
we don't need House.

188
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:57,932
Stop grinning and talk.

189
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,142
One of the routine pre-procedure tests
was positive.

190
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,311
- Which one?
- The one that if it's positive

191
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,896
would explain
a hormone imbalance

192
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,190
that could screw
with heart rate and blood flow.

193
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,736
Guess she does have a life
beyond her career.

194
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:13,447
I'm Pregnant?

195
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,032
You want to call the father?
Let him know?

196
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:18,160
Soon as you do some DNA testing,
let me know.

197
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,622
Must be hard to have
a real relationship when you're...

198
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,916
Are you making excuses for me?

199
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,209
I'm just saying
it's understandable.

200
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,504
You only have to understand something
if it needs an explanation.

201
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,841
I have needs, I met my needs,
end of explanation.

202
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,427
How recently were you needy?

203
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,180
It's been two or three months at least.

204
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,268
What? What is it?

205
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,394
Nothing.

206
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,397
- Tell me.
- It's actually, nothing.

207
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,737
The ultrasound
shows no trace of a baby at all.

208
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,450
Positive pregnancy test,
no pregnancy.

209
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,329
B12 deficit rectified,
but her heart's slowing even more.

210
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,706
And a bleed should
speed her heart rate.

211
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,046
House,
this is the kind of case you love,

212
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,298
contradictions piling up left and right.

213
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,635
Two false positive pregnancy tests,

214
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:19,930
bradycardia, lower GI bleed. Go.

215
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,516
Choriocarcinoma,
would've triggered pregnancy hormones.

216
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,226
Also would've shown on the sonogram.

217
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,520
Immunoglobulin A deficiency.

218
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,646
No urinary bleed.

219
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:31,567
If she's had beta-HCG injections,
they can cross-react with...

220
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,362
Keep going.

221
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,241
You're being an idiot.

222
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,786
You're gonna blow up your career,
then six months from now,

223
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,163
when you've moved on
from Amber to burnt sienna,

224
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:48,459
you're gonna be stuck on a mobile
oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

225
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,796
I'd need a flow chart
to explain all the ways in which

226
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,756
that was ridiculously insensitive.

227
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,091
You can't hide from misery.

228
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,926
This isn't your business.

229
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,428
My skull was cracked open
trying to save her.

230
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,682
Then we all need a little tea
and sympathy. I'm through discussing it.

231
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,101
We have a patient.

232
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,729
Who's obviously not going anywhere
with a bloody rectum.

233
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,648
- Great to have you back.
- Actually, I'm...

234
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,402
Actually, he's about to thrust a tanto
into the belly of his career.

235
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm leaving the hospital.

236
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,781
I'm sorry. This is obviously
a terrible time, but...

237
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,616
Why are you leaving?

238
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,785
I just need a change of scenery.

239
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,910
Buy a plant.

240
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,247
Rectal bleeding,
two positive pregnancy tests.

241
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,540
There's nothing we can do...

242
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,042
You could ask House to be a grownup
and respect my decision.

243
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,002
I respect things
that deserve respect.

244
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,505
This decision, on the other hand,
is a dog wearing a cape.

245
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,048
Hallucinations,
heart rate won't respond...

246
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,384
The patient tested positive
for pregnancy

247
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,886
because the patient is pregnant.

248
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,818
Hey, who are you?

249
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,943
This is Dr. House.

250
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,030
He's too brilliant for introductions.
False positive.

251
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,533
You're too busy to be running
a day care center in your abdomen.

252
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,201
False positive.

253
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,607
Not to mention, you should wait
till at least 30 to punish

254
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,623
that pleasure portal
with a seven-pound tissue expander.

255
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,002
I'm 37.
And I thought I wasn't pregnant.

256
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,214
Thirty-seven? Impressive.

257
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,552
Too bad you're not
passing on those genes.

258
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,014
Does that look false to you?

259
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,892
You were looking
in the wrong room.

260
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,811
It's more common
when the egg lands in the oven,

261
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,563
sometimes it winds up
in the fallopian tubes,

262
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,900
in rare cases, it plummets through
the plumbing entirely.

263
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,943
It's using her intestine
as a blood supply.

264
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:42,781
Caused the rectal bleed,
and now Junior Miss Steinem's junior

265
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:46,744
must be pressing on her vagus nerve,
slowing her heart to a crawl.

266
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,623
Yank the fetus. If she survives
the surgery, she'll be fine.

267
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,594
What if she wants
to keep the baby?

268
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,720
She doesn't.

269
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,722
We can't take two seconds
to discuss this?

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,516
I mean, fetuses have been
transplanted before,

271
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,184
whole uteruses, too.

272
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,937
Just terminating the fetus
when it's glued to her intestines

273
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:16,232
is high-risk surgery,
saving it is a fantasy.

274
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,651
That was at least three seconds.

275
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,278
She's a 37-year old woman
who deserves...

276
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,821
People get what they get,

277
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,115
it has nothing to do
with what they deserve.

278
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,001
And this has nothing to do
with her genitalia

279
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,078
and everything to do
with your genetics.

280
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,538
You told me to get tested.

281
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,664
I didn't know it was gonna color

282
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,789
your every medical opinion,
every personal opinion.

283
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,125
You didn't think
a death sentence would...

284
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:39,880
People die.
You, Amber, everyone.

285
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,675
Don't act like you
just figured that out.

286
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,303
I gave you a diagnosis, you don't
like it, there are exits on every floor.

287
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,950
I'm sorry to be
so definitive about this.

288
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,662
I know you're still absorbing the news,
but we have no choice but to...

289
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,248
Remove the fetus, absolutely.

290
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,210
I have no boyfriend, no husband,

291
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,005
I'm on the road with Patty
all the time.

292
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,133
Where do I sign?

293
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,884
Oh!

294
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,473
Feel any tenderness back here?

295
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,100
No, not at all.

296
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,313
So you're treating
professional sports injuries now?

297
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,438
No, I'm not...

298
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,316
Familiar with the concept of sarcasm.

299
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,402
Don't sweat it, it's new.
Have you spoken to Wilson?

300
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,195
We'll get you an EKG.
I'll be right back.

301
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,364
You want me to sleep with him
to get him to stay?

302
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,993
I put the bisexual chick on that,
but if you'd like to sit in,

303
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,786
- so to speak.
- I spoke to him.

304
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,911
What did you tell him?

305
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,415
I didn't tell him anything.
I listened.

306
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,876
So you could feel good
about doing nothing.

307
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,669
- Tell him...
- I am not your errand girl,

308
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,504
the best thing
about leaving you.

309
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,715
The two of you
used to be together?

310
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,718
She dumped me when I lost
the last 85 pounds.

311
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,971
Said there was
less of me to love.

312
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,723
Grief means different things
to different people,

313
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,225
case in point,
means very little to you.

314
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,894
Grief is Newark.

315
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,859
Okay, it's there, you can't avoid it,
but the idea is to hold your nose,

316
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,138
hope the traffic's not too bad

317
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,151
and get on to Manhattan as quickly
as possible, not to buy property.

318
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,986
You think that's
facing up to things?

319
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,029
I'm not the one who's quitting.

320
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,656
'Cause you haven't lost anything.

321
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,617
But you have.
He'll listen to you.

322
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,662
What did you do
when your husband died?

323
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,705
I got a new job, and I moved.

324
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,043
See how crappy that worked out.

325
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:50,302
Separating the placenta
from the wall of the large intestine.

326
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,889
Sponge.
Suction, we got some bleeding.

327
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,059
BP's dropping, 90 systolic.

328
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,727
And bleeding like hell, clamp.

329
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,104
BP's still dropping.

330
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,897
Amp of calcium chloride, fast.

331
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,107
- Still dropping.
- Shut up.

332
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,608
Squeeze her spleen,

333
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,276
we need to force some platelets out
so her blood clots.

334
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,530
She's in weak shape,
spleen's friable, it could rupture.

335
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,496
She's stabilizing, oozing's drying up.

336
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,958
And I hate Visitor's Day.

337
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,837
Removing the fetus.

338
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,969
Bye.

339
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,974
You have to stop Wilson
from committing career malpractice.

340
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,226
Talk to him.

341
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,646
Already talked to him twice,
he threw me out.

342
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,524
Mocking him and insulting him,
let's see, yes,

343
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,110
technically,
those are categories of conversation.

344
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,154
Block his references to other hospitals,

345
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,039
tell him
he can't hand off his cases until...

346
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,699
Talk to him.

347
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,326
Deal with his grief, talk to him
about what he's going through.

348
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,037
That's a brilliant idea.
I'll take him out for a beer,

349
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,540
that'll make up for the fact
that Amber's in a pine box,

350
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,209
that there's randomness and chaos
in the universe.

351
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,836
Tell him you're sorry.

352
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,421
I didn't kill her.

353
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,839
You were drunk and...

354
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:12,801
Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk,
she might never have been born. So...

355
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,762
You called her up in
the middle of the night,

356
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,139
she was on the bus
because of you.

357
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:20,184
I didn't ask her to come out,
I wasn't driving the bus,

358
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,686
I wasn't driving the garbage truck
that hit the bus,

359
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,272
and I did not prescribe her
the flu meds that killed her.

360
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,525
Yes, I know,
that's all true, but...

361
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,490
You really don't feel
any sense of guilt?

362
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,079
You want to keep him,
he needs to know he's not alone.

363
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,499
Just tell him
you feel like crap.

364
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,834
It'd be meaningless.

365
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,714
Well, then find some meaning.
And do something.

366
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,642
She's got
a neurological problem.

367
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,767
Surgical complication?

368
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,436
Don't think so,
she keeps on blinking.

369
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,771
Her heart's not recovering either.

370
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,523
So the pregnancy
was a coincidence?

371
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,528
Pulse's down to 39,
she's maxed out on atropine.

372
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,050
We're installing
a pacing wire to...

373
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,154
Avoid that.
We need some help in here!

374
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,113
Page House.

375
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,949
- Already paged him.
- Page him again.

376
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,500
It's for you.

377
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,379
If I told you that I was sorry,
would it change anything?

378
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,047
I wouldn't believe you.

379
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,340
If you believed me.

380
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,593
It's hard to imagine such a world.

381
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,303
I'm going home

382
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,349
until you agree
to stay at this hospital.

383
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,937
You can't be... That's blackmail.
And to do your job?

384
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,897
Why not hold a gun
to your own head?

385
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,650
Your conscience bleeds
more freely than my head.

386
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:59,491
Text. Patient's in cardiac arrest.
Ouchy.

387
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,161
You'd jeopardize a patient
because of my...

388
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,496
If it keeps you here.

389
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,001
Your friendship matters more to me
than this patient.

390
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:15,257
I've gotta do what's right for me.
You gotta do what's right for you.

391
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,302
Yeah.
But it comes easier for me.

392
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,564
Where is he? Where is he?

393
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,205
Status?

394
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,415
Her heart's stabilized,

395
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,627
we have a pacing wire in her, but the
bradycardia's not getting any better.

396
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,752
House was bluffing.

397
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,671
I called him three times,
he's not picking up.

398
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,924
- What do you want us to do?
- Same thing you'd do if he was here.

399
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,384
If he was here,
we'd be asking him what to do.

400
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,970
- What are the usual suspects?
- There aren't any.

401
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,015
She had a vitamin deficiency
and we corrected it,

402
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,682
an ectopic pregnancy,
we removed it.

403
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,267
But her heart problem
won't go away,

404
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,811
and now something's
wrong with her brain.

405
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,856
I have complete confidence
in you guys.

406
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,278
Who wants to go service House
so this patient can live?

407
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,738
We can do this without him.

408
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,365
Maybe something happened
during the surgery, caused her to...

409
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,241
Surgery was on her bowel,
not her brain.

410
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,744
Anxiety, stroke, Tourette's,
could all cause eye-blinking.

411
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,989
And cause her heart to beat faster,
it's slowing down.

412
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,208
MS. If a lesion took out the
sympathetic innervation of her heart,

413
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,134
it'd explain
the bradycardia and the blinking.

414
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,046
But not the vitamin deficiency
or the ectopic pregnancy.

415
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,589
House would want
a unifying theory.

416
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,800
House is gone.
And so are those symptoms.

417
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,678
MS explains everything
that's wrong with her right now.

418
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,097
Start her on interferon for MS.

419
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,479
Mind if I come in?

420
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,523
Not at all. You mind if I leave?

421
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,151
I told you not to take that case

422
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,112
specifically so you could deal
with Wilson.

423
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,407
And the two ended up dovetailing
rather nicely, don't you think?

424
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,410
This is how you show your friendship?
By bludgeoning him with guilt?

425
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,079
Because he's my friend,
I know what works on him.

426
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,081
Well, I can't let you
walk away from a patient.

427
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,290
Then fire me.

428
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,710
You're willing to risk your career
but you're not willing to say sorry?

429
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,129
I told him I'm sorry,
he didn't believe it.

430
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,880
- Well, make him believe it.
- I don't believe it.

431
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,549
You don't want to believe it.

432
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,468
Because if you tell Wilson
how you actually feel about him,

433
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,220
about what happened to Amber,

434
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,057
about your part in what happened,
and he walks out the door anyway,

435
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,934
if you make yourself
vulnerable for once

436
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,104
in your nerve-deadening,
emotionally-obliterating...

437
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:38,608
You're doing the same thing he is,
you're running away.

438
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,902
Only he's not killing
anyone in the process.

439
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,743
Where's Dr. House?

440
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,411
He's not feeling well.

441
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,913
Was MS his idea?

442
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,583
We work as a team.
You know how it is,

443
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,502
collaborative, sometimes it's hard
to tell where an idea comes from.

444
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:02,174
But you're not really a team.
You work for him.

445
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,762
And you work for Patty.

446
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,264
I'm sure a lot of
her ideas are actually...

447
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,600
She would be fine without me.

448
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,352
I'd be nothing without her.

449
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:18,940
Maybe if you just had the chance.
I'm sure you've learned a lot.

450
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,318
Not everybody's created equal.

451
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,530
Does Dr. House think I have MS?

452
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,033
Yes.

453
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,333
Did you just shiver?

454
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,712
You're running a slight fever.

455
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,922
Is that bad?

456
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,592
It means we were wrong
about the MS.

457
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,014
You had my cable disconnected.

458
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,599
Well, that's quite a leap.

459
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,935
Just because I happen to have
a 31 -person maintenance department,

460
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,187
each of whom you've personally abused
at some point...

461
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,730
Why?

462
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,440
'Cause you think I'm okay
with letting someone die,

463
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,859
but I'm gonna fold
if I can't watch celebrity bowling?

464
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,861
That is not an unreasonable theory,

465
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,073
especially with only
10 minutes till your favorite soap.

466
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,326
Gee, is this the remote
from the doctors' lounge?

467
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,208
This is your 911? Goodbye.

468
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,459
Stop.

469
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,547
I'm withholding your salary history from
every hospital in the Tri-State Area.

470
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,090
You go, girl.

471
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:29,261
And I'm permanently setting every TV
in this building to the Pottery Channel

472
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,346
unless you both sit down.

473
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,101
Welcome to couples counseling.

474
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,144
It's not the surgery.

475
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,062
Timing fits.

476
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,064
The location doesn't,
unless her brain's in her bowels.

477
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,399
If bacteria entered her bloodstream,

478
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,109
it could have caused
an infection in her brain.

479
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,319
The surgery went fine.
You were there, you saw...

480
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,484
Peptostreptococcus
could explain the blinking and...

481
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,616
No. You want to watch a grainy video
and have an epiphany.

482
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,911
Shut up, you're making me
miss House's mocking.

483
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,206
I know you told us
it was none of our business,

484
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,417
but if House thinks that your
Huntington's is affecting you,

485
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,169
- maybe it really...
- It's not, because I don't have...

486
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,004
You're desperate to do this
without him.

487
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,173
You're not trying to cure her,
you're trying to prove...

488
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,091
Stop the tape.

489
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,552
Zoom in.

490
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,557
On the anastomosis,
that little bump.

491
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,393
It's a hematoma,
a harmless pocket of blood,

492
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,645
which is why Chase ignored it
during the surgery.

493
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,149
Could be a ganglioma, which is
why Chase shouldn't have ignored it.

494
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,026
If it's an abnormal growth of nerves,

495
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,403
it could be causing
all the patient's symptoms.

496
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,157
We have to open her up again,
get a piece of it.

497
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,414
So what do you want to tell us?

498
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,832
Nothing.

499
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,044
Nothing I say is gonna change anything.
You guys need to talk.

500
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,630
Actually, you should read
the latest psych literature,

501
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,548
repression's gaining
a lot of fans.

502
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,133
What you don't face
can't crush you.

503
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,593
Talk to each other.

504
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,013
How you doing? Good?

505
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,598
Fine. Thanks.

506
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,476
Sit.

507
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,147
See, the two of you are friends,
look how you both...

508
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,690
Think you're an idiot.

509
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,568
We both also eat with forks,
that doesn't really prove...

510
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,155
Talk to him. Tell him how you feel
about what he's doing.

511
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,490
I told him he's an idiot.

512
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,867
Tell him what you think
about him leaving.

513
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:16,992
I think he's an idiot.

514
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,077
You're an idiot.

515
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:21,039
He's in pain, and your response
is just to emotionally blackmail him.

516
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,999
You told me
what your position is on that one.

517
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,209
You're against it, right?

518
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,712
She hasn't told you in front of me.
She needs to prove she's on my side.

519
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,256
Go to hell.

520
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,799
So much for that theory.

521
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,550
I'm sorry you lost Amber.

522
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,678
I cannot imagine what it is
you're going through,

523
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,137
but it will not get better

524
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,266
by you walking away
from everyone that cares about you.

525
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,936
Do you think Amber
would want you to walk away?

526
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,814
Nobody at this hospital
even liked Amber.

527
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,240
Same time next week?

528
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:04,249
You want me to do a second
major surgery on a patient

529
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,002
we almost lost
during a first major surgery

530
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,671
to see if she needs
a third major surgery?

531
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,172
We need a piece
of the ganglioma.

532
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,508
Then you're talking
about another patient,

533
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,135
yours doesn't have a ganglioma.

534
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,137
And if there is one
and you missed it?

535
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,223
Then you're talking about
another surgeon, I didn't miss anything.

536
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,149
But we're not talking
about another videotape,

537
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,144
this one showed a bump,
we need to biopsy it.

538
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,523
A bump? Oh, yeah,
my grandfather died of a bump.

539
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:34,321
She can't survive a second round of
general anesthesia, let alone a third.

540
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,698
You'd do this for House.

541
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:37,824
Yeah.

542
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:38,949
Then what do you suggest?

543
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,411
Because the patient's got
a high fever, a low heart rate,

544
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,622
and a dim chance of survival
if we stand here like idiots.

545
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,709
Then I suggest
you don't stand there like idiots.

546
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:54,507
How do you get coal out of a mountain
when it's someone else's mountain?

547
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,634
If we don't have House,
doesn't mean we can't think like House.

548
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,137
But it does mean
we don't have to talk like him.

549
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,598
You don't dig down.
You go in from the side.

550
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,266
We insert a lighted scope
through the rectum,

551
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,310
move the intestine
till we find the ganglioma,

552
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,855
then push it to the surface.
Where we see the light, we cut.

553
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,362
We'll make as small
an incision as we can,

554
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,073
but unfortunately
it'll be very painful.

555
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,638
After your surgery experience,
we can't give you anesthesia...

556
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,951
Can I talk to Dr. House?

557
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,537
No.

558
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,082
We can do this,
we know what we're doing.

559
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,500
I don't mean to be insulting,

560
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:32,295
but my former boss didn't insist on me
coming here because of you or...

561
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,713
Your former boss?

562
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,840
I've been replaced.

563
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,678
- I'm sorry. I mean, you must be...
- I'm fine.

564
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,806
She has a big Beijing trip,

565
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,101
ton of work to do, she can't just wait
for me to get better.

566
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,398
We've been well trained,
we'll take good care of you.

567
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,698
How can you let her
treat you like a footstool?

568
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,159
The world needs flunkies.

569
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,578
Don't say that,
you're better than that.

570
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,789
I have no problem with it.
Why do you?

571
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,418
Because life is short.

572
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,711
I mean,
yours could've ended in that surgery.

573
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:17,882
You'd have never lived for yourself.
What kind of feminist...

574
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,301
- We can have anything.
- No, we can't.

575
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:27,684
We can aspire to anything. But we
don't get it just because we want it.

576
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,521
I would rather spend my life
close to the birds

577
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:34,357
than waste it
wishing I had wings.

578
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,328
You're through the sigmoid,
into the descending colon.

579
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,913
Switching on the light.

580
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,249
Advance toward the anastomosis.

581
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,128
That's it.

582
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,839
Push the wall of the intestine
toward the skin.

583
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,762
There, I see it.

584
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,849
Don't look down.

585
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,893
Scalpel.

586
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:26,910
So your last day is Friday?

587
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,412
I'm gonna miss you.

588
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,915
You shouldn't go.

589
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,626
Did House ask you to talk to me?
Or are you trying to save the patient,

590
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,669
- because there'll always be another...
- House asked me.

591
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,464
- And you're doing it?
- I told him to go to hell.

592
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,258
Thanks.

593
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,843
But I think he's right.

594
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:53,811
You think you're making a rational
choice. You think the worst is over,

595
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:59,234
and then six months later,
you look back and you realize

596
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,027
you didn't know
what you were doing.

597
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,154
Are you saying the pain
doesn't go away?

598
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,280
It gets easier.

599
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,951
Not in two months.
Not in two years.

600
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,913
But, no, it never
really goes away.

601
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,042
Being here, in this building...

602
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,487
I was just in the lounge,
I kept staring at Amber's locker.

603
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,755
I saw a guy
wearing a scarf this morning.

604
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,341
The color reminded me of his eyes.

605
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,010
We lived 500 miles from here.

606
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:28,930
I have to do something.

607
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,348
Then do it.

608
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,731
But don't think it's the right choice,
because there isn't one.

609
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,404
It's not a ganglioma,
the problem wasn't the surgery.

610
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,906
Abnormally deposited proteins.
It's amyloidosis.

611
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,158
It would explain the blinking
and the low heart rate.

612
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,744
The only way to treat amyloidosis
is to treat whatever's causing it.

613
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:55,540
It's not as if a lot of things
cause amyloid, rheumatoid arthritis.

614
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,000
Familial Mediterranean fever.

615
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,125
Lymphoma.

616
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,419
Well, we can't all be right.

617
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:02,463
But you can all be wrong.
Patient's joints don't hurt,

618
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,090
abdominal pain went away
when the fetus did,

619
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,592
and no palpable lymph nodes.

620
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,260
Got anything
constructive to say?

621
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:08,636
Sorry. Sorry.

622
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,514
She has lots and lots
of palpable lymph nodes,

623
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,100
joint and abdominal pain,
she'll be better by dinner time.

624
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,144
If we don't find
the cause of the amyloidosis,

625
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,689
we never get her off that wire,
she never walks out of this hospital.

626
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,570
But, hey, who needs House?
So glad we lost those training wheels.

627
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,368
You want me to make the call?

628
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,412
There seems to be
some disagreement.

629
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,665
And this isn't just a pretext
to pressure me into staying?

630
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,084
Does it look like a pretext?

631
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,336
No.

632
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,838
She really is dying, isn't she?

633
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:51,346
Inflammation, enlarged nuclei, some
mitotic activity. It could be lymphoma.

634
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,847
There are no palpable
lymph nodes.

635
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,600
Makes it less likely,
but doesn't rule it out.

636
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,187
I'm an oncologist, I see cancer.

637
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,439
Show it to an immunologist,
they'll see autoimmune.

638
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,567
I already showed it
to an immunologist.

639
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,444
We'll start her on chemo.

640
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,281
You should leave.

641
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,950
House doesn't want
to lose his sidekick.

642
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,286
Cuddy doesn't want
to lose her check on House.

643
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,039
No one's talking
about what you want.

644
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,791
It's not that I want to.

645
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,793
Want to, need to.

646
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,593
If there's any chance
that being away from here

647
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:28,591
will make your life
even a little bit easier, do it.

648
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,678
That's what everyone else here would do.

649
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,199
Don't expect anything
to change too fast.

650
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,826
Lymphoma was your idea?

651
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,244
Why?

652
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,663
I feel better.

653
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,749
Sometimes just knowing
you're being treated helps.

654
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,475
You've given me 18 different treatments,

655
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:06,504
this is the first one
that made me feel better.

656
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,715
I don't think
it's psychological.

657
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,300
Thank you.

658
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,721
I'm sorry.

659
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,724
I shouldn't have
gotten angry at you.

660
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,976
Your choices are your choices.

661
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,645
You're not like me.

662
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,233
Maybe you have wings.

663
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,285
I have Huntington's Chorea.

664
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:44,584
Dozen years or so,
my nervous system, my cognitive skills,

665
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,254
even my emotional balance,
they'll all start to fray.

666
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:54,010
I won't be able to fly,
I won't be able to walk,

667
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,054
I won't be able to breathe.

668
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,226
And you want to make sure
your life matters?

669
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:09,984
I don't want to just be tightening bolts
and following instructions.

670
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:16,491
I want something to be different
because of me.

671
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:18,910
I am.

672
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,664
Not just 'cause
you saved my life.

673
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:31,422
I'm applying for a job at a foundation.
Running the finance division.

674
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:34,525
I mean, I don't know if
I'm gonna get it,

675
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:39,263
but if I don't,
there are other foundations.

676
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,106
It's almost 4:00. Soap time.

677
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,695
Nurses' remote,
works in the doctors' lounge.

678
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,906
Why do you think
Wilson's leaving?

679
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,662
How many times
do I have to use the word "idiot"?

680
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,413
And that's
a good enough answer for you?

681
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,340
Whenever anyone does
anything out of the norm,

682
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:10,169
you have to tell them what screwed-up
process is really at work in their head.

683
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,338
That's why I locked
the two of you in a room,

684
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,966
so you would say
something stupid and insensitive

685
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,176
and maybe
with a little bit of truth.

686
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,720
But you didn't.

687
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,808
So I can only assume
that you don't want to know the reason.

688
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,810
You're afraid to know.

689
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,773
You're not listening to me,
are you?

690
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,402
Try it sometime, you'll see why.

691
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:44,662
You look 37.

692
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,289
I am 37.

693
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,750
You looked 27 last week.

694
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,336
Unless I blacked out for 10 years,
your skin...

695
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,672
She has got lymphoma,
chemo's probably...

696
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,716
- Stop the chemo.
- She's getting better.

697
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,009
Bradycardia's improving,
we didn't...

698
00:36:58,134 --> 00:36:59,343
She have bruising?

699
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,305
She was pounding her legs
during the hallucinations.

700
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,390
It's not lymphoma.

701
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,101
Hey, don't... No, no, no.

702
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,524
My bad.
Thought "no" meant "yes".

703
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:18,446
Those aren't bruises,
they're mycobacterial lesions.

704
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:21,449
She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy,

705
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:24,952
must've caught it on
one of her overseas estrogen tours.

706
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,331
Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria,
she feels a little better,

707
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,208
wipes out most of her immune system,
she gets a whole lot worse.

708
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:34,795
Leprosy?
Like where my limbs fall off?

709
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,466
Actually, this is the flattering one.
It's also known as "pretty leprosy".

710
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,886
Doesn't disfigure,
makes your skin look younger, smoother.

711
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:45,056
Don't let the girls hear,
they'll all want to lick your face.

712
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,059
Unless you're that kind of feminist.

713
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:52,855
Blast her with antibiotics
and prednisone, she'll be fine.

714
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,733
Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late.

715
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,695
- Damn.
- What?

716
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,323
She's happy
you're gonna be fine,

717
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,160
but she'd be happier if you were
gonna be fine five minutes ago.

718
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,128
Test confirmed
Dr. House's diagnosis.

719
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,923
Thank God.

720
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,301
When you got pregnant,

721
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:25,513
the physical stress
triggered e-nodosum leprosum,

722
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:28,057
a common complication of leprosy.

723
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:31,811
Inflamed the nerves to your heart,
made it hard to absorb vitamins,

724
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,398
scarred your fallopian tubes.
It explains everything.

725
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,361
Better prescribe me
some skin cream, too, huh?

726
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,030
You might want it
for those job interviews.

727
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,035
I'm going back on the road with Patty.
My replacement flamed out.

728
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:54,709
She says I can manage some projects
on my own, carve out more of a role.

729
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,670
Do you really think she can change?

730
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,588
I don't know.

731
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,968
The truth is I'm not sure I...

732
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,219
You can change.

733
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,013
No.

734
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,850
I'm not sure
I want her to change.

735
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:15,396
If she's reasonable,
if she's just another employer,

736
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:20,151
then I'm just another employee.

737
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,740
In a weird way, I matter.

738
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,623
I like you better now
that you're dying.

739
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,625
I was wrong.

740
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:40,421
You took a shot.

741
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:44,759
She's going back to work for that idiot.
It's pathetic.

742
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,511
You thought something would change?

743
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:52,850
She almost died because of that job.
Yeah, I thought...

744
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,936
Almost dying changes nothing.

745
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,902
Dying changes everything.

746
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:34,683
I'm sorry.
I know I didn't try to kill her,

747
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:39,980
I know I didn't want her hurt,
I know it was a freak accident,

748
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:45,444
but I feel like crap,
and she's dead because of me.

749
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,073
I don't blame you.

750
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,160
I wanted to. I tried to.

751
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,956
I must've reviewed Amber's case file
a hundred times to find a way...

752
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,626
But it wasn't your fault.

753
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,840
Then we're okay?

754
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:12,888
I mean, I know you're not,
but maybe I can help.

755
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,598
We're not okay.

756
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,602
Amber was never the reason
I was leaving.

757
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,355
I didn't want
to tell you because...

758
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:30,030
Because I was trying,
like I always do, to protect you,

759
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,117
which is the problem.

760
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:38,998
You spread misery
because you can't feel anything else.

761
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:43,002
You manipulate people because you can't
handle any kind of real relationship.

762
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:48,424
And I've enabled it for years,
the games, the binges,

763
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,093
the middle-of-the-night phone calls.

764
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,890
I should have been the one
on the bus, not...

765
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:01,937
You should have been alone on the bus.

766
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:07,067
If I've learned anything from Amber,
it's that I have to take care of myself.

767
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:14,325
We're not friends anymore,
House.

768
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,914
I'm not sure we ever were.
