1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,631
I want to reassure you.

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:07,717
Your child can have
a completely normal life.

3
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:12,180
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

4
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,184
It's a condition
called genetic mosaicism.

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:20,563
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,565
Repaired?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,402
Made to look more typical.

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,571
More typical?

9
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:32,617
But you haven't even
told us if the baby's a boy or a girl.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,579
That's a choice
you have to make.

11
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,589
Nice job, Jackson.

12
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:52,470
Take it.

13
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,773
He had the shot.
He lost his nerve.

14
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,316
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

15
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,531
Three.

16
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,635
No fear that time.

17
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,064
Melanie.

18
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,234
Oh, my God. Jackson!

19
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,739
Black heels or the boots?

20
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,910
You know I'm a fan
of those heels.

21
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,578
Boots it is.

22
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,752
For all we know, House knows you're
a fan of those heels.

23
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,170
You think House is
going to figure out

24
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,131
we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

25
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,593
Go with the boots.

26
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,723
You gonna eat that?

27
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:02,517
Have at it.

28
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,521
Did you just ask my permission
before you took my food?

29
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,897
Yes, we can.

30
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,317
Adolescent genetic mosaic,
collapsed during a basketball game,

31
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,195
presenting with
persistent pelvic pain.

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,405
Fun.

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,866
The parents haven't told their son
that he could have been their daughter.

34
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:20,535
They want assurance
that you won't either.

35
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,328
Less fun. But still.

36
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,880
That was easy.

37
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,677
Our new patient.
Part girl, part boy,

38
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,597
all Thirteen's dream date.

39
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,435
Severe pelvic pain started during a
basketball game. Could be dehydration.

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,437
ER gave him fluids
when he came in.

41
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,730
Still, if it was chronic...

42
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,690
We got a kid who could mate
with himself, and we're thinking

43
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:51,858
he didn't have enough to drink?

44
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,818
There are dozens
of intersex disorders.

45
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:58,865
Persistent pelvic pain could mean
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, PMDS.

46
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,742
Those conditions occur
in intersex kids

47
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,329
who are chromosomally
XX or XY, not XX and XY.

48
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,915
Parents recently started him on
testosterone, maybe there's something...

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,375
Vitamins wouldn't
cause pelvic pain.

50
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:12,715
There's a note in here.

51
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,715
We're supposed to refer to his
testosterone shots as vitamins.

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
His parents aren't just liars.

53
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,593
They want us to be liars, too.

54
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,472
I won't do it.
You guys will, though.

55
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,917
He's a kid. Parents don't think
he's ready to deal with it.

56
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:28,269
My dad was the same way about me maybe
having Huntington's. It's...

57
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,438
Well, if that was
your experience,

58
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,982
it must surely apply
in this situation.

59
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,819
Pain could be caused
by a blind uterus hidden in his abdomen.

60
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:37,862
He needs an MRI.

61
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,406
Right. Boy with girl genes.

62
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,535
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough to check for a uterus.

63
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,704
He could have complications
from the surgeries on his penis.

64
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,914
That can cause pelvic pain.

65
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,832
Way to multi-task.

66
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,085
Impress your boss
and humiliate your ex.

67
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,420
MRI is a waste of time.

68
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,130
But to continue
the humiliation,

69
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,299
go put a camera up his penis.

70
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,221
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

71
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,056
What do you think
is wrong with our son?

72
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,894
These people were just
coming to tell you.

73
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,521
This is better.

74
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,856
Don't have to worry about
them losing their way.

75
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:17,944
We think that he has a blind uterus.
He should have an MRI.

76
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:19,904
Did you send them a text?

77
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,032
Over the past 13 years,
we've educated ourselves.

78
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,120
Who needs med school
when you've got Wi-Fi?

79
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:31,040
Go schedule their son
for an MRI with contrast right away.

80
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,376
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

81
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,213
You just said an MRI
was a waste of time.

82
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,340
So is arguing with them.

83
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,137
Contrast's in.

84
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,598
Jackson, we're going
to get started, so try to lie still.

85
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:54,731
How long do you think the post-break-up
awkwardness is going to last?

86
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,859
Foreman and I are
both professionals.

87
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,902
Stomach and liver are clear.

88
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,824
If by "professional" you mean he's a
T-1000 built by Cyberdyne Systems.

89
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,909
I never understood
what you saw in him.

90
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,953
He's not really your type, huh?

91
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,663
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

92
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,751
Here's my impression of Foreman
on the happiest day of his life.

93
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,089
Now, the saddest day
of his life.

94
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,136
We just broke up. I'm not quite ready
to mock him yet.

95
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,765
House was a jerk
to split you two up,

96
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,018
but bottom line,
he did you a favor.

97
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,146
Area around the
intestinal tract is clear.

98
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,898
No blind uterus.

99
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:47,450
I think there's
something wrong with House.

100
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,285
Who's he making miserable now?

101
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,703
Actually, no one.

102
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,913
He okayed an MRI

103
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,333
just because the parents wanted to look
for a blind uterus.

104
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,960
There was no fighting,
no arguing, he just went along.

105
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,754
It's a valid medical theory.

106
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,631
He doesn't think it is.

107
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:05,176
House decided to
humor these parents.

108
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,679
Maybe he had
a great cup of coffee,

109
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,473
or a tremendous bowel movement.

110
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,559
Bottom line is,
your boss is in a good mood.

111
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,062
Stop analyzing it
and just enjoy it.

112
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,531
We're going to use this scope
to fill your bladder with saline,

113
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,200
then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

114
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,661
Why would there be
a narrow spot?

115
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,539
Sometimes it just happens.

116
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,583
Can my parents come in?

117
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,626
Sure.

118
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,964
I thought it'd be awkward for you
having them here.

119
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,259
I have this feeling
they've seen me naked before.

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,805
Now, take a breath,
just try to relax.

121
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,102
Mom.

122
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,731
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

123
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,987
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

124
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:10,241
Those were so hard,
but you pulled through.

125
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,286
You can do this, too.

126
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,665
I'm to the bladder.
Start the saline.

127
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,590
I'm going to look around
and pull back on the scope.

128
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,010
Feels tight.

129
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,056
That pressure's normal.

130
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,722
Just try to hold on
for a few more minutes.

131
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,640
It's not down there.

132
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,517
It's my chest.

133
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,899
I can't breathe.
Can't... Can't breathe.

134
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,400
Is he okay?

135
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,860
Muffled heart sounds.

136
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,571
- Jugular's distended.
- Pericardial effusion.

137
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,697
We need a 10 gauge
and a syringe.

138
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:50,656
What's happening?

139
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,866
His heart is filling
with exudate.

140
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,118
If we don't drain it,
it'll stop beating.

141
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,752
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

142
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,157
His heart rate
is back to normal.

143
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,755
Pelvis plus heart.

144
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,591
Doesn't fit with any of the syndromes
associated with mosaicism.

145
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,385
It could be drugs,
toxins, an infection.

146
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,054
You're okay with this?

147
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,180
With what?

148
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:18,100
That we're considering a diagnosis
unrelated to this kid being a she-male.

149
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,837
Assuming a coincidence
like that would usually torture you,

150
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,146
but you're completely unfazed.

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,567
Completely unfazed? You think
I'm totally lacking in any fazing?

152
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:31,364
The idea that I'm anything less than
half-fazed, I actually find offensive.

153
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,573
It greatly fazes me.

154
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,033
He started testosterone...

155
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,368
Vitamins.

156
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,870
A few months ago.
That can cause autoimmune diseases

157
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,538
like polyarteritis and SLE,

158
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:45,044
which can cause pericardial effusion
and pelvic pain. So, it is related.

159
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,339
Now I'm unfazed.

160
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,092
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune,

161
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,469
finasteride to block
the vitamins.

162
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,353
You slept with House.

163
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,731
He asked permission
before taking my bagel,

164
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,566
took the case without a fight,

165
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,111
honored the parents'
request for an MRI.

166
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,822
Yes, those were my terms
for sleeping with him.

167
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,365
He's in a good mood.

168
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,951
Sex with me would explain that,

169
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:21,706
but it doesn't explain why I'm not
curled up in a ball, weeping in shame.

170
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,624
I did not have sex with House.

171
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,469
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

172
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:29,213
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

173
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,215
- That can't be good.
- Or he's just in a good mood.

174
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,967
This is not a crisis.

175
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:36,429
Maybe you can get back
some of that money he owes you.

176
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,724
Hmm.

177
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,479
Testosterone blocker?

178
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:50,276
Does that mean if Jackson has SLE,
or whatever that other thing was,

179
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,737
that he'd have to go
off the hormones?

180
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,238
Probably.

181
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,407
Then Jackson
will stop developing,

182
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,492
he'll never go through puberty.

183
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,619
Maybe this isn't
what's wrong with him,

184
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,265
maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

185
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:05,249
Yeah. But if it is,
then he'll never be a man.

186
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,337
Did we make the wrong choice?

187
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:20,598
You'll need to tell him the testosterone
blocker is something else.

188
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:25,728
Or maybe this is a good opportunity
to tell him the truth.

189
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,357
It might make it simpler
for all of you.

190
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,318
You want us to tell
a sick adolescent boy

191
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:36,155
that he's really not an adolescent boy?

192
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,616
That doesn't seem
simpler to me.

193
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,162
No. Just

194
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,458
give him the meds.

195
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:54,799
So, you have
pain in one arm and both your legs.

196
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,717
Does it hurt right now?

197
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,885
No.

198
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,472
It's when I, like,
put pressure on them.

199
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,267
See, it hurts when I do this.

200
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,269
Ow!

201
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,230
And this.

202
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,649
Ow!

203
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,402
And this.

204
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,238
Ow!

205
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,449
What about this?

206
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,368
Ow!

207
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,750
Did you give House the moron
with the broken finger?

208
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,502
They've been in Room 2
about 10 minutes.

209
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:36,257
The patient should've been screaming
for another doctor seven minutes ago.

210
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,887
Thanks, bro.

211
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,027
If I have this IV,
why do I need a shot, too?

212
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,740
Just some extra medicine,
just to be safe.

213
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,703
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

214
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,788
- What position?
- Point guard.

215
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,000
Small forward.
How's your crossover dribble?

216
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,211
It's okay. I'm not really
that into basketball.

217
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,089
Gonna feel
a little pinch, okay?

218
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:22,303
So, if you're not that into it,
why'd you join the team?

219
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,016
My mom kind of made me do it.

220
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,767
My parents were the same way,

221
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:31,061
always pushing me
to try new things.

222
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,398
It was more like
what she didn't want me to try.

223
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:38,444
I wanted to take dance,
but she flipped out,

224
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,489
and made me choose
between basketball and hockey.

225
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,824
What does your dad say?

226
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,620
He seemed okay with it,
then he just caved in to my mom.

227
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,167
Your palm is red.

228
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,002
What does that mean?

229
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,466
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

230
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,556
You were right,
he is in a good mood.

231
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,775
Bummer it didn't work out
with you and Thirteen.

232
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,235
It happens.

233
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,945
You guys seemed happy together.

234
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,198
It's probably for the best, you know,
the bisexual thing and all.

235
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,157
That was never an issue.

236
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,785
No, it never is. Until it is.

237
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,579
This is Thirteen.
Before you guys got together,

238
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,249
she was hooking up
with a different girl every night.

239
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:37,336
Long term, you really think
you could compete with that?

240
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,757
House, wake up.
We have to talk.

241
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,427
Stop pretending
to be asleep, we're not leaving.

242
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:46,845
House.

243
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,766
What's going on?

244
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,851
House?

245
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,241
- He's not breathing.
- Can you get a pulse?

246
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,524
- Barely.
- Call a code.

247
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,317
Get an Ambu bag
from the nurse's station.

248
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,603
Heart's still working,
means synapses are still firing.

249
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,989
We just need to get
a message through to him.

250
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,499
You stopped breathing.

251
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,209
What the hell is going on?

252
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,928
I think my penis
stopped breathing. Do you know CPR?

253
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,471
Looks like your brain is okay.

254
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,682
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

255
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,145
I'm fine, other than the fact
that my nurple is now purple.

256
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,896
No wonder you
broke up with him.

257
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,316
I'm surprised yours
are still attached.

258
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,527
By the way,
I could see that from here.

259
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,446
I assume those are our
patient's lab results.

260
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,364
The patient can wait.
You could have died.

261
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,826
The only reason you'd ignore a
near-death experience is you don't care,

262
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,703
or you already know
why it happened.

263
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,539
It's called Vicodin.
I took too many.

264
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,542
Can I please get
some information about our patient?

265
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,837
The patient's palms are red. Lab test
confirmed liver and kidney dysfunction.

266
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,763
I don't remember you
taking any Vicodin today.

267
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,883
I don't remember
hiring my mother.

268
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,509
And what causes the enzymes in

269
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,471
little Boy George's existing
heart problem and pelvic pain?

270
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,223
You didn't take any yesterday
at breakfast, either.

271
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,100
I don't remember
having breakfast with my mother.

272
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,353
Amyloidosis with
systemic involvement.

273
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,688
Protein levels are normal.
This kid's depressed.

274
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,732
If he's self-medicating
with drugs and alcohol,

275
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,108
that'd explain his symptoms.

276
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,818
Search the school.
Search the home.

277
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,570
Seriously? Or are you
just deflecting?

278
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,113
Both.

279
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,535
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

280
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,081
I'm staying right here,
so we can properly discuss this.

281
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,628
- He's on heroin.
- How can you...

282
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,506
Number one, he's happy,
which means he's high.

283
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,301
Number two, when he moved his bad leg,
he didn't use his hands to support it.

284
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,596
Whatever he's taking,
it's stronger than Vicodin.

285
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,015
What are we gonna do?

286
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,729
You really think House
took too many Vicodin?

287
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,900
Guy pops them like candy. I'm surprised
it hasn't happened before.

288
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,237
Do you miss
sleeping with women?

289
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,739
- Excuse me?
- Simple question.

290
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,909
Yes. It's a simple answer.

291
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,579
I'll check under the bed.

292
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,001
I also miss
sleeping with other men,

293
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,921
and I'm sure you miss sleeping
with other women.

294
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,216
Monogamy is like saying
you're never going to have

295
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,219
any other ice cream flavor
besides Rocky Road.

296
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,848
So, you're saying if you don't have
pink bubblegum for a while,

297
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,267
that one day you're
gonna chase down the ice cream truck?

298
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,228
No, Rocky Road is great.

299
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:46,316
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

300
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,736
I also know that if
I have other flavors,

301
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:52,906
then Rocky Road is gonna be left in the
freezer where anyone can just dip in.

302
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,200
Can we please
drop the metaphor?

303
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,829
Why is this coming up now?

304
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,749
Kutner said the silver lining
of our break-up

305
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,418
was I wouldn't
be dumped for a girl.

306
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,295
There's nothing
in here, either.

307
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,464
Seems like you're wrong
about this kid having drug or alcohol...

308
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,549
When did he bring that up?

309
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,134
Earlier today, right before...

310
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,636
This morning,
Taub called you a robot.

311
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:15,846
Hmm.

312
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,182
Either it's a big coincidence

313
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:22,060
or they're jerking us
around, they know.

314
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,980
And if they know, House knows.

315
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,816
This is bad.

316
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,194
No, this is good.

317
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,698
House only has two ways to handle
us still going out.

318
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,742
He jerks us around
or he fires us.

319
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,120
He chose option A.
This is good.

320
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,377
But this is bad.

321
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:54,760
"I stand alone, my soul and me,
beneath the mask that others see."

322
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,473
His chest is still rising.

323
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,101
He's just screwing with me
'cause Cuddy made me baby-sit.

324
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,271
"A pain that tears and bites
and will not bend."

325
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,649
"Only when I sleep
will it end."

326
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:12,653
Downer.
And medically irrelevant.

327
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,074
You sure his chest is moving?

328
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,200
House.

329
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,662
If he's faking, you think he's going to
come clean because you said his name?

330
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,958
Back off. Only Thirteen
gets to grab my nipples this time.

331
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,584
You know, recreating the moment

332
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,672
when you made us crap our pants
isn't actually all that funny.

333
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,800
That is sweet that you're
worried about House.

334
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,054
Unless the next stanza reads,

335
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,434
"Hoping to fry my brain to death
I smoked some primo crystal math,"

336
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,394
I'm not interested.

337
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,437
You can't deny that
this kid may be suicidal.

338
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,148
We're not here to make him happy,
we're here to diagnose him.

339
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,525
It's an infection.

340
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,237
Swab of the kid's water bottle turned up
toxoplasmosis.

341
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,489
I'll start him
on pyrimethamine.

342
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,084
I had no idea he felt this way.

343
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,379
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

344
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,132
It might help more
if you talked to him.

345
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,759
He's not ready.

346
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,554
If telling him the truth
would help him stop feeling like this.

347
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,056
If I knew that it'd
make him less confused,

348
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,600
I'd tell him right now.

349
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:28,103
But if she's wrong,
we'd only make things worse.

350
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,857
He obviously senses
he's different.

351
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,984
He's looking for answers.

352
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,653
Every teenager feels different.

353
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,700
He's sick. This isn't the time
to spring this on him.

354
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,538
Okay-

355
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,334
When you give Jackson
the antibiotics,

356
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,337
will you please re-start
the testosterone?

357
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,713
Sure.

358
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,055
I get House wanting to jerk me
and Thirteen around, but you guys?

359
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,515
Told you they were
still together.

360
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,516
How'd he know?

361
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,311
He noticed you smell like
Thirteen's soap every morning.

362
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,230
- You figured it out?
- Yes, I'm a little slow.

363
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,776
Maybe someone should let me know
when I should be insulted.

364
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,361
Then House doesn't know.

365
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,154
Probably does now
that you felt her up

366
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,490
during that last differential.

367
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,244
You noticed this,
but House didn't?

368
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,414
Yes, I get it.
He's generally smarter than me.

369
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,419
Can we please move on?

370
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,667
He's not generally
smarter than you,

371
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,628
he's always smarter than you.

372
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,046
Unless...

373
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,220
Hello?

374
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,388
House is on heroin.

375
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,644
Well, that's certainly
an interesting notion.

376
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,230
It's why his lungs stopped,
it's why he okayed the MRI,

377
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,608
it's why he missed things
he wouldn't ordinarily miss.

378
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,445
We'll run some tests,
and I'll let you know.

379
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,905
He's there, isn't he?

380
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,510
Well, that would certainly explain
the inappropriate responses.

381
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,743
I got to go. Okay-

382
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,621
Sorry. Consult.

383
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,624
When did you order these?

384
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,251
When you were in the bathroom.

385
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,962
I thought a celebration
was in order.

386
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,381
To cheating death.

387
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,641
You off bourbon?
Can I get you something else?

388
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,893
I came here expecting a burger.

389
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,855
Figured I'd have to endure
a little lecture on moderation.

390
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,398
You never listen, so why...

391
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,483
But instead, I get a drink.

392
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,611
A nice little serving
of respiratory depressant

393
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,780
on the day that my lungs
stopped working.

394
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,449
You seem fine now.

395
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,285
You don't believe
that I OD'd on Vicodin.

396
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,037
You figure I'm
on something stronger.

397
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,830
And because you can never,
ever assume anything

398
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,124
but the most screwed-up scenario
as far as I'm concerned...

399
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,792
Funny how I'm usually right.

400
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,128
You think that I'm on heroin.

401
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,799
This is your version of a tox screen.
Because if I am on heroin,

402
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,802
I can't drink that without risking
another bout of not breathing.

403
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,184
Well?

404
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,362
Good night.

405
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,496
Another shot?

406
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,331
I'm afraid so.

407
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,462
That looks like the vitamins
my parents give me.

408
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,127
Same red top.

409
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,263
These aren't vitamins.

410
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,850
What is it?

411
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:57,312
I can't tell you that.
You should ask your parents.

412
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,028
You idiot.

413
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,952
Okay, I admit it.
I have bulimia.

414
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,371
I look good though, don't I?

415
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,540
Heroin. Heroin!

416
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,126
House, of all the stupid...

417
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm not on heroin.

418
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,130
I just caught you
with your fingers down your throat.

419
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm on methadone.

420
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,345
Stupid product,
heroin without the high.

421
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,265
Yeah, and twice
the risk of death.

422
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,641
But no risk of arrest.

423
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,101
You nearly died.

424
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,936
Today was a fluke,
I nodded off.

425
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,356
Right, you're safe
as long as you never sleep again.

426
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,568
Mis-time your dose, you die,
couple of drinks, you die,

427
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,444
mix it with
the wrong drugs, you die.

428
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,280
You want to detox from Vicodin,

429
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,282
pick something
that won't kill you.

430
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,992
I'm not detoxing.

431
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:56,329
If you're looking for something
to help with your pain.

432
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:00,292
It doesn't help my pain.
It eliminates it.

433
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,971
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

434
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,357
She completely
disregarded our instructions.

435
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,902
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

436
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,321
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

437
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,073
I want her removed
from our son's case.

438
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,368
I'm sorry for the position
Dr. Hadley put you in,

439
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,953
but I can't do that.

440
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,624
She's a valuable part
of Dr. House's diagnostic team.

441
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,918
If he stays on the case,
so does she.

442
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,045
We have to deal with Jackson.

443
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,088
These questions
aren't going to go away.

444
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,007
He's not ready for this.

445
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,053
Let's hope you're wrong.

446
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,937
I'm sorry.
I'll stay away from their son.

447
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,605
No, you won't.

448
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,816
In about 15 minutes, you're the only
person that kid's gonna trust.

449
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:10,904
If he needs a hand to hold,
make sure yours is available.

450
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,456
So, what, am I a boy or a girl?

451
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:27,420
Some of your cells are male,
and some are female.

452
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,422
So, basically, I'm a freak.

453
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,174
No, no, buddy.

454
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,844
You're just a little different.

455
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:42,936
You've known this since I was born
and you never told me?

456
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,938
We didn't want you
to be confused.

457
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,189
So, you lied to me.

458
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,901
Oh, please, sweetie,
we were just trying to protect you.

459
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,069
Don't.

460
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,239
Just leave me alone.

461
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,993
Get out.

462
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,997
Let's go.

463
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,095
You still breathing in there?

464
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,889
Because if not,
I'm sending in janitorial.

465
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:24,311
I'm not breathing,
but it's strictly voluntary.

466
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,104
You should've seen the guy
who was in here before me.

467
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,231
I know about the methadone.

468
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,819
It's legal.
I have a prescription.

469
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,238
Whatever doctor
you conned into writing it

470
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,949
clearly had no idea about
your addiction issues, your lack of...

471
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,745
He knows I'm in pain. What I put
in my body is my business.

472
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,456
If you keep taking this,
you could die.

473
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,916
If he'd said that if
I keep doing this, you could die,

474
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,585
then it'd be your business.

475
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,089
I can't sit by and watch you
kill yourself.

476
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:56,634
As long as you're in my hospital,
you can't do methadone.

477
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,728
I'll send someone for my stuff.

478
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,816
That's it? You're quitting?

479
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,277
You're choosing methadone
over this job?

480
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,822
I'm choosing lack of pain
over this job.

481
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,919
Eventually you have to talk
to your parents again.

482
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,629
No, I don't.

483
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:48,061
I have this one friend
on my basketball team, Will.

484
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:52,690
We hang out a lot.
I really like him.

485
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,485
Now I'm worried that I,

486
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,904
you know, like him.

487
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,493
Maybe I'm supposed to.

488
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,788
Because if I'm really a girl...

489
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,169
Do you feel like a girl?

490
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:17,257
I like dancing
more than basketball.

491
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,716
Is that what that means?

492
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:26,850
Jackson,

493
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:33,189
as hard as it is right now,
at least it's out in the open.

494
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,527
You don't have to
hide behind a mask.

495
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,826
I found the poem
you wrote in your room.

496
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,707
No matter how bad things get,

497
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:54,043
killing yourself
is never the answer.

498
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,844
This was an English assignment.

499
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,681
We were supposed
to write a poem

500
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,850
in the style of Sylvia Plath.

501
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,440
You don't feel this way?

502
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,152
I'm sad sometimes.

503
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,490
But I don't want to die.

504
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,659
At least, I didn't.

505
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:39,255
Are these antibiotics
supposed to make you nauseous?

506
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,090
Yeah, they can.

507
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,261
- We're on our own.
- Is he okay?

508
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,586
He's fine. He's just not here.

509
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,305
Did he quit?
Did she suspend him?

510
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,224
She didn't say.
Just told me I was in charge

511
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,850
until further notice.

512
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,435
So, if we add bloody vomit

513
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,020
to our patient's list
of symptoms...

514
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,856
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused by a gastric fistula

515
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,343
caused by
necrotizing pancreatitis.

516
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,734
She must have
told you something.

517
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,444
Nothing that would
help us with this patient.

518
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,446
Heart, liver,
kidneys and pancreas.

519
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,449
Obviously, whatever this kid's got,
it's something systemic.

520
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,743
Zollinger-Ellison.

521
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,579
Or systemic scleroderma.

522
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,655
Zollinger-Ellison fits better.

523
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,874
Why?

524
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,126
Can we at least call House?

525
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,461
We can, I have,
he's not answering.

526
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,463
Put the patient on
proton pump inhibitors.

527
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,007
If he gets better,
it's Zollinger-Ellison.

528
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,509
If not, it's scleroderma.

529
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,392
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

530
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,853
You don't want it
to be scleroderma

531
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,646
because that means
he's going to die.

532
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:19,856
Patients die all the time.

533
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,984
Not the ones whose
families you've ruined.

534
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,445
I don't think that, you do.

535
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,697
It's not your fault.

536
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,866
He was no more confused
than any other teenager,

537
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,827
then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

538
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:34,245
You were trying to help.

539
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,130
Hi, is House here?

540
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,590
He's getting dressed.

541
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:48,259
I'll be back
around 10:00 tonight.

542
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,470
Go on in.

543
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,679
Okay-

544
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,435
Who is she?

545
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,354
I hired her to watch me sleep,

546
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,759
make sure I don't
stop breathing.

547
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,691
Home nurses
usually wear scrubs.

548
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,360
She's not a nurse.

549
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,323
You hired a hooker to watch you sleep?
That just can't...

550
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,203
Surprisingly,
hookers are cheaper.

551
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,539
They don't sue for sexual harassment.
Which one?

552
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,000
You shaved!

553
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,170
The red one then.

554
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,381
You have two ties?

555
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,424
Meeting at
St. Sebastian's today.

556
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,926
I'm going to try
and talk them into

557
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,803
starting up
a diagnostics department.

558
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:33,471
That sounds great.

559
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,226
I just came by to check up on you,
see how you were doing.

560
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,187
I'm fine.

561
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,232
I guess you are.

562
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,487
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

563
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,280
I'm afraid not.

564
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,201
So, that means
he's got the other thing?

565
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:59,122
I'm so sorry. We'll start him
on anti-inflammatories.

566
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:02,542
If we're lucky,
that will slow down the progression.

567
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,302
My son has a death sentence,

568
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,222
and I can't go in there and be with him
because of you.

569
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,348
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,268
You find a homework assignment
and decide he's suicidal,

571
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,729
make it your own
personal mission.

572
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:23,896
I let my feelings...

573
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,315
Oh, don't you dare apologize.

574
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,025
Like it could absolve you

575
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,570
of what you've done
to me, my family.

576
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,280
He was fine.

577
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,490
I understand why you're angry.

578
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,576
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

579
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,119
He won't let us in the room.

580
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,830
He's a teenager,
you're his mother.

581
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,207
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

582
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,752
Go be with him.

583
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,970
Thank you.

584
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,516
I didn't do it for you.

585
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,398
We made a mistake.

586
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,483
No, we didn't.

587
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,942
The methadone is good for him.

588
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,153
The methadone
is gonna kill him.

589
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,489
He shaved.
He was wearing a tie.

590
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,407
He has a meeting
at St. Sebastian.

591
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,867
If he buys a new pair of shoes,

592
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,410
should we let him smoke crack?

593
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,370
Cuddy, he's happy-

594
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,916
House doesn't do happy,
pain or no pain.

595
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,043
Okay, maybe.

596
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,837
But he's our friend,

597
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:35,301
and this is his one chance
to not be miserable.

598
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,285
The heels, very nice.

599
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,789
No reason not to wear them
now that House is gone.

600
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,040
You Okay?

601
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,209
Yeah. Just tired.

602
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,794
Got some good news.

603
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:10,919
The patient's scleroderma

604
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,797
is responding to
the anti-inflammatory meds.

605
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,341
His AST level
has dropped a bit.

606
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,802
So, he's dying
slightly less quickly than we thought.

607
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,971
That's great news.

608
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,808
I'm not okay.

609
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,103
Next time, just say that.

610
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,816
What's his AST?

611
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,151
185, I think.

612
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,111
That's a pretty fast drop.

613
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,037
Are we sure it's from
the anti-inflammatories?

614
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,235
What else could it be from?

615
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,740
He's been off the antibiotics
for a while.

616
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:40,908
Proton pump inhibitors
wouldn't...

617
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,076
He's back on testosterone.

618
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,703
Testosterone wouldn't help
his liver function.

619
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,246
But it could improve
his kidney function,

620
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,540
which would also lower his AST.

621
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,500
But not in kidneys damaged
by scleroderma.

622
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,086
Which means
it's not scleroderma.

623
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,635
I have an interview
in two hours.

624
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,013
Wow.

625
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,807
Hand over my letter
of recommendation.

626
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,184
Sorry, I haven't done it yet.

627
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,729
You have no right
to sabotage...

628
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,647
I was busy with this.

629
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,527
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

630
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,948
Weekly drug tests, supervised doses
administered on a precise schedule,

631
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,618
by me or one of the nurses.

632
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,870
Seems weird,
getting my meds here,

633
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,496
when I'm working
somewhere else.

634
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,789
Yes.

635
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,210
I'm offering you your job back.

636
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:38,215
- I want a raise.
- No.

637
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,677
And a bigger office,
but in the same spot.

638
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,095
No.

639
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:47,224
We both know
this is where you belong.

640
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,104
Okay-

641
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,233
Welcome back.

642
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,951
Thank you.

643
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,079
You're welcome.

644
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:17,880
You Okay?

645
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,092
I have issues
with authority. You?

646
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,927
We thought you were gone.

647
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,136
Cuddy missed me.

648
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,013
And what happened to your cane?

649
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,599
She asked to borrow it
for some reason.

650
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,477
Patient dead,
or do I need to do anything?

651
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:32,728
He's got scleroderma.

652
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,563
It's not scleroderma.

653
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:39,735
Wow, two days and you've
already got two separate theories.

654
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,113
You're back. Good.

655
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,959
We noticed a drop in AST levels.
It's not from the anti-inflammatory.

656
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,909
It's because his kidneys
got better from the testosterone.

657
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,953
Which rules out scleroderma.

658
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,080
When did you two
come up with this?

659
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,041
We ran into each other
in the lobby.

660
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,420
So, what did we miss?

661
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,714
When I say "we," I mean you,
since I wasn't here.

662
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,716
We've ruled out
Zollinger-Ellison.

663
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,009
That was a dumb idea.

664
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,927
- Why?
- Because it was wrong.

665
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,932
Also Toxoplasmosis, dehydration,
SLE, various intersex disorders.

666
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,183
Oh, crap.

667
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,022
Does this kid like
energy drinks?

668
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:19,150
I saw some empty bottles
in the team's locker room.

669
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,736
But energy drinks
don't explain...

670
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:22,862
Nice work.

671
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,697
So, we're okay?

672
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,658
Why wouldn't we be?

673
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,161
Nice heels.

674
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,754
This is all
your parents' fault.

675
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:41,088
Excuse me?

676
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:45,051
You chug a lot of energy drinks before,
during and after practice?

677
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,095
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

678
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,139
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

679
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:53,434
The ER treated him for that.
It didn't help the pain.

680
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,311
That's where
the energy drinks came in.

681
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,716
They put a strain
on his kidneys,

682
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:59,732
so he needed more time to rebound
from the initial dehydration.

683
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:00,983
Then why isn't he better?

684
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,736
That's where
your idiocy came in.

685
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,741
Before we could give him
another glass of water,

686
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,115
you two insisted I do an MRI.

687
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,536
So, I go down a blind alley,
looking for a blind uterus,

688
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,872
and my team injects him
with contrast material.

689
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,166
If his kidneys
had been healthy,

690
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,611
he would've filtered out the contrast
in a couple of hours.

691
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,171
Since they weren't,
it went around and around,

692
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,017
eventually getting absorbed by his
heart, his liver and his pancreas,

693
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,093
getting in trouble
everywhere it went.

694
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,137
Your son was fine
when he got here.

695
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,057
It was
your freaked-out over-protectiveness

696
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,600
that nearly killed him.

697
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,018
Nearly?

698
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:41,565
He's young. A few weeks of dialysis,
he should be fine.

699
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:52,660
You gave birth
to a freak of nature,

700
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:56,163
doesn't mean it's a good idea
to treat him like one.

701
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:09,677
How are you feeling?

702
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:11,220
A little bit better.

703
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,640
I saw you talking
to your parents earlier, that's good.

704
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,184
My mom asked
if I wanted to take dance lessons.

705
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,894
That's great.

706
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,523
I'm actually worried
I might miss basketball.

707
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,066
I was starting to get good.

708
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,110
No reason you can't do both.

709
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,593
Starting tomorrow, you'll come
to my office for your fix.

710
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,012
I'm done with the methadone.

711
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,598
I screwed up.

712
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:58,100
The kid's parents
wanted that MRI.

713
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,270
I knew he didn't need it.
I did it anyway.

714
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:02,688
That's what got him sick.

715
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,025
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

716
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,235
I created a case.

717
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,574
I played nice because I was in a
good mood because it didn't hurt.

718
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,993
You don't need your pain
to be a good doctor.

719
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,199
I'm not interested in good.

720
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,121
You're afraid to be happy.

721
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,332
Why do you care if I'm happy?

722
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:33,135
You're afraid of change. The one thing
you have is your intellect.

723
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,222
You think if that's compromised,
you have nothing.

724
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,269
Just take it.

725
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:44,563
No.

726
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,398
Don't do this.

727
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,652
It's already done.

728
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,908
This is the only me you get.
