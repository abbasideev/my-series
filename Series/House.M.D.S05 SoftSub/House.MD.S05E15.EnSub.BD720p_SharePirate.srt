1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,591
That's okay, Eileen.
I got this.

2
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:08,718
You sure?

3
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:09,677
Yeah, you get home.

4
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,053
Thanks, Danny.
See you in the morning.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,722
I'll be here.

6
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,774
Food's gone, Daryl.
We're closed.

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,749
You wouldn't happen to have an extra
coat in there, would you?

8
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,335
- You're wearing a coat.
- A winter coat, man. It's cold.

9
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,670
Come on.

10
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,805
Here.

11
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,604
Rangers? You expect me
to wear this in Jersey?

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,857
Come on, man, where's your
sense of humor?

13
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,233
Good night, Daryl.

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,983
Go away.

15
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,590
That's not funny, freak.

16
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,636
No one is laughing, Daniel.

17
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,561
You doing anything Friday?

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,439
I'm taking a lovely young lady
to the Philharmonic.

19
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,524
Is that your way of saying
you're having sex with a hooker?

20
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,694
Two. Can't create
a harmonic with just one.

21
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,572
Well, I was hoping you might be
available for Rachel's Simchat Bat.

22
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,908
- It's a...
- Jewish baby naming ceremony.

23
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,620
A time-honored tradition,
dating all the way back to the 1960s.

24
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,830
My house at 7:00.

25
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,584
It'll just be the rabbi and a
few friends and some family.

26
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,461
Nothing like welcoming
a baby into the world

27
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,755
with a completely
naked display of hypocrisy.

28
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,548
There'll be plenty of wine

29
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,259
and nice people
you can quietly mock.

30
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,510
Wish I could,

31
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,263
but I already put down
a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O.

32
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,556
House.

33
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,561
It's one evening.
I'd like you to be there.

34
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:52,441
Religious hokum against sponge bath.
Can I get back to you?

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,579
Can I help you?

36
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,039
Just browsing, thanks.

37
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,751
Happy to be
underachieving again?

38
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,711
Running the ER
is slacker heaven.

39
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,005
Looking for anything
in particular?

40
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,173
Not anymore.

41
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,008
- Where's this guy?
- Why?

42
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,637
'Cause he's my next patient. It'd be
rude of me not to introduce myself.

43
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,431
He's a drunk priest
who hallucinated Jesus.

44
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,392
Afraid you might have
missed something?

45
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,997
Afraid you're wasting
everyone's time?

46
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,437
It's obviously either
alcohol or exhaustion.

47
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,440
So, you admit
you have no idea which?

48
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,444
I admit that I'm too busy to care
who you're screwing with.

49
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:40,948
Don't thank me.

50
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,118
Just knowing I can be
of assistance is thanks enough.

51
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,875
You went out of your way to pick him?
This is nothing.

52
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,003
There are no small cases...

53
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,171
Any guesses where
this joke is going?

54
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,966
Could be psychomotor epilepsy.

55
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,175
Could be alcohol.

56
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,421
Shouldn't we let the ER rule
the obvious out before...

57
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,805
Could be atropine toxicity,
occipital lobe tumor.

58
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,807
You know something about this case
you're not telling us?

59
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,934
- Why would you think that?
- 'Cause you wanna screw with us.

60
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,437
Or screw with
a hallucinating priest.

61
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,148
Both are possible.
There's only one way to find out.

62
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,026
Run an EEG for epilepsy,
CT his brain for tumors.

63
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,738
And go check his
house of God for toxins.

64
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,324
Foreteen, hold up.

65
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,828
This department is broken,

66
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,873
and I'm not going to take a real case
until it's fixed.

67
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,418
Job or relationship,
your choice.

68
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,338
What?

69
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,715
To put it in terms
you might better understand,

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,259
if you don't split,
you must quit.

71
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,762
The drug trial is over.
I'm out, she's out.

72
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:45,721
Don't care.

73
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,473
We're adults,
we can handle this.

74
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,682
You just have to
give us a chance.

75
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,727
No, you're not, no, you can't,
and, no, I don't.

76
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:56,065
Mull it over. You got till the end
of this fake case to decide.

77
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,905
I wasn't drunk.

78
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,740
I had one or two drinks.

79
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,867
People often underestimate
alcohol's effect on their...

80
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,787
I was on my way to six.
I know how alcohol affects me.

81
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,288
This wasn't the alcohol.

82
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,500
You lived in Manhattan for three years,
then a year in Oregon,

83
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,628
18 months in New Mexico,
less than a year in Wisconsin,

84
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,464
and now you've been living in Trenton
for the last six months.

85
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,840
Yeah.

86
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,760
The more we know about you,

87
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,387
the more likely it is
we can help you.

88
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,389
Mmm. It's not medically
relevant, so...

89
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,392
No way to know,
unless you went to medical school.

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,732
Four years ago, a teen in a youth group
at my church

91
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,943
accused me of
inappropriate contact.

92
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,237
I was innocent,
but the church decided to transfer me,

93
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,697
said it would be easier
for all involved.

94
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,699
When the parishioners
at the new church

95
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,368
got wind
of why I'd been transferred,

96
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,746
they were unhappy.

97
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,374
I was sent off again and again.

98
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,210
And how is any of that
medically relevant?

99
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,963
So, the kid lied?

100
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,674
He was confused.

101
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,510
Confused whether you
molested him or not?

102
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,675
Okay, you wanted to know
why I moved around so much,

103
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,513
and I told you.

104
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,515
How about telling me
why I was hallucinating?

105
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,892
Syphilis could explain
the hallucination.

106
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,853
I'm not sexually active.

107
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,689
You don't have to admit
you did anything with the kid.

108
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,982
You weren't always a priest.

109
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,817
I wanted to be since I was 12.

110
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,319
I entered the seminary
when I was 17.

111
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,113
Maybe it wasn't
a hallucination.

112
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,739
Maybe it really was Jesus.

113
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,699
I'm not insane.

114
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,701
Seeing Jesus makes you insane?

115
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,786
Bit of an odd attitude
coming from a priest.

116
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,790
Well, it's just a job now.
The fairytale ended a long time ago.

117
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,254
You're a wuss,
part wimp, part puss.

118
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,673
I have no choice.
I'm part of the ceremony.

119
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,134
I thought you were
already circumcised.

120
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,720
It's one night for a friend.

121
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,446
What about the friend
who has two tickets

122
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:52,931
to see
Brubeck at the Blue Note?

123
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,600
I thought you had
an orgy planned.

124
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,767
I lied.

125
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,186
Are you lying about
the Brubeck tickets?

126
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,855
Yes, but only to save you
from yourself.

127
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,233
I'll be fine, and so will Cuddy,
if you don't show up.

128
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,527
I'm surprised
she even invited you.

129
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,489
It is oddly flattering.

130
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,658
God, I'm so sick
of his stupid stunts.

131
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,411
Everybody has to put up with their
boss' stupid stunts.

132
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,331
No, they don't. There's HR,
there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.

133
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,916
House doesn't listen to HR,

134
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,210
Cuddy'll let him fire us
before she fires him,

135
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,253
and I don't want another job.

136
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,631
Why do you cling to him?
Why do you defend him?

137
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,882
Just because I don't
want to be unemployed

138
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,050
doesn't mean I'm co-dependent.

139
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,969
I'm not saying you're co-dependent,
I'm saying you're scared.

140
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,853
You know what? You're right.

141
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,898
So, you wanna quit?

142
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,652
No, I wanna stop
a stupid stunt.

143
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,571
House doesn't want either
one of us to quit. He wants this.

144
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,450
He's got two lab rats in a maze
and thrown in one piece of cheese.

145
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,332
So, what do we do?

146
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,834
Nothing.

147
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,546
Cool.

148
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,005
It's cool he's
a child molester?

149
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,466
It's cool that a priest
doesn't believe in God.

150
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,885
It's cool that God
did to him what he did to the kid.

151
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,387
Allegedly.

152
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,513
You think he's innocent?

153
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,931
He had honest eyes?

154
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:16,890
And you think he's guilty,

155
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,935
which explains why you're
dying to discharge him.

156
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,561
I'm dying to discharge him
because he's not sick,

157
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,437
- not because he's a pedophile.
- Allegedly.

158
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,398
You actually believe
the kid got confused?

159
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,609
If everybody lies,
that includes teenage boys.

160
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,903
Aren't we lucky to have
such an interesting patient?

161
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,822
Had. There's nothing
wrong with him.

162
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,366
World's most boring case
just became a page turner,

163
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,951
and you want to tear out
the last chapter?

164
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,453
You want to examine his character,
go to his soup kitchen.

165
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,331
We're done testing him
for things he doesn't have.

166
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,751
Bad news for Foreman
and Thirteen.

167
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,129
Case is over.

168
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,755
We're not splitting up.

169
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,966
So, which one of you
is taking a hike?

170
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,260
And neither of us is quitting.

171
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,137
Interesting.

172
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,055
You were fine with Chase
and Cameron dating.

173
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,765
You obviously don't
actually have an...

174
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,058
You're fired.

175
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,062
How long you
gonna keep this up?

176
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,857
- We know you're not...
- Wrong. Again.

177
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,889
In fact, in the last few weeks,

178
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,194
it's hard to remember
a correct call you made.

179
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,961
If Chase had compromised his
professional judgment to help Cameron,

180
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,741
I would have fired
his ass, too.

181
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,992
When my mistake blew up,

182
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,911
you did everything to keep me
from contacting the drug company.

183
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,372
To save your license,
not your job,

184
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,082
and definitely
not your relationship.

185
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,960
So, badge.

186
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,423
Fine.

187
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,106
Why don't you see if you can find us
a real case?

188
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,991
How can you discharge me when you have
no idea what's wrong?

189
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,453
We know what's wrong,
and now that you've slept it off...

190
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,288
It's not just
the hallucination.

191
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,917
I feel nauseous, my foot feels numb,
like it's fallen asleep.

192
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,377
You didn't mention that before.

193
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,920
I didn't notice it before.

194
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,296
Are you hiding from someone?

195
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,901
Why are you so intent
on staying here?

196
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,134
I don't feel well. I know there's
something wrong with me.

197
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,928
Which foot?

198
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,096
My um.

199
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:27,896
Oh, God.

200
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,527
What the hell is that?
What is that?

201
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,988
Your toe just fell off.

202
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,038
Must be my lucky day.

203
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,499
New symptom means the old symptom
was a real symptom,

204
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,585
and I get to keep our pederast priest
after all.

205
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,379
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?

206
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,422
They left.

207
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,924
Leprosy could cause necrosis
and hallucinations.

208
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,134
Why would they leave?

209
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,678
Because Foreman
doesn't work here anymore,

210
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,223
and Thirteen is mad
that I fired him.

211
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,226
Don't worry, she'll be back.

212
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,437
She'll be pissed off,
she'll want to take a stand,

213
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,230
and then Foreman
will convince her there's no reason

214
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,149
both of them
should be out of a job.

215
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,400
Leprosy's a bad fit.

216
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,568
Why'd you fire Foreman?

217
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,903
I gave him a choice,
split or quit.

218
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,740
He chose neither.
How about ergotism?

219
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,450
He's giving up
his career for her?

220
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,452
He's giving up
this career for her.

221
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,080
No, normal white blood count.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

222
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,045
They're good doctors.

223
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,041
Separately,
they're great doctors.

224
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,545
Better than you.
Together they're morons.

225
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,297
Go check out the house
that they would have checked

226
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,590
had this been a real case.

227
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,800
And page Thirteen, tell her to run
the blood for CO,

228
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,262
and get the priest in a hyperbaric
chamber before anything else falls off.

229
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,768
So, what are we gonna do now?

230
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:51,855
I get a letter of recommendation
from Cuddy and find a new job.

231
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,149
Oh, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

232
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,279
House was right. Our relationship
did affect my judgment.

233
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,117
Then I should quit. It'll be easier
for me to find another job.

234
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,244
Not like this one.

235
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,331
We should both quit.

236
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,916
What's that gonna accomplish?

237
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,337
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

238
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,257
We'll be fine.

239
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,437
Go ahead.

240
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,648
I'll see you tonight?

241
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,982
I'll be home early.

242
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,585
You really think
House is done with Foreman?

243
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,657
If you ask me,
Foreman should be done with Thirteen.

244
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,162
He's not gonna get
a better job,

245
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,082
which means he'll end up
resenting her for losing this one,

246
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,416
which she'll end up resenting.

247
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,460
Or the hardship
will bring them closer together,

248
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,505
she'll invite friends over
for Foreman to share.

249
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,841
No leaks from the heater.

250
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,218
She's not a nympho,
she's bisexual,

251
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,136
which, by the way,
means she's accustomed to partners

252
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,347
who don't need a map
to find the treasure.

253
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,308
CO poisoning might have come
from these cigarettes.

254
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,519
Not unless he was
smoking them in a bell jar.

255
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,062
And even if you know
where the treasure is,

256
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,468
it can still be pretty hard
to dig it up without a shovel.

257
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,316
You can buy a shovel.

258
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,121
Let's see, how do I keep House

259
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:35,000
from ruining my precious display
of religious hypocrisy?

260
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,335
I know,
I'll pressure him to attend,

261
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,181
knowing that he'll never agree to
anything I actually want him to do.

262
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,757
I didn't pressure you,
I invited you.

263
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,443
And there's nothing hypocritical
about recognizing your heritage.

264
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,262
So, you keeping kosher now?

265
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,972
Wearing four-cornered garments?

266
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,850
Slaughtering heifers
to the god Ra?

267
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,185
Wait, is that
one of your people?

268
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,396
Do it all, do nothing
or option C,

269
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,481
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

270
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,861
House, for better or for worse,
you are a part of my life.

271
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,364
It isn't a ploy,
it's a sincere invitation.

272
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,283
I honestly want you to come.

273
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,870
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

274
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,958
I'm glad.

275
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,007
You idiot.
I was free and clear.

276
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,384
Now he's coming,
and it's your fault.

277
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,136
Since when have
your failed attempts

278
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,764
at communication through lies
become my fault?

279
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,225
Since you forgot
how to keep your mouth shut.

280
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,978
You messed it up,
and now you're gonna fix it.

281
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,356
And you're gonna
keep my name out of it.

282
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,818
How is he?

283
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,237
Stable.
Necrosis doesn't look to be spreading.

284
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,740
I was talking about Foreman.
Is he really gonna leave?

285
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,951
That's usually what people do
when they get fired.

286
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,077
Why are you biting my head off?

287
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,662
I was just wondering
what he was gonna do.

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,580
You're right, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

289
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,998
It's not House's fault, either.

290
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,643
He gave
you guys a chance, you blew it.

291
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,707
He didn't give us a chance,
he gave us an ultimatum.

292
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,672
I would have thought five years here
would buy a mistake or two.

293
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,715
Help me!

294
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,387
Help me.

295
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,142
I can't breathe. Feels like someone's
sitting on my chest.

296
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,269
Looks like a heart attack.

297
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,530
I assume you've heard.

298
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,283
I can't override him.

299
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,285
I'm not asking you
to override him.

300
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,371
I'm asking for a letter
of recommendation.

301
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:42,335
Eric, the reality here is,
House should have fired you.

302
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,379
You falsified medical records,

303
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,673
put this hospital's
reputation in jeopardy.

304
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,800
You're lucky
you still have a license.

305
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,180
I can't get a decent position at another
hospital without a recommendation.

306
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,602
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,027
Chest pain wasn't angina.
EKG ruled out heart attack.

308
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,030
So, the good news is,
he didn't have a heart attack.

309
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,157
The bad news is,
I apparently fired the only guy

310
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,951
who actually knows
what a heart attack looks like.

311
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,836
So, the man of God
who doesn't believe in God

312
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,997
had a heart attack
that isn't a heart attack.

313
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,833
Do I know how to pick
awesome cases or what?

314
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,251
Could be a clotting disorder.

315
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,045
Three different symptoms,
three different clots?

316
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,424
I know. How cool is that?
You two do an angio.

317
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,472
You don't want to work, so why don't
you just go get me a lottery ticket?

318
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,515
The sicker he gets,
the luckier I feel.

319
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,100
Where are you going?

320
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,394
I've been wanting
to introduce myself.

321
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,862
You really a virgin?

322
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,115
You have to treat me,
you don't have to believe me.

323
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,951
And before we treat you,
we have to diagnose you.

324
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,287
Not knowing whether we can believe you
is making that difficult.

325
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,039
Everything I've
told you is true.

326
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:05,126
You lost your faith
because a teenager got confused.

327
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,629
And my church abandoned me,
and my God forsook me,

328
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,298
and I couldn't come up
with a reason why a god would do that.

329
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,425
God gave the church
and the kid free will.

330
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,844
Their exercise of that
free will hurt you.

331
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,098
Means you're just
a victim of God's gift to mankind.

332
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,100
Oh, yeah.
God wants life to have meaning.

333
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,018
Life's meaningless
without free will.

334
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,772
With free will, there's always
suffering. So God wants suffering.

335
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,567
I got tired of that argument
before I even finished saying it.

336
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,862
And even if I bought that,
what the hell is God doing?

337
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,489
Just the big stuff?

338
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,866
The acts of God, the hurricanes,
the earthquakes,

339
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,452
the random killings
of millions of innocent people?

340
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,995
Then we better damn pray.

341
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,125
God, I wish you
weren't a pedophile.

342
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,797
Lungs are clean. No embolism,
no pleurisy, no pneumonia.

343
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,549
I'm sorry,
this is going to hurt.

344
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,926
No, it's fine.

345
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,511
No pain at all?

346
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,515
- No, why?
- Because there should be.

347
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,810
You feel that?

348
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,978
No.

349
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,147
Regional anesthesia's
a new symptom.

350
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,399
Unless the chest pain
is related to the numbness.

351
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,359
It's not circulatory,
it's neurological.

352
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,194
Run a nerve conduction study.

353
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,029
And be careful.
If you kill him,

354
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,073
he'll be dancing
with the Dark One.

355
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,163
Why the hell are you going
to Cuddy's baby naming?

356
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,290
It's a religious ceremony,
it's boring.

357
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,125
Why waste a good evening
that could be much better spent

358
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,044
in a drunken stupor,
feeling sorry for yourself?

359
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,171
Okay-

360
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,089
Okay? Okay, you won't go?

361
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,049
Okay, your obligation
to Cuddy is fulfilled.

362
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,263
Why are you doing this?

363
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,761
Why did Hillary
conquer Everest?

364
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,721
You always have a reason.

365
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,306
It's usually a bad one,
but a reason.

366
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,557
She's being childish.

367
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,768
See, that's an example
from the bad category. Is it resentment?

368
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,062
The stork brought home a new baby
and you don't want to share Mommy,

369
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,899
or you just can't stand
to see others happy?

370
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,233
She's trying to play me.

371
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,069
If I let her succeed,
the terrorists win.

372
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,662
I heard there might be
an opening in the ER.

373
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,628
Foreman's a neurologist,
that's not where he...

374
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,750
I did an ER rotation in Miami.

375
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,378
If I can find another position, I figure
House will rehire Foreman.

376
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,755
Don't quit.

377
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,423
Cuddy wouldn't
give Foreman a recommendation.

378
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,268
He's not gonna be able
to find a decent job.

379
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,582
Foreman shouldn't
leave, either.

380
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,304
You think they should split up?

381
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,765
Office romances are a bad idea.

382
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,101
We beat some very long odds.

383
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,729
Wow, honey,
save the gushy stuff for the wedding.

384
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,894
House is playing with you.

385
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,857
If you let him get away with it,
he won't respect you anyway.

386
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,192
Or House is helping you.

387
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,902
He knows it probably
won't work out,

388
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,072
and he's actually
doing you a favor.

389
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,491
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more like House.

390
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,702
I know they're looking for someone
at Mercy. I'll make a call.

391
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,039
Is your boss always like that?

392
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,290
Usually worse.

393
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,460
Finding a fellow atheist
always makes his day.

394
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,129
You think it's possible
maybe God's testing your faith?

395
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,464
No, I already failed.

396
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,883
There'd be no point in
what he's doing to me now.

397
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,678
Got something. Looks like
intercostal neuralgia.

398
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,971
What's that?

399
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,140
Something's traumatizing one of the
nerves that runs along your ribs.

400
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,017
Explains the chest pain
and numbness.

401
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,811
Could also cause
muscle atrophy.

402
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,729
- Does it do anything to the eyes?
- Why? What's wrong?

403
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,523
You're seeing Jesus again?

404
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,942
I'm seeing nothing.
My right eye went blind.

405
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,367
Ophthalmological exam's normal.

406
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,827
Nothing structurally
wrong with the eye.

407
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,871
His heart rate's down,
sensory loss is becoming more diffuse,

408
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,748
progressive muscle weakness.
He's shutting down.

409
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,793
It's got to be something systemic,
like autoimmune.

410
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,384
- CSF was clear for Guillain-Barré.
- Cancer?

411
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,428
Imaging studies
have been clear for tumors.

412
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,846
Then that leaves infection.

413
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,681
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

414
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,852
Or we're at the backstage door
of a Duran Duran concert.

415
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,314
Hundreds of screaming girls
clustered around.

416
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,273
What does that mean?

417
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,479
That girls like rock bands.

418
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,736
The presence of the fans
indicates the presence of the band.

419
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,572
Different night.
Same band, same door.

420
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,574
Now there's not
a girl in sight.

421
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,533
What does that mean?

422
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,898
Sorry, I don't speak hair band.

423
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,911
They weren't a hair band,
they were new romantics.

424
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,079
The band already left?

425
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,041
Nope. Band's still there,
still rocking out.

426
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,462
When does the absence of the fans not
indicate the absence of the band?

427
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,759
When it's 2009. There aren't
any Duran Duran fans.

428
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,385
They don't make them anymore.

429
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,636
If there's no infection,

430
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,222
it's because there aren't
any fans, no white cells.

431
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,100
You think his spleen?

432
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,479
Why do I bother with these
great metaphors

433
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,646
if I still
have to spell it out?

434
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,982
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
Go get a biopsy.

435
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,818
I'll try to get
New Moon on Monday out of my head.

436
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,490
Why are you talking this time?

437
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,038
If I quit,
will you rehire Foreman?

438
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,498
Why?

439
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,958
He can't find
another job, I can.

440
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,461
And you're willing to make
that sacrifice for him?

441
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,587
Yes.

442
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,132
Does Foreman know
about this plan?

443
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,342
Yes.

444
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,683
Well, if he's okay with it,
who am I to say no?

445
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,689
Hold still.

446
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,113
You think it's my spleen?

447
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,824
That's what they're testing.

448
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,786
So, if I happen to cure you,
what happens then?

449
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,665
You start thinking that God was working
through me,

450
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,375
this is some sort of miracle?

451
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,419
Do you think I'm an idiot?

452
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,837
That's what I'm testing.

453
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,215
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

454
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,092
It happened,
it's gone, for good.

455
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,929
But if it can magically disappear,
it can magically reappear.

456
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,390
And that's what you're hoping.

457
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,809
- Your job...
- Sucks.

458
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,896
That's my point. You could make
more money frapping decafs,

459
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,774
and yet you're still
ministering to the meek.

460
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,485
Why do the Lord's work
if the Lord has left the building?

461
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,320
I've been with the church
my entire adult life.

462
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,573
It's my only marketable skill.

463
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,492
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

464
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,996
You want to
talk hypocrisy, what about you?

465
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,457
You act like
you don't care about anyone,

466
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,418
but here you are, saving lives.

467
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,297
Solving puzzles. Saving lives
is just collateral damage.

468
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,717
Nice try. I don't think you're looking
for somebody to prove you right,

469
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,596
I think you're looking for somebody
to prove you wrong, to give you hope.

470
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,100
You want to believe, don't you?

471
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,774
Yeah. I want to walk out and find myself
in a forest of whore trees.

472
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,859
But I don't think
it's a good idea

473
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,820
to tell people
to go fornicate with fruit.

474
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,787
Hey, I was just
talking about you.

475
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,082
Well, not you specifically,
whores and hypocrisy.

476
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,378
You were right.
I don't want you there.

477
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,424
It's a special occasion,
filled with love and acceptance,

478
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,717
and the last thing I need
is someone there

479
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,386
who's filled
with loathing and contempt.

480
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,473
Okay-

481
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,601
That's it?

482
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,063
You're really not coming?

483
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,523
I'm really not coming.

484
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,318
Thank you.

485
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,861
You're welcome.

486
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,697
Gosh, I feel so grown-up.

487
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,952
He's obviously just
jerking you around.

488
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,662
Wants to see if you're serious.

489
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,830
If you just stick it out,
I think he'll bring Foreman back.

490
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,666
I don't. And even if I'm wrong,

491
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,793
I think you should
still split up.

492
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,045
It's just a matter of time
before one of you finds

493
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,755
the other in bed
with another woman.

494
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,757
This coming from
the relationship expert.

495
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,008
12 years and counting.

496
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,511
Hey, if you can
make it that long, then anyone can.

497
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,221
Funny how
the two people in the room

498
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,973
who think
relationships are easy

499
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,224
are both single.

500
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,430
I don't think they're easy.

501
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,351
That's why I think

502
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,077
if you find something
that could be good,

503
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,103
you should hang on to it.

504
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,856
Everything could be good,
very little ever is.

505
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,818
His spleen is fine. Just some
insignificant traces of minor bugs.

506
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,570
Nothing that'd make him sick.

507
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,862
Which minor bugs?

508
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,119
Why do people suddenly find religion
when they have kids?

509
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,704
Fear of the unknown.

510
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,998
Cornerstone of faith.

511
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,750
I think it makes perfect sense.

512
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,254
So it makes sense
because it doesn't make sense?

513
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,549
The fact that you're railing about it
doesn't make a lot of sense.

514
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,802
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

515
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,097
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

516
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,393
She doesn't have a thing per so.
I'm big on metaphors.

517
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,857
What about you?
Twenty-nine years of celibacy.

518
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,150
What's holding you back now?

519
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,444
Who wants a relationship
with a priest?

520
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,903
Who wants a relationship?

521
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,868
House.

522
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,623
It's the holy water.

523
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,876
We assumed if it was an infection, it
had to be something big and nasty.

524
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,878
But he has pneumocystis,

525
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,797
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

526
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,091
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

527
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,812
So Father Nietzsche has AIDS.

528
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,234
Impossible.

529
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,986
I've never had
a blood transfusion,

530
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,572
I've never done IV drugs,
I've never had sex.

531
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,157
So prove it. Have an AIDS test.

532
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,951
No. I know I don't have AIDS.

533
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,162
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

534
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,622
A negative result
proves nothing.

535
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,666
On the off chance
it's a false positive,

536
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,001
I permanently lose any
credibility I have left.

537
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,294
I'd say you just lost that.

538
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,463
I'd say I lost that with you
a long time ago.

539
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,052
We should start
treatment for AIDS.

540
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,011
We need to be sure.

541
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,806
The antiretrovirals could fry his heart,
his liver, his kidneys...

542
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,557
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Big of you.

543
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,476
I'm more worried about
the kid he molested.

544
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,811
We should be finding him
and getting him tested.

545
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,020
You don't think
he already got tested?

546
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,772
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't,

547
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,617
but that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

548
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,193
Legally, we can't inform
sexual partners about STDs.

549
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,987
This isn't some middle-aged barfly
who likes it bareback,

550
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,714
this is an innocent kid
who was molested.

551
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,367
You just want to rub the priest's face
in it. Get him transferred again.

552
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,620
Yeah, heaven forbid
a diddler has job issues.

553
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,665
And you get brought up
on charges.

554
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,127
Lost enough doctors this week.
Treat him for AIDS.

555
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,214
Found a job.

556
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,175
I didn't know you were looking.

557
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,761
Eggers at Mercy says
I can start Monday.

558
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,723
- Why would you...
- House says if I go, you can come back.

559
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,474
It's been less than two days.

560
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,310
You give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

561
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,687
You're acting like
I'm cheating on you.

562
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,772
I said I would handle this.

563
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,025
House knew you'd be like this.

564
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,404
Wow.

565
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,032
Guess House knows me
better than you do.

566
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,909
Too bad I don't go both ways.

567
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,287
Good night.

568
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,712
Don't you hate when they put
the mushrooms underneath the cheese?

569
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:18,174
Your attendance
is validating her hypocrisy.

570
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,386
If she invited you to a ceremonial
lynching, would you go?

571
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,223
It would depend on what she was serving.
Everyone's a hypocrite.

572
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,769
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with
Cuddy's particular brand?

573
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,812
I'm just making conversation.

574
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,938
Would you rather we go back
to talking

575
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,774
about mushrooms and cheese?

576
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,526
You're the hypocrite.
You want to go.

577
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,780
You don't resent this baby,
you want to be a part of it.

578
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,033
Yes, but not until
her 16th birthday in some states.

579
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,701
This is ridiculous.
You two deserve each other.

580
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,455
If you want to go,
just go and act like a human being.

581
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,250
Wow. Solid advice.
Except for two things.

582
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,212
I'm acting like I don't want to go
because I don't want to go,

583
00:29:56,337 --> 00:30:01,884
and I am incapable
of acting like a human being.

584
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,524
Ryan?

585
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,570
- Yeah.
- I'm Dr. Chris Taub. Can we talk?

586
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,156
Yeah. What's wrong?

587
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,076
In private?

588
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,744
Nobody's listening to us here.

589
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,873
I work at
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

590
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,209
I have some news
about Father Daniel Bresson.

591
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,504
What about him?

592
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,800
We believe he has AIDS.

593
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,553
Okay, so?

594
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:50,474
Well, given the incident
four years ago,

595
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,602
I think you should be tested,
unless you've already done so.

596
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,317
How sick is he?

597
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,610
Very.

598
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,114
Okay. Well, thanks.

599
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,076
Have you been tested?

600
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,536
Yeah.

601
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,913
And?

602
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,500
And it really isn't
any of your business.

603
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,598
I want my job back.

604
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,396
Love, sacrifice,
deception and now betrayal.

605
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,732
This is better
than a telenovela.

606
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,275
What's going on?

607
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,653
Well, either Foreman is here
as the two of you discussed,

608
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,364
to beg for his job back in
exchange for me dumping you

609
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,658
or nothing.

610
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,696
You're trying to get me fired?

611
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,873
I'm suggesting you quit
and I stay,

612
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,083
which is exactly what
you suggested last night.

613
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,752
I told Eggers
I didn't want the job.

614
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:03,464
Find another one. It took you
eight hours to find that one.

615
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,383
The point is, why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

616
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,718
Why are you here without me?

617
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,763
You're overreacting.
We'll talk about this later.

618
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,764
That's what this is about.
It's about you taking control.

619
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,308
It's about you not being
able to handle me saving your ass.

620
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,185
And you're not being
controlling right now?

621
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,021
Yeah, who's the
controlling bitch now?

622
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,773
House, shut up.

623
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,817
You never wanted
to take that other job.

624
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,611
You never wanted to save me.

625
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,530
You wanted to offer to save me,
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

626
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,784
You knew I'd say no.
That's why you're so mad right now.

627
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,039
You're an idiot.

628
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,882
Well, either you can go after her
and try and patch things up,

629
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,011
or you blow her off
and take your old job back.

630
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,275
Welcome back.

631
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,824
The AIDS meds
aren't gonna work.

632
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,493
If you'd let us do a test,
we could stop treating you,

633
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,161
or you could stop lying.

634
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,748
I know the feeling.

635
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,835
BP's climbing.
You feeling okay?

636
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,795
No. I feel flushed.

637
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,049
I'm burning all over.
My chest...

638
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,806
It's not a new symptom,

639
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,433
it's just a reaction
to the AIDS meds.

640
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,852
Yeah, he reacted by getting worse.
Means it's not AIDS.

641
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,270
"So went Satan forth

642
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:45,315
from the presence of the Lord
and smote Job sore with boils."

643
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,693
You think
it's Hyper lgE Syndrome?

644
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,529
I prefer the colloquial term,
Job's Syndrome.

645
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,990
Explains the symptoms,
and my quote.

646
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,235
It's the first thing I checked.
LgE levels are normal.

647
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,660
It could be some
other genetic disorder.

648
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,788
Cerebral microtumors could explain
the blindness and the hallucinations.

649
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,790
We didn't find any tumors.

650
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,917
That's why I didn't say tumors,
I said microtumors.

651
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,921
So your explanation doesn't depend on us
being major morons, just morons?

652
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,175
- We should start genetic testing.
- Takes too long.

653
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,180
- So we start treatment.
- Treatment is surgery.

654
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,942
We can't open him up
without confirmation.

655
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,181
So your position is we can't test
and we can't treat?

656
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,266
My position is you're wrong.

657
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,934
This isn't going to work.

658
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,188
Are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.

659
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,107
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic test.

660
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,317
On it.

661
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,433
So, now you don't think
I have AIDS?

662
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,952
I still think it's AIDS.

663
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,539
On the off chance it isn't,
we're pursuing other avenues.

664
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,670
Ryan.

665
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,510
He's... He's dying?

666
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:56,386
We don't know
what's wrong with him.

667
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,264
- Can I speak to him?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

668
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,432
Ryan?

669
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,731
Why don't I get you a...
Come on, Ryan. Now's not a good time.

670
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,367
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,624
For everything.

672
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,050
I'm sorry.

673
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,360
I know.

674
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,780
I know.

675
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,052
Any second thoughts
about Cuddy?

676
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:23,265
No, but please feel
free to blather on.

677
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,392
Raising a child
on her own is scary.

678
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,562
She's just doing what
you do, what everyone does.

679
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,938
Trying to avoid pain.

680
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,899
Religion is not the opiate
of the masses,

681
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,651
religion is the placebo
of the masses.

682
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,236
If you're saying that
she's not a hypocrite...

683
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,907
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you a rational reason

684
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:44,494
to overlook her hypocrisy, so you don't
feel like a hypocrite for going.

685
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,705
Oh. Sorry, continue.

686
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,123
Okay-

687
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,502
Even if an absolute truth exists,
we can't know all of it.

688
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,714
And you can't condemn her
for recognizing that.

689
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,069
Are you eliminating symptoms?

690
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,904
We can know everything.

691
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,448
This is medicine,
not metaphysics.

692
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,158
Truth is truth.

693
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,456
It fits.

694
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,083
It doesn't fit.

695
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,210
You can't eliminate a symptom.

696
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,128
I can if it's not a symptom.

697
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,922
Well, what is it?

698
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,215
Not a symptom.

699
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,309
You're not going to die.

700
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,439
You have
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.

701
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,692
It impairs your immune system,

702
00:37:56,817 --> 00:38:00,654
makes you susceptible to all the AIDS
stuff without actually having AIDS.

703
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,532
And you didn't catch it,
you were born with it.

704
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,325
Another gift from God.

705
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,704
You sure?

706
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,455
Genetic tests
should confirm it,

707
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,334
but it explains all your symptoms.
Toe, chest, eyes, skin.

708
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,170
What about my hallucination?

709
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,172
Scotch explains that.

710
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,553
That was just a coincidence?

711
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,057
Coincidences do happen.

712
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,814
But that coincidence is what brought me
to you in the first place.

713
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,236
You promised
you wouldn't go there.

714
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:48,160
Einstein said, "Coincidences are God's
way of remaining anonymous."

715
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:54,082
A woman in Florida said, "Look, Jesus
is on my cheese sandwich."

716
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,669
You didn't even want to take my case.
You didn't even think I was sick.

717
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,299
The fact that I was wrong
is not a proof of God.

718
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,513
I'm just trying to understand

719
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,100
how my life can completely turn around
in a single day.

720
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,315
Don't worry, your life will go back
to sucking soon enough.

721
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,321
Everything that happened to you
can be rationally explained.

722
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,158
I know. It's just...

723
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,624
That's a lot of coincidences.

724
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,726
House was right
about the priest.

725
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,188
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

726
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,723
And I would've discharged him.

727
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,191
Everybody would've
discharged him.

728
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,320
House included.
He only took that case as a stall.

729
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,074
And yet it was a real case,
and he solved it.

730
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,701
By violating
his own principles,

731
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,287
and ignoring
the admitting symptoms.

732
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,206
Still, he somehow
got away with it.

733
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,835
Saved another life.

734
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,255
You want him there tonight.

735
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,262
You should tell him.

736
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,283
Cold out there.

737
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,785
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

738
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,331
So, it's tonight?

739
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,624
Yeah.

740
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,377
Bad weather for it, huh?

741
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,628
Maybe you'll get lucky.

742
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:07,382
Maybe your sister will decide the roads
are too dangerous to drive on.

743
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,051
Fingers crossed.

744
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,018
Have fun.
