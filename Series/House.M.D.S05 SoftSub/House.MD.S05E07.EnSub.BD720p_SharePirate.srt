1
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,700
He's got a good pulse.

2
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,660
Maintain head stabilization
and flip him over.

3
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,204
On my count, guys. Ready? Go.

4
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,255
Sir, we're paramedics.

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,923
The mailman saw you
having a seizure.

6
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,288
<i>We had to break down your door.</i>

7
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,554
You know what your name is?

8
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:58,143
On my count,
one, two, three, up.

9
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,439
We're taking you
to the hospital.

10
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:10,822
I can't. No, I can't.
No, I can't...

11
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,291
Hey, buddy, buddy,
we're trying to help.

12
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:26,212
Sir.

13
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,380
Stay out of my house.

14
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:31,843
You just had a seizure, you could have
a stroke, a bleed in your brain.

15
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,219
Leave me alone.

16
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,088
35-year-old male, crushing headache,
and three seizures in the last two days.

17
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:13,384
So it's a bleed, a clot,
a tumor, metabolic or infection.

18
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,136
- Stick him in the CT and...
- Can't.

19
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,431
I'm assuming he has
a giant head.

20
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,351
Severe agoraphobe.
The world scares the hell out of him.

21
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,717
So we can only test him
with whatever we can take to him.

22
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,272
- Fun.
- The agoraphobia a symptom?

23
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,899
Only of being shot.

24
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,276
He and his girlfriend were mugged
seven years ago. It's when it started.

25
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,071
Anybody can hate humanity
after getting shot.

26
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,823
It takes a big man
to hate it beforehand.

27
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:37,116
How did you get this case,
if he didn't come to the ER?

28
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:39,661
I talked to him through his door
when he had flu last year.

29
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,579
I run the Community
Outreach Program now.

30
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,915
See?
Perfectly reasonable explanation.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,793
She's definitely not here
trying to work her way back on the team

32
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,118
and steal your job or anything.

33
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,630
- It's a legitimate question.
- He agreed to meet with us.

34
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,507
But even if I can get
inside his house,

35
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,676
his brain is a black box.

36
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:58,179
We can pick this up
in a minute.

37
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,684
- What's this?
- Takeout menus.

38
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,102
But I'm hoping
you'll come up with a better answer

39
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,563
when everyone asks
what we're talking about.

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,440
- Last night...
- Forget it.

41
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,776
I know this is awkward,
but we need to talk.

42
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,280
There's a reason that we've evolved
the feeling of awkwardness.

43
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,157
It tells us
not to talk about things.

44
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,743
I was emotional
because of the adoption falling through,

45
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,163
and you actually
let your human side show for a moment.

46
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,874
That is why we kissed.

47
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,961
I just want to say thank you
for not taking advantage.

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,550
You're welcome. Any time you
want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.

49
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,681
Portable equipment can't distinguish a
bleed or a tumor, can't see vasculitis.

50
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,391
What did Cuddy want?

51
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,812
I kind of hit that last night,
so now she's all on my jock.

52
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,523
Wow. She looks pretty good
for someone on roofies.

53
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,192
The only equipment we have
is a sonogram and a portable x-ray.

54
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,614
What part of "olivine, pyroxene
and amphibole" don't you understand?

55
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,325
Pyroxene? "Pyro" means "fire."

56
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,201
They're indicator minerals.

57
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,807
You can't see diamonds,
so you look for the indicator minerals.

58
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,042
I assume the diamond
is the tumor or bleed or whatever it is.

59
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,543
Provoke a seizure.

60
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,712
The indicator
is the increased electrical activity

61
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:16,090
focused around the abnormality.
We do an EEG, see the focus,

62
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,385
see where the problem is,
which tells us what the problem is.

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,056
The Formster and the Camster,
kicking it old school.

64
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,309
Thank God she's not
trying to steal your job.

65
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,270
Go do it,
and search the home for toxins.

66
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,565
I agreed to talk,
not to let you in.

67
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,942
You could be very sick.

68
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,861
- We need access.
- I'm just not ready.

69
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,404
Why does he have
two locked doors?

70
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,281
He must use this room
as an airlock.

71
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,992
Deliveries in, garbage out,
he never has to go outside.

72
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,037
Just tell us when you are.
We're not going away.

73
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:46,996
Seriously?

74
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:47,961
You want her to admit

75
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,667
that all he has to do is ignore us
for a few minutes and we'll take off?

76
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,835
He was shot, girlfriend killed.

77
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,802
He probably has
post-traumatic stress disorder.

78
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,632
He doesn't believe in a just universe,
he doesn't trust anyone.

79
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:59,050
Give him some honesty.

80
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,775
I shouldn't have implied
we'd wait forever.

81
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,558
We've got a whole hospital full of
patients. We can give you a few minutes,

82
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:11,229
but eventually, if you don't let us in
we're going to have to leave.

83
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,483
Just one person comes in.

84
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,528
No, we've got to search
the whole house for toxins.

85
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,992
How about I examine you in one room,
and my colleagues will do the search?

86
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,625
I'm going to try
to provoke a seizure.

87
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,919
I need you to look
straight ahead, okay?

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,754
Yeah.

89
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,674
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just...

90
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:44,262
I haven't been in a room
with anyone for a while.

91
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,889
- Okay, can you just give me a second?
- Sure.

92
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,141
Okay-

93
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,395
You're the person I talked to
through the door last year, right?

94
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,856
- Yeah.
- You were nice.

95
00:05:56,065 --> 00:06:00,528
And smart. Kind of made me
expect someone older.

96
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,113
I'm not that young.

97
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:09,829
- Must have been scary being shot.
- Don't do that. Okay.

98
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,914
You don't know me.

99
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,044
I've got everything
I want here.

100
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,880
I make a lot of money
writing tech manuals.

101
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,965
I get stuff delivered.
I work out.

102
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,220
I see anything I want over the Web.
I'm happy here.

103
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,892
- You don't seem very happy.
- Right now I'm not.

104
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,399
Go away.

105
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:44,155
- Did you speak to Cuddy last night?
- She's fine.

106
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,784
Why would it take anyone more than a
few hours to get over misplacing a baby?

107
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,368
You spoke to her?

108
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,623
Kind of hit that,
so she's all on my jock.

109
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,003
What?

110
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,380
Huh!

111
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,216
Everyone else thought
I was kidding.

112
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:08,679
You "hit"?
Like making out or full-on sex or...

113
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:11,682
I've got a chart laid out with all
the bases, I'll take you through it.

114
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:14,310
- What are you going to do?
- What can I do?

115
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm gonna ignore her
for the rest of my life.

116
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,689
This mosquito bite
kept me awake...

117
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,066
Don't care about the bug bite.

118
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,443
She's your boss.

119
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,779
So now I have two reasons
to ignore her.

120
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,741
It was just a kiss.

121
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,161
- There's a reason...
- Yes, those large things in her bra.

122
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,540
You were hiding it from me.
Means it meant something to you.

123
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:39,293
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it
within the phrase "I hit that."

124
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,837
Stop scratching,
you'll draw blood.

125
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,964
Finally,
you said something useful.

126
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,050
I'm just gonna break the skin
and let the poison out.

127
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:51,931
If you dated Cuddy,
there would...

128
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,892
Sorry, I get better reception
when you're not here.

129
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,019
What do you got?

130
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:58,226
<i>His place is totally clean.</i>

131
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,649
No animals. No hidden drugs or alcohol.
No lead in the paint.

132
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,317
And since
you're not breathing hard,

133
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,945
I assume you're not holding
Cameron aloft in triumph,

134
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,530
which means no seizures.

135
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:13,661
Hey, speaking of breathing hard...
Cameron, you engaged to Chase yet?

136
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:14,829
Sorry, we should have clarified.

137
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,165
We're calling about the patient,
not Dr. Cameron's love life.

138
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,332
We aren't engaged.

139
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,710
Moves things along much faster
if you just give him the answers.

140
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,355
Seizures can also
be induced through...

141
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,547
- After six years?
- A year-and-a-half.

142
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,215
Through sleep deprivation or...

143
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,509
Sleep deprivation
would take too long.

144
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,795
- You living together?
- We spend most nights together.

145
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:34,056
There's a bunch of drugs
that can lower a seizure threshold.

146
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,642
And cloud the diagnosis
with side effects.

147
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,728
- His place or yours?
- His, usually.

148
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,313
- Interesting.
- You would have said "interesting"

149
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,689
no matter what the answer.

150
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,608
And no matter what the answer,
it would have been interesting.

151
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,860
<i>No engagement,
commitment issues.</i>

152
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:50,781
His place, control issues.
Not sure whose, but, interesting.

153
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,575
Yeah, moves
much faster this way.

154
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,412
Where was the patient
when he had his first seizure?

155
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,831
In his entry hallway,
getting his mail.

156
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,459
And getting close
to the outdoors.

157
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,670
It spooked him, raised his BP.
Now use that fear.

158
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,838
Bring him outside.

159
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,298
He punched out a fireman.

160
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,758
<i>We're doctors, not bouncers.</i>

161
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:13,262
Okay.
So bring the outside to him.

162
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,141
Floor's genuine wood.

163
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,394
Why are they here?

164
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,689
They overheard me announce
the half-price bank foreclosure

165
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,442
in the ER waiting room.
Where is everybody?

166
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,655
Cameron's with the patient,
everybody else went home.

167
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,076
Because they don't need to be here.
Neither do you, and yet you are.

168
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,994
This way.

169
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,622
Moldings original?

170
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,333
Original?
They were here before the house.

171
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,046
The shut-in is also original.

172
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,509
- Come on, don't be shy.
- House, get them out of here.

173
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:55,680
Easy for you to say, you're not going
to be making some serious capital gains.

174
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,139
This is cruel.

175
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,767
And leaving him undiagnosed
is what, altruistic?

176
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,274
Procedure worked. He's seizing.
What do you see?

177
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,985
Normal theta, normal delta.

178
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,486
This isn't a seizure.

179
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,946
It's something.

180
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,698
Mr. Nozick, are you okay?

181
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,574
My stomach. It's killing me.

182
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,868
See? It's something.

183
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,215
Partial small bowel obstruction.

184
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,927
Blockage explains the pain. What
explains the blockage plus seizures?

185
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,762
Atrial fibrillation
throwing emboli.

186
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,306
Crohn's causing an abscess.

187
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,932
It could be a million things.

188
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,698
There's no way to know unless we get him
in for an MRI on his head,

189
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,604
or exploratory surgery
so we can biopsy his bowels,

190
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,481
- which he won't let us do.
- Wouldn't.

191
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,568
Pain changes things.

192
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,987
House.

193
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,034
He told you
to stay out of here.

194
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,037
He can chase me out
once he's done doubling up in agony.

195
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:06,500
Whatever your big problem is has caused
a complication we call "colon FOS."

196
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,671
"F-0", "full of," since we're
in mixed company, "S" is "stool."

197
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,966
Nothing is coming out,
so the pain's gonna get worse and worse.

198
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,344
So we need to stick
a pooper scooper in you.

199
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,262
We also need to take
a look at your bowel.

200
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,597
I made my wishes clear.

201
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,350
Uh-huh. And, see,
if the Crazy Fairy were here,

202
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,559
she could grant them.

203
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:28,064
I'm not insane.
I feel pain when I go outside,

204
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,733
so it's rational
to avoid that pain.

205
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,777
Except now you're
feeling pain inside.

206
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,570
Well, not as bad. Nowhere near.

207
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,946
We can give him drugs
for the blockage.

208
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,531
If it doesn't work

209
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,950
that blockage
will rupture your intestines

210
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,036
and spew sewage
throughout your body.

211
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,873
Whatever you're scared of out there,
aren't you more scared of death?

212
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,877
You, obviously,
can't stand people.

213
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,505
But for me, it's worse.
All right?

214
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,800
I'd rather die in here
than live out there.

215
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:06,268
If you don't mind floppy hair
and an annoying accent,

216
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,021
I know a surgeon who will
operate in your home.

217
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,233
Thank you.

218
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,906
With the risk of infection,
Chase won't actually...

219
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,868
He's not gonna do surgery
in some crazy dude's house.

220
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,787
- You just said...
- What I said was

221
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,831
that Chase would put him under
at the house.

222
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,791
We take him to the hospital,
open him up, do our thing,

223
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,836
then slip him back into his room
for the post-op,

224
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,462
without him ever finding out
that we tricked him.

225
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,423
So, that was implied.

226
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:36,799
- It's unethical.
- He'll be asleep.

227
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,924
He gets to make his own calls,
even if he's asleep.

228
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,428
Why are you siding with him?

229
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,016
Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes
broken people because her husband died,

230
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,268
and since Chase
isn't all that broken...

231
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,353
Hey, why don't we operate
on his infarcted leg while we're at it?

232
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,147
Who cares if he said no?

233
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,065
I was risking my life
to avoid becoming a cripple,

234
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,943
he's doing it to avoid
sunlight and fresh air.

235
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,614
We've got to make it look good.

236
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,587
I know I'm a pain in the ass.

237
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,257
I know it would have been easy
just to walk away,

238
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,927
but you're a good person.

239
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,895
Count down from 10.

240
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,566
Ten, nine,

241
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,735
eight...

242
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,738
Let's go.

243
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,924
- How you doing?
- Better.

244
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,258
Great.

245
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,886
Everything else good?

246
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,597
Everything involving me
kissing House is good.

247
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,391
Oh, God, you dragged it out of me,
you're a genius.

248
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,977
It's no big deal.

249
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,440
I was feeling vulnerable,
he's a friend, and I leaned on him.

250
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,818
It's funny.
I've leaned on friends in the past.

251
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:23,364
Never leaned so far
my tongue fell into their mouths.

252
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,702
I don't think of House that way.
I never have.

253
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,581
Why not?

254
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,709
You know exactly
how it would go.

255
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,211
It would start off exciting,

256
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,631
we'd get caught up in the novelty
and the hostility and the forbiddenness,

257
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:44,927
and then we'd realize that
the flirty hostility is just hostility,

258
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,222
his inability to open up
is no longer exciting,

259
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,184
it's just frustrating,
and then it's the inevitable blow up

260
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,272
and the recriminations,
and we don't talk for two months.

261
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:04,113
Yeah. Well, it certainly proves you've
never thought about House that way.

262
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:07,741
I get your point.

263
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,952
I will be more careful with my tongue
in the future.

264
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,245
That's not my point.

265
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,585
Maybe novelty and hostility and
forbiddenness doesn't have to end bad.

266
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,342
Got to go.

267
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,137
What time you done?

268
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,582
Thought we could try
that new sushi place next to my house.

269
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,474
Why don't we stay
at my house tonight?

270
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,681
But we always stay at mine.

271
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:37,062
That's what I mean.
We used to split, what happened?

272
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,607
- I don't know, I'm closer to work.
- By five minutes.

273
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:43,319
And my house doesn't look like it
was decorated by a drunk rugby player.

274
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,529
Well, we can discuss it.
I hadn't really...

275
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,907
Why does it have to be a discussion?
Can't you just stay over?

276
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,912
You do know they page me when that much
surgical equipment is signed out.

277
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,415
He didn't consent.

278
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,661
He consented to the surgery.

279
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,251
You think he's going
to sue over where?

280
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,086
He won't even know where.
He'll wake up in his house,

281
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,254
he won't know a thing
about what happened.

282
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,215
Until he catches a post surgical
infection in his dirty apartment

283
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:08,594
and finds out we tricked him
and winds up owning the hospital.

284
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,513
Why aren't you
arguing with her?

285
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,890
Because she's right.

286
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,518
I don't care where he gets the post-op,
just that he gets it.

287
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,770
Keep him here.

288
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,986
House?

289
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,863
You Okay?

290
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,115
Yes, we don't need to talk.

291
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,909
Your hand.

292
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,624
That's weird. I usually
don't get the stigmata until Easter.

293
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,589
Please tell Dr. Chase
the patient's ready for him now.

294
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,604
Stewart, wake up.
It's Dr. Cameron.

295
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,358
If you can hear me, blink.

296
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,697
We were concerned for your safety,
so we brought you to the hospital.

297
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,743
No, it's okay.

298
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,080
- No, it's okay.
- Why'd you...

299
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,373
I just wanted
to keep you informed.

300
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,917
I didn't want you to have a bad shock
while you're recovering from surgery.

301
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,502
- I got to get out of here.
- It's okay, Stewart.

302
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,547
Calm down. Calm down. Stewart.

303
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,549
- Stewart, I'm going to sedate you.
- I got to get out of here.

304
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,384
I'm gonna sedate you.

305
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,885
No!

306
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,182
Calm down. I need some help in here.
Damn it, somebody get in here.

307
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,484
What did you do?

308
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,993
Well done. Your patient
called his lawyer, threatened to sue us,

309
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,079
is now heading home
completely undiagnosed.

310
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,956
He'll soon be on his way back.

311
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,126
He's sick. He'll crash,
he'll lose consciousness,

312
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,253
and I'll declare an emergency,
bring him back in.

313
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,215
Not any more you won't. His lawyer
now holds his health care proxy.

314
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,701
The next time
we have an emergency,

315
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,219
Larry Ruseckas, Esquire,
will be calling the shots.

316
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,181
I made the right call. If he
had flipped out after major surgery,

317
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,306
it would have been worse.

318
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,769
The benefit of being boss
is that I don't have to argue.

319
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,395
You're all off the case.

320
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,574
What's going on
between you and Cuddy?

321
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,909
Bad loving gone bad.

322
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,119
Seriously, why didn't you argue with
her? She just threw us off the case.

323
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,079
Because ignoring her
is a lot easier.

324
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,965
Convince the patient
to let us back in again.

325
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,459
See if you can clear
his blockage with lactulose.

326
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:49,546
If this thing kills him before we
can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.

327
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,382
Okay-

328
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,510
You're going to
keep working on this?

329
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,303
Yeah. I brought in the case.

330
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,473
There is no case. He's gone, you've been
tossed. This is totally nuts.

331
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,078
He's incredibly sick.
We don't know...

332
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,142
Fine, forget about the patient.

333
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,727
What is going on with you?

334
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,187
This is why we left
House's team.

335
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,272
To avoid this constant flood
of pure craziness.

336
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,025
That's why I left House.
You got fired.

337
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,406
I'm sorry.
I know I let you down.

338
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,854
But you know
who else I let down?

339
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,204
Pretty much everyone
who's important to me.

340
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,541
My boss, my old boss,

341
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,460
my boyfriend.

342
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,048
I did that for you.

343
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,303
I'm not gonna
let you down again.

344
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,944
It's like
the red badge of idiocy.

345
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,197
If the Confederacy
had mosquitoes,

346
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,409
we'd all have Southern accents,
and I'd be paying Foreman less.

347
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,328
She kicked you off the case.

348
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,290
This is what happens
when you don't address it.

349
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,251
She acts weird,
things get different.

350
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,338
You understand that
different implies difference?

351
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,424
She's tossed me
a million times before.

352
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,843
No, she always chastises you,

353
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,970
and you'd always
come running to me to complain,

354
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,847
so you're acting different, too.

355
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,601
You're scared.
You are scared to get involved.

356
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,396
How is that scared?
It's rational.

357
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:33,901
Emotionally mature people
who work together should not date.

358
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,361
Guaranteed break-up,
guaranteed ugliness.

359
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,489
Any relationship that doesn't end
in a break-up, ends in death.

360
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,033
Everything falls
apart in the end.

361
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,451
That's your worldview.

362
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,453
The corollary,
which you keep forgetting,

363
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,915
is that you have to grab
any chance for happiness.

364
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,417
Why does this matter
so much to you?

365
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,752
Cuddy and I are fine.

366
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,421
The only person getting
worked up here is you.

367
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,299
I don't want you to be fine,
I want you to be happy.

368
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,134
I think if you dated her...

369
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,679
Are you familiar
with the adverb "vicariously"?

370
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,098
- If I wanted to ask her out...
- You did ask her out.

371
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,559
Last year.
Whatever happened there?

372
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,395
I don't know,
I wasn't interested.

373
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,396
Wrong.

374
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:15,067
You were interested,
but Amber grabbed your genitals first.

375
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,152
And now you're single,
and it makes you miserable,

376
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,274
but you think it's too soon
for another relationship,

377
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,323
so you're gonna
make me miserable.

378
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:24,409
Please.
Get a girlfriend or a life or something.

379
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,452
For me.

380
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,290
Better or worse?

381
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,501
<i>Worse. Drugs aren't working.</i>

382
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,128
<i>I think we should do the surgery
in his house, like we planned.</i>

383
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,713
Well, then one of us
wasn't paying attention

384
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,049
because I thought that surgery thing
was just a trick.

385
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,884
We prepared the room.
We hung the drapes.

386
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,010
It's probably 10 times as sterile

387
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,346
as any mobile operating theater
you'd find in a battlefield.

388
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,014
We still need Trapper John.

389
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,475
Chase doesn't want
anywhere near this surgery.

390
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,060
<i>Maybe you could talk to him.</i>

391
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,895
I can't understand
a word he says.

392
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,982
Taub, you doing anything later?

393
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,735
Blood in the field.

394
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,530
Not where I'm looking.

395
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,156
How am I supposed to know
where you're looking?

396
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,242
Here's a hint.
It's the bloody part.

397
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,327
The whole thing's bloody.
It's a guy with a hole in his body.

398
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,121
It's like you've never done this before.
Use the suction.

399
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,166
I will. And, in fact,
I've never done this before

400
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,834
because I went to med school,
not nurse school.

401
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,712
Hey, wanna see
if your client's actually made of money?

402
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,381
Cutting out
the last piece of bowel.

403
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,970
Suture.

404
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:32,019
Mucosa's pink. Flattened villi.

405
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,896
Intestinal atrophy.
It's Whipple's Disease.

406
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,274
Explains the seizure
and the stomach pain.

407
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,277
Little bleeder here. Cautery.

408
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,656
Hey, wait, the gas...

409
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,292
That always happens
during surgery.

410
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,378
It's the gas build-up in the blockage,
nothing to sue about.

411
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,173
Treat him for the burns, put him
on antibiotics for the Whipple's.

412
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,674
He'll be fine.

413
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,312
Hey. That's nice of you.

414
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,439
- Hi.
- Hi.

415
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,193
He doing good?

416
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,905
Burns are healing fine.
He's stable otherwise.

417
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,909
Good. So, I could stay
at your place tonight, if you like.

418
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,410
I can't.

419
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,498
Well, you're not gonna
sleep here again?

420
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,583
You might have noticed
the lack of nurses.

421
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,044
Because you're not on the case.

422
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,712
You can't really use that
as an excuse for...

423
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,464
Dr. Cameron.

424
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,673
Wait here.

425
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,014
- Your stomach?
- My legs are numb.

426
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,058
I can't feel them at all.

427
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,481
New symptom, peripheral neuropathy.
Got worse on antibiotics.

428
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,440
<i>It's not Whipple's.</i>

429
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,399
<i>Porphyria.</i>

430
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,400
<i>Liver's fine.</i>

431
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,360
Amyloidosis.

432
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,028
We'd have seen it
on the intestines.

433
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,447
What did we see
on the intestines?

434
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:11,576
<i>Pink mucosa, flattened villi. If it's
not Whipple's, it's gotta be celiac.</i>

435
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,662
Wheat allergy
means he's not absorbing nutrients.

436
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,907
Explains the seizures,
the stomach and now the nerves.

437
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,457
<i>We should run
a blood test for celiac.</i>

438
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:22,129
Not fast enough, not accurate enough.
Force feed him wheat.

439
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,297
<i>Then do an endoscopy
as it hits his duodenum.</i>

440
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,924
See if there's
an allergic reaction.

441
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,845
His guts just exploded. It might be
a tad painful to make him eat.

442
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,889
That's House's point.
There's nothing diagnostic about it.

443
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,225
He's trying to put the patient in pain,
force him to come in.

444
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,393
It is a valid test.

445
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,979
So is the blood test,
which is painless.

446
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,566
<i>Foreman, listen to
that little voice in your head</i>

447
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,444
that's coming from the telephone.
Force feed him.

448
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,948
Don't. You know House.
You know I'm right.

449
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,908
We'll do both tests.

450
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,835
I'm not here to
play matchmaker.

451
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,796
Okay-

452
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,506
House basically...

453
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:11,887
Well, he accused me
of being interested in you.

454
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,557
He's just trying
to change the subject.

455
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,768
I know. But I do have...

456
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,608
I've always had

457
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,735
some feelings for you.

458
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,364
Are you saying
you want to date me?

459
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,699
No, I...

460
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,786
It wouldn't be fair to House,
and it's too soon after Amber.

461
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,333
But you thought
you should just say it?

462
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,293
Yeah, I thought
you should know.

463
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,507
Let's have dinner
tomorrow night.

464
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,553
Okay-

465
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,391
Or maybe it'd be better
if we just had sex.

466
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,144
Pardon me?

467
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,938
In front of House's office.

468
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,440
I mean, I don't want to
take any chances.

469
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,276
I assume the point of this
is to make him jealous,

470
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,446
to make him realize that
he does want a relationship with me.

471
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,407
Yes.

472
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,244
You think it'll work?

473
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,995
You're an idiot.

474
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,208
Trust me, everybody will be happier
if House and I aren't dating.

475
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,344
You sure this is the best test?

476
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,097
No. But you've kind of
tied our hands.

477
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,183
As soon as this hits your intestines,
I'll look at it through an endoscope.

478
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,313
Stewart, I know you don't want
to talk about this,

479
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,151
but people who get shot
often get PTSD.

480
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,861
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

481
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,991
It's very treatable
with drugs and therapy.

482
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:57,617
It's not PTSD.

483
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:03,623
My girlfriend was with me
when I got shot, and she died.

484
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,214
But that's what I mean.
I lost someone myself.

486
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,175
I know it's traumatic.

487
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,596
No. What I'm trying
to say is that

488
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:25,061
I was like this before the shooting,
since I was a kid.

489
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,274
Everything was hard for me.

490
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,322
I didn't go out that much,
and when I did,

491
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:42,746
I had panic attacks,
like, physical pain.

492
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,583
You know, it was, like, worse,
it was like I was dying.

493
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,336
When I met Angela,

494
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,089
she was the only reason

495
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,301
that I ever wanted to go out.

496
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:01,097
But then she died, and...

497
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,613
Blood test will be done soon.

498
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,830
I'm guessing
that's a new technique.

499
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,957
Hey, do you remember
that idea that Cameron had

500
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,627
about trying to torture the patient
into admitting himself?

501
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,545
Pretty sure it was your idea.

502
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,172
You want me
to slow down the test?

503
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,592
Wow, everyone's got
all these great ideas today.

504
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:40,804
So you're thinking, "Patient won't leave
because leaving causes pain",

505
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,347
"so we gotta make
staying more painful."

506
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,598
That actually makes sense.

507
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,163
You'll increase his pain,
but not enough to make a difference.

508
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,185
He's on morphine.

509
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,561
He's on morphine now,

510
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,897
pretty soon,
he'll be on lessphine.

511
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:55,485
'Cause when you restock, you'll actually
be giving Cameron IV bags of saline.

512
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,237
And why do you think
I'll be doing this?

513
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,446
Same reason
you did the surgery.

514
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,490
That was because
it was an emergency.

515
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:04,369
No, it was because
your marriage is falling apart.

516
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:09,499
When you confess adultery,
things tend to go bad.

517
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:13,086
When one part of your life
does a Titanic,

518
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,422
you make a life raft
out of whatever's left,

519
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,966
which makes your job more significant,
which is why you did the surgery,

520
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,803
why you pulled an all-nighter,
and why you'll do this.

521
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,807
She's having me
sleep on the couch,

522
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,475
just for a few nights.

523
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,229
I'm not doing this to save my job.
I'm doing this to save his life.

524
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,315
Right.
That's what we'll tell everyone.

525
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:32,916
Oh...

526
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,152
Have you considered
that it's not my place

527
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,238
you really wanna be walking into
right now?

528
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:07,033
Ric Ocasek will kill me if I...
Oh, you mean Cuddy.

529
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:10,828
Yeah, she's a little nuts,
but she's beautiful, smart, funny.

530
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,830
And most important,
she can stand you.

531
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:16,125
Yeah. I came here
to have you lecture me on Cuddy,

532
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:19,128
not because there's a killer mosquito
chasing me around my apartment.

533
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,422
House, there is no mosquito.

534
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,800
This is all about Cuddy.

535
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,719
She's "bugging" me. Poetic.

536
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,555
Have you seen this bug?

537
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,764
Have you seen this bite?

538
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,933
No, what I've seen
is a suppurating wound

539
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,103
that you've scratched and mutilated
into a gangrenous state.

540
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,063
Delusional parasitosis.

541
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,523
I am not imagining things.

542
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:42,610
House, you're a drug addict,
you're always imagining things.

543
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,113
You got bitten
the night you kissed her.

544
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:48,283
Your itching always gets worse
when you think about her.

545
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,118
You need to address this.

546
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,202
She's my boss.

547
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,121
No, you're not afraid of authority,

548
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,999
you're afraid
she actually is right for you.

549
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,125
You're afraid to take a chance

550
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,835
because ifs too big a chance.

551
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:02,088
If it doesn't work with her,
then maybe there's no one out there.

552
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:07,218
I am not rationalizing.
I'm better off alone.

553
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,929
Also, have you seen
her ass recently?

554
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,055
You're not staying here.

555
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,056
Oh, come on.

556
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:16,561
No. You can go home, or...

557
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,648
You're going to Cuddy's,
you're gonna ring her doorbell,

558
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:24,611
and you're gonna ask her out on a date,
like regular people do.

559
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,321
At 3:00 in the morning?

560
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,323
When do regular people sleep?

561
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,866
Bye-bye.

562
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,081
Is he in enough pain
to come in yet?

563
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,249
No.

564
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,501
Antibody tests back?

565
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:41,669
Inconclusive.

566
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,172
- Then why are you here?
- I missed you.

567
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,633
- Endoscopy?
- Inconclusive.

568
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,301
Well, then do it again.

569
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:54,432
I know it sucks,
but I need to test your stomach again.

570
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,017
It's really hurting.

571
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,477
I know, I'm sorry.

572
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,730
I'm gonna try to get you on your back
and have you open your mouth.

573
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,109
He's out.

574
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,237
- Anything?
- No pulse.

575
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,572
Start CPR.

576
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,241
Get the paddles.
Get the paddles.

577
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,660
Who are you calling?

578
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,995
Pizza. You like anchovies?

579
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,540
I'm calling the lawyer.
Genuine emergency, he'll okay admission.

580
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,792
He's dying-

581
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,460
Exactly.

582
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,505
Hi, sorry to wake you.
Your introvert is having a heart attack.

583
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,006
House, if we don't restart his heart...

584
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,466
He can survive 15 minutes

585
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,844
on oxygen and CPR.
We can get him to the hospital in five.

586
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,889
Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.

587
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,392
2123, Holden Green,
patient with PEA.

588
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,518
- Clear.
- Wait.

589
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,648
I got a pulse.

590
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:47,026
Cancel the ambulance.
He's stable enough to stay here.

591
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,076
His heart's back
to sinus rhythm, but it's bradycardic.

592
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,120
Taub's putting in
a temporary pacemaker.

593
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,788
It'll keep
his heart beating for now.

594
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:02,458
Hey, Cameron, how would you like
your old job back?

595
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,711
I'm asking 'cause it's the only way
I can fire you.

596
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,422
Sorry, in ER we like
to actually resuscitate dying people,

597
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,799
- not just let them flop around.
- Could be lymphoma.

598
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:13,678
No, we'd have seen it on the abdomen.
It has to be a poison.

599
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,179
Organophosphates.

600
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,099
We checked the place over and over.
It's completely clean.

601
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,517
There were rose petals
in the front entry.

602
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,144
Unless he's eating
a bouquet a day,

603
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,186
- he couldn't...
- How clean?

604
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,605
Very, he probably
has a little OCD.

605
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,197
How often do you wash your tub?

606
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,907
Every couple of days.

607
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,493
- Bleach and ammonia?
- Yeah.

608
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:49,464
You know how kids
play toy soldiers in the bath?

609
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:54,051
He likes to re-enact the Battle of Ypres
three times a week with real gas.

610
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,095
Ammonia and bleach
makes chlorine gas.

611
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,307
Highly fat soluble.
He lost weight after the stomach pain,

612
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,309
explains why his symptoms
kept getting worse.

613
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,479
Put him on parenteral steroids
and sodium bicarbonate.

614
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,365
Even if you're right, that external
pacemaker's gonna fail eventually,

615
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,942
and I don't have the skills
to put in a permanent one.

616
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,905
Well, maybe the poison
hasn't completely shot his heart,

617
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,616
and you won't have to feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

618
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,621
How am I going to place the leads
in the exact spot on the right ventricle

619
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,457
without fluoroscopy? The Force?

620
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,501
Taub put in a temporary one.

621
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,545
You can do that playing
Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

622
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,297
Permanent pacemakers
need precision.

623
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,341
So we can use
the portable x-ray.

624
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,134
- It's not real time.
- Sonogram.

625
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,637
And what happens
when I put him into V-tach

626
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,402
because the sonogram
isn't precise enough?

627
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,681
He's dying-

628
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,601
Exactly why I don't want to be
the one to kill him.

629
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:45,853
Thanks.

630
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,524
You knew I'd have to say no,
but you came anyway.

631
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,984
You just wanted a reason
to be angry at me.

632
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,362
If there's something wrong between us,
then let's...

633
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:55,321
Forget it.

634
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:59,200
You know why we spend nights
at my house?

635
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,995
Because when we
spent them at yours,

636
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,834
I could tell you
didn't want me there.

637
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,212
Why would I keep inviting you over
if I didn't want you there?

638
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:14,173
You always kicked me
out every morning.

639
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:18,469
You never offered me a drawer, you
never cleared out your closet for me.

640
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,097
I was just a visitor.

641
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:24,976
How long have you
felt like this?

642
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,729
From the start.

643
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:42,034
I know it's hard for you
because you lost your husband,

644
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,082
but I can't keep
chasing you forever.

645
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,893
I just tried your house,
where are you?

646
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,312
Clubbing. Good or bad?

647
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,273
Bad. Vitals are dropping,
the abdominal pain keeps getting worse.

648
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:16,819
Means we were too late
with the treatment.

649
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,531
Tell the lawyer he's off the clock,
we're done.

650
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,199
You're giving up?

651
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,618
Call Taub.

652
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:28,080
Tell him to pick up some morphine.
No need for the patient to be in pain.

653
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:31,375
- He's on morphine.
- No, he's on saline.

654
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,879
I figured you'd put him on saline,
so I switched him back to morphine.

655
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:38,341
I love you.
When you reach puberty, give me a...

656
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,597
His abdominal pain,
that was on morphine?

657
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,140
Yes.

658
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,563
<i>Is there something
that causes abdominal pain</i>

659
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,191
<i>that doesn't respond to morphine?</i>

660
00:37:57,026 --> 00:38:00,529
I was right.
He is being poisoned.

661
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,999
What's this density on his hip?

662
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:17,338
- Just bone.
- Think less boney.

663
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,009
You think
he's got lead poisoning?

664
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:27,682
Explains the constipation,
the nerves, seizures. Hold him down.

665
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:35,231
You're not gonna feel a thing,
except excruciating pain.

666
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:54,792
Your mugger used hollow points,
which exploded and left fragments.

667
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>Your doctors missed a couple
hiding behind your hipbone.</i>

668
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:02,174
<i>It's no biggie, except years later,
they started to dissolve,</i>

669
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,095
and then, biggie,
you started to dissolve.

670
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,557
I'll start him on chelation.
The agoraphobia, could it...

671
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:13,144
Nope. The lead wouldn't have started
to disintegrate till years after.

672
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:14,812
But it could have
exacerbated the fear.

673
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,355
I don't need to change.

674
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,485
I know you think that but your life
could be better, you'd have choices.

675
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,238
- He's lying.
- About what?

676
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,658
About everything.
About his life.

677
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,662
He doesn't even think he's happy here.
He's miserable.

678
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,873
- I've got everything I need.
- Yeah?

679
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:38,169
Well, then why did Taub find
rose petals in your entry hallway?

680
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,756
Struck me as a little weird,
thought it might be medically relevant.

681
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:44,175
But it actually just told me
that you were pathetic.

682
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,930
The day you crashed in your entryway
was your girlfriend's birthday.

683
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:56,312
You weren't there for the mail, you were
trying to go lay flowers on her grave.

684
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:02,902
Yeah, he's got PTSD,
yeah, he's agoraphobic.

685
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:04,278
But he's also a coward.

686
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,947
If you want to change your life,
do something.

687
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,158
Don't believe
your own rationalizations.

688
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,369
Don't just lock yourself up
and pretend you're happy.

689
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,469
- Hi.
- Hi.

690
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,098
You were right.

691
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,226
About my husband.
It affected me.

692
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,314
It still affects me.

693
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,484
If you're saying
you'll never be able to...

694
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:46,112
I cleaned out a drawer for you.

695
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,700
Like, a big one.
