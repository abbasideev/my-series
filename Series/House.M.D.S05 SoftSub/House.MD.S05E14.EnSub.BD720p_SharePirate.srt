1
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,797
The trick to onions,

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,758
cut them in half lengthwise,
but leave the roots on,

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,928
then make your vertical slices.

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,850
I need a dozen.
Think you can handle this?

5
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,268
A dozen is 12, right?

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:23,691
Next, we add mustard greens,
spicy and they pack a nice punch.

7
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,987
Plus, they're really
good for you, improve mental function,

8
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:32,199
protect against rheumatoid arthritis,
even inhibit certain types of cancer.

9
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,412
Are you going to chop those onions
or give them a Thai massage?

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,290
Well, I guess a happy ending
is out of the question.

11
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:43,919
I don't recall adding "making snide
remarks" to your list of duties.

12
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,880
Just taking initiative.

13
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,758
Porcini mushrooms.

14
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,844
You want to reconstitute them
in a bowl of water.

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,846
You also want to
hire an assistant

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,851
who can stay focused
for longer than 30 seconds.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,809
- Why don't I hear you chopping?
- Just give me a second.

18
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,521
- You're kidding me, right?
- So sorry.

19
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,731
Are you okay?
You want to sit down?

20
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,650
My lips are blue. Cyanosis.

21
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,821
Pain in my back and chest.
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

22
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,531
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a doctor.

23
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,784
- You are?
- And I need a doctor.

24
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,584
You drool.

25
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,253
Shut up.

26
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,023
I know gas is expensive, but I
could have given you a ride.

27
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,275
Elevator's broken.

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,402
It was fine when
I came up from Admitting.

29
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,989
Dana Miller, the cancer researcher,
spontaneous pneumothorax.

30
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,449
Awfully thin file.

31
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,034
She just got admitted.

32
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,827
Lots of things can
cause pneumothorax.

33
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,705
Why don't we let eight or 10 other
doctors rule out the boring stuff?

34
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,873
We want to take this case.

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,168
She's maybe five or 10 years away
from curing retinoblastoma.

36
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,378
Which would make this case
attractive to anyone

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,173
who has some vested interest in people
curing the incurable.

38
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,050
She hasn't suffered from COPD,

39
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,177
she doesn't smoke,
she hasn't been scuba diving.

40
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,638
O2 sats are low, even after
chest tube insertion.

41
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,224
Pneumothorax could be secondary
to a bunch of things,

42
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,267
cystic fibrosis, lung cancer...

43
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,019
Or to be slightly
more optimistic,

44
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,271
late-onset asthma triggered
by an unknown allergen.

45
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,356
We have a case?

46
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,484
- Did you just get to work?
- Am I in trouble?

47
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,277
Did you take the elevators up?

48
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,737
Yes.

49
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,614
So, steroids for asthma?

50
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:03,118
Yeah. Do a CT looking for
hyperinﬂation to confirm.

51
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,504
And I thought my hospital was high-tech.
Have to wait all day for a CT.

52
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,339
Dr. House gets a few perks.

53
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,341
He has his own scanner?

54
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,719
No, just very loose interpretations
of hospital procedure.

55
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,596
I appreciate
the extra effort, but...

56
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,849
Our gift to society, we want to get you
back to work as soon as possible.

57
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:30,229
Well, I'm not working,
at least, not as a doctor.

58
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,941
I quit. I left
eight months ago.

59
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,444
You mean like a sabbatical?

60
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,030
I had a uterine myoma, benign,

61
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,158
but it ruptured, and I needed
emergency surgery.

62
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,327
I was lying there on the table thinking,

63
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,830
"I can't die now,
I haven't been happy yet."

64
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,751
Couldn't you just buy an overpriced
German sports car, or have an affair?

65
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,880
My sports car is doing
what I want when I want.

66
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,132
Right now, I'm learning
how to run a kitchen

67
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,676
from one of the best chefs in New York.

68
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,637
You're washing pots
and smashing garlic.

69
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,639
Smashing garlic makes me happy.

70
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,976
Before that, it was eight years
studying, twelve years in that lab.

71
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,731
It was always what I was supposed to do,
never what I wanted to do.

72
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,744
Come here. Look at this.
Come here.

73
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,671
Adorable. Elevators keep crashing.
Ls Mercury in retrograde or what?

74
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,173
Elevators can be capricious,

75
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,884
sometimes it just seems like
they're out to get you.

76
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,596
She keeps playing with the blanket.
Why would she do that?

77
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,891
Why do you think the elevators
would be out to get me?

78
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:49,850
I don't know.

79
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:54,480
Maybe they wanted to take time off to
spend with their little dumbwaiter,

80
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,732
but then they had to leave it at home
with an elevator sitter

81
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,736
because you drove the replacement
elevator to quitting

82
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,572
because you're incapable
of listening to anybody but me.

83
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,990
It's just a theory.

84
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,785
You're wrong.
I don't even listen to you.

85
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,371
Either do your job or go home.
Leave me out of it.

86
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,749
I am going to do my job. It doesn't mean
I have to do it happily,

87
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,417
doesn't mean I have to do it
without resentment,

88
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,086
and it definitely doesn't
mean I have to do it

89
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,172
without seeking vengeance
on the person making me be here.

90
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,884
Congratulations. You've officially
dragged me down to your level.

91
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,012
Okay-

92
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,871
Hey, Blue.

93
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,507
It's not asthma,
lung volume's normal.

94
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,009
She did have a uterine myoma
removed eight months ago.

95
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,847
Central line IV could've made a hole
near the lung that slowly expanded.

96
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,600
No pleural thickening.
I can't believe she quit.

97
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,686
People have a right
to be happy.

98
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,815
I saw a four-year-old with
retinoblastoma on my oncology rotation.

99
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,776
The cancer had eaten
through her eye and into her brain.

100
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,486
Horrible diseases exist.

101
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,197
It doesn't mean people should give up
recreational anything.

102
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,452
Why not? Big picture. I don't care if
Jonas Salk's life is a miserable shell,

103
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,777
I just want him to cure polio.

104
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,872
You can't live
your life big picture.

105
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,082
You've got to look out for yourself
and the people you care about.

106
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,333
Well, then,
why are you a doctor?

107
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,979
Why aren't you sitting by a pool
in Fiji knocking back Mai Tais?

108
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,172
People act in
their own self-interests.

109
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,507
You're all here because
you're happy to be here,

110
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,009
or at least because
it's your best option.

111
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,677
I'm here because
I want to help people.

112
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,723
No, you're here because
it makes you feel good to help people,

113
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,392
Taub and Foreman are here because
they've got no other viable choices,

114
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,687
and Thirteen is desperate to make
her life matter before it's over.

115
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,649
So, you're happy to be here?

116
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,526
Does it show?

117
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,446
Are those increased
interstitial markings?

118
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,073
It could be pulmonary fibrosis.

119
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,533
Do a biopsy.

120
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,828
Foreman.

121
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,667
"You've got to look
out for the people you care about."

122
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,294
That wouldn't have anything to do with
you screwing over your clinical trial

123
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,716
by slipping Thirteen
the real drug, would it?

124
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,594
You said that would be stupid.

125
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,598
Does she know?
Because Jonas Salk would not approve.

126
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,433
There's nothing to know.

127
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,067
Got it?

128
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,864
- Good?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,201
- You okay?
- Just a headache.

130
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,079
- I took some ibuprofen, but...
- Where's the pain, front or back?

131
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,083
Front. Why are there never any
interesting pictures on these cards?

132
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,626
They should make
a dirty version.

133
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,670
Sharp pain or more
of a throbbing...

134
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,924
Relax. This is not a side-effect.
People get headaches.

135
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,218
True, but I can get you an MRI.

136
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,345
If I'm on the drug,
it's been weeks.

137
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,181
It's not like something's
gonna suddenly crop up now.

138
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,227
Okay, first card.

139
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,106
Train, duck...

140
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,860
- You can't remember?
- ...piano.

141
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,699
We need a biopsy to confirm...

142
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,286
You need an open-lung biopsy
to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.

143
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,747
That's invasive surgery. I'd be
out of commission for weeks.

144
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,166
No offense,
but you're not working.

145
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,876
What does it matter if you spend
a little time in bed?

146
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,337
Not working doesn't mean
I don't have places to go.

147
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,550
I've got my book group, piano lessons,
cooking classes. They make me happy.

148
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,178
A warm apple fritter makes me happy,
it doesn't fulfill me as a person.

149
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,388
And working here does?

150
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,073
If it didn't, I'd have found a way to
go back to tucking tummies.

151
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,312
Good for you. If your job fulfills you
and makes you happy, that's rare.

152
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,896
I didn't say I was happy.

153
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,569
I loved being a plastic surgeon,
the money, the lifestyle.

154
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,863
And in a lot of ways,
this job stinks.

155
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,908
I'm making five bucks,
I'm always annoyed, but...

156
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,661
You can look yourself
in the mirror and think,

157
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,663
"I did something
worthwhile today."

158
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,665
Exactly.

159
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,126
That's important.

160
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,753
And I do miss that,

161
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,298
but it just wasn't
enough anymore.

162
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,431
- That doesn't feel right.
- Shun.

163
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,351
It's weird.

164
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,272
What is it, ascites?

165
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,071
Your belly's full of blood.

166
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,996
First her lung deflates,
like me after a cold shower,

167
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,874
now her liver starts to bleed,
like me after a...

168
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,172
You okay?

169
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,216
Great.

170
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,678
Just practicing
my clown college audition.

171
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,596
Someone set a trip wire.

172
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:22,724
We were with the
patient the whole time.

173
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,476
E were in the R.

174
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,603
Lung, liver. Go.

175
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,768
Shouldn't you be obsessing over
who did this to you?

176
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,192
Nope. Anybody bother MRI-ing
our patient's liver for tumors?

177
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,529
No tumors, no cysts,
no clear etiology.

178
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:39,616
If you're not obsessing,
you must have already figured it out.

179
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,537
Yes. So I'm obsessing about
why you're not obsessing

180
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,707
about why our patient's liver
suddenly sprang a leak.

181
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,043
There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe.
Could be a granuloma.

182
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,505
Erodes into the hepatic artery,
causes the bleed.

183
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,965
What caused the granuloma?

184
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,800
Blastomycosis.

185
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,635
Could've been
asymptomatic for months.

186
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,348
It hits her lungs, we give her steroids,
it blossoms and attacks her liver.

187
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,059
Get a piece of her lung,
stick it under a black light.

188
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,731
If it glows, the sick children who need
her soufflés can breathe easier.

189
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,692
Foreman.

190
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,905
Again?

191
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,657
You have a problem.

192
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,703
I told you. I didn't...

193
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,785
Then you really have a problem.

194
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,705
When she turned her head
to look at the MRI,

195
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,040
I think she's losing
her peripheral vision.

196
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,251
Because she turned her head?

197
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,627
I'm happy for you.

198
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,089
A love so deep you're ready to chuck
your medical license

199
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,343
to give her powerful, unproven drugs
with dangerous side effects.

200
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,763
I don't want to make any assumptions
about your feelings for me,

201
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,474
but I do have
a birthday coming up.

202
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,655
I hear Cuddy's SEAL training
finally came in handy.

203
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,450
Should I be investing in a flak jacket?

204
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,160
You're safe.

205
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,706
No carpet bombing, no burning of Dresden
to teach her a lesson?

206
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,043
Well, since you're incapable
of taking the high road,

207
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:17,589
I assume there's some deeper,
more long-term strategy in effect.

208
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,468
Cuddy's not playing games,
she's not looking for leverage.

209
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,262
She wants pure,
unadulterated vengeance.

210
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,723
And your countermove
is to let her have it?

211
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,392
The only time to strike back
is when I want something.

212
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,312
All I want now is to get things
back to normal,

213
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,897
which I can't get
by escalating.

214
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:39,277
The only way to win this war is to
lose it. Let her punch herself out.

215
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,863
Yeah, that makes sense, too.

216
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,823
Too?

217
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:47,285
I was thinking you actually feel guilty
about taking her away from her baby,

218
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,037
but your explanation
is good, too.

219
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,791
It's completely inconsistent
with your character, but whatever.

220
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,628
Oh, thank you, Rationalization Man,
you have saved the village.

221
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,297
You wanna eat?

222
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,757
You forgot your file.

223
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,513
Dana Miller?
The cancer researcher?

224
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,848
Not anymore.

225
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,859
Dr. Miller, I doubt
if you'll remember me...

226
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,277
James Wilson, right?

227
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,737
Chicago, at the
adenocarcinoma conference?

228
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,072
Impressive.

229
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,617
You want some cortisone
for that itch?

230
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,538
Liver failure, itching is one
of the lovely side effects.

231
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,875
W“)! Did you quit?

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,752
Well, the worst thing is,
now, every time I get sick,

233
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,297
I have to listen
to a dozen people judge me.

234
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,257
Do you want me
to congratulate you?

235
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,219
I've got four kids in Pede-Onc
right now who are going to die.

236
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,306
Three of them within a year,
the other in a few days, probably.

237
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,974
Breakthroughs will happen.

238
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,935
With or without me,
someone will find the answer.

239
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,020
Maybe.

240
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,485
I'm in the trenches.
I'm doing triage as best I can.

241
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,654
You had the chance
to end the war.

242
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,658
How is someone like me
supposed to keep fighting

243
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,953
when someone like you
just walked away?

244
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,876
When I left my job, a lot of people
were furious with me.

245
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,087
It was easier to be angry
than to admit they weren't happy.

246
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,008
That they were stuck
in a rut somewhere in their lives,

247
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,384
unable to move forward.

248
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,638
What's your rut?

249
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,402
Okay, you're freaking me out.

250
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,947
Do you think
we should have kids?

251
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,497
We've had this conversation.

252
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,667
Ten years ago. Things change.

253
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,419
On our third date, I told you
that I didn't want to have kids,

254
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,463
and you said that
you were okay with that.

255
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,715
I said it because
I wanted to sleep with you.

256
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,842
And then
I fell in love with you,

257
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,012
and I realized
that I really could be okay with it.

258
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,892
It wasn't like I had
this burning desire to have children.

259
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,603
God, have you been resenting me
all this time? Is that why...

260
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,481
No, of course not.

261
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,861
I'm just revisiting.

262
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:36,413
This isn't a whim for me.
It's not a decision that I made lightly.

263
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,748
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

264
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,000
All the time.

265
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,713
But just not enough
to make me want to do it.

266
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,340
I like our life.

267
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,179
Are you okay?

268
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,267
Can I turn the TV back on?

269
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,619
Look straight ahead.

270
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,749
Why didn't we do
this test this morning?

271
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,460
- Do you see that?
- No.

272
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,630
- Damn.
- I'm losing my peripheral vision?

273
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,970
I am on the drug.

274
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,642
Does this mean you have to tell them
and take me off it?

275
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,854
No and yes.

276
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,274
As far as they're concerned,
you're on the placebo.

277
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,236
I found out last week.
The trial was getting positive results,

278
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,782
so I switched you.

279
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,453
So my headaches...

280
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,919
I'll stop taking the drug
and everything should be fine.

281
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,844
Specimen's negative
for blastomycosis.

282
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,262
That's it?

283
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,308
I'll go give House the test results.
You can tell the patient.

284
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,143
Hey.

285
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,816
We have been dating
for two weeks.

286
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:33,571
You just broke trial protocol
and risked your entire career

287
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,699
to give me a drug
we're not even sure will help me.

288
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,870
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

289
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,880
Dr. Miller?

290
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,138
I'm sorry. The test was negative.
So, I'm gonna take you off...

291
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,181
What happened to your head?

292
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,183
I don't know, I was sleeping.

293
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,060
It's so itchy.

294
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,187
You were scratching it
in your sleep.

295
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,733
You scratched right through your skull.

296
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,944
- What?
- This is brain matter.

297
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,195
Oh, God.

298
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,114
Need some help in here.

299
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,994
I did a free flap closure
to avoid any scarring.

300
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,496
She was lucky, the scratching
didn't cause any brain damage.

301
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,455
But the first thing she said

302
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,208
when we woke her up was,
"it still itches."

303
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,004
Itch receptors are only
in the top two layers of skin,

304
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,590
which means she's not actually itchy,
she just thinks she is.

305
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,632
So the problem's in her brain.

306
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,302
Thank God we have you here
to interpret that for us.

307
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,889
Sorry. I have a headache.

308
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,056
It could be psychogenic.

309
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,683
She made a big,
sudden change in her life,

310
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,894
could be the
result of a mental imbalance.

311
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,605
She wants to do what she wants to do,
what's crazy about that?

312
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,274
Why do you have to quit to do it?
If I want to do something, I do it.

313
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,610
If you can figure out a balance,
there's no burn out.

314
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,069
Thanks for the lesson, Deepak,

315
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,989
but the itching started yesterday,
not eight months ago.

316
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,949
Meningitis, encephalitis.

317
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,118
Those are diffuse processes,
this is localized.

318
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,914
Could be plaques, MS would explain
the itching, possibly the lungs.

319
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,165
So would a brain tumor.

320
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,210
Well, how about we stop guessing
and MRI her head instead?

321
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,361
- You want to talk about your headaches?
- Not particularly.

322
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,700
You went off the drug, but the headaches
are worse. You need an MRI.

323
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,993
The patient needs an MRI.

324
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,955
If she had gangrene, would you be
amputating my leg?

325
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,000
These pills have codeine in them? You're
taking twice the indicated amount.

326
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,044
I've only been off the drug
for 24 hours.

327
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,422
So I think the bigger issue here is that
I've been off you for 24 hours.

328
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,925
You have worsening headaches,
loss of peripheral vision,

329
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,011
and a long history of pretending
bad things aren't happening.

330
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,889
You really think
this is just about my hurt feelings?

331
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,611
- I don't remember demoting you.
- Brought you something.

332
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,282
Latest issue of Parent magazine.
Really interesting column.

333
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,702
Apparently, working moms
are actually more engaged and attentive

334
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,997
than stay-at-home moms.
Something about personal fulfillment.

335
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:29,956
That's just a rationalization

336
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,458
by working moms who justify
not being with their kids,

337
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,962
which is fine, if that's what they want.
It's not what I want.

338
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,672
And this is Nurses Quarterly.

339
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,924
- The point is...
- You're only here to get back at me

340
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,135
by dumping dirty mop
water on my carpet.

341
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,054
Just get it over with
so I can get back to work.

342
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,703
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,748
I figured

344
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,959
only one of us needed to go
out on a limb.

345
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,130
I thought! Could help you.

346
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,885
It's hard to have a conversation
when I'm trying not to move.

347
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,560
Oh, God.

348
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,148
Patient's MRI was negative,
no tumors, no lesions.

349
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,692
- Where's your cane?
- Where are your co-workers?

350
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,903
- I paged them.
- It could still be psychogenic.

351
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:45,031
Technically, it can't still be that
because it never could be that.

352
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,658
She scratched through her skull
while she was sleeping.

353
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,911
Unless she was having
a dream about fleas...

354
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,246
Oh, hey, funny
you should drop by.

355
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,582
We were just talking
about this patient of ours.

356
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,085
Tell him the part about where two
of her doctors don't show up for...

357
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,378
Where are you going?

358
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,047
Polyneuropathy. If it's not
in the brain, it's in the nerves.

359
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,852
Explains the itching,
the lungs, the liver.

360
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,968
Shock the affected area,
re-boot the nerves, she'll be fine.

361
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,845
Foreman.

362
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,767
How bad is she?

363
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,190
She's got a tumor
in her optic chiasm.

364
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,860
You don't need your coat
to treat a tumor.

365
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,779
I'm going to the drug company.

366
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,865
To tell them that you compromised
their trial, your ethics,

367
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,826
and the patient's health.
That's a great idea.

368
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,912
They have records
on hundreds of patients.

369
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:33,913
I can ask them for access,

370
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,874
find out if other patients developed
tumors and how they were treated.

371
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,668
This drug inhibits cell death.

372
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,833
I think I can take
a wild guess on how I treat that.

373
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:45,091
Stop taking it?
Yeah, she tried that yesterday.

374
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,428
Oh, my God. It's been a whole day and
her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

375
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,931
If you get on that elevator

376
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,142
and it's only 'cause you're worried
about getting to sleep tonight...

377
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,435
I want to be able to tell her

378
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,687
this happened to other people,
and they're fine now.

379
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,147
So tell her.

380
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,858
- I'm not going to lie to her.
- A little late for that.

381
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,487
You need to wait.

382
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,489
Because if this thing
doesn't go away,

383
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,367
she's going to need you
to still have a medical license.

384
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,833
So I spoke with House.
He thinks we should just...

385
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,461
- My leg is bleeding.
- What happened?

386
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:25,339
I was going for the phone
and I fell over the table.

387
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,968
I can't see.

388
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,720
What do you mean?

389
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,681
I can't see anything.

390
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,328
- You gonna tip housekeeping?
- Get it from Cuddy.

391
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:59,916
Don't tell me. She burned
your apartment to the ground.

392
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,586
The warmth would have been nice.
No heat, no power.

393
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:08,633
Apparently, Mrs. House called the
utilities and told them we were moving.

394
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,927
You have 17 messages.

395
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:15,014
And your non-involvement strategy
doesn't seem to be working.

396
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,521
Hang up. He's here.

397
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,722
We've been
paging you all night.

398
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,195
By all means, let's discuss the failed
attempts to contact me,

399
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,405
not the reason behind them.

400
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,157
The patient started
experiencing spinal shocks

401
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,536
before the machine was turned on.
Lhermitte's sign.

402
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,039
Shocks without shock,
an itch that won't stop.

403
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,374
She needs Dr. Seuss.

404
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,126
Lhermitte's sign could mean Behcet's,
B12 deficiency...

405
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,796
No sores, no anemia.
Where's Foreman?

406
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:47,964
No idea.

407
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,924
Could be another
demyelinating disease.

408
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,843
Why are you asking about Foreman
and not Thirteen?

409
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:56,389
Because both questions
are bound to have the same answer.

410
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:00,851
Ebony and Ivory are joined near the hip.
Forget the brain, look lower.

411
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,187
A spinal tumor wouldn't explain
the liver or the lungs.

412
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,148
But an aggressive
spinal hemangioma could.

413
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,651
Go find it.

414
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,876
You didn't answer the door.

415
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,462
Probably because I didn't want
to talk to anyone.

416
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,465
You can leave your stolen key
on your way out.

417
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,260
I was looking for Foreman.
I figured...

418
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,681
You can't see.

419
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,186
- Where is he?
- On his way to the drug company.

420
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:48,232
- Tell him to come back. I'll dial.
- If they can help...

421
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,985
What, you think that drug company
has a magic tumor wand

422
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,323
that no one else knows about? You need
radiation, not ritual sacrifice.

423
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:03,789
He asked for my advice
before he switched you off the placebo.

424
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,667
I told him to do it
if he loved you.

425
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,503
He only thinks he loves me.

426
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,758
It's the same thing.
Yes, he's an idiot.

427
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,885
You didn't ask him to do anything,
you're pissed off that he did.

428
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,221
So let him torch his career
to pay for his sins,

429
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,934
unless you actually
feel something for the idiot,

430
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,107
in which case, you might want to
tell him to turn around.

431
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,539
You're hurting him.

432
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,084
Good, after all the stunts
he's pulled on me.

433
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,169
You're physically hurting him.

434
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,088
That's the point.

435
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,839
What's the point?

436
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,758
What do you think you're going
to accomplish?

437
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,302
House shouldn't be allowed
to make people miserable

438
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,096
- without paying for it.
- You're not miserable.

439
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,847
You're telling me how I feel?

440
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,518
You're here because you like this,
you like working with him.

441
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,603
Wow, if only I'd known
I was having fun,

442
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,438
I wouldn't have
canceled the bouncy house.

443
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,525
Fire him.
And go be home with your new baby.

444
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,236
I like what he does
for this hospital.

445
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,572
What he does is who he is.

446
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,616
And the same goes for you.

447
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,626
Slow down.

448
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,672
Unless you want to radiate her heart
instead of her brain.

449
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,049
Of course, then your problems
would actually all go away.

450
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,928
Thanks. I'm not beating myself up
enough already over this.

451
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,223
Entering the left
common carotid.

452
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,102
You broke the rules,
your girlfriend went blind.

453
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,647
You gotta be ready for losing
to be one of the possibilities.

454
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,399
You're at
the carotid bifurcation.

455
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,527
I knew that giving her the drug
would be bad for me if I got caught.

456
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,405
I never thought
it would be bad for her.

457
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,741
Nobody else was having
adverse reactions.

458
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,909
You did it because
you love her,

459
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,413
and, ironically, you never took her
into consideration.

460
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,000
I can't wait to see what you get her
for your anniversary.

461
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,589
Catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm.
We're in position.

462
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,558
Nukie-nukie.

463
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,695
What's going on
with everyone today?

464
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,114
It involves House,
Foreman, and Thirteen,

465
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:46,118
which means it's either dumb, dangerous,
or tragic, or a combination.

466
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,078
I'm embracing my ignorance.

467
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,749
House was right about the hemangioma,
looks fixable.

468
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,960
What's that?

469
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,923
Hemangiomas travel solo.
This thing's brought a friend.

470
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,885
Masses in her lungs and spine.
One in her pericardium.

471
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,969
They're everywhere.

472
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,142
Classic mesothelioma.

473
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,812
It metastasized outward
to the spine and muscles.

474
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,023
The irony of it.
Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all

475
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,819
if some other lazy cancer researcher
hadn't gone home early.

476
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,529
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?

477
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:23,823
Shouldn't you be saying,

478
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,158
"Those weren't there when we scanned
her two days ago"?

479
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,328
- Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.
- Good rephrasing.

480
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,957
Have Wilson do
a biopsy to confirm.

481
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,124
No.

482
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,335
Something weird is going on,

483
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,504
and it involves our colleagues,
we should know.

484
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,910
You want us to treat the patient?
Tell us what's going on.

485
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,550
Actually, all he needs us to do

486
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,469
is tell Wilson
to do something. So...

487
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:51,100
You always blab
to watch people react,

488
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:54,562
so not blabbing means you don't want us
to react, which can't be good.

489
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,565
Is Thirteen's headache
not just a headache?

490
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,150
If I check with Admitting,
am I going to find her name?

491
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,113
Little pinch.

492
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,583
I'm sorry about the other day.
I unloaded on you and...

493
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,167
You're not sorry.

494
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,714
You feel bad because mesothelioma
means I'm dying.

495
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,091
You're a good person.
I appreciate the sentiment.

496
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,093
I'm not apologizing
because you're dying.

497
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:30,139
I'm apologizing
because you were right. I am stuck.

498
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,226
My girlfriend died.

499
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,271
She was the only person
I've loved for a long time and...

500
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,526
I'm still living in her apartment.
I'm surrounded by her things.

501
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,653
I've left it
all exactly where it was.

502
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,743
I don't know how
to get un-stuck.

503
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,748
The only wrong thing
is to do nothing.

504
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,004
Yeah.

505
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,009
All right.

506
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,726
That's not supposed to happen.

507
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,696
Have you thought about going to
the drug company, see if they can help?

508
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,864
I thought about it.

509
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,492
We need to give it more time,
it's been half a day.

510
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,910
This thing keeps growing,

511
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,788
there's other stuff in your brain
you might need later on.

512
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,625
If I were any other patient, you'd both
be in the lounge eating donuts.

513
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,378
- You're not any other patient.
- Right.

514
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,255
Any other patient,
you don't feel guilty.

515
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,885
But you don't get to torch your career
to pay for your sins.

516
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,055
House told you
to say that, didn't he?

517
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,975
Does that make it
any less true?

518
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,353
- You think he's right?
- Who cares?

519
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,063
You're a hypocrite.

520
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,525
You don't ask her if she wants
to be on the drug,

521
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,150
but when there's a chance
you could help her get better,

522
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,486
suddenly you're letting her
call the shots?

523
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:11,198
That's not being noble,
that's saving your own ass.

524
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,869
I'd feel worse if he
destroyed his career.

525
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,041
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

526
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,127
So what causes
masses that do bleed?

527
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,170
AVM secondary
to schistosomiasis.

528
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,375
She'd be crawling with worms,
we would've noticed it.

529
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,049
Gorham's Disease
and Kasabach-Merritt

530
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,011
can both cause super-aggressive
vascular tumors.

531
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,681
Patient's heart just stopped.

532
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,767
So what causes that?

533
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,895
Cardiac tamponade.

534
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,107
She's bleeding into her pericardium,
smothering her heart. Syringe.

535
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,906
BP is going back up.
It's working.

536
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,074
No, it's not. Look.

537
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,254
We're transfusing platelets, FFP,
everything to try to keep her stable.

538
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,298
But we can barely keep up
with the blood loss.

539
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,341
At this rate, she could be dead
by the end of the day.

540
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,428
We need to resect
the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.

541
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,514
Too late.
No surgeon's going to touch her now.

542
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:21,810
- So we give up? Just let her bleed out?
- Don't be silly.

543
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,022
Do you know what that would do to our
malpractice insurance rates?

544
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,609
We go on the offensive, cut off
the invading army's supply line.

545
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,402
You're talking
about embolization?

546
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:34,490
Cut off the arteries that feed blood
to the tumors, they wither and die.

547
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,492
Start with the ones
in her lungs,

548
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,952
'cause if they get any bigger,
she's gonna have a hard time breathing,

549
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:41,038
so she'll have a hard time
telling us she's dead.

550
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,603
You can't kill the tumors
without also killing healthy tissue.

551
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,667
If we wipe out
three-quarters of her lungs...

552
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,962
Let's hope that running marathons
wasn't on her happy list.

553
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,182
I found this.

554
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,479
In the coat closet
where I hid it.

555
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:14,029
I thought I'd never see you again,
Little Little Greg.

556
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,907
Yeah, you heard me right.

557
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,873
You are who you are.

558
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,418
It's annoying,
but that's not your fault.

559
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,255
It isn't about you.

560
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,300
I'm sorry.

561
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:39,680
Because you were doing this job
perfectly until the baby came along.

562
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,056
What?

563
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,351
I'm apologizing.
Can't you just accept my...

564
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,061
I accept.

565
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,231
Are we gonna have
to do this dance again in 28 days?

566
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,774
What the hell
is wrong with you?

567
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,778
Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're
practically weeping on my shoulder.

568
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:59,032
I can only assume that what I'm hearing
is your Aunt Flow telling me...

569
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,710
When I was being a jerk,
you suddenly act human,

570
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,462
but when I act human,
you turn back into a jerk.

571
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,673
Guess our cycles
aren't matched up yet.

572
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,178
This is your way of saying you accept
my apology, isn't it?

573
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:22,389
Nope. This is my way of saying
you were doing a crappy job before,

574
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,684
you'll do a slightly crappier job now,
everything keeps going.

575
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,437
Nature of life,
nature of parenthood.

576
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,109
Or this whole thing
is just an act.

577
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,696
And you've gone back
to the part you think you need to play.

578
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,824
You should go talk to Wilson.

579
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,535
Rationalization Man
needs a faithful sidekick.

580
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,455
Now Rational Man
needs to go save a life.

581
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,009
House, if you're looking
for returnable bottles,

582
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,055
- Kutner's already cleaned it out.
- Damn! Oh, well,

583
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,726
it means the only thing I'm gonna
get out of this is a diagnosis.

584
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,480
So the nurses gave her pads
instead of tampons,

585
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,845
is that diagnostically
relevant?

586
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,108
The fact that the nurses
had to give her anything is.

587
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,236
It means she's bleeding
from her uterus.

588
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,280
Women do that. It's perfectly natural,
not scary at all.

589
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,867
She's menstruating
and she's bleeding everywhere.

590
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,995
There's about a three-or four-in-28
chance it's a coincidence.

591
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,583
Which leaves a much bigger chance that
the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.

592
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,587
She had a myoma eight months ago. The
surgeons cut through her uterine wall.

593
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,964
Every cut of the scalpel

594
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,592
could have sent endometrial cells
spilling out into her bloodstream.

595
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,177
Some of them took up
residence in her lungs,

596
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,971
some in her liver,
some in her spine.

597
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,306
And like all
horny little cells,

598
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,768
they went forth and multiplied until
they reached a critical mass.

599
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,687
In the days leading up
to her next period,

600
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,815
when her uterus is supposed to swell,
everything swelled.

601
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,859
Then when her uterus was supposed
to bleed, everything bled.

602
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:04,366
Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period.
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

603
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,827
Although, frankly,
not by all that much.

604
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,870
Cut out the masses,
she'll be fine.

605
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,915
Can't do surgery until her cycle's over
and she stops bleeding.

606
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,001
Let's hope she can
hold out until then.

607
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,794
In the meantime, get her
a pint of cookie dough ice cream

608
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,671
and a DVD of Beaches.

609
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,157
I'm sorry.

610
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,496
Foreman?

611
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,168
I can see you.

612
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:14,853
How you feeling?

613
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,066
Relative to the last
few days? Awesome.

614
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,486
You almost died.

615
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,031
- For the second time in eight months.
- I know.

616
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,952
How do you feel about
your life choices this time?

617
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,205
I didn't lie there
thinking, "What if"?

618
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,167
I always worry on my deathbed

619
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,879
I'll think, "I didn't do
anything really important."

620
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,965
You're gonna spend
one day of your life on your deathbed.

621
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:47,094
The other 25,000 are the ones
we should be worrying about.

622
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,055
Go to bed happy tonight.

623
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,793
Dr. Schmidt, it's Eric Foreman.

624
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,216
Actually, the trial
isn't going too well.

625
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,603
You told them, didn't you?

626
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,571
You really had no choice,
on account of being an idiot.

627
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,490
They gonna pull the drug?

628
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,577
I broke protocol.

629
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,622
Her results are
no longer admissible to the trial.

630
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,291
They don't have to do anything.

631
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,960
If anyone else gets a tumor,
they'll put a warning on the label.

632
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,962
You're gonna keep your license?

633
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,674
They'll come after me if I attempt
to participate in any more trials.

634
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,051
That's very decent of them.

635
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:16,016
Well, good for me.
See you tomorrow.

636
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,271
And the next day.
And the next day.

637
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,817
That wasn't your locker, was it?

638
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,863
It's a locker room.
How else are they gonna learn?

639
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,172
Do you think
you can't be happy without a kid?

640
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,966
I don't know.

641
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,056
I know I can't
be happy without you.

642
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,004
You snore.

643
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,507
Shut up.
