1
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,777
Wow.

2
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,195
Yeah.

3
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,676
Come back to bed.

4
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,928
Give me a minute.

5
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,596
You get 20 seconds.

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,824
Hey. What are you...

7
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,131
Female, late 20s,
tonic-clonic seizure.

8
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,216
Duration of the seizure?

9
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,633
A little over three minutes.

10
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,343
Does your friend
have a history of epilepsy?

11
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,678
She never said.

12
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,430
My name is Dr. Cameron.
You're in a hospital.

13
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,431
We're gonna take care of you.

14
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,475
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

15
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:11,925
House?

16
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:18,014
I have a case I think
you might be interested in.

17
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,516
Not now.

18
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,895
Twenty-six-year-old woman
had a tonic-clonic seizure.

19
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,106
What about me speeding away
says to you "let's chat"?

20
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:30,276
History of fatigue, and two years ago
she had a retinal vein occlusion.

21
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,569
She's diabetic.

22
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:35,031
No, she's not,
and she has no history of hypertension.

23
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,242
It can wait.

24
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,664
I knew I should have set up
the video camera. Stay there.

25
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,505
Oh, my goodness, I played
a practical joke on my best friend,

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,715
and he's badly injured.

27
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,635
Wish I'd learnt
this valuable lesson earlier.

28
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,806
I was waiting by my window
for an hour. Why are you late?

29
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,433
I had a breakfast meeting
at Mickey's Diner

30
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,853
with the Mercy people
to tell them

31
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,858
I'm coming back to work here.

32
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,488
Sorry if it interfered
with your plan to maim me.

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,740
Donut's a nice touch.

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,794
That's just my way of saying
welcome back.

35
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,674
The seizure could be the result of
dehydration or something neurological.

36
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,885
Or the Ecstasy
you found in her system.

37
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,720
According to Dr. Hadley,
the patient took the drugs

38
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:41,139
about five hours
before the seizure, so...

39
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,557
How does Thirteen
know about it?

40
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,059
Apparently,
she was with the patient last night.

41
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,730
At 3:00 a.m.?

42
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,775
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,486
Penthouse Forum
meets medical mystery.

44
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:56,696
Maybe there is a God.

45
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,035
Empty, transient sex?

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,370
I've been waiting for you
to spiral out of control

47
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,706
ever since you got
your Huntington's diagnosis,

48
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,458
but this is more
than I dared hope for.

49
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,168
The patient's seizure
resulted from dehydration,

50
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,670
which resulted from
a cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.

51
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,715
- Mystery solved.
- Wait, were you doing drugs?

52
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,258
Not diagnostically relevant.

53
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,052
That's what
we're trying to diagnose.

54
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,137
It's how steep of a spiral
you're on.

55
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,514
Our patient hemorrhaged into
her eye two years ago.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,961
Also not diagnostically relevant.

57
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:26,225
Retinal vein occlusion was fixed.

58
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,769
Her doctor said it
was a venous anomaly.

59
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,730
Is he in this room? Because if
he's not, I don't care what he thinks.

60
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,935
Unless he's a she,
and she was there last night, too,

61
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,609
in which case,
I care very deeply.

62
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,070
What if the eye problem wasn't
with her vein, but with her blood?

63
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,030
It would explain why she seized,
why she's always tired.

64
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,475
She parties until 3:00 a.m.,
that's why she's always tired.

65
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,492
Yet, you seem fine.

66
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,786
She's visited four other doctors
in the past year,

67
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,120
none of them found anything.

68
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,956
She's a hypochondriac
who drank too much.

69
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,540
Blood clots
could explain everything.

70
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:54,420
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive,
too many platelets. Sorry.

71
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,508
Thirteen, go stick a needle
in your girlfriend's pelvis.

72
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,219
And, no,
that one wasn't a metaphor.

73
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:04,472
Suck out some marrow.
That one was.

74
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,813
I like to watch.

75
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:17,735
I can handle this alone.

76
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,362
You've already handled it,

77
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,727
that's why
you need a chaperone.

78
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:24,742
Of course, I'm a very permissive,
understanding chaperone,

79
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,786
so feel free to ignore me,

80
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,081
you know, if you're in the mood to start
kissing or groping or showering...

81
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:34,002
You'll have to excuse Dr. House,
he mistakes immaturity for edginess.

82
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,712
You're Dr. House?

83
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:41,342
I assume my name came up last night
in the form of a moan.

84
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,302
You had sex, then a seizure.

85
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:47,098
Could be a particular position
or activity that set it off.

86
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,309
That sounds like a valid
medical theory, doesn't it?

87
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,978
I'm really sorry,
just ignore him.

88
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:55,815
Whatever you think we did, we did.
And then some.

89
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,816
Lights on or off?

90
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,943
You got a medical rationalization
for that one?

91
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,903
- Light sensitivity could...
- On.

92
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,532
Huh! Figured she had
more shame than that.

93
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:08,411
She talk dirty, or make you rely
on vague hand signals?

94
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,831
She's pretty direct
about what she wants.

95
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,624
I'm learning so much.

96
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,046
Okay, score the score,
scale of 1 to 10.

97
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,213
Don't answer.

98
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,799
Seven.

99
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,969
Finally get one right.

100
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,933
You want to investigate him
because he ate a donut?

101
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,179
He claimed he had a morning meeting
at Mickey's Diner.

102
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,520
Wilson loves Mickey's Diner.

103
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,398
He has the French Toast Tower
whenever he sets foot in the door.

104
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,152
There's no way he would have come
to work wanting more carbs.

105
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,446
He lied to me.
I need to know why.

106
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,892
What do you think
you'll find out?

107
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,325
I'm worried that
he might be a spy.

108
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,036
He's been gone four months. You're
worried the friendship has changed.

109
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,205
I'm just not sure
if he's working for Hirohito

110
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,539
or the New England Patriots.

111
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,792
You played a practical joke on him,
he didn't laugh...

112
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,127
I need something
to lord over him, a lie.

113
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,671
He didn't try to retaliate,
he moralized.

114
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,923
He always moralized.

115
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:05,009
And he always moralized and got even.
He hasn't fired back.

116
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,470
Things always change.

117
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,638
And that sucks.

118
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,601
Yeah. Find out where he was.

119
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,149
I should've known it wasn't
a coincidence. I found your letters.

120
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,417
You recognized House's name,
and you're the first patient I've seen

121
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,405
who actually enjoyed
being accosted by him.

122
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,865
I would've told you, but...

123
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,408
What exactly
would you have told me?

124
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,452
That you slept with me
to get to House?

125
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,830
That you've been trying to get him
to take your case for over a year?

126
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,083
I'm sick,
no one even wrote back.

127
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,334
You used me.

128
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,293
You used me.

129
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,920
My motives were clear.

130
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,047
You might've figured out
my motives faster

131
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,674
if you had bothered to ask my name.

132
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,639
I followed you to that bar
because I wanted to talk to you,

133
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,475
see if you'd help me
get to House.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,729
I didn't expect you
to be so aggressive.

135
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,022
Was that seizure even real?

136
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:01,774
Why would I fake a symptom?

137
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,152
It would just make it harder
for House to diagnose me.

138
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,988
There's nothing to diagnose.
Your biopsy results are negative.

139
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,990
Then it's something else.

140
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,701
Get dressed.
I'm discharging you.

141
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,287
House admitted me.
He obviously thinks...

142
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:17,373
House is using you as an excuse
to stick his nose in my personal life.

143
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,709
I'm tired all the time.

144
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:24,797
Some nights I fall asleep at 10:00
and wake up at noon, still tired.

145
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,092
Every doctor I see,
tells me there's nothing wrong.

146
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,802
And that proves what, exactly?

147
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,679
That they're wrong
or that you're wrong?

148
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,915
Come on,
you expect me to believe...

149
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,022
Sit back, deep breaths.
Try and relax.

150
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,983
Get the paddles,
she's gonna crash.

151
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,195
Damn.

152
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,658
<i>We had to use paddles
to stabilize the patient's heart.</i>

153
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,412
Eye issue, brain issue,
now a heart issue,

154
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,039
sounds like a real case to me.

155
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,374
Yeah, I get it. I was wrong.
Can we move on?

156
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,960
You're just upset
because the whole time she was with you,

157
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:08,841
she was thinking about my huge,
throbbing diagnostic skills.

158
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,927
Drugs would explain everything.

159
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,470
This morning
you rejected drugs.

160
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,055
That's when I thought
that Thirteen was right

161
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,098
and I was just
jerking her around.

162
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,227
Cardiac arrest means
she could be a serious user.

163
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,187
- Great.
- What?

164
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,150
That means that something she did
at my place set this off,

165
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,443
either she brought drugs in

166
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,403
or she grabbed something
from my medicine cabinet.

167
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,822
And that means my place
needs to be searched.

168
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,824
Now, I'd be happy
to do that myself,

169
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,577
but unfortunately, that would be
far less titillating for House,

170
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,062
so he's about to come up
with some convoluted medical reason

171
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,083
why I have to stay here
while he goes through my stuff.

172
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,128
Patient's dad
had bypass surgery,

173
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,214
means she's a candidate
for atherosclerosis,

174
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,132
she needs an ultrasound.

175
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,218
That was much less convoluted
than what you just said.

176
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,424
I'm not giving you my keys.

177
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,929
If you want to do this,
I'm going.

178
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,472
Who can pick a lock?

179
00:09:56,597 --> 00:10:00,476
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't
steal any underwear.

180
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,150
You're a disgrace to your stereotype.
Move over.

181
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,403
Think you can pick
a lock faster than me?

182
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:11,737
No need to pick.

183
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,242
Nice.
Steal from your employees.

184
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,660
Never.

185
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:21,956
I had my dick make keys
when I hired him to dick up the team.

186
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,880
I always imagined she'd have
a sex swing in the living room.

187
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:30,965
Give me my key.

188
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,466
Don't have your key.

189
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,468
You expect me to believe
that you hired Lucas

190
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,429
to investigate everyone
except for me?

191
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:37,513
Waste of money.

192
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,057
I already know
everything about you.

193
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,476
Thirteen had her purse,
that's gotta be the patient's.

194
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,519
Check it for drugs.

195
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,938
I call shotgun on her bedroom.

196
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,942
You know that I stole a car
when I was a teenager.

197
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,653
You know that my mom
has Alzheimer's.

198
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,738
You know nothing else.

199
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,574
Want me to have you investigated?
When did you get so needy?

200
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,160
I'm not needy,
I just don't buy it.

201
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,204
You always want more
information about people.

202
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,625
Look where we are.
Purse is clean.

203
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,554
Last night wasn't the first time
that Thirteen brought home some strange.

204
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,848
- If you found her diary...
- No toys.

205
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,017
When you sleep with the same person
over and over,

206
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,477
that's when you need accessories.

207
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,813
First time is plenty exciting
on its own. Unless...

208
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,821
You think an asthma inhaler
could be used as a sex toy?

209
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,242
There are ways of getting to know people
without committing felonies.

210
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,828
People interest me.
Conversations don't.

211
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,039
Because conversations
go both ways.

212
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,251
- Like Thirteen.
- Like Thirteen.

213
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,839
Brown recluse,
found it at your apartment.

214
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,426
Their venom can cause seizures
and heart problems.

215
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,970
Unless the ultrasound
showed anything.

216
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:00,930
No.

217
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,264
What room did you find it in?

218
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,474
Bathroom.

219
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,851
Nice bidet, by the way.
Very refreshing.

220
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,269
I don't have a bidet.

221
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,354
Oh.

222
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:12,024
Spider's not the only interesting thing
I found.

223
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,117
Yeah, my inhaler
is fascinating.

224
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,869
It's got its own
extensive online following.

225
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,371
You have asthma?

226
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,497
When I was a kid.

227
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,749
It started acting up again
when I moved into my new place.

228
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,418
- You moved?
- Who cares?

229
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,295
He doesn't. He's just surprised
he didn't know.

230
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,090
You withhold things
other people would never bother to.

231
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,842
A move, a little wheeze,

232
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,095
whatever you thought was in my pocket
instead of your inhaler.

233
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,100
Maybe I should make a return trip
to your place.

234
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,660
A spider bite
doesn't explain anything

235
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,476
unless the patient
was actually bitten by a spider.

236
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,477
I'll do the exam.

237
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,688
Don't be ridiculous,
that'd be inappropriate.

238
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,273
It'd be better
if a woman gropes her.

239
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,650
There's no sexual
tension that way.

240
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,994
I need you to stand up
and take off your gown.

241
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,791
I think I would've felt
a spider biting me.

242
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,585
Not necessarily.

243
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,676
You really need those
after everything we did the other night?

244
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,928
The other night
I wasn't your doctor.

245
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,557
How long are you
going to stay mad at me?

246
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,517
How long are you
going to be here?

247
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,312
Okay, then.

248
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,774
Look,

249
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,530
I really had no intention
of ever seeing you again.

250
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:47,453
So, having me end up here
is a little less than ideal. I get it.

251
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,415
But we just met. How did you know
you didn't want to see me again?

252
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,544
It's nothing personal.

253
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,590
I'm just really not that
into repeat performances.

254
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,802
I figured I wasn't
the first girl you cruised.

255
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,639
Why is that?

256
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,141
You're awfully good at it.

257
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,771
You'd think with all that experience
that I'd be better than a seven.

258
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,817
We just met,
we were both drunk.

259
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,238
Not like
there wasn't potential.

260
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,202
A little more practice
for the both of us,

261
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:32,164
I'd say we're looking
at a nine, easy.

262
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,796
But that would require
a repeat performance.

263
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,300
You didn't have
to move your hand.

264
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,553
I didn't.

265
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:48,681
My hand's on your hip,
you don't feel that?

266
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,810
No. What does that mean?

267
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,311
It means it's not
a spider bite.

268
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,776
Blood test confirms
low potassium levels,

269
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,153
explains the numbness
in her hip.

270
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,363
It's not good,
but I think we've got time

271
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,689
for at least one or two comments
about my personal life.

272
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,702
Which you just wasted
with that comment about my comments.

273
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,997
Low potassium means her heart problem
is a symptom of a kidney problem.

274
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,373
What caused the kidney problem?

275
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,791
Could be lgA nephropathy.

276
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,293
Not without blood in the urine.

277
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,419
PSAGN?

278
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,296
Not with normal blood pressure.

279
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,172
Renal tubular acidosis?

280
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,008
Her kidneys don't filter
acid out of the blood,

281
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,469
excess acid drives down potassium,
causes kidney calcifications.

282
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:32,349
If it's RTA, all she needs
is sodium bicarbonate for the acid

283
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,936
and surgery to remove
the calcifications. CT her kidneys.

284
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,814
If you find calcifications,
we have our diagnosis.

285
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,280
What's he doing now?

286
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,366
Mmm-mmm. He's playing
that carjacking video game.

287
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,786
He'd get a lot farther
if he didn't stop at all the red lights.

288
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,248
Maybe he was doing something
he thinks I'll mock him for.

289
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,918
Like just about anything.

290
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,253
You don't think it's that.

291
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,547
I don't think it's
"just about anything"?

292
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,008
You don't think it's
about anything trivial.

293
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,093
If you weren't worried,
you wouldn't be sitting in my car.

294
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,512
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.

295
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,641
That does not look like
a pizza delivery.

296
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:17,770
Doesn't matter if it isn't,
Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.

297
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,315
Eight units in this building,

298
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,193
there's gotta be a pervert like me
living in at least one of them.

299
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,154
Yes, because you represent
one out of every eight people

300
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,447
living in this country.

301
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,995
Well, apparently, he has developed
a taste for pizza.

302
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,419
Things change.

303
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,383
CT shows one more calcification

304
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,386
near the superior pyramid
on the left kidney.

305
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,845
See it.

306
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,981
That thing you were hoping
House didn't find at your place.

307
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,693
I found it.

308
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,864
You did the CAG test
two weeks ago.

309
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,784
A number this high means
you have less time than you thought.

310
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,270
It's understandable
you'd be upset.

311
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,080
It doesn't mean
you have to self-destruct.

312
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,708
It's not noble for you
to protect me from House

313
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,667
if you're just going to judge.

314
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,794
There are things
you should be doing,

315
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,130
working out, improving balance
and coordination...

316
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,090
Yeah, that sounds like a blast.

317
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:33,095
I'm having fun, cramming
as much life into my life as I can.

318
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,223
You're doing drugs, staying up
all night, having sex with strangers.

319
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,933
It sounds fun to me.

320
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,436
Good night.

321
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,233
Close the incisions.

322
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,693
She won't even have a scar.

323
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,027
Her O2 sats are dropping.

324
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,033
Did you nick something?

325
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,823
The procedure was clean,
BP's strong.

326
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,075
Well, she's not breathing.
We need to intubate.

327
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:04,251
The breathing problem started
after we fixed her kidney problem,

328
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,378
means the RTA
isn't the underlying cause.

329
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,421
Where's Thirteen?

330
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,089
Traffic's bad,
she's probably just...

331
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,507
Not here.

332
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,178
It's not her lungs.
No masses, no infiltrates.

333
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,764
Her lungs are working,
but she still can't breathe.

334
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,557
Distribution plant
can't distribute

335
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,802
if it's not getting deliveries.
If her lungs are fine,

336
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,853
maybe the problem's in the supply line,
airway collapse.

337
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,229
That could signal autoimmune

338
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,356
or some kind of dystrophy
as the underlying cause.

339
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:30,611
There's only way to find out if
her airway failed. Make it happen again.

340
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:35,741
Stick Thirteen's carpet cleaner
on a treadmill, methacholine challenge.

341
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,659
And someone find the carpet.

342
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,255
Exam going on, 15 minutes.

343
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,843
Morning, Dr. Hadley.

344
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,099
Just spoke to my brother.

345
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,851
And by brother you mean...

346
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,478
I mean, my parents' other son.

347
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,605
Wow, same dad.

348
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,524
He got a call last week
from your Pl.

349
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,276
You lied.
You did have me investigated.

350
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,362
You've been taunting the team
with what you've learnt,

351
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,364
but you never came after me.

352
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,951
Means you couldn't find anything.

353
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,077
You're right.

354
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,378
That's because you haven't done
anything stupid,

355
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:33,549
spontaneous, or even vaguely interesting
since you were 17.

356
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,552
And that's just sad.

357
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,519
I found her in the clinic
giving herself IV fluids.

358
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,938
At least you could've let her finish.
She looks terrible.

359
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,440
She has a fresh nightclub stamp
on her wrist.

360
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,887
She's in no condition
to practice.

361
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,486
Unless this is a prelude
to an actual spanking,

362
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,612
there's no reason
for me to be...

363
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,155
I want her to take a drug test.

364
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,490
You can't make me do that.

365
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,742
But I can suspend you
until you do.

366
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,036
Because she went to a nightclub
in her free time?

367
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,539
Or because she had sex
in her free time?

368
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,958
The patient was undergoing
a routine surgery for RTA.

369
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,523
I didn't need
Thirteen here for that,

370
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,880
and I don't need you making my employees
punch a clock or pee in a cup.

371
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,716
Let's go. Come on.

372
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,014
Thank you.

373
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,186
By the way,
the surgery was not routine,

374
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:31,481
the patient stopped breathing,
and you missed a differential.

375
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,275
You're fired.

376
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,405
What? You just defended me.

377
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:43,243
No, I just prevented you from getting
a drug test, probably saved your career.

378
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,496
I'm already taking responsibility
for one doctor with a drug habit.

379
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,498
I don't have a drug habit.

380
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,043
The slutty party girl is fun

381
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:56,298
till she pukes on your shoes,
then she's just a pain in the ass.

382
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:16,318
I haven't sat on this couch
for four months. It remembers my cheeks.

383
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:19,988
I've missed this.

384
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,114
Me, too.

385
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,326
Me trying to work,
you interrupting.

386
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,913
Come on, your patients can wait
five minutes, get me caught up.

387
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,831
Come on.
What did you do? Travel?

388
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:33,502
Did you get a new hobby?
Did you meet someone?

389
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:40,175
Actually, yes, I sort of
started dating someone.

390
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,803
Great.

391
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:48,517
What does she do?
Is she an actress?

392
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,812
No. Why would you think that?

393
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:55,607
I just figured you'd want something
a little more exciting...

394
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,401
She's not...

395
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,781
You're gonna find out anyway
because you're gonna meet her.

396
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,327
She's a prostitute.

397
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:14,042
Used to be.
She made some mistakes.

398
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,878
Single mom,
had some drug issues,

399
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,425
but she's so smart.

400
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,262
She wants to go to law school,

401
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:29,766
and I told her
I'd help her with tuition.

402
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,437
How long have you known her?

403
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,480
I knew you'd be like this.

404
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,690
I asked a question.

405
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,568
House, you are a drug addict,

406
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,070
you go to prostitutes,
you can't be judgmental.

407
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,115
- And yet...
- Please, don't do this to me.

408
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,410
I was hurting,
and I wanted to feel good.

409
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,413
I didn't expect it
to go this way.

410
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:58,211
Amber said that she
wanted me to move on,

411
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:02,132
that she wanted me to be happy,

412
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:07,637
and Debbie makes me happy.

413
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,770
If you're happy, I'm...

414
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,575
I heard.

415
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,244
Yeah.
I'm looking for my ticket back.

416
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,165
I'm sorry if I upset you.
I didn't want to invade your privacy...

417
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,960
It wasn't your fault.
Can you get me caught up?

418
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,712
You think you're going to find
something we didn't?

419
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,298
It's good for the patient,
good for me.

420
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:46,259
Films are clean,
we ruled out hypertension,

421
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:50,263
the guys have her on a treadmill
running a methacholine challenge.

422
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,892
And I still think
you've been acting like an idiot.

423
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,896
I know. Did you talk about whether
this lung field looks a little dark?

424
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,314
It's probably just overexposed.

425
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,399
Or her diaphragm's
a little flat.

426
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,984
Could be a sign
of hyperinflation.

427
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,736
Suggests a pulmonary obstruction.

428
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,615
Lung cysts,
they wouldn't show up on an X-ray.

429
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,619
The treadmill test isn't gonna close her
airway, it'll make her lungs explode.

430
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,208
Her throat's fine.

431
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,085
We made her airway collapse,
but it's not collapsed.

432
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,130
You ruptured a cyst,
her lung collapsed.

433
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,799
Breath sounds on both sides.

434
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:26,758
Move.

435
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,597
Trachea's deviating
to the left.

436
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,607
Nice.

437
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,198
Chest CT confirmed
multiple lung cysts,

438
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,950
one of which burst
during the treadmill test.

439
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,676
Luckily, Thirteen
figured out the problem

440
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,287
and was there
to re-inflate her lung.

441
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,581
Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms,
could be amyloidosis,

442
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,875
which we can manage,
or pulmonary fibrosis, which...

443
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,376
Thank you.

444
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,004
My employees can take
care of it from here.

445
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,463
We need to biopsy the cysts.

446
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,965
You fired me
because I screwed up.

447
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,925
I just proved
I can pull my weight.

448
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,094
All you proved is you know
how to make an entrance.

449
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,013
House, she deserves another shot.

450
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,556
She found the cysts,
saved the patient...

451
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,921
Who wouldn't have needed saving

452
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,894
if Thirteen had shown up
to the differential in the first place.

453
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,562
Give her job back, House.

454
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,731
Or what? You're gonna quit?

455
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,358
Go do the biopsy.

456
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,238
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,995
How much clearer do
I need to make this?

458
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,883
What does it even mean,
dating a hooker?

459
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:53,011
He's an idiot
with a messiah complex,

460
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,763
savior to all who need saving.

461
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,765
That's why his first wife
had a wooden leg,

462
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,558
his second wife was Canadian.

463
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,269
He's the one
who needs to be saved.

464
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,395
From you or the ho?

465
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,940
The ho's just using him
for his money.

466
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,109
Wait, it was a bad example.

467
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,403
Normally, in these situations,
I'd follow the girl,

468
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,648
find out something embarrassing
about her to show him.

469
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:15,450
But since that's our
starting position...

470
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,827
We proceed directly
to the leg breaking.

471
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,830
I'm not breaking her legs,
she probably has a pimp,

472
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,207
or at least an older brother,

473
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,043
or younger brother,
or overprotective sister...

474
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,589
Find her. Find her family.
Find client number 9.

475
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,884
Just get me something I can use
to force her to back off.

476
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,845
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting, Mannix.

477
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,515
Here's the result
from the lung biopsy.

478
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,488
Why not men?

479
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,616
You're bisexual.

480
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,660
If you were just being
self-destructive,

481
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,537
you'd be having
random sex with men.

482
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,790
Better chance of getting assaulted,
catching a disease.

483
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,876
If this were just
about getting laid,

484
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:11,339
it'd be a lot easier
to pick up men or ugly girls.

485
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:16,594
This woman's hot, which means
you like the challenge, the conquest.

486
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,556
It's the control
that gets you off.

487
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,850
And controlling women is
as close as you can get

488
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,735
to controlling what's
going to happen to you.

489
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,395
Here I thought
I was just into boobs.

490
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,189
Instead of getting
sweaty with a stranger,

491
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,151
why don't you try
taking it to the next level?

492
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,694
Play God.

493
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,864
Tell a girl
that she's got 10 years to live.

494
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,658
She has LAM.

495
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,253
Okay-

496
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,713
This is not a test.

497
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,639
You're not getting
your job back if you can...

498
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,592
I know what it's like
to get this news,

499
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,303
and no one should
have to get it from you.

500
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,701
Hey.

501
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:32,003
The biopsy of your lung cyst
showed smooth muscle cells.

502
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,548
That's indicative
of a disease called LAM.

503
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,510
What do you do for that?

504
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,263
Surgery to remove the cysts,

505
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,726
but they'll come back.

506
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,522
Little by little,
the cysts replace healthy lung tissue

507
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,066
until your lungs stop working.

508
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,417
I'm going to die.

509
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,627
Yes.

510
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,387
I'm so sorry.

511
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,600
<i>They removed
all the cysts they could.</i>

512
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,125
<i>That should help
you breathe better.</i>

513
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,231
How long until
the cysts come back?

514
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,818
We don't know exactly.
I'm sorry.

515
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,156
Stop saying you're sorry.

516
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,245
I know you're scared.

517
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,750
I don't know what I feel.

518
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,053
You're going to be numb
for a few more days.

519
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,598
Then you'll go home
and cry for a few weeks.

520
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:14,189
And then you get angry, start telling
yourself nothing matters anymore.

521
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,401
You start doing stupid things.

522
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:22,071
Maybe you go out to bars
and pick up a bunch of women.

523
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,660
You're...

524
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,832
How long do you have?

525
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,962
Maybe a little more than you,
maybe a little less.

526
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,759
I'll race you.

527
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,733
I was thinking maybe
I'd come back later?

528
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,361
Sounds good.

529
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,582
Oh, God. What's going on?

530
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,336
All her blood counts are down.
It's a new symptom, aplastic anemia.

531
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:23,007
Does the word "fired" have some whole
other definition that I'm not aware of?

532
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,426
I don't work for you.
Fine, don't pay me.

533
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,470
Just let me finish
out this case.

534
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,138
So you like her
now that she's dying.

535
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,723
What happens
if she stops dying?

536
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,267
There's no danger
of that right now.

537
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,019
If we don't figure out what's wrong
with her, she's got days, not years.

538
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,021
Aplastic anemia
takes LAM off the table.

539
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,524
Unfortunately, none of our other choices
are any better.

540
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,277
PNH with some sort
of respiratory infection...

541
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,861
Best case gives her 12 years.

542
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,905
- Or fast-moving Langerhans.
- Few months.

543
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,242
Or mastocytosis, which can cause
systemic shock and kill her in days.

544
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,328
Go. Test for everything.
Not you.

545
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,040
You're just a visitor.

546
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,047
How's your patient?

547
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,341
She doesn't have Langerhans.

548
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:06,384
That's good.

549
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,554
Actually, a cancer diagnosis
would be good news right now.

550
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:16,644
Do you think I'm boring?

551
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,606
Yes.

552
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,067
You're saying that
just to screw with me.

553
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,779
Yeah. Why would you
expect anything else?

554
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,032
I expect House
to pull my strings,

555
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,908
I expect Cameron
to make me feel better,

556
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,994
I expect the new team
to kiss my ass,

557
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,164
and I expect you to be honest
'cause you don't give a crap.

558
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,712
Yes, you're boring.
That speech was boring.

559
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,130
Thanks so much.

560
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,382
You don't let
other people's problems affect you.

561
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,301
You don't let
your own problems affect you.

562
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:50,970
And it's the screw-ups
that make us interesting.

563
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:56,100
You're never out of control,
which is good and boring.

564
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,270
Never losing control also means
you're never putting yourself out there,

565
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,147
never pushing your limits.

566
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,859
On the other hand, you do have a tattoo,
so maybe I'm wrong.

567
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,453
I'm glad you're here.

568
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,022
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

569
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,607
Test results are back?
What's she positive for?

570
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,110
Nothing.
But we've got a donor match.

571
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,112
Jumping to a transplant
when we don't know what she...

572
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,156
I know she has
a blood disorder.

573
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:36,159
Could be PNH.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

574
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,164
Or leukemia.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

575
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,412
Or thalassemia.
She needs a bone marrow...

576
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:40,496
Yeah, I get it.

577
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,458
But she'll never survive
total body irradiation.

578
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,126
So we don't radiate her.

579
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,589
Her marrow's nearly wiped out already,
count is almost zero.

580
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,300
"Almost" being the key word. The new
marrow would attack the old marrow.

581
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,051
She'll die
from graft-versus-host.

582
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,553
You got a better idea?

583
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,058
She trusts you.
Go get her consent.

584
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,247
Sometimes I find out things
you'd rather not know.

585
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,250
This was in his trash.

586
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,086
He's using.

587
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:39,806
You're back.

588
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,267
Genius.

589
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:48,397
Damn, I knew the fake works
was too much.

590
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,441
Well, you had no choice.

591
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,486
Where were you gonna go
after fake-hooker-girlfriend?

592
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,656
How did you know
he was outside?

593
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,574
Cane prints.

594
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,910
I'm actually kind of insulted.
No way I'm a drug addict

595
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:04,956
but you completely buy
that I fell in love with a prostitute?

596
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,749
You played to your strengths.

597
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,252
By which I mean
you played to your weaknesses.

598
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,006
Oh, my God.

599
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:19,220
You invoked your dead girlfriend's name
to sell me.

600
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,098
You're my hero.

601
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,433
Best $30 I ever spent.

602
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,561
Thirty?
Did you keep her number?

603
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,814
Unfortunately, I killed her
and buried her in the basement.

604
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,191
Shame. Hungry?

605
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,151
Yeah.

606
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,616
So, seriously,
where were you the other morning?

607
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:43,202
Oh, don't make me
do this again.

608
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,580
It has nothing to do with you.

609
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:46,539
Then tell me.

610
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,040
We're going bowling on Monday.

611
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,252
I'm coming over to play poker
this weekend. Nothing's changed.

612
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,004
You have to trust that.

613
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:56,299
Okay-

614
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:05,266
You're gonna keep following me,
aren't you?

615
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,351
It's what we do.

616
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,773
Be outside my apartment
at 8:00 tonight.

617
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,241
She said yes to the transplant.

618
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,784
Good.

619
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,956
You're in a downward spiral
of destruction.

620
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,499
I can stop.

621
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,586
You're gonna keep spiralling,
keep screwing around,

622
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:35,751
keep slashing away
at every person who tries to help

623
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,758
until no one
tries to help anymore,

624
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,052
until you hit bottom,
until you're dead.

625
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,517
But until then, I can use you.

626
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,690
You're hiring me back?

627
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,361
You did good work.

628
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:10,331
I did good work yesterday,
and I was still fired. What changed?

629
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:18,339
You wanted me
to spend time with her,

630
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,008
see if I could still
make a connection.

631
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,136
You connected with the diagnosis,
not with her.

632
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,973
You're trying to save me,
trying to control me.

633
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,058
You're doing exactly
what you think I'm...

634
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,393
Cracks.

635
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,355
Your lips are cracked.

636
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,444
Been using your inhaler lately?

637
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,156
Allergies.
Don't deflect, you always deflect.

638
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,158
Did she cry?

639
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,497
When you told her
that she was going to die, did she cry?

640
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,000
She got upset, she...

641
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,085
Were there tears?

642
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,422
No.

643
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,763
Chopping an onion
releases a mist

644
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,558
of syn-propanethial-S-oxide.

645
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:16,522
A chemical irritant which causes people
to have a very predictable reaction.

646
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,274
She has no tears.

647
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,194
It was either this
or put on <i>Brian's</i> Song,

648
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,999
but I didn't have time
to stop by Wilson's.

649
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:30,745
She has Sjogren's, that attacks the
glands that produce tears and saliva.

650
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,957
It also, by the way,
causes lung cysts and RTA.

651
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,584
It doesn't cause bleeding.

652
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,335
It's like you and men.

653
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,713
Just because you usually don't
doesn't mean you can't.

654
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:43,632
And it doesn't cause cracked lips
in other people.

655
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:48,262
Lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding
ground for a fungus like Candida.

656
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,556
Her asthma inhaler
did the same for you,

657
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:53,476
wiped out
your mouth's immune system.

658
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,811
So, she's got what I've got.

659
00:39:57,146 --> 00:40:00,649
Just the opportunistic infection,
not the underlying condition.

660
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,072
Another life saved
by girl-on-girl action.

661
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:16,874
I'm gonna be okay?

662
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:21,462
You're gonna be okay.

663
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:25,633
Methylprednisolone to get
the Sjogren's under control,

664
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:30,513
and some artificial tears to maximize
the visual impact of this moment.

665
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,194
Spencer's gonna be fine,

666
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,490
and I hear
you got your job back.

667
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,039
I'm gonna keep standing here
until you say something.

668
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,175
I feel alone,

669
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,682
and she hasn't gone anywhere.

670
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,728
She gets to live.

671
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:31,323
I'm gonna go home. I'm tired.

672
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,632
What do you think?

673
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,097
Oh, my God.

674
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:59,643
You guys shop here, too?
Best nipples in Princeton.

675
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,562
Why are you here?

676
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,856
Because he ate the donut.

677
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,443
I'm so sorry.
He must have followed me.

678
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:08,777
I'm sure.

679
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:10,487
You're clearly not pregnant.

680
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,573
So either
you're buying this as a gift

681
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:16,619
or this is some kind of weird "if you
build it, they will come" moment.

682
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,495
I'm adopting a baby.

683
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,372
She asked me
to be a character reference.

684
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,124
That's where I was
