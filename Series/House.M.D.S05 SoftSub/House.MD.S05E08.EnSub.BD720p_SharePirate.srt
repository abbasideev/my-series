1
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:05,131
We're starting a fund.

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,341
Then you don't need me.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:09,594
- The man's injured, can't work.
- His fault.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,767
We're family,
we depend on each other.

5
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:19,229
We're not family,
we're co-workers.

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:21,272
He's not even that any more.

7
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,066
I can't believe
you just said that.

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,860
Can't come between a man
and his beer money.

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,278
See the big heavy machinery?

10
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,782
I'm sorry, but he should give.
You gave.

11
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,493
Go back to work.

12
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,373
Paolo is the one
who got you off the night shift.

13
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,542
It's not like I asked him.

14
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,382
Also covered for you
Labor Day weekend.

15
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,928
But, hey, it's America,
if you don't want to contribute...

16
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,931
If you don't want to...

17
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,496
Oh, gosh.

18
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,960
Get an ambulance.

19
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,922
- Morning.
- Don't want to hear it.

20
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,883
So, I take it you
did not ask Cuddy out.

21
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:12,842
Yeah.

22
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,260
"Yeah" I didn't
or "Yeah" I did?

23
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,514
Whichever one means you almost
had me convinced it was a good idea.

24
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,765
Oh.

25
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,230
- Nothing to say?
- No.

26
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,398
"No" you don't
or "No" you don't don't.

27
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,566
Whichever one means no.

28
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:32,779
- Is this some kind of a reverse...
- No.

29
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,907
House?

30
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,962
Sixteen-year-old girl
with fluid in her lungs.

31
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,172
No previous trauma,
lung or cardiac issues.

32
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,550
Gram stain was negative,
no bacteria, no pneumonia.

33
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,596
She's a factory worker,

34
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,720
means she probably works close
to a lot of recent immigrants.

35
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,224
Thank God some of those
offshore sweatshop jobs

36
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,809
are coming back to America.

37
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,769
She's an emancipated minor.

38
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,271
In a factory?

39
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,774
Either an Olympic gymnast
who busted her leg,

40
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:13,194
a child star who blew
all her sequel money on drugs,

41
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,779
or she's just a lying runaway.

42
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,490
Her parents died last year.
No relatives.

43
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,577
To avoid foster care,
she got a GED and got emancipated.

44
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,453
Could have picked up
a parasite from a co-worker.

45
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,123
She'd be having GI problems.
Pregnancy's more likely.

46
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,209
Sparks a fluid overload, hits the lungs,
causes the pulmonary edema.

47
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,014
Her history says
she's not sexually active.

48
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,213
And our history says
she could be lying.

49
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,382
But not every teenager
is having sex.

50
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,175
But every teenager is stupid.

51
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,177
Teenagers on their own
are stupider.

52
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,847
The girl's holding down a job,
makes her rent.

53
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,349
On the one hand,
Kutner's right,

54
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:47,437
maybe she's a sweet young thing who's
not a screw-up lying through her teeth.

55
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:50,440
On the two hand,
pregnancy test only takes five minutes,

56
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,983
and we no longer kill rabbits,

57
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:55,445
so, in conclusion, shut up,
do the test. What else?

58
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,738
Drugs could damage the heart.

59
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,907
Pressure imbalance allows fluid
to build up in the lungs.

60
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,074
Tox screen's clean.

61
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,536
For drugs used recently,
not for drugs used before recently.

62
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,497
Sixteen doesn't automatically mean
a risky lifestyle.

63
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,957
Didn't we just
have this conversation?

64
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:12,921
Kutner trusts her, someone else doesn't.
So, in conclusion, shut up,

65
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,298
check her home and work
for toxins or drugs.

66
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,133
Kutner and Foreman, do an echo,

67
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,302
find the extent
of the heart damage.

68
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,604
Kutner can do the echo
on his own.

69
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,190
Yes, but he'll be very lonely,

70
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,778
so I have to ask why.

71
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,198
I've been asked to help
run a clinical trial.

72
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,575
That okay with you?

73
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:47,872
Good for your career, great for
your street cred. What's in it for me?

74
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,000
You have four doctors
and never more than one case.

75
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,044
Means I have time
to work on other things,

76
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,547
and they all have more chances
to step up, stand on their own.

77
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:59,759
And if there is
an emergency with Annie,

78
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,886
should she wait
until you finish grooming lab rats?

79
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,388
If there's a problem
with Sophia,

80
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,682
or any other patient,
you know I'll be there.

81
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,433
Your patient is my priority.

82
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,603
No.

83
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,734
What? You want a reason?

84
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,862
Clinical trials take time,
your time is my time.

85
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,335
I told you, I don't do drugs.

86
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,045
Still a good idea
to check your heart.

87
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,131
Something else
could've damaged it.

88
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,258
You find it hard,
being all on your own?

89
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,968
Having to do
everything without...

90
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,386
Drugs to ease my pain?

91
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,055
- That's not...
- A teenager on her own,

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,557
I wouldn't trust me either.

93
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,517
I meant it must be hard.

94
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,479
No one there to back you up.

95
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,947
I know you're trying to be nice,
but I'm not into the whole pity thing.

96
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,444
I was actually doing
the "I get it" thing.

97
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,155
I lost my parents
when I was six.

98
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,826
It doesn't go away, but it gets easier.
You learn to deal.

99
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,708
I still get nervous
when there's a knock on the door.

100
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:18,379
Always think it's the state trooper
with more bad news.

101
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:22,717
You already got the worst news
and survived. That's sort of the upside.

102
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,890
Your heart's healthy.

103
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,059
Isn't that good news?

104
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,354
For your heart, yeah, but it also means
we still don't know what's wrong.

105
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,862
Check book balanced,
place spotless,

106
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,739
looks like she builds
her own furniture.

107
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,949
If you're this grown-up at 16,
what happens at 30?

108
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,827
You turn back into a kid,
like Kutner.

109
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,162
Kutner's not that bad.

110
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:55,500
He needs everything to be nice,
wants to see the best in everyone.

111
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,503
- Kitchen's clear.
- Yeah, friendly is a dangerous thing.

112
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,421
There is such a thing
as too trusting.

113
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,591
Corollary is there's such a thing
as not trusting enough.

114
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:07,345
Too much, you get hurt.
Not enough, you don't live.

115
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,015
So, the object in life is to get hurt
just the right amount?

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,520
Excuse me if I don't go out of my way
to take relationship advice from you.

117
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:19,440
And trust should be earned.

118
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,116
Bong means nothing,
drugs are irrelevant.

119
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,534
Relevant if she's taking them.

120
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,662
Even if she is, irrelevant.
Echo showed no heart damage.

121
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,707
Would that be the echo
that Foreman chose not to run with you

122
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,294
after I dashed
his new drug discovery dreams?

123
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,547
You mad at me because you think
Kutner screwed up the echo?

124
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:43,548
I didn't screw up the echo.

125
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,259
I know.
No structural heart damage.

126
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,803
- So, if it's not the heart...
- It's the heart.

127
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,263
Didn't you just say it's not?

128
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,557
Not all heart damage
has to be structural.

129
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,143
Drugs could have caused
intermittent tachycardia.

130
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,549
Irregular heartbeat
would account for the pulmonary edema.

131
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,522
Edema was acute,
vasculitis makes more sense.

132
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,815
There's no sign
in her blood work,

133
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,621
and if she had vasculitis, she'd be
too weak to work in the factory.

134
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,813
She builds her own furniture,
you think she skips work

135
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,948
'cause she's feeling a little weak?
She needs steroids.

136
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,992
Steroids could cause
an irregular heartbeat,

137
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,578
making her current
one irregular-er.

138
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,998
Foreman,
start her on beta-blockers.

139
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,835
Rest of you, do anything that isn't
starting her on beta-blockers.

140
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,843
Start her on the treatment.
Page me if you need me.

141
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,268
Irregular heartbeat causes blood to back
up behind the heart and into the lungs.

142
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,228
The beta-blockers keep
this from happening.

143
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,073
I thought the test showed
my heart was fine.

144
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,232
It's tricky.
An arrhythmia can come and go.

145
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,736
So, you don't believe
me or the test.

146
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,489
You guys are more cynical
than I am.

147
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,076
We found the bong
in your apartment.

148
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,162
You went into my apartment?

149
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,830
Extended drug use can damage...

150
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,209
The bong belongs to my ex.
It's why he's ex.

151
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,336
That doesn't mean
you didn't use it.

152
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,046
No.

153
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,965
You have no reason to trust me.

154
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,802
You have to do your treatment.

155
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,975
The other possibility is
you have vasculitis.

156
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,602
The treatment
for that is steroids.

157
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,008
If you've been using drugs,
if they've damaged your heart,

158
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,024
and I start you on steroids,
they could kill you.

159
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,528
I haven't used drugs.

160
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,411
I'll get the steroids.

161
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,129
Why are you here?

162
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,382
- I owe clinic hours.
- No, you don't.

163
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,176
I'm here because House
doesn't want me to be here.

164
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,845
I'm guessing he said no
to the clinical trials.

165
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,598
He didn't need to say no,
he just wanted to say no.

166
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,142
House did something solely
out of self-interest?

167
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,644
Freaky.

168
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,105
- Don't suppose you want to override...
- No.

169
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,483
What do you think
this is going to prove?

170
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,444
Does it matter? Just figured
you could use some help down here.

171
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,197
And you spending two hours wiping noses
will annoy House.

172
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,408
If that is your dream,
God bless.

173
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,078
If you want to prove
you can do his job and something more...

174
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,838
His puke is red.
That's blood, right?

175
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,134
That hurt?

176
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,012
How about that?

177
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,973
Four days he's been like this.
It's just getting worse.

178
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,474
Maybe he just needs to poop.

179
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,435
- Evan.
- What?

180
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,562
Worked last time
I had a stomach ache.

181
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,147
That's actually a smart idea,

182
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,816
which is why that's the first thing
the other doctors checked.

183
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,693
His insides are clear.

184
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,362
- Anyone else sick at day-care?
- No.

185
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,031
- How about his friends?
- No. No one.

186
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:57,742
- What's happening to him?
- Not sure yet.

187
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,745
Don't worry, I've got an idea.

188
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,207
You can make him better, right?

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,793
That's my plan.

190
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,503
You need to make him better.

191
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,719
Stay the hell away from me.

192
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,220
Just calm down.

193
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,180
What happened?

194
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,848
I adjusted her IV,
and she went crazy.

195
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,350
Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

196
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,517
Sophia, it's okay,
we're here to help you.

197
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,977
Just stay away from me!

198
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,729
Don't touch me!

199
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:32,610
I said don't...
Get your hands off of me.

200
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,736
Get your hands...

201
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,113
Beta-blockers don't
cause psychotic breaks.

202
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,574
She's not on beta-blockers.

203
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,460
<i>We started her on
haloperidol, she's stable.</i>

204
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,254
Lab tests show the delirium
wasn't caused by a metabolic problem.

205
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,547
Means we still don't know
what caused it.

206
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,800
Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman.

207
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,967
I didn't switch her meds.

208
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,553
But your decision
to stick it to the man

209
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,889
clearly inspired Oliver Twist.

210
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,058
I treated her based on
the symptoms she presented.

211
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,352
You treated her based on
empathetic orphan syndrome,

212
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,270
and almost killed her
in the process.

213
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,315
She wasn't on steroids long enough
for it to cause the delirium.

214
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,776
- It's a new symptom.
- One that rules out vasculitis.

215
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,113
And arrhythmia. The psychotic break
caused a surge of adrenaline,

216
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:20,658
but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's
not the problem. We're both wrong.

217
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,038
So, what causes
lung issues and delirium

218
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,417
and is not based on wishful thinking
that she's safe and happy?

219
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:32,294
Prinzmetal angina.

220
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:39,135
Silent and unhappy
is better than vocal and unhelpful.

221
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,137
If you'd run the echo
that you didn't run

222
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,347
before giving her the beta-blockers
that you didn't give her,

223
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,765
if you'd listened to
what Kutner said,

224
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,933
you'd know it's
not a heart problem.

225
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,144
I'm not talking about her heart,
I'm talking about her head.

226
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,630
Prinzmetal angina
doesn't affect...

227
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,731
No reason it couldn't cause
an artery in the brain to spasm.

228
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,192
Leads to the delirium
and the pulmonary edema.

229
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,283
Foreman, give her Ergonovine
to cause vasospasms

230
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,535
and run an fMRI to see
which artery's dancing.

231
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,745
And when I say Foreman,
I mean Foreman.

232
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:10,166
I want his signature on the paperwork.
I want videotape.

233
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,711
I want photographs of him
with the patient and today's newspaper.

234
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,131
Set her up.
When you're ready...

235
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,466
House wants you...

236
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:22,428
To do the procedure.
When you get everything set up, page me.

237
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,191
- That's really a camera?
- Pretty cool, huh?

238
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,735
This can go places
the other scopes can't.

239
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,654
Jonah, I need you
to swallow this pill.

240
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,908
- Don't wanna.
- It doesn't hurt, promise.

241
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,497
Jonah, please,
this will help make you better.

242
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,793
I don't want to be mean, but if you
don't do this, we'll have to make you.

243
00:13:55,628 --> 00:14:00,341
It's a power pill. It's not just
a camera, it makes your muscles grow.

244
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,138
Like the vitamins we take, except
this was made with a secret formula.

245
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:19,818
You did great, sweetheart.
You're very brave.

246
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:24,949
Jonah's lucky. I was pretty cruel to
my little brother when I was your age.

247
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,617
Why?

248
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,162
I guess I thought it's what big brothers
did. Obviously, I was wrong.

249
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,916
Is he a doctor, too?

250
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,167
No.

251
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,756
Does the pill tickle, sweetie?

252
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,926
He can't feel it.
What's funny? Your brother?

253
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,726
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

254
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,857
How are you guys getting along?

255
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,819
And you suddenly care why?

256
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,384
House was asking
questions last week.

257
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,446
I assume Foreman needs us,

258
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,824
and he's worried that if we're sniping,
we might be distracted.

259
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,535
- That's kind of insulting, isn't it?
- Very.

260
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,120
You're obviously fine.

261
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,916
I need a differential
for uncontrollable giggling.

262
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,002
He's four, they laugh.

263
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,797
Yeah, nothing like diarrhea
and bloody vomit

264
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,632
to put you in the mood to goof around.

265
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,397
I've looked down one end
and up the other.

266
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,345
All the tests came back clean.
Can't figure this out.

267
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,890
You can't? Don't you work with
three other doctors and a grouchy gimp?

268
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,020
This isn't House's case.

269
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,403
Just so you know, whatever you're
trying to prove, it won't be enough.

270
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,865
Gotta go.

271
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,584
Sorry.

272
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,502
You didn't miss much.
No spasms yet.

273
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,631
Nothing in the anterior
or posterior cerebral arteries.

274
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,507
<i>How much longer?</i>

275
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,176
Just a few more minutes.

276
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,887
Were your foster homes all around here,
or did you have to change schools?

277
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,349
Is chatting about lousy foster parents
supposed to relax me?

278
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,018
Left middle cerebral artery
looks good.

279
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,686
My foster parents were great.

280
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,132
I think most foster parents do it

281
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,814
because they want to do
something decent.

282
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,567
Which is why
you didn't get emancipated.

283
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,738
Nothing around the vertebral artery.
No sign of spasms.

284
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,073
But that's odd.

285
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,660
How'd you find out
about your parents?

286
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,787
Told you. State trooper.

287
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,747
Look at that.

288
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,208
Arteries are fine.
You can stop.

289
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,001
Not that.

290
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,755
I forget. Did he come to your house,
or call you down to the station?

291
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,717
Came to my house. I cried
into the guy's shirt for an hour.

292
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,345
Wow.

293
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,724
FMRis tell us
where the blood flow is.

294
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,351
You were using
your limbic region.

295
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,269
Lights up when we use our imagination,

296
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:01,480
doesn't light up
when we're telling the truth.

297
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,441
Your parents aren't dead,
are they?

298
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,737
I risked my job,
put you on a different treatment.

299
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,983
I didn't lie about the drugs.

300
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:10,906
Then why lie
about your parents?

301
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,826
Because I wish they were dead.

302
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,080
I got emancipated
because my dad raped me,

303
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,917
and my mom pretended
it didn't happen.

304
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,636
No signs of spasm,
impeded blood flow,

305
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,055
or brain dysfunction.
It's not Prinzmetal's.

306
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,559
All the fMRI showed is House was right.
She was lying.

307
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,230
Only relevant if it could cause
pulmonary edema and delirium.

308
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,024
We find out our patient's been raped,
and that's your response?

309
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,526
Is she a psych patient?

310
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,945
Rape could mean STD.

311
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,948
Thank goodness,
one of you doesn't have a heart.

312
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,744
Maybe if we all stop wringing our hands,
we could solve this thing

313
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,746
and let her live to have
a few more nightmares.

314
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,875
Gonococcal endocarditis would explain
the pulmonary edema, the delirium.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,752
No sign in her blood work.

316
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,088
Could be lying about the rape.

317
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,469
Yesterday, you were all BFF,
now you think she's pathological.

318
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,155
Yesterday,
I had no reason to doubt her.

319
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,638
If she'd been honest
with us from the beginning...

320
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:20,267
She lied about dead parents
because it's better than rapist parents.

321
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,643
You find that unsympathetic?

322
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,603
That's it.

323
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:23,562
What's it?

324
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,523
Her whole life's a mess.
What rhymes with mess?

325
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:31,445
It's not stress. She has
none of the usual manifestations.

326
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,280
No hormone imbalance,
no cardiac...

327
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,725
Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs,
and she's delirious.

328
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,367
She's a picture
of emotional health.

329
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,662
Severe emotional stress can lead
to asymmetric function of the mid-brain.

330
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,164
Explains the delirium.

331
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,959
Interruption in the brain-heart coupling
could cause pulmonary edema.

332
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,630
Even if House is wrong, the treatment's
basically anti-anxiety meds.

333
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,632
Hard to argue with.

334
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,468
Yes, I agree,
it does explain everything.

335
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:59,014
Thirteen, load her up on diazepam.
Foreman, make sure she does it.

336
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,892
Thirteen,
make sure he makes sure.

337
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,649
I went to Cuddy's house.

338
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,860
But I didn't go in.

339
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:17,324
Went home without ringing
either her metaphorical or actual bell.

340
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,076
Huh.

341
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,454
You're processing.

342
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,206
I'm scrubbing.

343
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,083
"Huh" means processing.

344
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,585
"Huh" means acknowledging.

345
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,839
If you prefer,
I could say "hah" or "hmm" or...

346
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,049
No insights? No opinions?

347
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,345
- You're disappointed.
- You made a decision.

348
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,389
I can't tell you
what's right for you.

349
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,600
Seriously?
Because last week you could.

350
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,228
Last year, you could.
Seems to come pretty easy to you.

351
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,939
Do you want me to tell you
what you should do?

352
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,732
I want you to stop thinking

353
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:54,236
that acting inscrutable
makes you anything other than annoying.

354
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,448
Interesting.

355
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,872
Holding things in
can give you cancer.

356
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,417
Kid's in day-care,
could be meningitis.

357
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,419
No fever,
no stiffness, no rash.

358
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,587
You check his thyroid?

359
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,922
TSH, T3, T4 were within range.

360
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,327
Ruled out all
the usual suspects.

361
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,662
Nothing's usual
for a 4-year-old.

362
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,878
And as fun as this is,
it feels like we're your goomah.

363
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,387
Your feelings are hurt?

364
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,014
Either you can handle
both these cases or you can't.

365
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,891
If you can't,
it's dangerous and stupid.

366
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:27,769
On the other hand,
stomach cancer, leiomyosarcoma.

367
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,315
Long shot. Altered mental status
means porphyria's more likely.

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,027
No abdominal pain. Cancer explains
the lethargy, the GI symptoms.

369
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,778
Neither is perfect.

370
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,655
Then we test for both.

371
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,491
And by "we" you mean
the collective, not you?

372
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,202
Thanks.

373
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,373
Severe stress scrambles the way

374
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,709
the brain communicates
with the rest of the body.

375
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,336
I have a problem with my brain?

376
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:56,006
Not exactly. The problem would be
with your body chemistry.

377
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,466
Where's Dr. Kutner?

378
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,676
There's four of us,
it's my turn.

379
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,598
I'm sorry I lied
about my parents.

380
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,061
You did what you thought you had to do
to protect yourself.

381
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:13,190
If we're right, we should see a change
in your lungs pretty fast.

382
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,901
Then we can figure out
how to manage your stress.

383
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:20,113
It might help to turn him in,
file a police report. Get closure.

384
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,490
Won't help.

385
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,285
Not addressing what happened
won't make it go away.

386
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,498
Yeah? What do I have to do
to make it go away?

387
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,304
I didn't mean that.
I just mean that you...

388
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,379
I addressed it.
I got away from him.

389
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,841
Reporting it just labels me
"girl raped by dad."

390
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,843
It doesn't have to define you.

391
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,512
It's how you see me.

392
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,932
It's why you're treating me
with tranquillizers.

393
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,725
Not any more.

394
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,270
Stress wouldn't change
your urine color.

395
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,824
Labs show the brown urine
was caused by shredded red cells.

396
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,203
So, what messes with her lungs,
her mental status,

397
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,497
and runs her blood
through a wood chipper?

398
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,463
Factory lunch rooms
aren't the cleanest places.

399
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,709
Could have picked up E. Coli.

400
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,085
Or Shigella, from the restroom.

401
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,004
Either would account
for the red cells, the delirium.

402
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,424
But not the original lung symptoms.
Legionnaire's could and cause delirium.

403
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:21,675
No, her sodium's normal.

404
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,927
What did her furniture
look like?

405
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,600
You said it was homemade.
Old boxes, what?

406
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,020
It was wood, nailed together.

407
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,522
The wood have
little dents or holes?

408
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,967
I didn't see any on the bookshelves,
but they were painted.

409
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,153
The desk did. Looked like
she'd stapled stuff all over it.

410
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,447
Holes means that
it was pressure treated.

411
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,201
Sawing or burning it releases
arsenic into the air and into her lungs.

412
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,536
Tests didn't show...

413
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,913
'Cause it found a cloak
of invisibility hiding...

414
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,915
Arsenic gets absorbed
in the internal organs

415
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,333
so it doesn't show up
on the blood test.

416
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:59,004
Test her hair. If it's positive,
chelate it out of her blood.

417
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,181
<i>No cancer, no porphyria.</i>

418
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,475
You paged me
with negative test results?

419
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,685
Yes, because it means
we're done.

420
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,187
Since we still don't know
what's wrong,

421
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,439
this kid has a real problem.

422
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,900
- Talk to House?
- Not his case.

423
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,698
There's a point
when Cameron and I aren't enough.

424
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,991
We're not there.

425
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,412
We need to run some more tests.

426
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,293
A week ago, he was a happy little boy,
playing with his brother,

427
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,337
and now he can
barely lift his head.

428
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,630
We'll figure this out.
I just need...

429
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,091
Mom. Help.

430
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,676
We need a crash cart.

431
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,148
- What's going on?
- He's in cardiac arrest.

432
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,765
Get them out of here.

433
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,611
- Clear.
- Nothing. Go again.

434
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:08,198
- Clear.
- He's back.

435
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,621
Foreman, we're there.

436
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,343
Chelation's complete.
You're arsenic-free.

437
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,262
So, I can get out of here?

438
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,930
In the morning.

439
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:39,354
That's it? No advice?
No, "Be careful out there, kiddo"?

440
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,482
You want my advice?

441
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,777
Want is one thing,
expect is another.

442
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,741
I wish I could
tell you what to do.

443
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,371
But you're strong. You've made
good choices. You'll be fine.

444
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,416
Thanks.

445
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,388
Need four milligrams
of Lorazepam.

446
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,067
After the seizure,
we ran a new MRI.

447
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:32,449
This is Sophia's brain three days ago,
this is her brain today.

448
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,744
Lesions.

449
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,205
Magical lesions,
which appear out of nowhere.

450
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,917
She was cured, then she wasn't.

451
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,793
Lesions grew
too fast for cancer.

452
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,545
Could be infection, MRSA.

453
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,756
WBC count would be
through the roof.

454
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,341
Put the arsenic back.

455
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,801
You wanna treat a patient
nearly poisoned to death

456
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,386
by giving her more poison?

457
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,598
Just because we call something a poison
doesn't mean it's bad for you.

458
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:57,891
It was killing her.

459
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,144
But since she's still dying, the
arsenic, obviously, wasn't killing her.

460
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,270
And since she's now getting worse,

461
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,523
the arsenic was obviously
fighting the killer.

462
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,486
It's a hero.
We should be organizing a parade.

463
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,906
So, what does arsenic treat?

464
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,742
Syphilis. Before penicillin,
the treatment was arsenic.

465
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,994
We already ruled out STDs,
and even if we were wrong,

466
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,039
that much arsenic in her system
would have wiped out the syphilis.

467
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,833
Acute promyelocytic leukemia
is still treated with arsenic.

468
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:28,838
APL explains the lesions and why they
appeared after we took the arsenic out.

469
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,258
So, put the arsenic back.

470
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,761
We still have a problem. Arsenic
slows leukemia, but it can't cure it.

471
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,639
If she wants to see 17, she's gonna
need a bone marrow transplant.

472
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,517
The best match would be
a sibling or a parent.

473
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:45,939
Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's
dying, and load her up with arsenic.

474
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,108
Keep her alive till
you can convince her that

475
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,735
rapist marrow
and rapist-enabling marrow

476
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,113
work just as well
as the unleaded stuff.

477
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,076
We need to talk.

478
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,454
This about the case
you didn't want me to know about?

479
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,665
- Cuddy?
- Foreman.

480
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,459
You didn't flinch
when you found out about

481
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,838
a 16-year-old who could be
dying in the next few days.

482
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:13,550
Means you're here about
someone even younger, dying even faster.

483
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,886
- He needs you.
- But he has you.

484
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,061
This boy is going to die.
You selfish enough to let it happen?

485
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:28,064
- Pot calling a kettle a pot?
- You're a hypocrite.

486
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:31,484
If our job is to find out what's
killing patients, you'd help this kid.

487
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,403
But you'd rather play mind games
to prove

488
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,089
you're the only one
with magical powers.

489
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,532
You wanted something all your own,
now you got it.

490
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,827
Your disengagement won't work.

491
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:42,287
I can see that.

492
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,913
You think that when you tell me
what I should do,

493
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,332
my instincts are to push back,

494
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,537
so that by not telling me
what you think I should do,

495
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,002
I'll do what
you think I should do.

496
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,337
I sound convoluted.

497
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,256
Disengagement is neither
artful, nor effective.

498
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,968
So, my not doing anything
isn't causing you to do anything.

499
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,470
Right.

500
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm okay with that.

501
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,639
No, you're not.

502
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:05,352
You are designed to have opinions
and to force them on people.

503
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:08,188
I'm starting to
sound desperate.

504
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,649
Don't screw with my stuff.

505
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,657
I just need a donor with
the same blood type or something, right?

506
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,619
Actually, bone marrow's
a little more complex.

507
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,996
The best donors
are immediate family.

508
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,792
But those donor banks
have thousands of names.

509
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,086
Your parents' similar DNA

510
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:33,296
- gives you a much better chance...
- No.

511
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,757
If I do this,

512
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,386
I'll owe my life to them.

513
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,641
It would mean everything else
that happened was somehow okay.

514
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,060
They don't deserve that.

515
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,188
They're not in my life.

516
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,525
If that means I'm dead,
then I'm dead.

517
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,865
I have Huntington's disease.

518
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,119
I'm dying-

519
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:09,499
I don't know when it will happen,
but it'll be sooner than I ever planned,

520
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:12,252
and I'd do anything to stop it.

521
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,047
Because the only way
to make anything right,

522
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,133
the only way
to make your life matter,

523
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:23,763
is to live as long
and as well as you possibly can.

524
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,604
Have you ever been raped?

525
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,817
No.

526
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,655
Don't try to walk in my shoes,
and I won't try to walk in yours.

527
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,746
You had no right.

528
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,039
To try to convince her
to do the right thing?

529
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,124
To lie to her.

530
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,917
It's a true story.
Who cares if it's not my story?

531
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,878
- It's my life.
- It's her life.

532
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,422
The point wasn't I'm dying,
the point was she should live.

533
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,756
You should have told her.

534
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,676
Instead you tell her to call the cops,
give her stats on DNA markers.

535
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:05,054
Everything's by the book,
nothing is ever personal.

536
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,764
Trying to sleep here.

537
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,810
Biopsy confirmed APL.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

538
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,564
Run the donor banks.
I'm going home.

539
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,358
We need to track down
her parents.

540
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,030
I assume she's already
said no to that idea

541
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,116
or there'd be no need to screw up
your courage before saying it.

542
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,784
Children who've been through trauma
can't think clearly.

543
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,786
Children who've been through trauma
and are dying...

544
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,747
Guess I'm the only one
who cares about patient rights.

545
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:34,375
What she wants could kill her,
what she needs could save her.

546
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,669
Our job is to find out
what's killing patients,

547
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,463
not treat them for chronic idiocy.

548
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,881
Idiocy is what's killing her.

549
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,766
And since we can't cure that,
I'm going home.

550
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:45,887
We could save this patient, but all
you care about is getting your answer.

551
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,016
Your point being?

552
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,771
Taub and Kutner can check the donor
banks. I'm gonna find her parents.

553
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,150
Can't see why you're surprised.

554
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,902
You push against House,
he's going to push back.

555
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,530
Against me, I get,
but his ego's killing my patient.

556
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,241
You liked this case
because he wasn't looming over you,

557
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,450
the decisions were yours.

558
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,827
Only difference now
is he decided not to loom.

559
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,664
Doesn't change the fact
that your patient's dying.

560
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,416
What are we missing?
What's not in the file?

561
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,503
The mother.
Overburdened, at the end of her rope.

562
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,339
Makes her kid sick,
so someone else will take care of him,

563
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,507
sympathize with her.

564
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,092
Munchausen by proxy?

565
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,257
She brought him to the clinic, was with
him when he went into cardiac arrest.

566
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,681
The brother would have noticed,
said something.

567
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,683
Evan's even more protective
than she is.

568
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,643
Then maybe it's the brother.

569
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,645
- He's eight.
- Could be jealous.

570
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,024
He's the opposite of jealous.
He includes Jonah in everything he does.

571
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,819
Makes sure he eats,
brushes his teeth...

572
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,410
You think we gave him an idea?

573
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,620
Either that
or he's off to kill House.

574
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,798
- Mr. Valez?
- Yeah?

575
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,634
I'm Dr. Remy Hadley
from Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

576
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,054
We're treating your daughter,
Sophia, for leukemia

577
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,017
and we need to test both you
and your wife for bone marrow donation.

578
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,269
I'm sorry, you said
you're from Princeton-Plainsboro?

579
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,063
I know this is unexpected,
but time is short and...

580
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:23,693
What's going on?
This doctor says you have leukemia.

581
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,946
I don't have leukemia.

582
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,949
- Sophia Valez?
- Yeah?

583
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:35,830
- Sophia Isabel Valez?
- Yeah.

584
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,625
Do you know something I don't?

585
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,088
Just that liars lie.

586
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,637
You stole her identity.

587
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:52,764
To protect myself.

588
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,390
So they can't find me.

589
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,644
We can protect you,
but we need to find your parents.

590
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:58,853
Why?

591
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,357
You have my blood,
you don't need my name to find a donor.

592
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,401
You're a minor, you, obviously,
forged the emancipation papers.

593
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:10,031
Even if we had a donor, we'd still
need your parents' consent to treat you.

594
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:13,117
Can't you just pretend
you didn't go to that house,

595
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:16,537
that you didn't find that girl?

596
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,878
Calling your parents
doesn't mean a family reunion.

597
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,049
You don't even
have to see them.

598
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:37,850
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

599
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:42,772
You'll have to give me a transplant,
even without consent.

600
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,702
An iron overdose?

601
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,704
From his vitamins.

602
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,997
If I'm right, we can treat him tonight.

603
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,458
He'll be back to his old self
in the morning.

604
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:09,757
But they're children's vitamins,
I only give him one.

605
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,009
I know.

606
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,892
I thought more
would make him strong.

607
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,188
I didn't mean to make him sick.

608
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,067
He's gonna be okay.

609
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,823
He's gonna hate me.

610
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:38,119
That's the great thing
about brothers.

611
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,081
You can make mistakes,
and they'll still love you.

612
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,936
Donor list turned up
a partial match.

613
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:04,896
So treat her.

614
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,856
It's only a three out of six.

615
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:07,857
So don't treat her.

616
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,902
She may not last the week.
Partial's better than nothing.

617
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,570
- So treat her.
- She'll reject it,

618
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:15,948
then she'll be too weak to try again
when a better match turns up.

619
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,451
- It's my turn now, right?
- If a better match turns up.

620
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,412
Well, when you decide,
get back to me.

621
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,376
She's scared.

622
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,505
Not scared enough.

623
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,049
Tell her the thing
about emotional reactions is

624
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:37,011
they're definitionally
irrational or stupid.

625
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,014
You might want to phrase
that in your own words.

626
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,809
She wants to deny her parents
the satisfaction of saving her life.

627
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,770
That's your rational explanation
of her emotional response.

628
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,730
That was her explanation.

629
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,360
That makes sense.

630
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,903
How long did it take her
to come up with that?

631
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,571
It was her immediate reaction.

632
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,324
That doesn't make sense.

633
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,535
The fact that it makes sense
doesn't make sense?

634
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,578
Emotional is immediate.

635
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:06,749
She went to rational first,
means there was no emotional to process.

636
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,418
You're saying
she's lying about being raped?

637
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:10,545
Wouldn't be her first.

638
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,464
She lied about one trauma
to cover a worse trauma.

639
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,637
So, what's worse than rape?

640
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:28,771
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

641
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,151
What did you do?

642
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,238
- I don't...
- Something happened,

643
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,573
but it wasn't rape.

644
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,410
Believe whatever you want.

645
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,662
You're scared and stubborn,

646
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,707
and you don't like people
feeling sorry for you. Why not?

647
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:51,586
I don't want pity,
I just want to be normal.

648
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,088
But you know you're not.

649
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,927
You need people to see how independent
you are, how well you're coping,

650
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:04,307
so they won't see the lost,
hurt little girl.

651
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,021
Because that's
not what you see.

652
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:14,609
You see someone
who did something terrible,

653
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,531
who deserves to suffer,
who doesn't deserve to live.

654
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,872
What did you do?

655
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:39,300
Eventually, we'll find your parents,
if only to deliver the body.

656
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,596
And they won't care.

657
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,473
You're an idiot.

658
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,185
You'd rather die
than face your parents because of what?

659
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,770
You broke their Fabergé egg?

660
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,772
I killed their son.

661
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,694
I killed my brother.

662
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:03,282
I was supposed to watch him.

663
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,663
He was in the bath.

664
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,752
I could hear him laughing.

665
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:22,134
Every time they'd look at me,
it's like I killed him again.

666
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,406
If you don't take
your parents' bone marrow,

667
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,075
you'll be killing
their other child.

668
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,745
If they don't hate you now,
they will then.

669
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,667
I don't care.

670
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:57,503
Sure you do.

671
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,426
You want someone to tell you
that it was just an accident,

672
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,011
that it's not that bad.

673
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:08,014
Well, it is that bad,
and you know it.

674
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,184
There's nothing
you can do to change that,

675
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,526
but there is one thing you can do
to not make it worse.

676
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:14,306
If you're here to celebrate the kid's
bone marrow transplant working,

677
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,474
you missed cake.

678
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,102
I want to do clinical trials.

679
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,104
Already had this conversation.

680
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,606
I've proved I can work
two cases at once.

681
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,359
I can do this,
and I'm doing it.

682
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:28,154
Okay-

683
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:31,448
Okay? Just like that?

684
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:34,785
Can I give my reasons later,
or never?

685
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,163
Three days ago you said no.

686
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:41,250
Three days ago, you asked me.
Now you told me.

687
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,086
Can't say no
if it's not a question.

688
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,742
Nice thing you did for Foreman.

689
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,119
He speaks.

690
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,122
He deflects.

691
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:26,212
I almost cost
a 4-year-old his life.

692
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,756
You knew Foreman
would figure it out.

693
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:30,966
Did I?

694
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,181
You just needed
to prove it to him.

695
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:40,226
You're an ass, but a noble one.

696
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,102
I sound clever.

697
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,395
Thank you.

698
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,689
Your little game didn't work.

699
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,192
I'm not Foreman,
and you're not me.

700
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,699
You want to talk about her?

701
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,160
Nope.

702
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:00,454
All right.

703
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:05,834
You're gonna be okay, House.

704
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,171
Good to know.
