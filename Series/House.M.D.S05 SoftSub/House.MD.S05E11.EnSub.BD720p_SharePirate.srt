1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:06,173
Joy to the world,
The Lord has come.

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:10,678
Let Earth receive her king.

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:15,558
Let every heart
prepare him room.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,895
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing.

5
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,231
And heaven,
and heaven and nature sing.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:27,570
This sucks. This is why we need
to make a statement, you know?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,238
I don't think that...

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,241
What? You afraid
we'll end up in detention?

9
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:34,785
Well, yeah.
That's what teachers do.

10
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,789
They're not going to send
all of us to detention.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,583
Mr. Henderson is totally lame,

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,044
and this is our best chance
to inform him of that fact.

13
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,629
You don't think he's lame?

14
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,840
Well, yeah, but...

15
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,175
Then what's the problem?

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,345
Okay-

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,516
The
Robert Page Academy vocal jazz ensemble.

18
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,488
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

19
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,365
Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

20
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,285
Yuletide carols
being sung by a choir.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,788
And folks dressed up
like Eskimos.

22
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:19,747
Everybody knows.

23
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,458
Mr. Henderson's a stupid...

24
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,755
I can't believe
she fell for that.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,340
Why'd you do that...

26
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,727
I don't feel so good.

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,190
Sixteen-year-old female gets pranked,

28
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,068
also gets visual hallucinations
and vomiting.

29
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,487
Turns out to be
a failing liver.

30
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,448
Why have Foreman's breasts
suddenly started to droop?

31
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,827
Large breasts are a classic symptom of
you letting Foreman take vacation days

32
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,746
so he can finish his
FDA reports before the end of the year.

33
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,415
When are you taking vacation?

34
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,125
Hepatic and neurological
involvement...

35
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,420
So, I understand Foreman's absence.
Your presence, not so much.

36
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,839
I'm bringing in a case. You may have
noticed me doing that before.

37
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,924
I've noticed you
a lot recently.

38
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,927
It's almost as if you have a sexual
interest in someone here.

39
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,471
Like, say, Taub?

40
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,058
Well, Taub might think
I like him if I stayed,

41
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,311
which is
why I'm going to do this.

42
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,565
Somehow, I don't think
that was really about me.

43
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,649
Wilson's Disease.

44
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,942
Ceruloplasmin's normal.

45
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,652
You got a Christmas present.

46
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,907
"Greg, made me think of you."

47
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,584
That's funny. It usually explodes
after I do that.

48
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,710
Alcohol abuse?

49
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,545
She's 16.

50
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,214
The kind of boozing that destroys
your liver that early,

51
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,467
her parents or teachers
would notice. Wow.

52
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,803
"Manual of the
Operations of Surgery by Joseph Bell."

53
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,763
You're throwing that away?

54
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,805
Twice.

55
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,309
Someone's screwing with me,
forget it.

56
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,021
Yeah, gifting antique medical texts.
Oldest gag in the book.

57
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,607
Handwriting's kind of girly.
You got an admirer, House?

58
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,359
I said, forget the book.

59
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,820
Why'd they pick on her?

60
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,199
She's an overachiever, high grades,
she volunteers, she's a big target.

61
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,784
I'm assuming literally,

62
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,245
depending on where this school
falls on the Heathers scale.

63
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,914
You think the kids slipped her
something? Their teachers grilled them.

64
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,084
When did teachers ever know how to
motivate their students?

65
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,752
What did you do to Natalie?

66
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:16,006
It's all my fault. I didn't stop her
from being a total pig.

67
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,633
- What are you...
- Your friend's liver is failing.

68
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,888
We're doing what we can,
but she still might need a transplant.

69
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,016
She could die, unless you tell us
what you gave her.

70
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,935
- Just tell him.
- Shut up.

71
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,605
We gave her some shrooms.

72
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,776
We took some ourselves, we just wanted
to make her loosen up a little.

73
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,195
How thoughtful of you.
You got any left?

74
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,324
They're in Simon's locker.

75
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,285
This was your idea?

76
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,829
No way. I didn't
give her anything.

77
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,874
Right, you just knew about it
and let them do it.

78
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,125
Poisonous mushrooms and
hallucinogenic ones are different.

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,043
Not if they're not
dried correctly.

80
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,130
Get back to school. You better hope
we got to her in time.

81
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,266
What?

82
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:11,103
Am I going to get in trouble?
Should we apologize or something?

83
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:15,357
Yes, you should.
Natalie's on the third floor.

84
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,234
- Who's down there?
- Mr. Ravitz.

85
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,656
Where's the woman
I spoke to last week?

86
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,743
The trial patient
with the advanced symptoms.

87
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,244
She dropped out.

88
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,329
She Okay?

89
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,455
Not health related.

90
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,540
She just wants to drop out.

91
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
Why?

92
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,127
She didn't say.
And I only break into the houses

93
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,088
of very special patients
to get to understand them better.

94
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,136
I do good today, boss?

95
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,265
No rigidity, no cogwheeling.
So absolutely, I'd call that good.

96
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,933
Great. Thanks.

97
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,520
Your clipboard.

98
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,646
Keep it.

99
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,947
This place actually
smells of evil.

100
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,616
Where do you work again?

101
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,061
Why would House throw out a book
worth hundreds of dollars?

102
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,828
To make you ask that question.

103
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,789
Can you really put a price tag
on screwing with people?

104
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,917
Can you get us into Natalie Soellner's
locker while we're here?

105
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,046
House always has an agenda.
Just screwing with us isn't...

106
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,965
Yeah, he'd never do that.
Oh, wait, he already did, last year.

107
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,634
Remember the Secret Santa
gift he got himself?

108
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,095
He was making us fight over
who could get him the best present.

109
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,222
This time, he's just
making us wonder.

110
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,851
No animosity, no ugly competition.
I think it's a real present.

111
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,396
If it's real, then House
really was freaked.

112
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,649
And if it affects him,
eventually it'll affect us.

113
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:39,733
Uh-oh.

114
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,112
Maybe it wasn't those kids
who poisoned Natalie.

115
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,947
Maybe it was Natalie herself.

116
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,119
I didn't try to kill myself.

117
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,663
Then why'd you have
all those painkillers?

118
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,081
In case I get a headache.

119
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,917
Well, maybe,
you took a few too many.

120
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,295
- Do you have any kids?
- No.

121
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:06,135
But high school wasn't
all that different when I was your age.

122
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,638
Teenagers can be incredibly mean.
I know what you're going through.

123
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,436
I bet you were cool.
You're pretty.

124
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,438
You're pretty, too.

125
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,649
I'm fat. I'm a loser.

126
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,193
They all hate me.

127
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,613
You know what
they did last year?

128
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,783
They took these photos
of me for the yearbook.

129
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,997
But it wasn't. It was for this website
making fun of me,

130
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,458
calling me a pig.

131
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,876
Forget about them.

132
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,297
Let's just make you better.

133
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,715
What's the point?

134
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,970
Acetylcysteine could save her liver,
but we have to act fast.

135
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,680
If there's any
chance that she took all those pills...

136
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,848
There's no chance.

137
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,351
Okay-

138
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,812
She was the happiest,
sweetest little girl.

139
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,273
And a year ago,
she hits puberty,

140
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,652
and it's like this secretive little
stranger moved into her room.

141
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,406
I tried to talk to her about
what she's going through, but...

142
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,785
Give her the treatment.

143
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,870
Kimberley, you think
that she tried to...

144
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,080
I don't know what to think.

145
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,715
If it's a subpoena, he's gotten
that kind of present before.

146
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,383
It was a book.

147
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,801
That narrows it down.

148
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,607
Just look for someone
who knows how to read

149
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,180
or has been to a bookstore.

150
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,391
Most bookstores don't carry
Joseph Bell on surgery.

151
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,063
Did it have a note?

152
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,440
"Greg, made me think of you."

153
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,817
Green wrapping paper.

154
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,237
How did you know that?

155
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,699
What is it?

156
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,286
It's nothing.

157
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,789
Yes, when something's nothing,

158
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,416
the natural response is to guess the
color of the paper it's wrapped in

159
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,669
and then descend
into stunned silence.

160
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:12,010
Irene Adler. Christmas 2001.

161
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,682
Sarcoid symptoms,
but she didn't respond to methotrexate.

162
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,686
I've never seen him
so obsessed.

163
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,064
He saved her with a last-minute
Wegener's diagnosis.

164
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,776
But the hours he put in,
I thought it would kill him.

165
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:33,699
And then, well,
he fell for her.

166
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,787
But it was too soon
after Stacy and...

167
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:44,668
It sounds silly,
but Irene was the one who got away.

168
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,337
Really?

169
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,716
No, you idiots. House is just
screwing with you.

170
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,092
You think there's some
woman with a mysterious

171
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,885
green wrapping paper trademark?

172
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,679
Then how did you guess...

173
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,888
I could be wrong.

174
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,099
It's possible a secret admirer

175
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,561
gave House the same book
I gave him last Christmas,

176
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,480
and the same paper
I wrapped it in,

177
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,857
and the note I wrote.

178
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,150
We gotta go.

179
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,574
Heartbeat?

180
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,575
One-fifty.

181
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,078
BP 180 over 110.
Crackling three-quarters of the way up.

182
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,791
At least this means
she didn't try to kill herself.

183
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,300
Scratch the hallucinations,
that's from the mushrooms.

184
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,304
Leaves liver failure
and now pulmonary edema.

185
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,892
And you standing there
beseechingly.

186
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,477
Yes, I was gonna
stalk you at home,

187
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,522
but it was a busy week
and your office is closer.

188
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,356
Thirteen and Foreman
were busy drug-trialing

189
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,025
and we needed an answer on the overdose,
so we called her in.

190
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,402
She's just updating us.

191
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,613
- Convenient.
- Update's done.

192
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,536
This is a good experience
for me as my parents never got divorced.

193
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,789
- Theories?
- Glue sniffing.

194
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,415
Effects on the lungs
would have been immediate.

195
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,043
House, we all know
what's going on here.

196
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,921
Cuddy gave you that present.

197
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,089
No.

198
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,423
Infections?

199
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,425
No fever,
no polys in the sputum.

200
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,760
I think...

201
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,513
I think she loves you.

202
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,765
I told you
to lay off the present.

203
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,767
And the LSD.

204
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,229
We got distracted by the painkillers,
toxins are still the most likely...

205
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,314
Just tell her how you feel.

206
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,027
If you won't, then I will.
I'll walk right down there.

207
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:39,241
Damn it, love like this
needs to fly free.

208
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,665
You talked to Wilson.

209
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,042
He has very girly
handwriting, by the way.

210
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,670
I knew I should have
just wrapped a new present.

211
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,714
You said the patient
volunteered. Where?

212
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,590
Pleasant Valley.

213
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,844
Soup kitchen in Trenton.

214
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,130
Thirteen and Kutner,
go search the home and the school.

215
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:07,894
Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the
fragrant and contagious homeless men.

216
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,442
Why don't you
hang out in the video store

217
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,819
and tell everyone
Kevin Spacey's Keyser Söze?

218
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,322
By the way, that ending really
made no sense at all.

219
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,160
You had my present for a year
and didn't even open it?

220
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,912
I had no way of knowing
there was an expensive book inside.

221
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,040
Completely meaningless
prank, even for you.

222
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,086
Stealing your ice cream is a completely
meaningless, albeit delicious, prank.

223
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,331
Observing my team's reactions
to unexplained phenomena

224
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,923
could have been pretty useful.

225
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:41,887
Of all the ways to mess with people,
why give yourself an imaginary present?

226
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,765
Have you checked the prices for firemen
strippers recently?

227
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,141
Yes.

228
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,269
The holidays.
They're hard for you, I get it.

229
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,398
You see the people around you
giving and receiving gifts,

230
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,860
having sustained, meaningful
relationships. And since you can't,

231
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,570
something deep in your subconscious

232
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,907
makes you create
the appearance of a gift.

233
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,950
Sad.

234
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,620
You really passed
your psych rotation?

235
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,546
It's too bad you can't
just be nice to people.

236
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,749
You could
get a real present that way.

237
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,918
If I wanted gifts,

238
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,962
I would just look deep
into my patient's eyes and act like you.

239
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,050
"Oh, I'm so sorry
you're dying, Mrs. Moron."

240
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,470
"Of course I'll sleep with you. What I
lack in skill, I can make up for in..."

241
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,390
You'd just wind up insulting her.
Perhaps calling her Mrs. Moron.

242
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,976
Right. 'Cause I'm physically
incapable of being polite.

243
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:35,106
Being kind in a sustained,
meaningful way? No.

244
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,152
Oh, I get it. You're trying
to get me to prove you wrong,

245
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,405
then I'm gonna be nice to all my
patients all through the holiday season

246
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,992
and then Mr. Potter won't steal Tiny
Tim's porridge. I'm totally on it.

247
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:50,163
Yeah, that actually is
what I'm trying to do.

248
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,583
And the pathetic part is,
it's not going to work.

249
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,169
You're right.

250
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,548
I gotta stop being such a jerk.

251
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,469
Oops.

252
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,388
Kind of undercut myself there.

253
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,778
Janice?

254
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,489
- I'm Remy. I'm...
- Yeah, I remember you.

255
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,537
I heard you left the trial.

256
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,705
Yeah.

257
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,833
If there's some way I could help...

258
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,130
it was that doctor. The one that was
running the test.

259
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,798
- Dr. Foreman.
- Yeah.

260
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,093
He's a great neurologist.
He's a great guy.

261
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,928
You like him?

262
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,139
Why don't you?

263
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:53,810
I told him that those injections
were making me sick in my stomach,

264
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,522
and he just gave me antacid.

265
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,524
We were warned that
nausea's a side effect,

266
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,027
and giving you antacid
is all he really could do.

267
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:06,823
No. He told me, "Get over it."

268
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,535
With or without these drugs,

269
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,956
I don't have a long time.

270
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,754
I'm not gonna spend it
being his guinea pig.

271
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,343
House.

272
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,386
It's tuberculosis.

273
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,681
You got that from an anal swab?
Man, you're good.

274
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,433
There was a more subtle clue.

275
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,728
Homeless guy, uncontrollably
hacking up blood.

276
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,731
Cough's lasted two months.
He was cachectic.

277
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,858
Unless you could
tie him to the patient...

278
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,361
Yes, again, if only there
was some subtle clue,

279
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:48,281
like the fact that he was standing
next to her in the soup line for a week.

280
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,324
I hate spunk.

281
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,493
TB can cause liver failure,
lung symptoms.

282
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,661
Fits.

283
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,080
Start her on the
standard regimen.

284
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,123
You don't have
clinic duty today.

285
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,668
Who says it's a duty?

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,505
Hi. I'm Greg.

287
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,006
Hi. I'm Whitney.

288
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,509
Hi, Whitney,
how can I help you?

289
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,095
I have a terrible headache.

290
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,472
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

291
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,059
We'll get you fixed up.
Is there anything else you need?

292
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,478
Bottled water?
Coffee? Mint tea?

293
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,854
No, but that's so nice.

294
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,399
Usually, the clinic
doctors are kind of rushed.

295
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,944
If you can't be nice,
why be a doctor?

296
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,155
So, where do you feel the pain?

297
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,282
- In the back of my head, here.
- Uh-huh.

298
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,911
It's Beccaria's sign. It'll be gone
by your third trimester.

299
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,830
Oh, I'm not in school.

300
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,500
Neither is your fetus.

301
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,795
Oh, God.

302
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,088
You didn't know
you were pregnant?

303
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,590
How do... You know that just
from the headache?

304
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,802
How do I know?

305
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,348
I missed my period,
I got fat and threw up.

306
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,183
Oh, no, wait,
that's how you know.

307
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,309
What?

308
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,312
I know because of the tight shirt
stretched over the swollen boobs,

309
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,606
the salt craving you
imported into the clinic,

310
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,859
the motion sickness patch
that doesn't do anything

311
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,104
for the kind of sickness
that you feel in the morning.

312
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,114
I'm a virgin. So is my fiancé.

313
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,241
I believe him.

314
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,410
Aren't there other ways
I could get pregnant?

315
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,621
Like sitting on a toilet seat?

316
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:22,459
Absolutely. There would need to be a guy
sitting between you and the toilet seat,

317
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,918
but, yes, absolutely.

318
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,338
And I was doing so well.

319
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,179
Natalie?

320
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,307
Oh, God. Natalie.

321
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,641
She's having a seizure.

322
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,893
Put her on her side. Nurse!

323
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,728
Is this from the TB?

324
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,230
Not with a supple neck.
I don't know what this is.

325
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,607
Four milligrams lorazepam.

326
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:56,409
Liver, lungs, and now brain,
which has mysteriously reappeared.

327
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,038
Speaking of mysteriously
reappeared...

328
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,334
Her ALT is 20 times normal,
transaminasas and PTs, way up.

329
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,504
She's going to lose her liver.
We gotta get her on the transplant list.

330
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,381
You keep showing up.
You also keep leaving.

331
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,636
It's possible that you have the hots for
me, but really, really hate this kid.

332
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,722
It's also remotely possible
I have that reversed.

333
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,475
She's a nice kid,
I want to make sure she's okay.

334
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,518
Hepatic fibrosis.

335
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,520
Normal complement level,
normal-sized liver.

336
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,855
She remind you of you?

337
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,543
No, you weren't
a loser in high school.

338
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,611
You had every Tom, Dick and Hershel
wet dreaming about you.

339
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,656
But she could be making you think
of another helpless,

340
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,866
chubby little girl
that you recently met.

341
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,662
You're not really making
this about the baby I tried to adopt.

342
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,580
It's been a few weeks.

343
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,208
Just enough time
to get over hurt feelings.

344
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,085
Natalie's 16.

345
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,672
I think you're confusing being
maternal with being human.

346
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,383
If we hadn't ruled out
the mushrooms...

347
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,260
Maybe we shouldn't have.

348
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,178
Forget toxic, think allergic.

349
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:01,015
Severe mold allergy could cause liver
failure, respiratory arrest,

350
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,350
and encephalopathy.

351
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,644
She ate the shrooms days ago.
There's no way she'd still be sick.

352
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,480
Unless it also gave her
a fungal infection.

353
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,816
Give her
a prick test and antifungals.

354
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,161
Hey. Thank you for the gift.
I really appreciate it.

355
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,872
I spoke to Janice.

356
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,081
She Okay?

357
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,249
Yeah.

358
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,547
Her nausea, she said you
told her, like, "Get over it"?

359
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,673
And?

360
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,261
Nausea isn't something you can overcome
with sheer willpower.

361
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,724
Which is why I didn't prescribe
willpower, I prescribed antacids.

362
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,727
She can't handle that,
she'd have to leave the trial anyway.

363
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,980
Just call her,
say you're sorry, she'll come back.

364
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,773
No.

365
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,734
God, you're acting
like House now.

366
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,777
No, I'm not acting like House,

367
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,744
which is exactly why I don't need
to apologize.

368
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,406
I'm not being cruel,
I'm not being manipulative.

369
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,117
You said the same thing to me when
I told you I was having a hard time.

370
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,744
And it worked.

371
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,455
She's a 40-year-old woman
who's falling apart,

372
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,499
physically and emotionally.
She's dying.

373
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,796
Look, I know seeing the Ghost
of your Christmas Future is tough,

374
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,762
but the only way I can help her is
to make sure she follows her regimen,

375
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,468
not by becoming her life coach.

376
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,223
You're not acting like House.
You are like him.

377
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,521
Dr. House?

378
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,024
This is my fiancé, Geoff.

379
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,904
She says you told her you can get
pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.

380
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,576
I said those words, but with
a particular inflection.

381
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,828
I knew it wasn't true.

382
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,289
Is there any other way?
Isn't it possible?

383
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,542
There was a reported case
of a Civil War soldier.

384
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,169
He was shot in the testicles,

385
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,840
and the musket ball carried
the non-musket ball

386
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,927
into the uterus of a woman working
in a neighboring field.

387
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,638
Nine months later,
a miracle child was born.

388
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,849
Also, maybe she cheated on you.

389
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,935
We made a promise.

390
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,895
We do other stuff in bed.

391
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,065
Couldn't some of his sperm
have made it up there somehow?

392
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,443
More likely it came from the guy whose
penis made it up there somehow,

393
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,154
but sure, anything's possible.

394
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,823
I want a paternity test.

395
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,575
Tell him that amnios are dangerous
this early on in the pregnancy.

396
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,995
- Are they?
- Who cares? He doesn't know.

397
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,581
We'll do the paternity test.

398
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,965
No reaction.

399
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,174
That's bad?

400
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,343
If you had a mold allergy,
it would explain your symptoms.

401
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,429
We'll find out
what's wrong, don't worry.

402
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,598
And I know some things are hard to talk
about with your parents around,

403
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,517
but kids can be really mean.

404
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,402
There are people you
can talk to, programs...

405
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,854
I'll be okay.

406
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,233
You're in good spirits.
You feeling better?

407
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:01,237
No. I was just
doing my homework.

408
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,656
I'm such a dork,
I guess that cheers me up.

409
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,741
Parents brought it?

410
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,367
No, Simon did.

411
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,619
The jockey kid in your class?

412
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,788
Yeah. He just left.

413
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,210
Security.

414
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,171
I was just bringing
her homework.

415
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,576
You helped bully this little
girl

416
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,924
and completely refused
to accept responsibility.

417
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,302
No way you came here out of compassion.
That only leaves guilt.

418
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,678
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

419
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,638
Stop lying or I'll take the drugs
I found in your locker

420
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,849
down to the cops,
you slimy little jerk.

421
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,979
- This kid didn't do anything to you.
- This isn't about me.

422
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,189
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it,

423
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,316
you were bullied yourself
when you were in school.

424
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,360
- Take it easy.
- I wasn't bullied.

425
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,945
Right. The Indian foster kid whose
parents were shot in front of him.

426
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,031
You were clearly
Homecoming King.

427
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,703
Let's try this again.
Just tell me...

428
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,663
Honestly, you don't understand.

429
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,960
We used to be friends.

430
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,839
And I'd be friends with her now
if people wouldn't make fun of me.

431
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,759
There's nothing you could
tell us that'll help?

432
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,763
Did she mention
she used to drink a lot?

433
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,515
No. How do you know that?

434
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,893
Look, don't tell anyone,
all right?

435
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,479
I have my brother's ID
and I kind of supply people.

436
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,690
I used to get her
a few bottles of vodka each week.

437
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,983
Why'd you stop?

438
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,110
She got her own ID.

439
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,861
Said it was cheaper
buying it herself.

440
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,030
You can go.

441
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,995
I think we got our diagnosis.
Our little girl's a drunk.

442
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,879
I don't drink.
I did back then, but...

443
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,840
You could die.

444
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,510
We can't get you on the transplant list
until we know why your liver is failing.

445
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,346
Alcohol abuse
would explain that.

446
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,557
The seizures could be
from withdrawal.

447
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,184
I haven't drunk in six months.

448
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,478
I didn't even drink
that much back then.

449
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,480
A couple
of vodka bottles a week?

450
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,024
I didn't open half of them.

451
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:08,281
I just bought them
because Simon was selling them.

452
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,450
We used to be friends,
and that's, like, the only way

453
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,160
I could get him
to even talk to me.

454
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:15,997
Then why did you stop buying from him?
He said you got your own ID.

455
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,166
I don't know.

456
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,667
See, that's not a good answer.

457
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,546
Remember when you asked me
if I had any kids?

458
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,494
I don't. I don't know,
maybe it has nothing to do with it,

459
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:31,012
but I was good at school,
good at work, lousy at life.

460
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,431
I screwed up every
relationship I ever had.

461
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,100
I thought, why would I want to
bring a child into this?

462
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,146
But then I got older and...

463
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:49,280
How you feel now will pass.
Don't let it screw up your whole life.

464
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,742
It's already screwed up.

465
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,583
My asthma. They said they'd fix it, but
it didn't make any difference at all.

466
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,713
Well, sometimes
doctors make mistakes, Anna,

467
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,299
and then we have to try
twice as hard to fix them.

468
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,550
You using your inhaler?

469
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,552
All the time.
Go through one a week.

470
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,639
You sure you're using it right?

471
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,849
Do I look like an idiot?

472
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,017
No.

473
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,021
Why don't you show me
how your inhaler works?

474
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,698
Jerk.

475
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,620
What was that all about?

476
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,664
Jamaican chicken recipes.

477
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,706
The parents said no
to the benzos.

478
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,793
But I still think Natalie's
not being honest with me.

479
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,212
So she's willing to die
to cover up some boozing?

480
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,755
She's very depressed.

481
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,175
She feels like she deserves what
the other kids are dishing out on her.

482
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,677
I think she either wants to die

483
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,596
or she wants the attention
that dying gives her.

484
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,684
I have no idea why you care so much.
Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.

485
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,643
House, the parents just...

486
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,520
Uh-uh. Not the alcoholism,

487
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,648
the seizures, totally different.
Don't need their approval for that.

488
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,948
You sure you want to know?

489
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,284
If it makes it any easier,
I'm going to tell you anyway.

490
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,660
We want to know.

491
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,751
What does it say?

492
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,262
Don't leave.

493
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,525
You go home last night?

494
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,903
I meant to, but started reading this
file, just couldn't put it down.

495
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,614
Let me ask you.

496
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,490
That patient who dropped out,
the one I told you about?

497
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,658
Yeah.

498
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,619
Do you think I should
pursue it more?

499
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,664
No. Patients drop out,
that's why we start with hundreds.

500
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,665
I just thought,

501
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,292
if there's an easy way
to make the people who drop off

502
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,668
come back, then why not?

503
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,795
- They're not people.
- Really?

504
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,923
I thought the zombie trials
were all completed during Phase Two.

505
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,969
You can't see the patients as people.
You can't even see them as patients.

506
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,011
They're numbers.

507
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,220
Look.

508
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,307
A friend of mine
has this disease.

509
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,894
I don't want to know.
There's a reason this is double-blind.

510
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,812
Any personal stake
we have skews the study.

511
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,024
Science is not about
human relationships, it's about results.

512
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,234
But you know that.
You work for House.

513
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,570
Why do you think
I brought you on as my partner?

514
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,907
Dr. Taub!

515
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,700
She was talking to me
and then she just passed out.

516
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,035
Her heart's slowing down.

517
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,203
Can you fix it?

518
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,538
- Can you fix it?
- I'm trying.

519
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,457
Push one amp atropine.

520
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,595
We've been waiting here for six hours.
Am I the father or not?

521
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,687
No, but she also
didn't cheat on you.

522
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,945
Normally, sperm meets egg,

523
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,782
DNA meets DNA, goes back to her place,
cells divide.

524
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,702
Nine months later,
joy is bundled.

525
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,203
That's normally.

526
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:29,625
Abnormally, an egg could have two
naturally occurring gene mutations

527
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,669
that don't naturally
occur together.

528
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,675
Spontaneous calcium spike could prep
the egg for fertilization without sperm.

529
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,428
And a division mistake
could let the egg split up

530
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,722
without ever needing
male DNA at all.

531
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,851
Parthenogenesis.
A baby without a daddy.

532
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,355
In humans, it's only ever been
theorized, and it was never proved.

533
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,607
Until now.

534
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:01,282
Mommy, baby. Your daughter
has only maternal DNA.

535
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:07,288
I personally checked this five times.
In seven months, you will have

536
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,333
a virgin birth.

537
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,712
Merry Christmas.

538
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,685
I've got to tell you
about this clinic patient.

539
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,688
Natalie's liver's continuing to fail.
And now bradycardia.

540
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,565
Atropine isn't keeping
the heart rate up,

541
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,567
we're going to have to
put her on a pacemaker.

542
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,780
Alcohol withdrawal would cause
her heart to race, not crawl.

543
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,406
There's nothing structurally
wrong with her heart.

544
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,117
EKG, echo, electrolyte
panel are all normal.

545
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,786
Multiple endocrine syndrome?

546
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,038
Free T4's normal.
Hypothalamic brain tumor?

547
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,040
Didn't come up on the CT scan.

548
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:56,170
It's hitting all her organs.
Could be the blood. What's her Alk-Phos?

549
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,467
Three hundred.

550
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,845
It can't be leukemia.

551
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:11,936
High Alk-Phos could
also be from liver failure.

552
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:15,773
She's a teenager, means bone growth and
destruction could throw it off.

553
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,858
Maybe. But it's higher
than you'd expect.

554
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,569
Start her on chemo.

555
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,197
We'll do a bone marrow
biopsy to confirm.

556
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,324
Why are you ordering tests
instead of treatment?

557
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,744
Her heart and liver are about to
give up. Do whatever you need to.

558
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,248
Why are you so attached
to this girl?

559
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,794
It's your call.

560
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,423
He doesn't want us
to treat her.

561
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,468
If it's leukemia, even if we kill
every cancer cell,

562
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,678
her heart and liver
are too far gone.

563
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:46,804
A double transplant.

564
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,808
With brain involvement?
The committee won't even open the file.

565
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,185
There's no reason
to put a dying girl

566
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,688
through a painful treatment
if it can't save her.

567
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,734
He's being kind.

568
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,779
I'll arrange a biopsy.

569
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,540
Mrs. Burke?

570
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,837
We're conducting another trial
in tandem with yours.

571
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,797
Same drug, lower dose.

572
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,884
The nausea would be less.

573
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,138
I did some checking,
I can switch you.

574
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,517
Here's the forms
if you want back in.

575
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,027
What if we're wrong?

576
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,779
Maybe we shouldn't have
overlooked autoimmunes.

577
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,906
High sad rate.

578
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,240
We went over this.

579
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,701
Normal complement level.

580
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,411
So it isn't hepatic fibrosis,

581
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,957
it could still be
microangiopathic vasculitis.

582
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,377
With high dose steroids,
we might be able to reverse...

583
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,548
You run a hospital that
treats thousands of patients every day.

584
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,926
Some of them die. Every day.

585
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:10,012
If you're gonna get this worked up over
every one of them...

586
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,764
Yes.

587
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,145
BEE!

588
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,856
- What is it?
- Thank you from a patient.

589
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,274
For you?

590
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,776
I saved her marriage

591
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,237
by showing that her pregnancy
was a result of parthenogenesis.

592
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,491
- Human parthenogenesis? You proved...
- Yep.

593
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,869
It's unbelievable. But I personally
checked it five times.

594
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,537
How did you
check it five times?

595
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,206
The cycler's broken.
You would have had to send it out.

596
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,999
- It would have taken...
- Oh, yeah.

597
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,961
That does sound impossible
now that I think of it.

598
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,589
I guess the better explanation is that
the paternity test showed she cheated,

599
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,758
so I faked the whole
parthenogenesis thingy.

600
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,760
What? Why?

601
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,930
I win.

602
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:59,395
You faked a scientific miracle
just to win a bet with Wilson?

603
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,729
More an argument.

604
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,190
I realize it would have been simpler
to just fake the paternity test,

605
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,693
but, hey, Christmas
spirit and all that.

606
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,613
I think you're confusing
"nice" and "evil" again.

607
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,117
Letting the woman deceive
her husband by inventing a virgin birth,

608
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,410
just so you can...

609
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,078
And it obviously
would have been more fitting

610
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,289
if the baby had been born on Christmas,
not just invented then.

611
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,959
It's not leukemia.

612
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,879
Seizures, liver failure.

613
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,466
It's eclampsia.

614
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,722
Which means we don't have
one dead patient,

615
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,392
we have two.

616
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,239
You have a disease
called eclampsia.

617
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:57,202
It causes liver failure,
pulmonary edema and seizures.

618
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,413
It's also associated
with cardio myopathy.

619
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,542
That's a pregnancy disease.
You tested her when she came in.

620
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,671
You can get eclampsia
up to a month after giving birth.

621
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,758
That's ridiculous.
How could she hide a pregnancy?

622
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,845
Loose clothes. She's heavy to begin
with, it was probably premature.

623
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,807
If it was three weeks ago, they could
have missed it on a physical exam.

624
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,976
The baby's why you
quit drinking, isn't it?

625
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,772
Why you asked me if I had kids.

626
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,733
Why you feel guilty.

627
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,947
I'm sorry.

628
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,324
Oh...

629
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,786
- Who did this to you?
- Simon.

630
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,663
It wasn't bad.

631
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,791
We were, like,
boyfriend-girlfriend for a while,

632
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,876
we just didn't tell anyone.

633
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,588
He doesn't even know about...

634
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,801
What happened to the baby?

635
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,594
I was going to give her away.

636
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,057
If they found out at school...

637
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,811
I was at the soup kitchen,
and she started coming.

638
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,897
There was this empty house
down the street, but...

639
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,358
And she wasn't breathing.

640
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:16,406
I tried so hard, but I couldn't
do anything. I'm so sorry.

641
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,955
If I had her in a hospital,
maybe she'd be alive.

642
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,791
Can you cure this?

643
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,795
The damage to the heart
and liver are permanent.

644
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm gonna die?

645
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:41,807
I'm sorry.

646
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,896
I didn't even bury her.

647
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,942
I just put my coat over her.

648
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,377
Get out of my house.

649
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,130
I'm a doctor.

650
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,465
I don't care who you are.

651
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,052
Did you find
the body of a baby?

652
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,261
I said get out.

653
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,641
Michael?

654
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,602
Who are you?

655
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,275
That's not your baby.

656
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,571
You're tiny. There's no way
you gave birth three weeks ago.

657
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,698
She's my sister's.

658
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,077
That baby is sick. She needs clean
water. She needs real heat.

659
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,789
She was probably born
with a partially blocked airway

660
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,541
and might even
have brain damage.

661
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,336
You can't take care of her
in a place like this.

662
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,587
Shut up.

663
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,715
I took care of her.

664
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,675
I know.

665
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:42,594
You found her.

666
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,222
You saved her life.

667
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,521
Now you have to let her go.

668
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,723
Who's that?

669
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,642
It's your daughter.
She was alive.

670
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,645
People found her
and took care of her.

671
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,250
She's beautiful.

672
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,051
It's okay.

673
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,291
Kutner.

674
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,585
No transplant?

675
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,796
We appealed. Too sick.

676
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,660
How much time
does she have left?

677
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,174
A couple days at most.

678
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,675
What about the baby?

679
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,719
Seems healthy,
but it's too early to tell.

680
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,098
She's in the hospital for observation
for a few days. But after that...

681
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,225
Best case, winds up
with her teenage father,

682
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,520
who just got voted
captain of the varsity bullying team.

683
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:57,687
He's just a kid.

684
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,401
- You all right?
- I gotta go.

685
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,340
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

686
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,468
It's Lawrence Kutner.

687
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:31,888
Why are you here?

688
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,225
I wanted to apologize
for all the horrible stuff

689
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,102
I did to you in high school.

690
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,312
I'm sorry.

691
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,005
What's going to happen to her?

692
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,424
I spoke to both
sets of grandparents.

693
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,678
It's too painful. They're putting
her up for adoption.

694
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,808
What are you going to do?

695
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,104
I already spoke to a lawyer.

696
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:27,736
I become a foster parent
and then I adopt.

697
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,917
Merry Christmas, Cuddy.

698
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,126
Hey.

699
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:10,987
Where is everybody?

700
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,697
Down at the party.

701
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,576
I heard Janice is
back on the trial.

702
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,204
My Christmas gift to you.

703
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,709
I was wrong. You're not House.

704
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,964
Yeah. Well,
that's my Christmas gift to myself.

705
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,682
We should go to the party.

706
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,644
We should.
