1
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,952
Hey!

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,788
How long have I...

3
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,916
Blunt force trauma to the head did
the fatal damage.

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,761
Since the accident,
he's had a continuous...

5
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:45,547
Can't get up.
What's wrong with my legs?

6
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,342
Hey, someone talk to me!

7
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,220
Hey, you don't hear me
talking to you?

8
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,685
Great heart for transplant.

9
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,769
Who?

10
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:03,606
My heart? Oh, God.
They don't know I'm in here.

11
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:08,069
Hey, genius. I think it violates
certain ethical laws

12
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,447
to rip the organs out of a guy
that's still alive.

13
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,157
Possibly certain law laws, too.

14
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,241
Thank you.

15
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:16,494
Could you get back
in your bed, please, Mr. House?

16
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,579
It's actually Dr. House.

17
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:18,663
This guy's a doctor?

18
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,749
There's also a Navy SEAL House,

19
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,125
but you're gonna
have to save up for that one.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,544
Really? Well,
that's interesting,

21
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,129
but you're here because
you crashed your motorcycle,

22
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,340
not because I need
a consult, so get back in bed.

23
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,051
Scraped my elbow.
Just need a truckload of Vicodin.

24
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,095
- Whereas this guy...
- He's brain dead.

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,263
No, I'm not!

26
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:36,931
So drop it.

27
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,433
See that?

28
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:40,643
Minimal brain waves
don't mean he's alive.

29
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,354
I am alive. I'm here.

30
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,190
No EEG response to painful stimuli,
hot or cold.

31
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,442
What you're seeing
is random, barely discernable.

32
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,401
I discerned it.

33
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,569
Listen to him. Please.

34
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,030
No. That's just the amplifier's
internal noise level.

35
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,397
It's on increased sensitivity.

36
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,533
No, no, no, it's not! It's me.

37
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,035
Then why is
his eye following you?

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,994
Exactly.

39
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,079
Following motion is
an involuntary reflex.

40
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,039
No.

41
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,040
You're a doctor,

42
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,416
you should know these things.

43
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,378
No, no. I'm not dead.
I need help. I'm here.

44
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:12,342
I also know about
locked-in syndrome.

45
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:18,139
And things are either
involuntary or voluntary.

46
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,851
Blink if you can hear me.

47
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,520
I hear you.

48
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,106
Oh. This is gonna be fun.

49
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,689
Eye movement is deliberate.

50
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,776
Can you blink once
for yes, twice for no?

51
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,027
I hope so.

52
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,572
Square root of nine?

53
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,912
He got that faster than you.
Brain is fully functional.

54
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,414
Where's Molly?

55
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,915
You were in an accident.

56
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,380
Lee, hit the brake.
Hit the brake. Hit the brake.

57
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,050
You sustained a traumatic injury
to your brain stem,

58
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,655
which has cut off
your brain's ability

59
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,178
to communicate with
the rest of your body.

60
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,723
Can you fix me? Where's Molly?

61
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,766
You still have
movement in your eyes,

62
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,518
so we can get you
to a rehab facility

63
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,061
where they can teach you
how to communicate.

64
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,647
No, I can't be stuck like this.

65
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,568
Unless the crash didn't cause
the brain damage.

66
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,696
Maybe the brain
damage caused the crash.

67
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,992
Yeah. I couldn't stop.
Why couldn't I stop?

68
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,620
Look at his palms. No scrapes.

69
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,833
He didn't even try
to protect himself.

70
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,294
Suggests slowed
reflexes or no reflexes.

71
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,922
You're not a doctor in this hospital,
you are a patient.

72
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,591
Yeah. And you're the guy
who wants to cut out my organs

73
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:17,876
and he's the guy who doesn't.

74
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:18,968
Stroke, cancer,

75
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,764
even a simple infection, anything that
insults the central pons could do this.

76
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,169
Then that means
I could be fixed.

77
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,767
You're giving him false hope.

78
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,603
He needs to accept
what's happened

79
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,772
and work on making
the most of it.

80
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,200
Molly.

81
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,534
Hey.

82
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,830
Don't look at me like that.
That's not making me feel better.

83
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,625
I love you.

84
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:55,463
I don't know how God is gonna get us
through this, but he will.

85
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,632
Stop it, I'm blushing.

86
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,258
What are you doing?

87
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:02,470
Just looking for
some reading material for the crapper.

88
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,848
- These CTs...
- Get back in your bed. Come on.

89
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:08,476
The children are in the waiting area.
Can I bring them in?

90
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,645
No. No, don't.

91
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,355
You don't wanna see them?

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,940
I don't want them having
nightmares.

93
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,566
I don't wanna scare them, Molly.

94
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,485
You don't want them to see you?

95
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,907
It's okay. I understand.

96
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,536
You're gonna be
better soon enough.

97
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,913
You really that sure?

98
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,958
Why are you so sure, babe?
How do you get so sure?

99
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,258
Are you okay?

100
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,426
Never better.

101
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,510
Here's your burger.

102
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,726
If you can't bring Mohammed to
Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed.

103
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,311
It's my diagnostics posse.

104
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,188
Hot, dark and darker.

105
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,940
Talk about getting
me better, please.

106
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,066
What are you doing
up in Middletown?

107
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,026
Who cares?

108
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,820
Buying a Gibson '57 Goldtop.

109
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,072
It's the guitar Duane
Allman used to play.

110
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,366
Next to the trauma,
the most likely causes of

111
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,618
a sudden onset of
locked-in syndrome

112
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,585
are basilar artery stroke
and brain hemorrhage.

113
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,788
CT was clean.

114
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:11,994
Man, those fries look good.

115
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,874
Certain circulatory diseases.

116
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,501
Guy's an active bike
rider, his heart's fine.

117
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,378
A well-placed tumor
could explain it.

118
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,798
Jeez, is the last thing I ate
gonna be the last thing I ate?

119
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,177
It could evade the CT, and still show up
on an MRI with contrast.

120
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,095
It was a melted PowerBar.

121
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,305
She's the smart one.

122
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,849
I just keep dark and darker
to fill out the quota.

123
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,812
If we find it, treat it,
you can be fine.

124
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,982
I never thought
I'd be praying for a brain tumor,

125
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,776
but please, dear God.

126
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,905
If you're praying
in there, stop it right now.

127
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,656
We'll get his doctor
to order an MRI.

128
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:46,982
His doctor's busy teaching him

129
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,619
how to blink out "kill me"
in Morse code.

130
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:54,082
Luckily, I found some
forms under the mattress.

131
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,922
Check it out,
they have those MRI video goggles.

132
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,925
- I heard these were awesome.
- What do you see?

133
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,343
It's a beach.

134
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,887
Oh, look. There's Taub.

135
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,933
Drinking a margarita and mocking us
for driving all the way up here

136
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,685
because House said "jump."
Easy. I can still feel in here.

137
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,356
Excuse Dr. Kutner. He gets a little
excited about new technology.

138
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:21,317
It can get loud in there,
and a little closed off.

139
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,945
These will put you
in a quiet place.

140
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,614
You can create
a relaxing scenario for yourself.

141
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,659
I hope they work.

142
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,993
Wow.

143
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,504
You're in my relaxing scenario?

144
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,215
I guess you like me.

145
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,844
Either that or
you got sent here.

146
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,720
What, by God?

147
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,390
I'm not sure if
I believe in God.

148
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,643
You spend an awful lot of time in church
for someone who doesn't.

149
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,230
I don't not believe either.

150
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,316
It's either one or the other.

151
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,194
I go to church mainly to
keep my wife happy, but...

152
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,114
I don't know.
I've never actually thought that

153
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,700
God could reach out
and affect my life.

154
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:15,663
But getting a brilliant
doctor in the bed next to me...

155
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,709
God is also the guy who opened his car
door in front of you.

156
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,210
I think Molly was right.

157
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,005
I think you were sent here
to make me get better.

158
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,465
I think so.

159
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,639
Hey.

160
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,768
Hey, Dad. Making a volcano.

161
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,105
Yeah. You're making a volcano. Looks
like it. What you doing, baby?

162
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,320
What time is it?

163
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:51,407
Hope you don't mind.
My new roommate snores.

164
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,203
And my new room
doesn't have you.

165
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:00,208
Your MRI showed
a lesion in the central pons.

166
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,001
What is that?
What does that mean?

167
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,169
See it there?

168
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,128
No.

169
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,090
Yeah, that's what they said.

170
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:13,262
But it's there, which means no way
head trauma did this.

171
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,475
It's cancer, causing a
paraneoplastic syndrome.

172
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,685
Unfortunately, your
current doctor thinks

173
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,813
its diffused nature
means an infection.

174
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,608
Now, the bad news
is the antivirals

175
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,653
he's got you on might kill you.

176
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,737
I'm not gonna die.

177
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,282
The good news is,
if they just almost kill you,

178
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,578
then Dr. Idiot will realize that
his name is not a coincidence,

179
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,497
and he'll let me
do whatever I want.

180
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,539
Thank you.

181
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,836
See, the irony here is,

182
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,298
you're kind of fascinating.

183
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,385
So many questions.

184
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:54,929
But if you could
answer any of them,

185
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,597
then you wouldn't
be fascinating.

186
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,725
I get it. You're a little
nuts, aren't you?

187
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,773
Your wife is the one
getting you through this.

188
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,733
Your wife and me.

189
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:12,238
Although, frankly, the MRI
was a lot more useful

190
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,365
than four hours of hand holding.

191
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,326
I think.

192
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,538
If he had a wife,
he'd know it matters.

193
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:25,001
You're a good guy.
Easy to talk to.

194
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:29,297
Wait, something's
happening. What's happening to me?

195
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,549
Need some help in here.

196
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,551
Your patient is seizing.

197
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,722
Why would he have a seizure?

198
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,265
Because he has cancer.

199
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,590
His brain stem is compromised.

200
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:43,227
Why are you still arguing with
this guy? You thought I was dead.

201
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,563
Welcome back.
And nicely played.

202
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,483
You almost died,
exactly as we planned.

203
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,901
You knew this was gonna happen?

204
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:54,572
Usually happens when you treat cancer
by pretending it's not cancer.

205
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,450
- Right, Doctor? My turn?
- It's cancer?

206
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,534
- No, it isn't.
- Yes.

207
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,746
Small tumor in his brain stem
causing paraneoplastic syndrome.

208
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,665
- He needs plasmapheresis.
- Can you give that to him?

209
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,834
No, no, I'm sorry. I completely disagree
with Dr. House.

210
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,918
Please shut up!

211
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,211
I don't.

212
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,464
Which means I can treat him.

213
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,341
Let him. Let him.

214
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,800
Is that what you want?

215
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,469
Absolutely.

216
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,056
Could you send up
a couple of bellboys?

217
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,320
I got the transfer papers,
plasmapheresis is all set up.

218
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,446
Are you okay?

219
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,324
Fresh infusion of
macho. You like?

220
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,452
I can't move, and she's worried
about his boo-boo?

221
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,037
What were you
doing up there anyway?

222
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,580
Antiquing.

223
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,415
Found you a late
Victorian corset.

224
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,833
Come by later. I'll tie you up.

225
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,046
He hitting on her? If she turns
around, she's into him, too.

226
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,381
And there you have it.

227
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,549
Sorry, I didn't show up
in Middletown. I didn't get the message.

228
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,510
Probably 'cause
there was no message.

229
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,096
I decided to accept
your resignation.

230
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,681
Uh, I thought we were past this.
I decided to stay.

231
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,725
No, you didn't, you had it
decided for you.

232
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,310
So now you're stuck here
with a boss

233
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,312
who knows that you wanna be
somewhere else.

234
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,314
Which means you're
no longer motivated to impress me.

235
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,359
Which means you're no longer motivated
to come up with good ideas.

236
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,902
Unless I'm wrong.

237
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,864
Save the cheerleader,
save your world.

238
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:20,991
I got it from here.

239
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,493
I thought you
already solved this.

240
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,912
You thinking you might be wrong?

241
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,539
What's going on?

242
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,583
Hey, just curious.

243
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,877
What're you driving
up to Middletown for?

244
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:32,837
Why do you care?

245
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:33,921
Why does he care?

246
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:35,423
Because I'm your friend.

247
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,591
- I was buying a guitar.
- Yeah. I heard that.

248
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,970
Used to belong to a guitarist who died
in a motorcycle accident.

249
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,681
Just reeks of you
screwing with people.

250
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:48,227
Your crash was 10 miles from the Orange
County Progressive Pain Clinic.

251
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,396
You live 10 miles
from Mary's Dress Shop.

252
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,322
And yet,
that's not even on my list of reasons

253
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,316
that I think you're
secretly a transvestite.

254
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:58,237
If you're going to another state
to get more narcotics...

255
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,196
He's on drugs?

256
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,158
I went to visit your ex-ex-ex wife
who lives in Thompson Ridge.

257
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,827
Let her know about the extra money
you're making on the lecture circuit,

258
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,288
so she'll be sure
to adjust your alimony.

259
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,664
You wouldn't do that.

260
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,416
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

261
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,667
Would you?

262
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,127
You guys are friends?

263
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,425
Shouldn't we be entertaining
our patient?

264
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,429
I performed Euripides with sock puppets,
you just missed it.

265
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,306
House said we should.

266
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:26,724
The mind is like a muscle.

267
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,852
If you don't exercise it,
it'll atrophy, just like anything else.

268
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,105
Whoever's with him needs to talk,
keep his mind active.

269
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,150
And it'll show
House you still care.

270
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,443
Not sure if I do.

271
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,236
Jeez, you're my doctor.

272
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,613
Then why don't you just quit?

273
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,418
- Not sure I want to do that, either.
- Oh.

274
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,619
Maybe you should figure it out before
House figures it out for you.

275
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:50,706
Dude, maybe you should have your
midlife crisis after I'm better.

276
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,249
Kutner.

277
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,544
We'll be right back.

278
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,547
Wait. Wait,
what did you just see?

279
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,013
Do you drink?

280
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,058
He's a roofer, alcohol hardly
proves your theory.

281
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,976
Marchiafava-Bignami
disease fits.

282
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,102
LFT's are normal.

283
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:15,272
Speak English.
Is it fixable? What does that mean?

284
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,232
That hurts.

285
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,858
No tremors.

286
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,818
How much do you drink?
A six-pack a day?

287
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,384
I hate beer.
I don't even drink beer.

288
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,404
Could mean he drinks
more or less,

289
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,490
or maybe something else.

290
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,865
It may not be alcohol at all.

291
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,367
Street opiates could
also cause locked-in...

292
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,326
I don't get high.

293
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,285
MPPP.

294
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,163
Either we play 20,000 questions
with every street drug,

295
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,458
or instead of talking
to him, we talk to the lesion.

296
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,417
Talk to me.

297
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,295
We're going to
biopsy the brain stem?

298
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,340
For the record, that doesn't count
as your inspired idea.

299
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,508
It's sort of
where I was heading.

300
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,427
You're gonna cut
into my head? Why?

301
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,430
Stop treating me like
a piece of furniture!

302
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,516
I have a right to
know what's going on!

303
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,606
Where is that going?

304
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,150
Blood in your urine clogged up
your old catheter.

305
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:04,071
Peeing blood? That must be
what the insecure doctor saw.

306
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,116
Every clue gets us
closer to the answer.

307
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,118
Damn it!

308
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,370
The surgery will
get us more clues.

309
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,587
You have visitors.

310
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,926
No. No, Molly.

311
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,344
You can come in now.

312
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,555
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

313
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,348
I told you not to bring them.

314
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,350
They wanted to
see their father.

315
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,396
I can't even hug them.

316
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,190
They can handle it.
It's gonna be all right.

317
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,651
You're not so sure
anymore, are you?

318
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,905
They must have told you that
it's dangerous, that I could die.

319
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,283
And that's why you
brought them in here.

320
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,826
I got an A plus on my test.

321
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,870
To see me before I die.

322
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,038
I love you, Daddy.

323
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,539
Daddy loves you, too.

324
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,542
I want to show my drawings.

325
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:03,547
Kids just want a dad.
Even if he's just a lump.

326
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,966
Maybe you should go now.

327
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,053
Oh no, they can stay.
Please, let them stay.

328
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,766
Bye, Daddy.

329
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,936
Bye, Daddy.

330
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,236
Sorry. You were crying.

331
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,697
Damn.

332
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,083
We're going to put you out,
just so we can drill the hole.

333
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,002
Oh, that's very
thoughtful of you.

334
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,755
Then we'll wake you back up.

335
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,591
We need you to answer some simple
"yes" or "no" questions

336
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:48,717
while we're cutting
to make sure

337
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,677
we're not cutting where we shouldn't.

338
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:50,761
Seems to be working.

339
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:55,683
Deep breaths. In about 10 seconds,
you will feel light headed.

340
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,104
By now, you should
be floating high...

341
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,958
How come I'm not better?

342
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,002
God's not supposed to
work in trial and error.

343
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,255
God's mistakes
are well documented.

344
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,881
If he'd done everything
right the first time,

345
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,634
there'd have been one plague
and zero great floods.

346
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,803
Those were because
of human mistakes.

347
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,180
You think your doctor
has an apartment on Mount Olympus?

348
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,266
God put me with
you for a reason.

349
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,143
I'm gonna be all
right still, right?

350
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,604
I don't know.

351
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,696
Lee? You with me now?

352
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,118
Easy questions.

353
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,787
You'll be done
before you know it.

354
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,789
Is this equation correct?

355
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,499
What? So if you make a mistake,

356
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm not gonna
know that anymore?

357
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,378
Are these lines parallel?

358
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,798
Spatial relationship's intact.

359
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,258
Take a look at this circle.

360
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,178
Is more than half of it shaded?

361
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,679
Of course.

362
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,600
Don't forget to blink. Ls more than half
of the circle shaded?

363
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,518
Sorry. Yes.

364
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,895
Look at me, Lee.

365
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,231
Again. Ls more than half
of this circle shaded?

366
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,358
Blink. Come on, Lee. Blink.

367
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:29,401
Foreman, back out.

368
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,570
I can't blink. Cannot blink.

369
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,411
Why aren't his eyes moving?

370
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,124
Two options, my
neurologist screwed up,

371
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,376
or else something that
the hospital lawyer

372
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,836
is going to have to come up with
when you sue us.

373
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,046
Blinking and eye movements

374
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,048
are controlled
by a small cluster of nerves

375
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,217
just millimeters
from the biopsy site.

376
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,345
But he's still in there, right?
I mean, he just can't communicate?

377
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,554
It's possible.

378
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,058
Also possible is that the surgery caused
so much swelling in his brain stem

379
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,351
that he's just gone.

380
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,023
He had one way to communicate and now
that's gone. Well played.

381
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,734
Brain biopsy revealed severe
damage to the myelin sheath.

382
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
The question is why.

383
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,947
Epstein Barr.
Picornaviruses. Malaria.

384
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,325
He runs a business, meets a lot of
people, could have picked up rotavirus.

385
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,077
Did he report
having bloody diarrhea?

386
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,120
Wife's not sure.
Says he doesn't complain.

387
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,080
Did you ask him?

388
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,039
We prioritized.

389
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,325
He can only blink, a real history
would've taken weeks.

390
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,460
If he had Epstein-Barr,
he'd have belly pains.

391
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,587
If he had picornavirus,
he'd have headaches.

392
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,922
Five other "yes/no" questions,

393
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,007
and maybe we'd know
what treatment to give,

394
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,926
and what treatment
would kill him.

395
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,970
Unless he's already dead.

396
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,265
Maybe there's another way.

397
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:50,107
Brain-computer interface,
better known as BCI.

398
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,487
The goal is to get you to move
that cursor with your mind.

399
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,365
When you think "up",
the computer records the pattern.

400
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,202
Think "up" enough times, it eventually
learns what you're thinking.

401
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,372
So, start thinking "up."

402
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,768
You in there?

403
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,272
Are you trying?

404
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,584
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife.

405
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,004
She was at a sweat lodge
in New Mexico last week.

406
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,256
What were you
really doing in New York?

407
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,761
Know how you hate
it when I meddle in your lies?

408
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:03,138
I mean, your life?

409
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,598
Why are you being so evasive?

410
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,934
Unless you have
something to evade.

411
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,269
Interesting.

412
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,066
So it's nothing to do
with you, your ex-wife, or my pain.

413
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:18,111
I was heading to the Downstate
Correctional Facility in Fishkill.

414
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,406
One of your hookers
arrange a conjugal visit?

415
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,825
It's where Foreman's
brother is being held.

416
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,335
This is gonna mean
months of sleepless nights wondering

417
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,587
if I could've done
something differently.

418
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,341
Maybe it's not that
I'm sick of House,

419
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,636
it's that I'm sick
of being scared

420
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,223
out of my mind to
go to work every day.

421
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,479
Sorry.

422
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,322
Did that just...

423
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,492
Was that you?

424
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,511
Are you really in there?

425
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,813
I knew you were in there.

426
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,106
I was scared.

427
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,607
Thank God.

428
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,153
I am scared.

429
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,822
Molly, I love you so much.

430
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,702
Have you had any bloody diarrhea
in the last two weeks?

431
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,120
(BEEPING "No-q."

432
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,663
Rotavirus out.

433
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,457
Any recent joint pain?

434
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:54,416
(BEEPING "No-q"

435
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,584
Epstein-Barr's out.

436
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,086
Have you traveled out
of the country lately?

437
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,005
What about inside the country?

438
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,592
He was in St. Louis.

439
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,180
Good.

440
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:12,100
Could be Missouri malaria.
We'll start treatment.

441
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,103
(BEEPS "No-q."

442
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,106
He was there.

443
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,068
The machine must
not be working.

444
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,694
Hmm.

445
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,905
Either that or
he lied to you about it.

446
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,823
People do that sometimes.

447
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,368
For example, I just lied to him
about Missouri malaria.

448
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,168
Did you go to St. Louis?

449
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:44,132
I should've told you.
Why didn't I just tell you?

450
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,301
Down.

451
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,980
When you weren't in
St. Louis for two days,

452
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,150
I assume you were
getting some strange for two days.

453
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,902
So does she.

454
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,946
You have to tell her I wasn't.

455
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,489
Amazing.

456
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,910
A man who only has two blips
at his disposal can still lie.

457
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,578
I'm not lying.

458
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,164
If you were getting some
really strange strange,

459
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,667
you could have
contracted neurosyphilis.

460
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,461
Infection went to your
brain, froze you right up.

461
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,463
Good news is, it's treatable.

462
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:27,175
You'll be up and moving in time to sign
the divorce papers.

463
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,261
Why would I tell you the truth
about being in St. Louis

464
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,555
and then not tell you
the truth about this?

465
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:36,101
He just admitted he wasn't
in St. Louis in front of his wife.

466
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,312
And you think he's lying
when she's not even in here?

467
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,274
I'm liking this one more and more.
Don't fire him.

468
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,652
Were you out of the state?

469
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,362
I never left.

470
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,824
Were you within 20
miles of your house?

471
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,868
Yes.

472
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,995
Were you within five miles?

473
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,538
Yes.

474
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,873
Within two miles?

475
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,291
Yes.

476
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,669
Did you stay at a hotel?

477
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,422
No.

478
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,426
You had to sleep
somewhere. Your car?

479
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,053
No.

480
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,764
A friend's house?

481
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,392
Yes.

482
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,269
Yes.

483
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,815
That narrows it down,
depending on how popular you are.

484
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,610
Tell the wife to stop
crying, get in here.

485
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,826
He says that when he was supposed
to be in St. Louis,

486
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,312
he was staying at
a friend's house.

487
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,788
- Really?
- Yes.

488
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,750
Let's assume that
you believe him for the moment.

489
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,627
Name your friends
within two miles.

490
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,670
Martin and Kim's?

491
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,755
No.

492
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,258
Guess someone who
doesn't have a wife.

493
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,970
- Dave?
- Yes.

494
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,058
You got an address?

495
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,852
If this is where he got sick,

496
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,271
someone else here
should have symptoms.

497
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,066
Not if Lee was the
only one coming down to the basement.

498
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:09,027
Furnace is rusty
but no gas leaks.

499
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:11,154
Résumés and cover letters here.

500
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:15,367
Some are weeks old, he's been spending
time here for a while.

501
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,412
Business wasn't going good.

502
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,540
I didn't want you
and the kids to worry.

503
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,837
I was trying to protect you.

504
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,218
Molly...

505
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,306
I wish you could hear me.

506
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,559
I wish I could make
all of this better.

507
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,938
Looks like he
temped a few times.

508
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,191
As a janitor.
Factory out on Route 10.

509
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,866
The factory foreman says they make
rechargeable batteries,

510
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,076
mostly for cell phones.

511
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,913
Big step down from running your own
business to sweeping up.

512
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,207
Doing what I had to do.

513
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,792
Metal filings.

514
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,004
Judging by the color,
I'd say cadmium.

515
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,424
Which he'd aerosolize with the broom,
then right into his lungs.

516
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,759
Heavy metal poisoning
explains everything.

517
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:31,192
The chelation will scrub
the heavy metals out of your blood.

518
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,558
If we're right about the cause,

519
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,779
we should see some
movement in about a day or so.

520
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,823
Can you put
this thing on turbo?

521
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,533
Getting a little
anxious in here.

522
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,036
Somebody will be
here at all times

523
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:45,749
to irrigate your eyes,
keep you company.

524
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,709
Hopefully help make
the time go quicker.

525
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,753
My eyes still feel really dry.

526
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:53,381
Thank you for thinking "up".

527
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,134
For helping me
find you in there.

528
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,512
Man, when you
moved that cursor...

529
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,736
Bought my first girlfriend a necklace,
it was silver.

530
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:19,407
Cost 180 bucks.
Had to save for six months.

531
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,368
She hated it.

532
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,578
Really, seriously,
would you tell this story

533
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,330
to someone who could walk away?

534
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,791
Never bought
another girlfriend jewelry again.

535
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:31,503
Until Dr. Hadley.

536
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,506
You're dating her? You might want
to start all your stories with that.

537
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,634
Same thing. She didn't
even wear it.

538
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,011
The diamond thing?
She was wearing it the other day.

539
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,514
If she doesn't like it,
she doesn't like it.

540
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,474
Apparently, I suck at
picking out jewelry,

541
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,101
but at least have
the guts to tell me.

542
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,311
Okay, getting boring again.

543
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:51,147
How long till we know
if this treatment is working?

544
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,110
You lied to me.

545
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,070
I wasn't having an affair!

546
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:00,365
So, we needed money, who cares?

547
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,368
The last time business was slow,
you got migraines every day.

548
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,369
Why would you do that to me?

549
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,704
I'm sorry,
I was stupid, I was...

550
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,124
Don't go. Don't... Damn it! Somebody put.

551
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,709
"I'm sorry" on
this stupid computer.

552
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,629
My eye is killing me.

553
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,557
I want to keep my job.

554
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,687
Great. All you gotta
do is come up with a good idea.

555
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,692
How about we hook the guy's brain
to a computer so he can communicate?

556
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,318
That's a great idea.

557
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,573
For the guy who invented the computer
that can read minds.

558
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,450
Your idea was to use his idea.

559
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,411
You didn't come up
with it. No one else came up with it.

560
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,997
If I didn't re-establish communication,
we never would have found...

561
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,375
What's interesting is
why you're here now.

562
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,544
Not when I gave
you the ultimatum.

563
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,504
Was it something
the patient said?

564
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,849
I realized that what
we do here terrifies me.

565
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:13,771
And overcoming that

566
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,649
is the only way I can matter.

567
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,240
Kutner found
the battery factory,

568
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,242
Kutner came up with cadmium.

569
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,370
Maybe you don't matter.

570
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,097
I'm gonna close your eyes
so you can get some sleep.

571
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,975
Hopefully, when you wake up,
we'll see some improvement.

572
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,520
Hope that includes
my eye feeling better.

573
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,692
Hand me the fluorescein stain.

574
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:00,902
What does that mean?

575
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,695
Epithelium looks torn.

576
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,241
These drops sting.

577
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,868
I'm going to close your left eye
to keep it protected.

578
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,471
I'm gonna blink your eye a few times
to distribute the dye.

579
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,565
Ulcerative keratitis.

580
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,526
It means it's not
cadmium poisoning.

581
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,862
Which means you
don't know what's wrong.

582
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,739
Again.

583
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,546
When was the last time you changed
that dressing?

584
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,339
Judging by the smell
of it, I'd say never.

585
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:10,722
He's locked-in,
his kidneys blew a fuse,

586
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,891
and now his eye's oozing pus.

587
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,727
I assume you went
over all that with your team.

588
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:17,604
Also assume
they didn't have any brilliant ideas

589
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,814
or you wouldn't
still be muttering to yourself.

590
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,232
This is gonna hurt.

591
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,525
Ow!

592
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:26,904
The way he's losing his myelin

593
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,865
makes an infection most likely.

594
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,491
Could be varicella.

595
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,661
Road debris has come to the surface.
I'm gonna have to scrub it out.

596
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,997
And the initial
acyclovir would've treated that.

597
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,250
Which pushes me towards
an auto-immune disease.

598
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,585
Like Behcet's.

599
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,670
Here, this is gonna
hurt even more.

600
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,672
Take two now, two later.

601
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,343
Oops.

602
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,229
Of course, if the varicella
was resistant,

603
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,315
it wouldn't matter what they did
up in Middletown.

604
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,524
Do an LP.

605
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,820
You've been in the ER too long.

606
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,030
When the patient
had a head trauma,

607
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,783
white blood cells only
indicate that he had head trauma.

608
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,202
Or you could use the LP
for something useful.

609
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:18,122
If you find polys, it's varicella,
lymph's, Behcet's.

610
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,835
Why did I fire you again?

611
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,796
You didn't. I quit.

612
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,472
You weren't visiting
Foreman's brother either.

613
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:38,810
Busy. Kutner's doing
an LP so I have to focus.

614
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,021
I had prison security check
visitor logs, phone records,

615
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,607
you've never had any
contact with anyone at Fishkill.

616
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,567
So I ask again,

617
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,737
what were you
doing up in Middletown?

618
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:54,242
You know what's more interesting
than what I was doing?

619
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,995
The reason you are so obsessed
with what I was doing.

620
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,122
Stop deflecting, House.

621
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,623
Says the deflector.

622
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,839
The reason I was up there is the reason
you're scared I was up there.

623
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,217
I was checking out
your dirty little secret.

624
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,804
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

625
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,810
How did you know?

626
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,980
Your only secrets are
the girls you find embarrassing.

627
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,149
And the only
embarrassing girl you've met recently

628
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,526
is the one at your brother's
cuckoo facility.

629
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,069
We've only been
out a few times.

630
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:34,157
She's a caregiver.
Like all your other failed exes.

631
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,951
And someone who takes
care of your brother.

632
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,245
Who was the last
person that took care of your brother?

633
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,540
You think this is oedipal?

634
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:45,001
Actually I was
thinking masturbatory,

635
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,378
but I guess your mom
took care of him first.

636
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,591
So the safe course is to gouge
your eyes out.

637
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,892
LP stands for lumbar puncture.

638
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,770
We use this needle to collect fluid
from your spine.

639
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,688
That's a really big needle.

640
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,648
You're going to feel some extreme
pressure in your back.

641
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,860
I already feel pressure in my front.
My chest hurts.

642
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:11,861
Sort of a fetal position...

643
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:12,862
Something's wrong.

644
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:13,988
The best angle into your spine.

645
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,698
No, my chest.

646
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,576
Something's wrong. I think I'm...

647
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:19,535
Pull the needle out!

648
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,912
Oh, God, I'm flatlining.

649
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,331
Call a Code.

650
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,843
There is no God.

651
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,971
You don't know
what's wrong with me.

652
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,266
Doesn't seem that way.

653
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,269
So am I dead?

654
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,104
Not yet.

655
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,109
But you're about to be.

656
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,653
Okay.

657
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,074
Charging. Clear.

658
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,118
Again. Clear.

659
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:02,995
He's back.

660
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,208
No. No. Let me go.

661
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,626
You can't fix me.

662
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,754
I've been here for three days.
Everything hurts.

663
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,005
We need to get him
started on steroids.

664
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,801
It's okay. Just stop fighting.

665
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,178
She's gotta go
on with her life.

666
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:25,852
The kids don't need this.
I can't do nothing for them. I can't.

667
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:30,898
God, this foot.
Oh, that really, really itches.

668
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,943
So we put in a temporary pacer,
it's not gonna...

669
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,193
Shut up! Shut up!

670
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,614
He's trying to talk.

671
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,245
Something bothering you?

672
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,457
If there's still tightness
in your chest, it's expected.

673
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,876
Is it your eye?

674
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:57,133
Why's he saying "no" three times?
You only asked one question.

675
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,384
Maybe he's not saying "no".

676
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,219
Maybe he's saying "down"?

677
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,268
Are you saying that
the pain is lower?

678
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,061
How low? Your leg?

679
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,730
Your foot?

680
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,567
Left foot?

681
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,488
Check his... Let me see now.
Yeah. His right foot.

682
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,157
No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.

683
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,701
Then there should be no pain.

684
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:25,661
Is it a tingling sensation?

685
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,164
Is it itching?

686
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,630
Itchy foot means liver failure.

687
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,633
The liver's fine, his enzymes have
been normal since we admitted him.

688
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,551
I didn't say failing,
I said failure.

689
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,094
Just like you.

690
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:44,931
Liver's like a cruise
ship taking on water.

691
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,891
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an SOS.

692
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,644
Only instead of radio
waves, it uses enzymes.

693
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,313
The more enzymes in
the blood, the worse the liver is.

694
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:55,816
But once the ship has sunk,
there's no more SOS.

695
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:58,945
You think the liver's fine, but it's
already at the bottom of the sea.

696
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,529
So dying liver released toxins,

697
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:03,240
damaged the nerves,
led to locked-in syndrome.

698
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,701
Now we just need to know what's causing
the liver failure.

699
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:09,580
Liver plus eye plus kidney,
most likely sclerosing cholangitis.

700
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,416
Oh, God, if only
Taub had said that,

701
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,876
it would have
been a happy ending.

702
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,628
Do a biopsy to confirm.

703
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:24,136
I'm gonna numb up the area where
we'll go in for the punch biopsy.

704
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,639
Where's the new bracelet?

705
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,433
She was wearing the bracelet?

706
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,977
You didn't notice
that I was wearing it?

707
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:32,103
Because you weren't.

708
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,604
He noticed and you didn't?

709
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,564
If you don't like it,
it's fine, it's not a big deal.

710
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,024
I like it. That's the point.

711
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,909
I'd rather have it at home
in the jewelry box

712
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,112
than getting peed on at work.

713
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,822
You got the patient's
urine on that arm?

714
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,574
When I was putting
in the catheter. Why?

715
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,452
- You've got a rash.
- The bracelet's real.

716
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,580
I figured. So what if the rash

717
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,667
isn't just a rash,
what if it's an infection?

718
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,211
If there were rats
in that basement,

719
00:38:57,336 --> 00:39:00,589
then the liver failure
could be caused by leptospirosis.

720
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:04,135
Transfers through urine.
Rat pee to him. His pee to you.

721
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,762
The infection would
need an entry point.

722
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,265
Look for any recent
scratches, cuts.

723
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,731
Look. Next to his fingernail.

724
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,736
The infection
destroyed your liver,

725
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,031
which released toxins that caused
the locked-in syndrome.

726
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,532
You were dying of a paper cut.

727
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,492
I hope you're right this time.

728
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,299
Let's start him on
high dose penicillin G.

729
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,997
We found rats in your
buddy Dave's basement.

730
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,416
Tested positive
for leptospirosis.

731
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,960
Means we're on
the right treatment.

732
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:42,715
So try moving a finger.

733
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:47,303
Your brain needs to get used
to doing its job again.

734
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,721
Try harder.

735
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,225
I'm sure you've lost hope.

736
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:57,082
I know we've told you several times
that we knew what this was,

737
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,065
but this time we're right.

738
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:04,487
Concentrate. Move
one finger for me.

739
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,749
Welcome back.

740
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,794
I did it.

741
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,511
Rat pee.

742
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,971
Very nice idea.

743
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,557
Who came up with it?

744
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:35,810
I did.

745
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,231
Good.

746
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,906
You okay with him
claiming the credit?

747
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,367
It was his idea,
he saw the rash, he...

748
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,369
If he did, he would have hung

749
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,413
a "Mission Accomplished"
banner in my outer office.

750
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,251
Don't toy with him, if you're going
to fire him...

751
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:03,879
Fact that he stole your
idea means that he cares enough to lie.

752
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,590
That's all I needed to know.

753
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,177
Rat pee. It's a very nice idea.

754
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,433
House, you left
this in my office.

755
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,020
No, I didn't.

756
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,189
So either I have
a hole in my pocket...

757
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,151
No, that's right.
I remember now. I stole it.

758
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,987
Because if you had gone up there
to check out my girlfriend,

759
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,947
you wouldn't have come
back here and lied to me about it.

760
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:31,490
You would have thrown
her right in my face.

761
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:34,118
You underestimate the
entertainment value of your obsessions.

762
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:37,746
And then there were all those calls
you weren't taking in front of me.

763
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,793
So I dialed the number of the calls
you weren't taking.

764
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,587
You're seeing a psychiatrist.

765
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,474
You had no right to
invade my privacy.

766
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,645
- Is that?
- Yeah, it's irony.

767
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:04,607
Hey.

768
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:10,613
God sent you.

769
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,159
Suddenly, you're not
so fascinating.

770
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,664
You're spying on your team?

771
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,541
Prioritize, Wilson.

772
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,835
Is that really what you want
to torture me about right now?

773
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,170
I don't want to torture
you at all.

774
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,495
I think this is a great thing,

775
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,674
not something you have to drive an hour
out of town to shroud in mystery.

776
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,635
Yeah, whining on
someone's couch

777
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,595
is an excellent use of my time.

778
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,800
Maybe I'll discover
that my childhood wasn't perfect.

779
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:39,516
So your attitude
about therapy clearly hasn't changed.

780
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,477
And yet you went.

781
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,480
Which leads me to believe that maybe
something else has changed.

782
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,359
Maybe you think you can change.
Credit Cuddy with that.

783
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:51,320
Not much credit to
take 'cause I'm not going back.

784
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,072
Oh, House, please.

785
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,574
I assume you went
because you're tired of screwing up

786
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,409
every chance you
get at happiness.

787
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,535
Delete contact.

788
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:01,121
Do not let the fact
that I found out about it...

789
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,915
Don't beat yourself up.

790
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,668
I'm not going back
because it doesn't work.

791
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,674
You'll end up alone.
