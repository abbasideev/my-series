1
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:07,801
The risotto isn't bad, but it's not
what Chef Zane did back at Fortunato.

2
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,095
He replaced the rosemary
with saffron, for one thing.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,681
And what is this stock?
Did he get it out of a can?

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,142
My fish isn't bad.

5
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:20,105
But it's not great either, I'm sure.
I warned you against the snapper.

6
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,322
Do you think it'll calm down?

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,949
God. I hope so.

8
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,245
That guy is a bit of a blowhard,
though, isn't he?

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,622
The food's not spicy at all,
you can barely taste it.

10
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,667
Mine's pretty spicy. Try it.

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,963
I don't taste anything.

12
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,298
Have you been throwing
rolls at me?

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,593
It wasn't me.

14
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,430
Really, he didn't.

15
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:57,016
I'm sorry someone would choose
to behave that way. Really, I...

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,272
I'm so sorry.
Really, really, really sorry.

17
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,733
No, no, no, no. I swear, I...

18
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,652
It's not me.

19
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,750
A bloody tear could just mean
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

20
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,920
He sneezed too hard from a cold,
which caused his lack of taste.

21
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,755
House isn't going to care.

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,716
Does "black tie optional"
really mean black tie,

23
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:54,801
'cause I don't want to rent if...

24
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,302
There's been a glitch
with the wedding.

25
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,263
And House will be interested.

26
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,347
A "glitch"?

27
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,474
Patient had his
corpus callosum cut

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,725
to correct a seizure issue.

29
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:03,685
A "glitch"?

30
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,330
The seizures stopped
after the surgery.

31
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:06,980
But he's having trouble
adjusting to a split brain.

32
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:09,190
A "glitch"?

33
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,777
This is Dr. Taub.
Tell him about shopping.

34
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,739
I go into a grocery store,
everything seems normal.

35
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:20,493
I get to the checkout, and there's
all these extra items in my cart.

36
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,204
Stuff I didn't put there.
Stuff I hate.

37
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,206
My left hand hates me.

38
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,587
Yeah. I think House'll
be interested.

39
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,764
Just warning you.
I'm in a good mood

40
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,767
and largely pain-free, so I've got
no idea how things are...

41
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,020
Alien hand syndrome.

42
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,815
Set off by a stroke, or is
there a pony in the backyard?

43
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,360
Split brain. Right hemisphere
controls the left, and...

44
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,989
It's making life miserable.
Non-logical thinkers often do.

45
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,674
The current issue isn't the split brain.
The surgery corrected...

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,868
You're dissing
the right hemisphere?

47
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,077
Most people who have this operation

48
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,662
don't even notice
they're missing anything.

49
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,998
The left brain has language,
arithmetic, rationality,

50
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,458
and right brain
is a mute loser.

51
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,424
The right brain
is more aesthetically oriented,

52
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,878
has greater facial recognition.

53
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,212
I couldn't have been a
plastic surgeon without it.

54
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,423
Yes, and where
would junior high be

55
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,342
without our ability to judge
people on aesthetics?

56
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,507
Right brain's also more aware
of the present moment,

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,970
our place in the universe.

58
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:25,391
It's a universal daisy chain of peace
and love that throws buns at people.

59
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,353
His present symptoms
could mean autoimmune disease,

60
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,564
a nasolacrimal tumor,
an infection or just a cold.

61
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:36,235
Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand
new toy, you want to play?

62
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,612
We need to talk.

63
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,282
Great. I love euphemisms.

64
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,452
By "euphemism," I mean when you say
something but mean something else.

65
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,788
Begin eliminating.
Search the home.

66
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:56,589
Isn't that like locking the barn door
after the horse has put his face

67
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,758
between your breasts
for an hour and a half?

68
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,512
I'm your boss.
You're an employee.

69
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:06,391
I'm not normally into role-playing,
but if you want to...

70
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,770
People who get close
to you get hurt. That's a fact.

71
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:15,525
You're also a valued doctor
in this hospital. That's another fact.

72
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,194
From now on,
we're going to focus on the second fact.

73
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,990
So, this isn't you freaking
out over last night?

74
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:26,828
This isn't an emotional decision.
I'm just giving you the rules.

75
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,746
You can either
accept them or leave.

76
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,854
I slept with Cuddy.

77
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,690
After she helped me
detox from Vicodin.

78
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,693
I've been clean for
almost 24 hours now.

79
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,199
Okay. Thought I'd mention it.

80
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,702
Wow.

81
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,454
Wow.

82
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,247
One for each.

83
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,790
That's what she said. Ah!

84
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,167
How's the pain?

85
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,626
She's probably
got some bruising.

86
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:19,505
Yeah, I get it, you're a stud.
This is serious, House.

87
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,800
I feel better than I
did four hours ago.

88
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,805
Four hours from now,
I'll feel better than this.

89
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,805
The other "wow."
You were sober? She was sober?

90
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,683
Clean and sober and hot.

91
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,063
Wow. This is fantastic.
How are you gonna screw it up?

92
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,440
Several good options.

93
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,525
Unfortunately, I don't
think she's gonna give me the pleasure.

94
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,735
She left before I woke up

95
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,696
and five minutes ago, she told me
that I'm just an employee.

96
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,448
- Ha.
- Yes.

97
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:49,660
Well, either she's
actually in love with you and scared,

98
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,289
or she realized last night
was a gigantic mistake.

99
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,666
You were needy and vulnerable,
she was maternal.

100
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:56,876
You think she
jumped me out of pity?

101
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:03,007
No, I'm saying whatever is going on,
you need to talk to her.

102
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,759
Absolutely.

103
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,388
Does our patient
freak you out a little?

104
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,598
No.

105
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,686
If he's two people, then we're all two
people and we just don't know it.

106
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,730
And what does that
say about identity?

107
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,693
It says we're making it up as we
go along, which I find freeing.

108
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,532
Wow, I haven't been in a bathroom
this size since my dorm in med school.

109
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,451
Is that fungus?

110
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,036
It's from the steam buildup.

111
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,585
What do you think of this "glitch"
with Chase and Cameron's wedding?

112
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,797
It's always a sad thing when
sperm comes between people.

113
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,219
I hear the sperm
is very good today.

114
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,054
I mean, the salmon.

115
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,853
- Go away.
- No other tables.

116
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,109
You'd let your wife
keep another man's offspring on ice

117
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:06,279
next to the frozen peas,
just in case?

118
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,947
That's what this is about.

119
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:11,701
She's not ready to commit to me.
She's planning for failure.

120
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:15,663
Did you know that male fruit flies have
toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid

121
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,957
that inhibit the sperm
of other males?

122
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,136
Wilson says we need to talk.

123
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,762
- We talked.
- I agree.

124
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,934
This has clearly gone
past the talking stage.

125
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,855
What?

126
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,404
Hey.
Great, did you find my MP3?

127
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,910
Not yet. But I got your shaving stuff,
toothpaste, deodorant,

128
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:58,080
some magazines,
and this cactus from your window.

129
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:02,001
You didn't have to do that. Really,
the hospital supplies all that stuff.

130
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,087
I'm still trying too hard, huh? Trying
to get your other half to like me.

131
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:09,926
No, no, no. Don't say that,
okay? I like you, which means that...

132
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,096
We shouldn't read into that.

133
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,848
Anti-fungal meds.

134
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,684
Ordinarily we'd put
them in your IV,

135
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,854
but since your right
brain doesn't seem too fond of IVs...

136
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,522
You should be feeling
better in a few days.

137
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,941
I have to get back to work.

138
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,069
Rick says your shift will be waiting
for you when you get back.

139
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,487
Thanks.

140
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

141
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,036
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,829
I have to go.
I have to get back to work.

143
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:41,832
Babe, wait. Hold on.
No, no. It wasn't me...

144
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:45,461
I can't walk.

145
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,758
Well, obviously
it wasn't the fungus.

146
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:54,053
And it's not a coordination issue.
Dehydration can cause loss of balance.

147
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,012
We haven't had him on IV.

148
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,890
No. Good skin turgor,
not orthostatic.

149
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,643
Could be our tax
dollars at work,

150
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,980
constantly building new
roadways and bridges.

151
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,898
Meningioma. Slow-growing.

152
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,859
It could extend along the sub-osteal
layer of the cranial cavity,

153
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,069
and be hidden by the bone.

154
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,363
The cancer cells are actually
re-growing a connection

155
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,073
between the left
and right hemispheres.

156
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,909
If you're right, the two halves
have begun sending messages again,

157
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,161
but it's too early in the process
for him to pick up on it.

158
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,497
But we can test for it.

159
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,086
Proof.

160
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,300
You didn't talk
to her, did you?

161
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,927
If I'd talked, she'd have lied,
I'd have lied,

162
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,887
and though two negatives
make a positive,

163
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,765
I thought thermal-imaging
photos seemed simpler.

164
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,060
Note how many more heated areas appear
after less than a minute with me.

165
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,063
So it's either love,
or possibly rage.

166
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,523
Don't talk to her.

167
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,066
I have no plans to talk to her.

168
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,985
Manipulation is in
your genetic code.

169
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,987
You think I'm making a mistake,
you move in to correct.

170
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,406
- You are making a mistake.
- She lied to me.

171
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,931
Either last night or today.
I need to find out which and why.

172
00:10:58,034 --> 00:11:00,578
And clearly, thermal
imaging is the way.

173
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,039
This isn't a case. You're not
looking for a diagnosis.

174
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:08,085
If this matters at all to you, please,
for once in your life, be an adult.

175
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,674
Keep your eyes
focused on the plus sign.

176
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,717
Any image that appears

177
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,219
on your far right will
only be seen by your left brain,

178
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:21,515
and any image on your far left will
only be seen by your right brain.

179
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,475
Okay-

180
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,060
Just start by saying the words.

181
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:31,776
Book, giraffe,
willow, fortunate.

182
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,658
You're not saying the word.

183
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,202
I didn't see a word.

184
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,791
Could you draw a picture
of what you think the word might be?

185
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,377
Look, I didn't see...

186
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,092
Candle.

187
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,386
This is so cool.

188
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,262
Yeah, that's not freaky at all.

189
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,848
No communication.

190
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,850
So far.

191
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,487
Scott, why are you standing?

192
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm a little chilly.

193
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,618
I thought I'd get a sweater
or something from my room.

194
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,744
Is that okay?

195
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,912
Just a few more minutes.

196
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,918
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is the left hemisphere.

197
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,754
The side that's obsessed
with finding answers,

198
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,840
the one that needs
things to make sense, the interpreter.

199
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,926
That's where we tell the story
of who we are and why we do things.

200
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,719
That's also the side
that was wrong.

201
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,925
The right brain's advantage
is that it isn't logical,

202
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,890
it doesn't choose which
details to look at.

203
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,892
It makes connections
you could never see.

204
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,770
You owe your
insight to the "mute loser."

205
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,772
I'll send it tickets
to a Phillies game.

206
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,734
Confabulation means no communication.
Means your theory's wrong.

207
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:00,948
But he is cold.

208
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,042
Why are you scratching?

209
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,335
It itches.

210
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,920
Ammonia breath.

211
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,264
Your liver is failing.

212
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,371
I know for them to approve
this price,

213
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,312
they'll need
statistical documentation...

214
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,314
What? Why are you
looking at me?

215
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,774
When you first walked in,
I was under the impression

216
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,819
you wanted to
say something else.

217
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,947
- Nope.
- About House and me.

218
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,909
There's nothing to talk about.

219
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,917
I want permission
to do a liver biopsy.

220
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,960
We're looking for sarcoidosis.

221
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,337
Fine.

222
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,005
What do you mean, "Fine"?

223
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,410
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

224
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,593
Do you mean that because
a liver biopsy is not a test

225
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,346
that by any stretch of the imagination
could be considered risky,

226
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,765
so asking my permission is
essentially wasting my time,

227
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,809
and you're wondering
what my reaction to that will be?

228
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:11,977
Yes.

229
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,187
Are you trying
to make me angry?

230
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,146
Yes.

231
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,482
Do your biopsy. And also,
do your clinic hours.

232
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,025
I'm blowing off
my clinic hours.

233
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,193
Really?

234
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,986
Let's see how that goes.

235
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,951
Still not angry.
Try again later.

236
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,590
Sorry. I know
I'm a little ripe.

237
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,717
- Just a sweaty guy.
- Recently?

238
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,885
Always.

239
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:50,766
With a crazy left hand. Sometimes I
fantasize about cutting it off.

240
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,603
Just a fantasy.
It's the hand that's crazy, not me.

241
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,025
What?

242
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,445
If it doesn't like an ultrasound wand,
how's it gonna react to a needle?

243
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,032
Can you get music
into this room?

244
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,787
I think you're using your relationship
with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs.

245
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,998
You should be in more pain
so soon into detoxing,

246
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,542
but your body's full
of romantic endorphins,

247
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,338
and on top of that, you create
this distraction of looking for proof.

248
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,799
You think I should stop
and let the pain flood back?

249
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,593
Cuddy is not
a Vicodin substitute.

250
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:26,719
Quite the opposite.

251
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,805
You have to wait
for her to be ready.

252
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,808
Great advice. You pretend that
I'm going to do that.

253
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,185
You've made two major
changes in your life,

254
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,187
not a time anyone's
judgment is at its best.

255
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:40,816
Didn't you used to argue that my
judgment would be better off drugs?

256
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,569
Admit it. You're curious
why I want to make her angry.

257
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,238
I'm sure it's convoluted,
wrong and stupid.

258
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,490
You're dying to know
what I found on her coffee cup.

259
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,701
- No, because...
- Oxytocin.

260
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:01,253
Oxytocin, the chemical
involved in emotional bonding.

261
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:05,466
Her lips say "no," her hormones say
"Oh, my God, yes, more."

262
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,885
No. For you to know
her levels were elevated,

263
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,690
you'd need a baseline
to compare them with.

264
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:13,849
I paid the guy in the gym to retrieve
one of her water bottles from the trash.

265
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,518
Love inspires us to greatness.

266
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,812
So I need to make
her lose her temper,

267
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,315
which breaks her delusion,
which demonstrates to me, and to her,

268
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,525
that there is something
underneath this facade.

269
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:24,693
And then what happens?

270
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,737
She admits everything
and falls into your arms?

271
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,616
That's outcome one.
Outcome two is she kills me.

272
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,118
I think it's 50-50 right now.

273
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:35,746
Great.

274
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,331
I thought you'd say that.

275
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,709
You're committing
yourself to something. To someone.

276
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:45,089
I mean, it's childish in
a way, but ultimately great.

277
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,927
Assuming... Are you absolutely sure
you want this to succeed?

278
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,931
Why is an old guy
standing in my doorway?

279
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,766
Eugene Schwartz.

280
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,519
Eugene Schwartz.

281
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,355
Dr. Cuddy asked me to come
up here from the clinic.

282
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,650
She says you're seeing
patients in your office.

283
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,236
It's still free,
though, isn't it?

284
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,405
She sent him.
That's gotta mean something.

285
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,573
I'll go get my decoder ring.

286
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,663
I squawk. Like a parrot.

287
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,711
No, that's not it.
It started a few months ago.

288
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:27,589
I was doing some woodworking in my
garage. I was trying to make a chair.

289
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,259
Was it the chair?

290
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,720
Anyway, all of a sudden,
from nowhere,

291
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,764
this strange noise
comes bursting out of my mouth.

292
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,812
Tough to fake that.

293
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,439
Nice pants.

294
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:49,695
My wife Mona thinks I'm busting
her chops. It's ruining my marriage.

295
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,654
Where are we going?

296
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:56,201
So your left hand would rather play air
guitar than give me a hard time?

297
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,621
It'd rather play air guitar
than tie shoes, eat dinner...

298
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,874
Your right hand's playing, too.

299
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,751
I don't want to discourage it.

300
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,635
Splinter hemorrhages
under his fingernails.

301
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:14,970
What's that...

302
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,808
BP and O2 sat are dropping.

303
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,727
We need a bag
of B-negative in here!

304
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,772
So much for sarcoidosis.

305
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,816
Points to a clotting issue.
Clots would explain all his symptoms.

306
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,818
Why aren't we in the office?

307
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,653
I'm tired of clinic duty.

308
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,032
There's only one thing
that could cause squawking, right?

309
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,241
Yeah.

310
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,868
We gave him heparin
and did an echo of his heart

311
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,286
to see if it was
throwing clots, but...

312
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,579
More air guitar?

313
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,789
The heart's fine.

314
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,000
We wanted to test for Factor V Leiden,
Protein C, Protein S,

315
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,670
but the hand got tired of cooperating.
We finally knocked him out.

316
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,255
And all those tests came
up negative anyway,

317
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,883
or you'd have opened by telling me
your brilliant diagnosis.

318
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,593
He apologized for being sweaty,

319
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,221
said it had always been an issue.
But what if it's a symptom?

320
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:01,225
There are cancers that cause night
sweats and can lead to clots. Lymphoma.

321
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,310
Or pancreatic cancer.

322
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,188
Go scan his pancreas.

323
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,193
And try Led Zeppelin.

324
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,196
We've always remembered
what this hospital did for Leo

325
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,948
when his appendix burst.

326
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,492
Still, a check this size...

327
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,287
Sorry to interrupt,
here's my poo.

328
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:26,416
Dr. House said to bring it over and
leave it with you as soon as I could.

329
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,503
I don't know if you people
have an official term for it.

330
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,296
- Stool sample.
- Ah, yes.

331
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,714
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

332
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,135
It's hard to rush these things. Even if
you've eaten a lot of broccoli.

333
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:42,516
Where are you going?

334
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:46,061
Annie called.
She's not coming back.

335
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,307
This is not the best time...

336
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,857
Look, you said the heparin
would keep new clots from forming.

337
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,984
Maybe. But something's
obviously causing the clots.

338
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,151
If you have
pancreatic cancer...

339
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,477
We're not trying to scare you,

340
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,613
but even in its early
stages, the fatality rate...

341
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,659
You walk out of here...

342
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,782
Stop!

343
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,453
Look, I'd ask you to put
yourself in my place,

344
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,206
but nobody can put
themselves in my place.

345
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,003
Did she find somebody new?
Was I not being attentive enough? No.

346
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,798
She's just tired of being
insulted by a limb.

347
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:19,303
She said that my feelings
toward her were mixed.

348
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,471
Well, my feelings aren't mixed.

349
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,683
You're not going anywhere.

350
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,102
Unless you want to go naked.

351
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,606
Your right brain knows
you need to stay.

352
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,901
My right brain's an ass.

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,656
Got a minute?

354
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,618
There's something
wrong with this cup.

355
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,413
I need someone to bounce ideas off of.
Someone to be my whiteboard.

356
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,623
That's how you
taught me to work.

357
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,249
I have three choices.

358
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,586
First, I can accept it's over, pretend
we don't work in the same hospital,

359
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,547
have selective visual impairment
when we pass each other in the hall.

360
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,799
Second, I can accept
it's over and leave.

361
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,718
Or you could try
making him angry.

362
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,678
Standard choice number three.

363
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,139
Third, I can talk to him.

364
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,976
But it's not like I have
any new facts I can present,

365
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,355
and Chase has this romantic view of love
that reality can't compete with.

366
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,899
I know how you could succeed.

367
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,025
How?

368
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,738
Just say the magic words,
"I will destroy my husband's sperm."

369
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,533
You mean, succeed without
doing that? Probably not.

370
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,790
I have doubts. Normal doubts.

371
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,209
It's not wrong to prepare for
bad things to happen,

372
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,614
even if
you don't expect them to.

373
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,713
I don't expect my condo
to burn down, but I have fire insurance.

374
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,885
Patient's girlfriend left him,
now he wants to leave us.

375
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,644
If your condo rules don't let you buy
insurance, do you go homeless?

376
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,815
His room is this way.

377
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,650
What? You think I can fix this?

378
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,610
We need to offer this guy
something he can only get

379
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,530
if he stays in the hospital.
Relationship counseling.

380
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,739
I don't know if
his girlfriend is...

381
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,199
I mean his two hemispheres.

382
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,744
That's the breakfast of relationships,
the most important one of the day.

383
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,913
We need your special skills.

384
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,752
Ls the guy out there?

385
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,171
The guy that's gonna
make my right brain work?

386
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,464
Oh, for...

387
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,135
What do you think
your right brain wants?

388
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,180
<i>How should I know? It's crazy,
it does things I would never do.</i>

389
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:31,184
Duct of Wirsung slightly enlarged,
but within normal parameters.

390
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,312
Say something.

391
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,690
<i>It's mute. It can't
communicate with you.</i>

392
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,776
Maybe you should try
communicating with it.

393
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,739
"Talk to her."
The well isn't deep, is it?

394
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,783
You're the dominant half,
you make all the decisions.

395
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:51,204
The right side has no control over
anything. It must be frustrating.

396
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,582
No masses in body
or tail segments.

397
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,126
<i>I can't communicate with it,
that's the whole...</i>

398
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,920
When you decide to
go and get groceries, what do you do?

399
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,366
<i>What do you mean? I put on my jacket
and I go to the store.</i>

400
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,632
Your right brain has no idea

401
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,634
why you're suddenly
getting up and putting on your jacket.

402
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,722
It just gets dragged along.
Next time, try saying it out loud.

403
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,474
Just say to the empty air,

404
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,686
"Hey, I think I'll go to the store
because we're out of peanut butter"?

405
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,480
How much did they teach you
about people like me

406
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,206
when you were learning
to be a therapist?

407
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,941
I'm an oncologist.

408
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,696
Your right brain likes what he's saying.
Hasn't moved the entire scan.

409
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,282
Hasn't gotten us anything, though.
Sean's clean.

410
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,451
It's not pancreatic cancer.

411
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,288
Clotting could be a problem
well before a solid tumor forms.

412
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,534
It could still be pancreatic.

413
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,459
Yes, but if you want
a diagnosis backed by actual evidence,

414
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,294
we should probably
look at other cancers.

415
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,213
- House.
- I just squawked!

416
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,714
- What?
- Eugene Schwartz.

417
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,300
Your patient from yesterday.
I just squawked!

418
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:49,346
I was buying some flowers for Mona.
It happened when I was paying the clerk.

419
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,264
I assume Dr. Cuddy
gave you this number.

420
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,352
Yes. She told me to call
you any time I squawked, day or night.

421
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,686
I'm sorry, but I'm
about to lose you,

422
00:23:56,812 --> 00:24:00,065
because I'm about to drive into a tunnel
in a canyon on an airplane

423
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,983
while hanging up the phone.

424
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,319
I might be getting some more phone
calls, so let's make it fast.

425
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,738
- Lymphoma.
- That's right, pancreatic.

426
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,949
I know it's pancreatic.
I know there's evidence.

427
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,368
I know we've seen it.
I just can't...

428
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,245
Right brain/left brain issues?

429
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,582
If the cancer's too small
to find, let's make it easier.

430
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,292
Let's open him up and paint it.

431
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,963
There's a new procedure using
scorpion toxin and infrared paint.

432
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,465
The paint only works on the cancer
cells, makes them easier to spot.

433
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,759
Just agitating the pancreas
can cause clotting,

434
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,220
and you want to do it to a guy
whose problem is clotting?

435
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,222
If I'm right about
pancreatic cancer,

436
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,350
the only chance he's got is finding
and removing those cancer cells now.

437
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,603
His brain MRI showed narrowing in the
blood vessels leading up from the neck.

438
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,981
If we do shake something loose,
we could kill him.

439
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,315
Or one of him.

440
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,903
A clot in his brain could kill one
of them without affecting the other.

441
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,906
He might actually
be okay with that.

442
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,247
How long is it going to take?

443
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,208
Assuming he doesn't
crash, a few minutes.

444
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:14,764
Hey, you and Cameron...
I'm sorry.

445
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,313
I'll be right back.

446
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,030
I don't want to be homeless.

447
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:33,116
Okay. You can stay in
the condo. I'll find some other...

448
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,701
That's not what I mean.

449
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:41,333
I want to marry you.
I got the forms to destroy the sperm.

450
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,002
You sure?

451
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,795
Yeah.

452
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,549
I want to hug you, but
then I'd have to re-scrub.

453
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,634
I know.

454
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,429
BP is dropping.

455
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:55,931
Go.

456
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,602
No sign of cancer.
BP is 90 over 60.

457
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,196
You never answered my question.

458
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,283
Relax. Our friendship
is not doomed.

459
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,495
Thank God. But my question was,
do you really want Cuddy,

460
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,248
or is this just
another challenge?

461
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,541
You're worried that once
I'm in a relationship,

462
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:24,501
you and me will be over.

463
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,254
Hey, I'm actually for this.
I think this is great.

464
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,674
But if you're serious,
and you don't treat it seriously,

465
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,093
then you will get hurt.

466
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:37,389
And if you don't accept that,
then accept that she will get hurt.

467
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,854
I was told it
was your birthday.

468
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,981
I understand.

469
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,524
So, so sorry.

470
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,693
I know.

471
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,444
Clearly, there was a mix-up.

472
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,946
Have a nice day.

473
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,285
Does she look angry?

474
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,620
If you're standing there
when she looks up here...

475
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,211
Oh, no.

476
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,505
Systolic's 80.

477
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,431
Gotta finish this
suture before I can get out.

478
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,465
Give him a dopamine drip.

479
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,510
We weren't looking up
at the right time.

480
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,387
Get to your point.
We're a little busy here.

481
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,640
The clots aren't from cancer.
They're coming from his heart.

482
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,058
We echoed the heart. No clots.

483
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,936
Not while we were looking.
Didn't! Open with that?

484
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,581
The clots were caused
by an arrhythmia.

485
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,647
No arrhythmia.

486
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,566
Not while we were looking.

487
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,401
Intermittent arrhythmia.

488
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,987
This guy pulls our equipment off
at the slightest provocation.

489
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:36,197
We'd have to be watching at
the exact moment it happened,

490
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,240
which I'm guessing,

491
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,075
given the way you two
are scrambling around like idiots,

492
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,577
is right now.

493
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,997
Yes, I'm saying
do a transesophageal echo.

494
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,373
We have to get his BP stable.

495
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,792
Absolutely.
Right after the echo.

496
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,545
Systolic's 70.

497
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,298
The heart looked healthy
at the last echo.

498
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,801
And an arrhythmia wouldn't
cause clots in a healthy ventricle,

499
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,304
so start with
the left atrial appendage.

500
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:08,104
- Wow.
- Yep, I did it again.

501
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:11,900
Now get this poor guy's BP under
control and seal off the appendage.

502
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,070
And then all we have to do is
find out what damaged his heart

503
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:17,364
before it goes
after something he really needs.

504
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,870
So what damages
a healthy 20-year-old heart

505
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,372
enough to make it send out clots

506
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,999
- like it's bombing Dresden?
- Rhabdo.

507
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,364
Would've fried
his kidneys, too.

508
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,418
What about Graves'?

509
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,420
Thyroid function
tests were normal.

510
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:36,591
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction
could interfere with heart rhythm.

511
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,344
Run a dexamethasone
suppression test.

512
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,025
Annie.

513
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,988
You hit me.

514
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:02,784
I know. I'm so sorry.
But it wasn't me.

515
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,160
I know you would
never have done that

516
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,830
if you were in
control of yourself, but...

517
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,790
But you came back.

518
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,959
To talk with your doctors.

519
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,253
I've been going over
and over what happened.

520
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,005
And I had this thought,
out of nowhere.

521
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,731
Ever since I've known Scott, I've seen
his left hand throw things,

522
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,262
but always sort of playfully,
thinking it's fun.

523
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:26,558
But when he threw this, it was angry.

524
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:31,229
And that's when his hand slapped me,
too, when I brought it to him.

525
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,314
Could it mean something?

526
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,857
Deodorant shouldn't...

527
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,984
How often do you use it?

528
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,070
A few times a day. It's special,
heavy-duty stuff.

529
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,405
I have to send away for it.

530
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,241
Sprayed around a bathroom
the size of a shoebox.

531
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,452
I'll check the ingredients
from the manufacturer.

532
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,371
I'll check for any references
associated with health issues.

533
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,131
Somebody's grateful.

534
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:01,050
We'll just leave
the three of you alone.

535
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,564
Why is there
no lipstick on this cup?

536
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,941
Cuddy was wearing lipstick
when she drank from it.

537
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,444
It was on my face.
Why isn't it on the cup?

538
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:24,324
Why is it always reasonable, in
Houseland, to take an emotional problem

539
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,410
and sidestep it by turning
it into a mechanical problem?

540
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:30,705
Because, in Houseland, and the rest
of the universe, by the way,

541
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,500
when a question presents itself,
it calls for an answer.

542
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,878
If the left brain is
the interpreter of reality

543
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:42,717
and the one that tells us the story of
who we are, then what is your story?

544
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,178
Do you want to be the man
with the answers?

545
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,181
Or do you want to be
the man with Cuddy?

546
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,943
What do I do?

547
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,820
You make her angry.

548
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,240
Do you really think that was
the best time to mock me?

549
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,493
I'm as surprised as you,
but I think I'm serious.

550
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,912
Communication can't start
unless you're both...

551
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,205
I've been trying to
make her angry for...

552
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,790
No, you haven't.

553
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,543
Come on. Poo? Strippers?

554
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,836
It's routine stuff.
You've been pulling your punches.

555
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,171
You're scared.

556
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,381
You should be.

557
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,473
Now go terrorize her.

558
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,570
You don't want to
destroy it, do you?

559
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,114
I said I was gonna
do it, I'll do it.

560
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,116
But you don't want to.

561
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,787
I want to be with you. Maybe I'm not
comfortable with it, but...

562
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,582
Let's say
it's our fifth anniversary.

563
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,209
Are you ready
to destroy it now?

564
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,211
Tenth. Three kids.

565
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,440
They spend their summers
in Melbourne and have annoying accents.

566
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:07,343
It's disgusting
how happy we are. You ready now?

567
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,809
You don't have doubts.

568
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:20,064
You just don't want to kill the only
thing left of someone you loved.

569
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,908
Don't do it.

570
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,495
I do have trouble
giving things up.

571
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:41,127
For example, I never cancelled
any of our wedding plans.

572
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,686
Attention!
I have an announcement.

573
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,105
As you go about your day,

574
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,402
I would like you to be aware of the fact
that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.

575
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:37,308
This is beyond asshood.

576
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:41,854
You have the luxury of not
caring about your image. I do not.

577
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,190
I can permit a lot of crap,

578
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:49,654
but an employee shouting
about his sexual exploits with me, no.

579
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:54,367
That is zero tolerance.
So congratulations, House, I'm angry.

580
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,745
I was wondering if we
should move in together.

581
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,005
You're fired.

582
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,889
I wouldn't worry about it.
I think she likes you.

583
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,981
If I'm fired, I think that probably
means I don't have to see patients.

584
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,395
I'm here as a squeaky wheel.

585
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,315
I know how you doctors
are, you're busy, you get distracted.

586
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,317
My lab results could be
sitting in your inbox.

587
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,154
I don't need your labs,
you have acid reflux.

588
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:32,280
Well, how could you...

589
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,031
Acid splashes on
the vocal cords,

590
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:38,202
they tense, make that squawking sound.
It's completely harmless.

591
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,122
I'm gonna give you a prescription,
and you're gonna go away.

592
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,124
You are a great doctor.

593
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,919
Why'd you move your belt?

594
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,838
I always move my belt.

595
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,548
It makes me sore.

596
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,884
You didn't tell me that.

597
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:55,178
At 86, what isn't sore?

598
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,972
Soreness is less
important than squawking.

599
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,141
It's the squawking
that was bothering my wife.

600
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,646
That's not a potbelly.
That's a tumor.

601
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,652
That's why pancreatic
cancer was on my mind.

602
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,281
My brain was trying
to tell me...

603
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,825
This isn't sounding good.

604
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,661
Pancreatic cancer?

605
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,790
Can cause acid reflux.
We should scope you.

606
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,667
So it's not good.
Even for cancer, it's not good.

607
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,169
No, it's not.

608
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,380
The deodorant has a high proportion
of propylene glycol.

609
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,217
Same stuff made a kid in Singapore
develop a heart condition

610
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,052
and, get this, seizures.

611
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:39,388
Our patient may never have needed
split-brain surgery.

612
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:42,099
I'm sure he will half
appreciate the irony.

613
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,689
Can you take this man to Radiology?
Pancreatic scan.

614
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,441
And stay with him.

615
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,654
Eugene Schwartz.

616
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,710
Whatever it is,
just say it quickly.

617
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,298
Do you have more than one lipstick
in the same shade?

618
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,301
Maybe one that has a sealing agent,
and one that doesn't?

619
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:20,555
How could that possibly
be relevant to anything?

620
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:29,438
You really don't think you're just
overreacting to the other night?

621
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:34,402
Fine. I am overreacting.

622
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,823
You've said plenty of lousy
things to me before.

623
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:42,785
But reaching the final straw
has been a good thing,

624
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,583
because it made me realize we not only
don't have a personal relationship,

625
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,418
we never could.

626
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,423
You're...

627
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:04,557
You've been overreacting
to something I said?

628
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,394
You insulted me, I walked out.

629
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,647
It's nothing that hasn't happened
a hundred times before.

630
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,323
I quit.

631
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:21,991
Great.

632
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:29,040
My nanny is off the clock at 7:30.
So your week off...

633
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,250
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

634
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,461
who makes you
feel good about yourself.

635
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,049
Screw you.

636
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:59,236
No, no. That's
not what happened.

637
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:02,949
I told you that I needed you.
You helped me.

638
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,035
Are you okay?

639
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:31,852
Are you okay?

640
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:27,968
So, this is the story you made up
about who you are. It's a nice one.

641
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,599
Too bad it isn't true.

642
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:45,111
No.

643
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,322
I'm not okay.
