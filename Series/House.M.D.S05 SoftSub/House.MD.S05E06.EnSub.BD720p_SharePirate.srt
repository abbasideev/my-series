1
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:28,863
What time?

2
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,281
4:30.

3
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,368
- Why so late?
- Make-up test in social studies.

4
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,954
Did you invite
Shelby for Saturday?

5
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,913
No.

6
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,623
- Do you want me to call her?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

7
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,209
You calling a 12-year-old girl
for a sleepover.

8
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,002
- It'll be fine.
- Make you a deal.

9
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:45,046
I'll call a friend
when you call a friend.

10
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,926
It's your birthday.
Do what you want.

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,386
Thank you. Bye.

12
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:53,888
Bye.

13
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:47,066
- What did you forget?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,359
Then why'd you come back?

15
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:49,944
'Cause I live here.

16
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,696
Come on, Samantha,
you're gonna be late for school.

17
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,240
What are you talking about?
It's 4:30.

18
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,669
Are you okay?

19
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:07,754
Lull.

20
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,384
Tired, I guess.

21
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,774
What's wrong?

22
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,654
I don't know.

23
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,315
Right.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,820
That's all I need to know.
You're late! Okay, bye.

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,782
37-year-old male
with recurring blackouts.

26
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,535
Tell him to switch from tequila
to bourbon. Worked for me.

27
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,997
The three doctors he's already seen
already ruled out drugs and alcohol.

28
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,081
Then it's epilepsy.

29
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,207
Tell him to buy
a hockey helmet and...

30
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,501
EEG's clean, so is the CT.

31
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,256
Relax. Just because you got approved
by an adoption agency

32
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,174
doesn't mean you'll get approved
by the birth mother.

33
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,467
You're a single mom.

34
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:40,221
That puts you somewhere below
couples acquitted in day care scandals.

35
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,931
You're welcome, Dr. House.

36
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,808
It is an interesting case.

37
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,811
What time are you
seeing the mom?

38
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,481
Are you having
your guy follow me?

39
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,650
I just trashed your
social value as a mother,

40
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,527
and all I got
was a little sarcasm.

41
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,692
It means you don't feel
the need to defend yourself,

42
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,574
which means you're not worried
about getting a kid,

43
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,951
which means
you've already got one.

44
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,370
00.

45
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,581
She's due to deliver
a baby girl in two weeks.

46
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:10,001
Well, I'm sure the mom will be thrilled
to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.

47
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,210
She's not a crack baby.

48
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,921
No, mother's perfectly healthy.

49
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,380
She just had to give up
the baby in order

50
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,592
to continue her work
on the human genome.

51
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,802
She confessed
to some past meth use.

52
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,390
What they don't confess to
is almost always more interesting.

53
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,558
This is a mistake.

54
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,645
Because a kid you don't know may have
some problems you don't know about

55
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,290
that she may have
passed on to a kid...

56
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,482
Because you're
a control-seeking narcissist,

57
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,484
which is fine,
good even, in some jobs,

58
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,071
but you're not equipped to handle
a real kid, never mind a factory second.

59
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:41,157
Where are you meeting her?

60
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,951
In a little place
called, "Follow me",

61
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:45,745
"and your urologist
will be buying himself a new yacht."

62
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,705
They explained
the returns policy, right?

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,951
It's worse than video games.

64
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,249
I'm not changing my mind.

65
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,922
Could be
post-concussion syndrome.

66
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,882
Not without a pre-concussion.

67
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,133
Pick a number.

68
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,259
For what?

69
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,136
Cuddy pool. She got the nod.

70
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,763
Little tweaker's due
in fourteen days.

71
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,015
That's great news. I think.

72
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,100
It's good news.

73
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:10,186
The great news is she insisted
that she's not gonna change her mind,

74
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,313
which means she's actually
thought about changing her mind,

75
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,438
which means she's not sure
she's ready to be a mom,

76
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,043
which means
she's not ready to be a mom,

77
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,670
which means
she's gonna change her mind.

78
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,153
The only question is when.

79
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,990
$100 buy-in, less than seven means
the next seven days.

80
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,325
But she's been dying for a kid
for three years.

81
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,690
No way she's gonna
back out now.

82
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,120
Not one of the options.

83
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,167
Mini strokes can cause
blackouts and memory loss.

84
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,837
Nine hours is a lot of time
to be out for a mini stroke.

85
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,672
And there'd be
residual damage on the CT.

86
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,049
The guy works at home
as a consumer product tester.

87
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,802
He could've been exposed to a toxin
that caused short-term memory loss.

88
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,048
Wouldn't show up on imaging.

89
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,807
A cavernous sinus thrombosis could cause
absence seizures and memory loss.

90
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,517
I'll take seven to fourteen.

91
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:50,685
We have a player.

92
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,894
You just said
it was great news.

93
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,062
Now you want
to bet against her?

94
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,148
It's only great news
if she wants it to be great news.

95
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,025
House knows her better
than any of us.

96
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,193
I'd rather use a pseudonym.

97
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,987
Good thinking.

98
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,198
I say she's gonna
meet the mom and bolt.

99
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,868
I'm going for the early fold.

100
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:12,999
Check his home for toxins,
and his sinuses for thrombosises.

101
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,377
Maybe he OD'd on caffeine.

102
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,380
Apparently he didn't drink the coffee,
just smelled it.

103
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,884
Wow.

104
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,722
Did they just move here?

105
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,015
Six years ago.

106
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,767
This is no way to raise a kid.

107
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,019
He's a single dad.
I'm sure he's doing his best.

108
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,065
Which is why single people
shouldn't have kids.

109
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,830
You got a problem
with what Cuddy's doing?

110
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,984
You think
single mothers can't...

111
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,862
I think the traditional family
is a fraud.

112
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,906
Even married moms
are single moms.

113
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,242
Daddy just pays some bills
and reads just enough bedtime stories

114
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,702
to not kill himself
out of guilt.

115
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:50,828
My dad was great.

116
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,414
- After my mom died, he...
- He might be the exception.

117
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,542
On the other hand,
you are fairly screwed up.

118
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,844
No booze, no meds, no drugs.

119
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,929
And no view.

120
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,848
The building's half empty. He'd rather
a view of the turnpike than the park.

121
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,391
Park views
are probably 50% more.

122
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,061
You're surprised the guy's a pragmatist
after looking at this place?

123
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,438
The guy's not a pragmatist,
he's a flagellant.

124
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,648
Mmm.

125
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,566
Looks like mold.

126
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,955
Mom would have cleaned better.

127
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,002
Exposure to certain types of
mold can cause short-term memory loss.

128
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,504
We're testing both of you.

129
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,256
I feel fine.

130
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,675
I'm sure you are.
We're just being cautious.

131
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,637
So, where do you guys go,
other than home and school?

132
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,223
Nowhere. Dad works at home,
and I go to school.

133
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,017
What about sports,
friends, travel?

134
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,728
Like I said, Dad works at home,
and I go to school.

135
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,484
Must be hard not having
your mom around, huh?

136
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,195
I was only four
when the accident happened.

137
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:09,782
Still, I'm sure you
both miss her sometimes.

138
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,492
Not really.

139
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,956
- You're strong.
- No, I just don't get

140
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,333
what the big deal
about death is, you know?

141
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:22,962
Yeah.

142
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,841
How is she?

143
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,804
Physically, she's fine.
Mentally, she's weird.

144
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,683
I'm sure she's just freaked out
about her dad. Mr. Harmon?

145
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,353
Mr. Harmon?

146
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,563
Where are you going?

147
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,776
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

148
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,486
We haven't finished
with your treatment,

149
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,821
and we're still waiting
on some test results.

150
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:49,864
I have an appointment.

151
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,115
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to reschedule.

152
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,825
I really have to go.

153
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,412
Mr. Harmon,
do you know where you are?

154
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,247
Why are you trying to stop me?

155
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,336
Look at his eyes.

156
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,046
Is he having a seizure?

157
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:09,467
His pupils are responsive.
I think he's asleep.

158
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,100
He was just asleep.
It means no memory loss.

159
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,586
And sleepwalking doesn't kill,
unless he walks out a window.

160
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,939
Sleepwalking's not a diagnosis,
it's a symptom.

161
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,504
As long as we can't
figure out why...

162
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,567
Stress-induced insomnia.
Lots of people sleepwalk.

163
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,320
Not in the middle of the day before
they've even put their head on a pillow.

164
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,571
Could be some
sort of narcolepsy.

165
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,698
Which is caused by...

166
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,408
There's usually
a genetic history.

167
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,785
Or?

168
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,829
If you know the answer,
can you tell us the answer?

169
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:42,333
I don't know the answer.
Which brings us back to "Or?"

170
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,710
Some sort of
environmental trigger.

171
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,212
- Which means?
- It's a toxin.

172
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,338
So we are?

173
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,090
Being led down
an annoying path.

174
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:52,551
I honestly don't know where
this is going. Just following the clues.

175
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,761
We're right back
where we started.

176
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,013
The mold we found
doesn't cause these symptoms,

177
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,391
and there's nothing else
at his home.

178
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,351
- And?
- And you're obnoxious.

179
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,686
He never goes anywhere else.

180
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:02,979
Which we know because?

181
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,355
Because he says so.

182
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,316
Because his daughter says so.
Because they have no reason to lie.

183
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,695
Which proves he never goes
anywhere else

184
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,030
when

185
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,491
he's...

186
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,247
Conscious.

187
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,999
Oh, my God, you're right.

188
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,324
He said he had an appointment.

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,710
Next time, let him keep it.

190
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,963
Send him home,
see where his dreams take him.

191
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,193
Becca?

192
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,194
Dr. Cuddy?

193
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,863
Lisa. Nice to meet you.

194
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,699
- Oh! You want one?
- No, thanks.

195
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,952
I can't stop eating them.
I guess it's, like, a craving.

196
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,830
I must have,
like, a dozen a day.

197
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,249
And this is decaf.

198
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,001
How have you been feeling?

199
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:10,921
Uh... You know,
tired, fat, nervous.

200
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,925
Is there anything
you want to ask me?

201
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:18,054
Yeah, actually,
I just have one question.

202
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,932
What are you going to call her?

203
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,559
I'm not sure.

204
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,436
It's all been rather sudden,
you know?

205
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,854
I like Joy.

206
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,650
But as I said,
I haven't really decided yet.

207
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,904
Well, is there anything
you want to ask me?

208
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,489
It's okay.

209
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,994
The agency website is filled
with prospective parents.

210
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,759
There are their photos,
their biographies.

211
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,082
There're so many
wonderful people out there.

212
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:47,625
Wonderful couples.

213
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,795
Why did I choose a single mom?

214
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,633
My grandmother was married for 37 years
to a man that treated her like garbage,

215
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:58,219
and my mom would've stayed married
to my loser dad that long,

216
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,678
but he dumped her.

217
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:00,930
You know, I never understood

218
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,682
how you could fall for the same crap
as your mother.

219
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,601
Then I met Tony.

220
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,898
When I read your bio,
a doctor, a head of a hospital.

221
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,109
When I saw your picture...

222
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,155
I don't want her
raised by a loser.

223
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,207
How long have you had
that rash?

224
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,126
I don't know, a few days.

225
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,585
Have you had any joint pain?

226
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,004
Yeah, I'm pregnant.
All my joints hurt.

227
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,006
They shouldn't all hurt.

228
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:36,966
Have you been using?

229
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,300
Not in seven months.

230
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,845
Not since I found out
I was pregnant.

231
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,266
That needs to be checked out.

232
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,276
You sure
you don't want children?

233
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,946
You know, just because we're stuck here,
and I'm lying down,

234
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,865
doesn't mean
we need to get deep.

235
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,631
You're afraid you'll make the same
mistake you made with your wife?

236
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,704
Get caught taking some other kid
to a ball game?

237
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,414
I like my life as it is.

238
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:10,916
Alpha waves increasing.

239
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,042
Any change in demeanor?

240
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,003
No, nothing. He just got up.

241
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,922
Maybe it's a result
of a blood pressure change.

242
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,758
Delta waves. Out of nowhere.

243
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,345
He's now asleep.

244
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,764
Brain's supposed
to turn off motor function.

245
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,641
If the brain was doing
what it was supposed to be doing,

246
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,311
we wouldn't be here.
He's leaving. Come on.

247
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,232
She's 38 weeks.
You think it's Fifth disease?

248
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,918
- What's that?
- It's a viral infection.

249
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:37,943
It can infect the fetus.

250
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,778
Usually in the first
20 weeks of pregnancy,

251
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,697
and in women who have trouble
with their immune system.

252
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,241
History of drug use could have
compromised her immune system.

253
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,827
I told you I haven't used anything
in seven months.

254
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,662
It does look more
like a heat rash to me.

255
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,958
Yes, well, maybe we want to look
at the actual blood tests.

256
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,960
Of course.

257
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,214
- Does she work for you?
- Yeah.

258
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,008
Everybody here works for you?

259
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,346
When this happens for real,
are you okay to deliver here?

260
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,348
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

261
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,643
Blood work's normal.

262
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,894
Test it again.

263
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,729
Tested it twice.

264
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,898
I'll get you some topical cream
for that rash.

265
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,275
I'm admitting her.

266
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,560
There's nothing wrong with her.

267
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,655
There are dozens of other things
this rash could indicate.

268
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,448
I want a full fetal workup.

269
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,411
You're losing it.
That's what happens when you have kids.

270
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:33,415
Ceaseless crying and nagging
leads to irrational fears.

271
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,085
It's impressive that you didn't wait
for the actual crying and nagging.

272
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,088
She had a lace-patterned rash,
joint pain and a history of drug abuse.

273
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,965
You would've done
exactly the same thing.

274
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,508
And I'd be an excellent father.

275
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,011
Hey, what are you doing?

276
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,388
Baby barf.

277
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,807
Maternity ward was
handing out free samples.

278
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:52,810
Well played, sir.

279
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,187
You leave me
no choice but to change.

280
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,689
My clothes, not my mind.

281
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:57,982
That's exactly my point.

282
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,108
It's not gonna be me and a cup.

283
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,317
It's gonna be
eight times a day.

284
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,820
If you can't handle wearing that stain,
you can't handle a baby.

285
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,280
Why do you even care?

286
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,156
It's not like I'm ever
gonna ask you to baby-sit.

287
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,950
I'm a humanitarian.

288
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,708
We should stop him.

289
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,667
The whole point was to...

290
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,502
Let him plow into
some innocent bystander?

291
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,589
His legs are working.
Obviously his eyes are working, too.

292
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,090
His reaction time
could be slower.

293
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,049
He's stopping.

294
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,593
Yeah, I see.

295
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,637
He's having sleep sex.

296
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,805
Maybe.

297
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,016
- Pull up to her.
- I know.

298
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,109
What'd that guy want?

299
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,694
Piss off.

300
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,362
Go after him.
She's not a hooker.

301
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,447
How do you know?

302
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,865
Do you want me
to describe the clues,

303
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,660
or do you want to stop him before he
finishes off the drugs he just bought?

304
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,009
Apparently, Rip's a coke fiend.

305
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,562
So, Sleeping Beauty
has a jones for Snow White.

306
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,732
Coke explains the narcolepsy,
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

307
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,360
But it doesn't explain the rip
in the space-time continuum.

308
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,404
Coke leads to sleepwalking,
which leads to coke,

309
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,697
which leads to sleepwalking.

310
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,199
What caused
the first sleepwalking?

311
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,925
The coke he took
while he was wide awake.

312
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,327
- He says he didn't.
- Wouldn't be the first time

313
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,703
somebody lied about drug use.

314
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,913
He has no reason to lie.

315
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,207
He knows he's sick,
his job doesn't drug test,

316
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,084
no relationship,
his daughter wouldn't find out.

317
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,543
Maybe he just forgot.

318
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,674
Forgot he did cocaine?
You're going with forgot over lying?

319
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,300
It fits.

320
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,388
Cocaine explains the narcolepsy,
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

321
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,557
Whatever's in the cocaine other than
the cocaine explains the memory loss.

322
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,603
Dealers cut that stuff
with all kinds of garbage.

323
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,187
Great. We'll start him on immediate
treatment for "all kinds of garbage."

324
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,730
You can narrow it down
in the lab.

325
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,695
Not without a sample.

326
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:04,191
So get a sample.

327
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,277
You want us to score cocaine
from a drug dealer?

328
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:08,445
It's exciting.

329
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,530
It's a felony.

330
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,115
It's necessary.

331
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,914
There she is.
Amniotic fluid looks good.

332
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,875
Good fetal movement,
heart's beating nicely.

333
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,051
- What?
- It looks like pulmonary hypoplasia.

334
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,344
What's that?

335
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,179
The baby's lungs
are underdeveloped.

336
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,639
She won't be able
to breathe on her own.

337
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,391
- She might die?
- I don't know.

338
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,196
If she was born today,
she'd be in trouble,

339
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,829
but we're not going
to let that happen.

340
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,656
We'll put you on magnesium
to prevent labor,

341
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,440
and steroids to grow the lungs.

342
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,109
It's a good thing
Dr. Cuddy brought you in.

343
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,705
How do you know what
a drug dealer looks like?

344
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,575
I'm not doing drugs,
if that's what you're asking.

345
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,286
I just noticed that she had cash
in her hand. Obviously came from him.

346
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,621
Obviously didn't have enough time
to perform any other services.

347
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:00,748
I didn't notice
her holding any...

348
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,416
Mmm. There she is.

349
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,964
We're not cops.

350
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,174
Cops aren't allowed to say that,
right?

351
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,550
Yeah, they can say it.

352
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,509
Oh!

353
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:16,221
But if you were a cop, you'd know that.
What do you want?

354
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,206
I'd like to buy some cocaine,
please.

355
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,228
Definitely not a cop.

356
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,321
Thank you.

357
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,405
Wait.

358
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,081
- It's good.
- Glad you like it. Now can we go?

359
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,626
No.
You gave us the wrong stuff.

360
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,085
What are you talking about?
You got my best.

361
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,852
I know. I don't want the good,
"get the new customer hooked" stuff.

362
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,800
I want the stepped-on, "keep the old
customer coming back for more" stuff.

363
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,051
Are you crazy, bitch?

364
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,053
No, I'm just a bitch
who knows what she wants.

365
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,020
Looks like this kid thing
is really working out for you.

366
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,314
All of the shopping,
none of the stretch marks.

367
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,732
Not a good time.

368
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,651
Right. Kid's getting worse.

369
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,238
Blessing in disguise,
although completely predictable.

370
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,157
If you take in strays,
don't be surprised by the worms.

371
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,482
I'm still wearing the sweater.

372
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,203
I didn't say you weren't stubborn,
I said you weren't maternal.

373
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,497
Thank you. Go away.

374
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,666
- You're getting crankier.
- Baby's sick.

375
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,626
Sorry I'm not
finding the fun in that.

376
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,839
Is it really worth it? Just for
the pursuit of unconditional love?

377
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,175
Only you could see
that as a bad thing.

378
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,510
It's a fake thing.

379
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,304
There's no unconditional love,
it's just unconditional need.

380
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,307
Don't make this child a victim
of your biological clock.

381
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,725
Victim?

382
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,395
You think
she's better off staying...

383
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,688
Yes.

384
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:50,774
'Cause at least she knows
she's not qualified for the job.

385
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,617
Let me guess. I'm gonna tell her
not to play ball in the house,

386
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,578
- but she's not gonna listen.
- No.

387
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:06,248
Actually, I was going for she sneaks
her boyfriend in while you're sleeping,

388
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,694
and he wants
to do it on the desk,

389
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,461
and at first she says no,
but she has issues with self-esteem...

390
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,462
You know you're
gonna pay for that.

391
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,257
I'm paying for it
right now with wisdom.

392
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,011
Get out.

393
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,232
We found lactose.
The coke was cut with milk powder.

394
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,483
Makes it nutritious.

395
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:34,985
Not much of a toxin.

396
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,653
It is if he's allergic to milk.

397
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:37,946
He's not.
There's milk in his fridge.

398
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,406
How does he like his coffee?

399
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,771
I don't know. What does that...

400
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,743
What type of cereal's
in the cabinet?

401
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,370
Cocoa something. Why?
What does it matter?

402
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,372
He likes his coffee black.
Milk's for the kid.

403
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,332
How can you be sure?

404
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,501
Because if he drank the milk,
he'd know that he's lactose intolerant.

405
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,670
Ask him, then treat him
for allergic reaction.

406
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,049
If he gets better,
we all get to go home early.

407
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,803
Steroids make you
more prone to infection.

408
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,557
You'll have to stay here for the next
two weeks, so we can monitor you.

409
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,853
The baby's lungs,
is that because of the meth?

410
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:11,730
Could be.

411
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,108
You must hate me.

412
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:26,036
If you had done everything right in
your life, I wouldn't be getting a baby.

413
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,459
You're not scared?

414
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,627
I am scared.

415
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,422
You got, like,
this perfect life.

416
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,258
Not yet.

417
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,179
What's that?

418
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,847
Heart rate's climbing.

419
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,809
What's wrong with her?

420
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,437
It's not the baby, it's you.

421
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,569
I need two units
of O-negative, stat!

422
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,042
The mother had a Stage Two
placental abruption, she's losing blood.

423
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,338
So, deliver the baby.

424
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,257
Lungs are 10 weeks premature.

425
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,431
So, deliver now, risk the baby.

426
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,099
Deliver later, risk the mom.

427
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,562
It's not your baby yet,
it's not your call.

428
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,064
She'll do whatever
I tell her to do.

429
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,026
Self-worth issues...
That's genetic, you know.

430
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,614
You should deliver now.

431
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,285
Right.

432
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,997
Are you serious?

433
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,542
You're not? You just told me...

434
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,918
The wrong answer.

435
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,284
You can give the mom
more blood.

436
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,588
You can't give the fetus
more lungs.

437
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:00,672
The lungs might work.

438
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,507
It's the right decision,
medically.

439
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,551
And yet, you're here.

440
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,639
To get your opinion,
not to get jerked around.

441
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,558
See, this is what's
screwed up here.

442
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,101
You're not sure
that this is the right call,

443
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,427
but you are sure that this is
what you want to tell her.

444
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,398
And that scares you
because your motives aren't medical.

445
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,610
Some part of you
doesn't want this baby,

446
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,695
and that part wants
to tell her to kill it.

447
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,283
This is an impossible situation.

448
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,161
I'm advising her
to take the safest route.

449
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,704
Right.

450
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,874
Doesn't explain why
you changed your sweater.

451
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,433
I need your advice.

452
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,394
It's not cancer.

453
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,815
Wow! Can you remove spleens
with your mind, too?

454
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,776
You're here to talk about Cuddy.
The file is a pretext.

455
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,445
Why the hell haven't you come
to talk to me about Cuddy?

456
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,572
I've been doing
all sorts of insane stuff.

457
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,700
If she can't handle your insanity,
she can't handle a baby.

458
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,786
That's exactly my point.

459
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,953
No, it isn't.

460
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,580
You're feeling threatened
because she's going on to high school

461
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,666
and leaving you behind
to repeat the 8th grade.

462
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,502
She's sleeping with her math teacher
to get her diploma.

463
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,796
Adoption is cheating?
Are they giving her a fake kid?

464
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,464
That's the problem.

465
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,841
She gets to have
a relationship with a kid,

466
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,176
but she can't handle
one with an adult.

467
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,053
So she's gonna kill it.

468
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,805
That does seem cleaner.

469
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,892
I've seen the file.
She's making a judgment call.

470
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,894
Decisions are never made
in a vacuum.

471
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,106
Just like your decision
to make her miserable.

472
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,483
You're doing this because
we no longer have inkwells,

473
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,694
and Cuddy doesn't
have pigtails.

474
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,242
Why do you think I did that?

475
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,876
How you doing?

476
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,669
Not sure.

477
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,963
Been keeping an eye on the clock,
like you said.

478
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,423
I don't think I lost any time.

479
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,841
The machinery agrees with you.

480
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,510
That means your problems
were caused by the coke.

481
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,928
Can't believe I did coke.

482
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,138
You were asleep.

483
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,307
I chose to do coke.

484
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,350
In your sleep.
You weren't responsible.

485
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,519
Something inside me
wanted to do it.

486
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,730
Something inside of me
didn't think it was wrong.

487
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,148
It's like a dream.

488
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,713
We all do stuff in our dreams
we wouldn't do when we're awake.

489
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,110
I don't.

490
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,658
What's that?

491
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,333
Did I fall asleep
and hurt myself?

492
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,585
I don't see any cuts.

493
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,253
'Cause there aren't any.

494
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,796
I think

495
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,799
you're sweating blood.

496
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:57,390
The guy is bleeding out of his pores.
What does that tell us?

497
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:01,269
Other than you don't want to play
basketball against him, and he's dying.

498
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,188
That neither cocaine
or allergies are the answer.

499
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,273
It's gotta be systemic.
Hemorrhagic virus maybe?

500
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,608
You think it's Ebola?

501
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,527
His white blood cell count would be
through the roof. It's not an infection.

502
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,905
- DIC?
- Coags are normal.

503
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,783
It's cancer.
Leukemia explains everything.

504
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,243
- No fever.
- The bleeding.

505
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,489
- No weight loss.
- The rash.

506
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,828
- No headaches.
- The fatigue.

507
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,622
Leukemia would be obvious
from the CBC.

508
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,041
Leukemia has false negatives
all the time.

509
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,882
So, we have four reasons for leukemia,
four reasons against.

510
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,259
You only need one against.

511
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:37,055
Yeah, if we had one reason for anything
else. Go do a bone marrow biopsy.

512
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,897
What would you do?

513
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,026
I think...

514
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,071
I think you should wait.

515
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:57,158
But if I wait, I could die.

516
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,703
There would be more danger
for you, but...

517
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,539
Is this your opinion
as a doctor,

518
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,374
as a mother?

519
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,126
It's my medical opinion.

520
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,652
It's my personal opinion.
I don't...

521
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,630
I don't wanna wait.

522
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,678
It might only be one week.
We will keep you on plasma.

523
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,848
This is not my baby.

524
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:24,978
I already sacrificed nine months
for this stupid mistake.

525
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:30,066
I don't wanna
sacrifice any more.

526
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:36,072
Becca, you asked my opinion because
you wanted to do the right thing.

527
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:39,951
You are giving up this baby because
you don't want to make the mistakes

528
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,787
your mom made, her mom made.

529
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:48,168
You have a chance to break this cycle,
to do something great for this baby.

530
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,799
No.

531
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,227
I need you to hold still.

532
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,981
Wait.

533
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:16,071
You been testing
any tanning creams or sprays?

534
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,238
No.

535
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,826
It's not a tan.
Means it's not leukemia.

536
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,211
Chem panel
confirms kidney failure, end stage.

537
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,420
Got him on dialysis?

538
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,922
BP's too low.

539
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:37,717
Too bad. Would have been nice to have
more than an hour to solve this thing.

540
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,843
Haemachromatosis?

541
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,346
- He have tiny testes?
- No. Scleroderma.

542
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,723
His skin's darker, not lighter.

543
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,101
As much fun as 20 Questions
tends to be,

544
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,353
he's blowing blood
out of every orifice.

545
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,729
You think it just
might be vascular?

546
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,439
Vasculitis?

547
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,819
If I said it might be vitas gerular,
would you have said Vitas Gerulaitis?

548
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,446
Test him for vasculitis.
Angio and blood.

549
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,699
Even if we're right,
he's going to need a kidney transplant.

550
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,493
- Test the daughter.
- She's 12.

551
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,870
Small kidney?
It just means he won't pee as much.

552
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,038
Great for road trips.

553
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,415
I meant she's a minor,

554
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,584
and Daddy has a conflict,
so we're gonna need Cuddy's sign-off.

555
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,544
So get it.

556
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,004
She's kind of busy.

557
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,094
Clamp.

558
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,812
Suction.

559
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,899
Entering the abdominal cavity.

560
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,778
There's the head.

561
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,410
Got a minute?

562
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,787
- Get out of here.
- Who's that?

563
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,164
Dr. Gregory House.

564
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,541
He's the one you'll be suing
when you develop sepsis.

565
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,625
Well, why is he here?

566
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,544
Better question is,
why is she here?

567
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,629
You're an administrator,
administrate.

568
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:58,423
My patient's daughter
needs a guardian ad litem.

569
00:29:58,548 --> 00:29:59,757
- That's it.
- Tests are inconclusive,

570
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,759
- but either way, he's gonna need...
- House, get out!

571
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,386
This doesn't need you, I do.

572
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,679
Head's out.

573
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,309
- Later.
- Later's too late.

574
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,939
And there she is.

575
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,027
Come on, cry.

576
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,322
There we go.

577
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,617
Come on.

578
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:33,082
Come on. Joy, cry!

579
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,418
Cry,

580
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,003
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,672
I'm so sorry.

582
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,846
That's a sound we like to hear.

583
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,765
Apgar's 9 out of 10.

584
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,142
You hear that?

585
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,103
You just got your first A.

586
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,112
She's yours now.

587
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,626
Mazel tov.

588
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,503
Now it's time to say those magic words

589
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,588
you'll be telling her
for the rest of her life,

590
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,966
"Mommy's gotta go to work."

591
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,223
Have the risks of the transplant
procedure been explained to you?

592
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:33,184
Damn it! I was hoping
you weren't going to ask her that.

593
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,603
Of course she knows.
Can you just sign the paperwork?

594
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:40,316
Dr. House explained to you that all
surgeries carry risks? You could die.

595
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,151
And if you don't do it,
Daddy will die.

596
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,528
Stop pressuring her.

597
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,697
Sorry.
Daddy's perfectly healthy.

598
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,282
But we want you to give him
the kidney anyway,

599
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,701
'cause it'd be cool
if he had three.

600
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:52,120
Shut up.

601
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,916
Do you understand the risks
of living with one kidney?

602
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,875
Yeah.

603
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,961
And you still want to proceed
with the transplant?

604
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:00,878
Yeah.

605
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,427
Okay. Go ahead.

606
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,684
No.

607
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,477
I'm saying you can proceed.

608
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,937
And I'm saying I can't.

609
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,944
Whatever he has, she has, too.

610
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,031
She's sleepwalking.

611
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,121
If we don't give him
a new kidney, he's dead in a week.

612
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,581
We have to transplant.

613
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,583
When your remote
has a dead battery,

614
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,753
you don't replace it
with another dead battery.

615
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,713
Whatever's killing
the dad's kidneys

616
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,078
is going to kill
the kid's, too.

617
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,092
It is possible the sleep issues
aren't medically related.

618
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:51,095
Maybe they're both insomniacs
due to the turnpike noise,

619
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,139
maybe they both drink
too much coffee, maybe...

620
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,474
House is right.

621
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,433
How do you know?

622
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,852
Because the daughter
is sweating blood.

623
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,229
But if they have the same thing,
it means there has to be a common cause,

624
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,982
which means it has to be a toxin,
infection or genetic.

625
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,443
And since we've ruled out
infections and toxins...

626
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,321
It narrows it down to any one
of a dozen genetic disorders,

627
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,698
each of which takes
more than a week to run.

628
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,618
Call Foreman, get to work.

629
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,416
<i>Cuddy is positively aglow.</i>

630
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:24,003
What's your theory, she's only
acting happy to make you miserable?

631
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,172
I need a genetic disease.

632
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,757
I'm sure you're carrying a few.

633
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:31,719
Symptoms are kidney failure,
bleeding and insomnia.

634
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,388
You paid off the pool?

635
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,182
Technically,
anyone who didn't enter is a winner.

636
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,517
It's not over yet.

637
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:39,762
Everyone's happy
until they unwrap that pretty present

638
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,972
and find they got a wall clock
in the shape of Africa.

639
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,148
Adoption's a cheat, remember?

640
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,735
There's no real pregnancy, so
there's no stranded dopamine receptors,

641
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,405
so there's no
post-partum depression.

642
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,491
Cuddy will be the happiest
new mother you've ever seen.

643
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,579
I've just given you
the answer, haven't I?

644
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,126
And now you're going to walk out of here
without saying a word.

645
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:05,628
Nope.

646
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:12,260
Good news.
I know what you have,

647
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,345
and you're both gonna be fine.

648
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,432
What? Are you serious?

649
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,892
Yes, and no.

650
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,394
So you do know what they have?

651
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,562
Yeah.

652
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,480
But they
aren't going to be fine.

653
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,816
No idea. They might be.

654
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,526
Why the hell
would you say they were?

655
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,069
To make them happy.

656
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,446
For two seconds?

657
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:34,449
Technically,
to see if they can be happy.

658
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:38,703
I should have seen a grin,
a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.

659
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,288
They're sick, they're tired.

660
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:41,581
They're anhedonic.

661
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,374
Incapable of
experiencing pleasure.

662
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,419
Something's bushwhacked
their dopamine receptors.

663
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,337
They're depressed.
Mom's dead, Dad's dying.

664
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,716
You should know that being bummed
isn't necessarily a pathology.

665
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,552
Being bummed doesn't explain
their lack of friends,

666
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:56,220
or their indifference
to each other.

667
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,307
Why their place had no music,
no view, no decor.

668
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,225
But if you can't feel pleasure,
what's with the cocaine?

669
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,854
Really? Is that why you do drugs?
'Cause you're happy?

670
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:06,981
Most people do them
'cause they wanna be happy.

671
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,025
His subconscious
craved it, needed it.

672
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,402
The most common cause of anhedonia
is schizophrenia.

673
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,653
Sure, in white folk.

674
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,238
They're black?

675
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,993
They're liars.

676
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,206
What's your name?

677
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,832
Jerry Harmon.

678
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:31,839
Your real name.
Hosarian? Herzog? H'Ali-Baba?

679
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,509
Hammoud.

680
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,306
Jamal Hammoud.

681
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:44,185
Changed it when we invaded Iraq,
the first time.

682
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,479
How did you know?

683
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:49,857
You and your daughter have
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

684
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,444
It's a genetic disease contracted
by people of Mediterranean descent.

685
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,364
Sephardic Jews,
Armenians, Arabs.

686
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:00,743
Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney
failure, even lactose intolerance.

687
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,162
Symptoms are set off
by age and stress.

688
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:06,541
Kid couldn't get happy, but she could
get stressed by Daddy dying.

689
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,042
You don't know
if we'll get better?

690
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:12,964
Treatment tends to be hit and miss,
once you reach the sweating blood stage.

691
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,217
Start them on colchicine
and melphalan.

692
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,553
His kidneys are fried.

693
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,222
If he doesn't have FMF,
the colchicine will kill him.

694
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,057
Boy, I sure hope I'm right.

695
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,770
Mr. Harmon?

696
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,858
Mr. Harmon,
I need you to open your eyes.

697
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,779
Feeling better?

698
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,878
How's Samantha?

699
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,963
Healthy enough
to toss you a kidney.

700
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,092
- Dad?
- Sammy.

701
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,156
Baby's doing great.

702
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,201
Lull

703
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,579
I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

704
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:12,458
I was stupid and selfish.

705
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,878
- You were scared.
- Yeah. But you wouldn't have been.

706
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:17,588
That's not true.

707
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,758
Well, I mean,
you would have been scared,

708
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:24,136
but you would have done
the right thing anyway.

709
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,890
And I wanna be like that.

710
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:33,980
I don't wanna be a loser.

711
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,982
You're not a loser.

712
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:42,029
When I saw you hold her,
and the look on your face,

713
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:46,033
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

714
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,081
And that's when I realized

715
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,959
I can't...

716
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,091
Becca.

717
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:08,597
My life, it's always been
about pain and anger and disappointment,

718
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,725
never about love.

719
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,520
And that's when I realized,
you know, it could be.

720
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,939
And I can't give that away.

721
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,860
Becca, don't do this.

722
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,913
What you're feeling is natural,

723
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,419
but you're filled with hormones
and emotion and fear.

724
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,881
And you just can't make a huge decision
like this right now,

725
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,175
you have to give it some time.

726
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,137
I'm so sorry.

727
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,019
It's a decision
that changes everything.

728
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,024
Changes the rest of your life.

729
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,862
I hope so.

730
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,227
It's really not the greatest time
for gloating.

731
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:27,611
There's more than one baby
in the sea.

732
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:31,699
The world is full of teenage boys
riding bareback.

733
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,409
No.

734
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:37,997
I'm done.
I can't go through that again.

735
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:39,999
You're quitting?

736
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:41,333
Just like you quit NF?

737
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,419
Yeah. Just like that.

738
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,337
There, you just did it again.

739
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,469
It's too bad.

740
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:56,182
You would have made
a great mother.

741
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,105
You son of a bitch.

742
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,609
When I was getting a baby,
you told me I'd suck as a mother.

743
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:10,905
Now that I've lost it,
you tell me I'd be great as a mother.

744
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,783
Why do you need
to negate everything?

745
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,873
I don't know.

746
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,819
Good night.

747
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,326
Good night.
