1
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,856
Bye.

2
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:32,409
I want to be
alone with my wife.

3
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,591
I'm a selfish SOB.

4
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,888
I never got you to Rio.

5
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,433
There was always

6
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,145
one more problem at the stores.

7
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,856
You deserved better than that.

8
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,900
I love you.

9
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,654
I always have.

10
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,119
I'm ready.

11
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,954
It's okay.

12
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,086
I know...

13
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,783
Somebody

14
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,327
help her.

15
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,164
Help her!

16
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,188
Fifty-four-year-old woman with acute
respiratory failure.

17
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,702
No anaphylaxis, lung issues
or tracheal lesions.

18
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,871
Tox screen was clean for coke
and amphetamines.

19
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:46,543
I will give you 30 reasons, one for each
pound that caused the apnea,

20
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,753
which inflamed the epiglottis.

21
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,173
Why's our rainbow coalition
missing Brown and Bi?

22
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,759
Thirteen's with the patient,
and Kutner's dog's sick.

23
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,885
He should be in by lunch.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,847
No apnea because no sleeping problems
when she's sleeping.

25
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:00,212
She's spent the last six months

26
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,392
caring for her husband who's dying
of heart failure.

27
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,686
Reason 31, whatever whacked
the husband's heart

28
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,729
is also whacking her airway.

29
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,024
And, oh, good, I thought maybe Kutner
was home nursing the rib you broke

30
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,069
when you elbowed your way
in for credit on the last patient.

31
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,948
I contributed. And the patient's illness
wasn't caused by her husband,

32
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,658
unless lung cancer
is contagious.

33
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,034
Interesting.

34
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,412
Not about the patient,
that was kind of dull.

35
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,582
I thought maybe you were lying
to cover for Kutner, which sounds noble,

36
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,918
except you're doing it
out of guilt, instead of love.

37
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,671
She visited her sister
in Hawaii about six months ago,

38
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:32,797
just before
her husband got sick.

39
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,717
Could've picked up
melioidosis from one of the islands.

40
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,218
Would have jumped
to the husband,

41
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,888
finished off him
and his lame immune system.

42
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,140
No tumors,
no drugs, no bacteria...

43
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,225
Leaves viral. Varicella zoster.

44
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,311
Start her on IV fluids
and acyclovir.

45
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,146
Can't. She's demanding
to be released

46
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,632
so she can get
home to her husband.

47
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,941
How sweet.
They can die together,

48
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,985
instead of separately,
40 years apart.

49
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,530
She claims he got stronger
as soon as she stopped breathing.

50
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,823
The mind can heal the body.

51
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,327
Seeing his wife in distress might have
actually slowed down his death.

52
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,329
Or he just had
an adrenaline surge

53
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,706
when he saw his chance
to hit the singles market.

54
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,583
- Send her home.
- We don't need to.

55
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:12,378
I had an idea, all by myself.

56
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,470
Eddie?

57
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,388
Found him loitering
in the lobby.

58
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,098
You're still with me.

59
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,892
Where the hell else
am I gonna go?

60
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,269
And now, with your permission,

61
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,438
we'd like to try
to make you better.

62
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,657
The pageant starts in
an hour. You have to do something.

63
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,343
There's something wrong
inside her head.

64
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,953
It's like she has no idea
what's going on around her.

65
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,705
I thought she was just
flirting with me.

66
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,794
I could fix it,
but it's gonna cost you $3.75.

67
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,297
Well, I'm not
just gonna give you my coffee.

68
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,593
Think of it
as Costa Rican sober juice.

69
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,805
She's drunk?

70
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,600
That little minty scent
hiding beneath the rose petal perfume,

71
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,560
and the cherry blossom
moisturizer,

72
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,688
and the morning dew
hairspray...

73
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,607
You sneak into Mommy's bathroom

74
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,192
and gulp some of her mouthwash?

75
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,277
Gotta be perfect.

76
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,196
You spit it out?

77
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,656
Mommy doesn't.

78
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,868
Treatment worked.

79
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:28,121
Charlotte's breathing's back to normal.
She's being discharged.

80
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,040
She can resume her vigil over her
husband. He's started fading again.

81
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,750
Win some, lose some.

82
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,421
And, strictly speaking,
since he's not my patient, win some.

83
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:37,964
Oh, look at the time.

84
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,800
It's half past Taub
was lying about Kutner.

85
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,219
He probably went to
a comic book fest,

86
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,471
spent the night at some
Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll...

87
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,765
Find out what,
or who, he's doing.

88
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,930
Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to
write it under "Reason for Termination."

89
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,688
- Is that Kutner?
- Charlotte.

90
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,191
O2 sat and S-T are normal.
It's not her airway.

91
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:00,820
You're okay.

92
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,656
Yeah, don't worry about me,
she's in pain.

93
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,576
Pulse is rapid and regular,
no fluid in her lungs.

94
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,744
What's happening?

95
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:09,662
I don't know.

96
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,752
Kutner. It's Foreman and 13.

97
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,047
Where are you going?

98
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,174
House didn't ask us
to find out where he wasn't.

99
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:23,551
If you wanna climb
a fifth-floor fire escape...

100
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,011
This might be faster.

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,850
Kutner!

102
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,062
Man-boy heaven.

103
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,689
Surprised he ever leaves.

104
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,158
There's nothing on his calendar.
His pager's still here.

105
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:53,372
Oh, God.

106
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,675
Need an ambulance
at 410 Willis, apartment 5C.

107
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,053
Twenty-eight-year-old male, single
gunshot wound to the right temple.

108
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,638
No pulse.

109
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,015
Alert Princeton-Plainsboro,
have a trauma unit ready.

110
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,155
His pupils are dilated,
his head's swollen.

111
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,229
Still no pulse.
Come on, Kutner!

112
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:17,897
Let me try.

113
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,907
He's cold.

114
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,078
Eric.

115
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,162
He didn't say anything
to any of you?

116
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,168
Family problems? Bad relationship?
Financial pressures?

117
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:23,171
His parents were shot
right in front of him.

118
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,047
Parents are ancient history.

119
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,383
Not to someone
who actually cares.

120
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:33,472
He didn't slit his wrists and peacefully
drift away, he shot himself.

121
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,227
He didn't leave a note,
that means panic.

122
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,689
Which could've been pre-empted if
the idiots who worked alongside him

123
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,608
for 80 hours a week
had seen this coming.

124
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,109
You're blaming us?

125
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,778
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

126
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:50,907
We would've helped him
if he'd reached out to us. He didn't.

127
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,326
We should've
picked up on something.

128
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,119
This isn't our fault.

129
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,413
Something like 25%
of suicidal people

130
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,415
show no outward signs
of depression.

131
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,169
No, 25% of suicidal people
have friends

132
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,296
who didn't notice anything
and don't want to feel guilty.

133
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:09,050
Killing yourself
also kills all other options.

134
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,469
Makes Kutner an idiot.

135
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,430
So pity, yes, but guilt, no.

136
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,432
If that's what
you want to tell yourself.

137
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,392
We still have a patient.

138
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,563
Actually, two. One worsening,
one who should be worsening.

139
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,358
You can't be in denial
about Kutner and the husband.

140
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,444
It is possible Eddie's body
is willing itself to live.

141
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,321
Well, call the tabloids.

142
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:34,367
Tell them you just witnessed the miracle
of slightly increased kidney function.

143
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:39,205
Maybe we should pass this file off
to another doctor.

144
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,333
And the next one, too?
And the one after that?

145
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,546
How many files till it's okay
that Kutner's dead?

146
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:54,387
Cardiac enzymes means
she didn't have a heart attack.

147
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,556
No vision problems means
no mitochondrial disease.

148
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,850
Could be
a metabolic disorder. Acidosis.

149
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,352
Blood pH was normal.

150
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,563
Polyserositis would inflame
the membranes near her epiglottis

151
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,984
and the heart's pericardium,
causing the chest pain.

152
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,944
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,740
I've hired a grief counselor,
who I'm sure none of you will see.

154
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,385
And I'm offering time off,
which I'm sure none of you will take.

155
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,453
But just know it's available.

156
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,295
Polyserositis fits.
Start her on indomethacin.

157
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,968
If you'd rather
not deal with this case...

158
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm fine, despite
what Wilson will say.

159
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:39,557
He hasn't come to you?

160
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,892
Pretty sure he has Mahjong
Tuesday mornings.

161
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,395
I assume he thinks that I will work
through this better

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,274
if I don't have to keep
flicking his wings off my shoulder.

163
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,559
You didn't even
have an inkling?

164
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,490
I know his fantasy football team
cratered, figured he'd gotten over it.

165
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,161
Well...

166
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,375
Sorry for your loss.

167
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,171
Thanks. It's not my loss.

168
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,798
Then I'm sorry
you don't think it is.

169
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,852
Patient's membranes
aren't going to heal themselves.

170
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,146
Taub went to run the treatment.

171
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,399
We'd like to go
see Kutner's parents.

172
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,487
I'll join you.

173
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,290
Polyserositis damages the protective
covering around tissue and organs.

174
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,542
The indomethacin is simply
an anti-inflammatory,

175
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,960
but it should fix it.

176
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,962
Just make the pain stop.

177
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,466
Charlotte.

178
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,761
Close your eyes.

179
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,098
Now.

180
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,812
Pretend you finally
made it down to Rio.

181
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,606
You're on the balcony of

182
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,694
some fancy hotel.

183
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,407
You never talk like this.

184
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:23,160
Yeah, just shut up
and let me do this.

185
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,872
And you're on that balcony,
and you are watching the Mardi Gras.

186
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,083
It's called Carnival.

187
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,712
And I don't want
to go without you.

188
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,632
I want you to.

189
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,679
And I want it to be everything
you've ever dreamed of.

190
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:47,226
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'd like to run one more test.

191
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,478
On you.

192
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,527
This is the
first day we got him. He was six.

193
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,697
Sweetest little boy
you ever met.

194
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,741
Must have been scary,

195
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,037
going through a trauma, and then
being handed off to a new family.

196
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,541
We kept telling him
to call us Richard and Julia,

197
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,877
but it was always
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

198
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,631
Then, on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

199
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,051
Lawrence always loved
blowing things up.

200
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,599
And he said, "Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad."

201
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,602
That's who we were
from then on.

202
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,192
He was pretty special.
We were lucky to have him.

203
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,571
You spent the most time
with him.

204
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,241
He spoke so highly
of all of you.

205
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,161
Do you have any idea...

206
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,830
I wish we did.

207
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,707
We all...

208
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,626
It was his name.

209
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:58,172
He was conflicted.
Didn't know where he fit in.

210
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:02,343
Being ripped out of his world
and stuck into yours.

211
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,095
We encouraged him
to hold on to his heritage.

212
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:07,681
It's hard
to still be Lawrence Choudhary

213
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,808
when everyone sees you
as Lawrence Kutner.

214
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,394
It was his idea
to take our name.

215
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,355
- You should have said no.
- House.

216
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,775
All his Anglo name gave him was the
illusion that he was someone he wasn't.

217
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,110
You were being emotional,
not rational.

218
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,612
You didn't understand him.

219
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,198
We loved that boy,
you son of a bitch.

220
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,201
You wanted to make him happy
by shutting out his pain.

221
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,246
When he looked happy, you assumed
the pain had gone,

222
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,581
but it just got buried deeper,

223
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,293
leaving him tormented about who he was,
until finally he put a bullet...

224
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,378
House.

225
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,798
Go back to the hospital.

226
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,821
I'm sorry about your son.

227
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,504
Indomethacin had no effect, she's still
in pain. Rules out polyserositis.

228
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,131
I ran a hormone panel on Eddie.

229
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,882
His prolactin's above normal.

230
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,593
Means he's actually improving.

231
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,805
Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons.

232
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,640
Stress, fear, why not love?

233
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,643
Maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

234
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,896
You haven't asked if I learned anything
relevant from the Kutners.

235
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,823
If you had, I'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

236
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,610
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant,

237
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,029
which would mean
you could have saved him.

238
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,281
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

239
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,491
Sometimes you just
don't want help.

240
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,536
Good thing you got some,

241
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,291
or you'd have tried again
and gotten it right.

242
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,086
She doesn't have Wegener's.

243
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,006
Kidney function's normal.

244
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,134
It's not byssinosis,
it's not mitral valve stenosis.

245
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,719
Nothing fits.

246
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,139
If it doesn't fit
any diagnosis,

247
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,433
that just leaves one diagnosis.

248
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,523
I'm Dr. House.

249
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,193
You have hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

250
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,111
His heart is too weak,
yours is too strong.

251
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,613
Good news is it's fixable.

252
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,574
We induce a massive heart attack
and kill off the extra muscle.

253
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,284
You want to give me
a heart attack?

254
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,536
It's only dangerous if your heart
is normal-sized.

255
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,538
- But since all the...
- Are you serious?

256
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,791
No.

257
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,169
This is actually very annoying,
and I'm getting really bored

258
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,962
of lying to patients
to scare them

259
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:46,340
into telling me the truth.
She's faking.

260
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,425
And, yes, if she keeps faking,

261
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,761
I'm going to eventually do something
that will kill her.

262
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,098
How could she be...
The windpipe thing?

263
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,266
That was real.
The treatment made her better.

264
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,268
But good for her was bad for you,
which was bad for her,

265
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,562
so she made herself bad.
It's all so simple.

266
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:04,483
She figured that the sicker she was,
the longer you'd hang on.

267
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,444
Charlotte?

268
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,285
We haven't been
this close for years.

269
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,454
I wanted to hang on to that.

270
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,041
Oh, please.

271
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,918
People hate reruns.

272
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,254
It's my leg.
I swear, this is real.

273
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,507
Do you pinky swear or you just
plain swear, because...

274
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,467
How can she fake that?

275
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,472
She can't.

276
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:45,441
So, what can shred an epiglottis
and make muscle disappear?

277
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,444
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

278
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,530
They caused Kutner's death,
why not Charlotte's?

279
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:55,451
Mourning period's over.
Foreman's sense of irony is back.

280
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,661
I was wrong
about the ethnic reason.

281
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,664
Step one,
change your name back.

282
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,959
Step two,
if step one fails, move to Bangalore.

283
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:08,005
Step 14,
if step 13 doesn't work, kill yourself.

284
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,450
So, what now? You gonna insult your way
through his rolodex

285
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,717
till you find someone
with an answer?

286
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,262
I've been polite to the friends I've
called, all of whom were useless.

287
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,223
They weren't useless, they just didn't
know anything more than we did.

288
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,308
Tomato, tomato.

289
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,644
MS. Weakens myelin sheath,
compromises nerve conduction.

290
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,814
I'm talking about Charlotte,
the one who's still alive.

291
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,109
You two,
stick her in an MRI, confirm MS,

292
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,986
and you, run the echo on Eddie

293
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,488
that you're planning
to do behind my back

294
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,364
to see if
his heart's improving.

295
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,245
Did you let me hire a pervert?

296
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,331
Well, it'd be hypocritical
of me not to.

297
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:45,501
Kutner's police background check
from when he started.

298
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,586
He was charged with
indecent exposure.

299
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,255
Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth
football game.

300
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,425
Precisely the kind of thing
you'd expect him to do.

301
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,968
It's okay.

302
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,054
You should be upset.

303
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,890
He thought like you,
pushed boundaries like you.

304
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,809
If he thought like me,

305
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,602
he'd have known that
living in misery

306
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,146
sucks marginally less
than dying in it.

307
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,640
Just a few more minutes,
then we'll get you back to Eddie.

308
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,865
What's it like,
30 years with the same man?

309
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,703
Great for me,
good for him, I hope.

310
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,082
What, you don't think
he loves you?

311
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,459
I think he always
loved me, in his way.

312
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,295
Just notin a "spend time
with me "or "show emotion"

313
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,799
or "any affection
for me" sort of way.

314
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,010
W“)! Did you stay?

315
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,224
I didn't need him to feel about me
the way I did about him.

316
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,979
Love doesn't...

317
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,564
Charlotte?

318
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,238
I've heard stories
of cancer patients

319
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,992
going into
spontaneous remission.

320
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,411
You think this might be
that sort of thing?

321
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,288
It's unlikely,
but you never know.

322
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,958
If I just had a little more time
to be with Charlotte.

323
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,418
Try and do better by her.

324
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,545
Yeah, maybe.

325
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,381
You don't think I mean it.

326
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,800
I think you mean it now.

327
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,803
I think it's much easier to mean it
than to do anything about it.

328
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,648
Chamber walls
are barely moving. I'm sorry.

329
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,291
He needs a friend.

330
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,629
I can't deal with this
and House.

331
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,422
You need a friend, too.

332
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,466
You couldn't give
a crap what I need,

333
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,344
you just want someone
to take care of him.

334
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,352
He told Kutner's parents
it was their fault.

335
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,402
Ruptured spleen.
Means it's not MS.

336
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,489
What are you doing here?

337
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,935
Waiting for you to fix herspleen,

338
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,409
so we can biopsy it
for rheumatoid arthritis.

339
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,827
I'll do it. Go home.

340
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,371
She's not your patient.

341
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,873
And Kutner wasn't my friend.

342
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,627
Kutner wanted to die,
Charlotte doesn't,

343
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,381
so in a contesifor my concern
and interests, she wins.

344
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,633
Okay, either you're
a cold-hearted bastard,

345
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,760
or you're too miserable
to face it.

346
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,428
Go home and cry.

347
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,557
It's not rheumatoid arthritis,
her liver's scarred.

348
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,434
Whatever she's got,
it's spreading.

349
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,496
For the record,

350
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,583
I'm uncomfortable violating
a dead colleague's dignity.

351
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,881
It's only violating
if we find something.

352
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,261
Good to see you.

353
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,305
What are we looking for?

354
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,350
He was hiding.

355
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,228
Why?

356
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,315
Shame? Fear? Are you okay?

357
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,694
It's okay not to be okay.

358
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,574
"Colonial Warrior Blaster.
Number 101 ."

359
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,495
He spent months
tracking this down.

360
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,330
He had passions.

361
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,332
He was obviously in pain.

362
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,711
Does it really matter why?

363
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,299
He hung the bad with the good.

364
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,510
His loss beside a reminder
of what he'd gained.

365
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,014
Means he was open
about the pain.

366
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,644
Should mean that if it got worse,
he had no reason to hide it.

367
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,859
Here's how we're gonna
handle this, House.

368
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,238
We're going to leave here and go
to the closest bar and drink,

369
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,326
tell stories about the time Kutner
almost blew up an OR,

370
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,328
and pass out in our own sick.

371
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,539
Sound like a plan?

372
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,354
What am I missing?

373
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,654
You've got that look.

374
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,781
You figured this out.

375
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,293
You're not here because
you care about Kutner.

376
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,412
You're here
because it's a mystery.

377
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,164
You're here for the puzzle.

378
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,628
What if I didn't miss anything
because there's nothing to miss?

379
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,675
He didn't kill himself.

380
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,220
He was murdered.

381
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,744
Epiglottis, muscle,
spleen, and now her liver,

382
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,331
which is operating at 20%
and deteriorating fast.

383
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,709
Autoimmune hepatitis?
Did you page Foreman?

384
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,170
He took up Cuddy's offer
of time off.

385
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,338
Normal thyroid
means no hepatitis.

386
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:06,673
Could be amyloidosis.

387
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,842
Amyloid build-up
hits the organs, tissue...

388
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,510
Her muscles
wouldn't have atrophied.

389
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,053
You run the echo
on the husband?

390
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,473
Heart's still failing.
The improvement was only temporary.

391
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,184
I prefer the
less subtle answer.

392
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,685
"You were right, House."

393
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,898
So, less time proving
why hubby isn't dead,

394
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,567
more time proving
why Kutner is.

395
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,821
Motives for murder.

396
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,490
House, it was a suicide.

397
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,909
The police have
already investigated.

398
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,120
They investigated what they saw,
not what they didn't saw.

399
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:42,042
Talk to friends, classmates,
pizza delivery guy. Draft Foreman.

400
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,252
- He can make calls through his tears.
- No.

401
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,338
Is that, "No, I'm not calling
my boyfriend"

402
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,174
"who apparently called my boss instead
of me to say he wasn't coming in"?

403
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,927
'Cause it's really not fair to have
that much subtext in one syllable.

404
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,221
We all want to know
why Kutner did it,

405
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,265
but we're not
gonna waste time chasing ghosts.

406
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,520
You're not remotely curious?

407
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,981
Only why a man
who embraces the rational

408
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,025
is suddenly pursuing
the irrational.

409
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,865
She could have
Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.

410
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,825
Run her AAT proteins.

411
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,458
I'd like to be with Eddie.

412
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,460
It's too soon
after your surgery.

413
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:30,382
You can ask if someone
gets your organs if you die, right?

414
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,968
Even if the donor bank
turned them down?

415
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,512
Individual donors can bypass
the registry,

416
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,764
but there are a lot
of other factors.

417
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,267
- Blood type...
- I've given him blood.

418
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,352
- It's not just...
- Please.

419
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:47,565
If I go before him, I want
you to give him my heart.

420
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,487
This isn't over yet.

421
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,781
For me.

422
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,200
But it is for him, isn't it?

423
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,287
Yes.

424
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:07,210
Remy Hadley.
I also answer to 13.

425
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,838
I sometimes sleep with you.

426
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,631
I know I should have called.

427
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,301
I just need some time.

428
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,844
Alone?

429
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,390
I've worked through
a lot of bad stuff in my life,

430
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,350
always done it solo.

431
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,068
So I should go?

432
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,030
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,699
Okay-

434
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:54,049
IT's been trying to close out
Kutner's email account.

435
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,343
Apparently, someone's
still logged on to it.

436
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:59,763
Wasn't hard to figure out
that his password was "Kutner."

437
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,349
He did what
they tell you not to.

438
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,809
- He wasn't murdered.
- But his parents were.

439
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,770
And the guy who
killed them is coming up for parole.

440
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,522
He's coming up for parole,
he's not out on parole.

441
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,567
Kutner testified at
every one of his hearings.

442
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,362
Guy wouldn't be the first
to see the clock ticking...

443
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,405
He was killed by his own gun.

444
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,824
Which he bought years ago,
obviously for self-defense.

445
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,285
- In the temple, cops found residue.
- Right.

446
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,289
A murderer would never try to make it
look like suicide, that'd be unethical.

447
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,838
You haven't asked
about my patient.

448
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,174
You're waiting on
AAT protein results.

449
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,635
Means you checked up to see
that I'm still on it.

450
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,428
You want to transfer the case,

451
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,474
but you won't because you think it's the
only thing that's holding me together.

452
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,975
Well, relax.

453
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,435
Either I'm right or I'm wrong.

454
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,062
We'll know soon enough.

455
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,106
Find what's
killing your patient,

456
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,526
and then I'll find you
another patient.

457
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:00,990
What happened?

458
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:01,950
Nurses found her like this.

459
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,577
She broke into the cart,
injected whatever she could grab.

460
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,246
Dumb way to look
worse for Eddie.

461
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,914
She wasn't trying
to look worse.

462
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,000
She was trying to kill herself.

463
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,257
She's stable, but whatever was
left of her liver

464
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,259
is definitely shot now,

465
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,261
and there's no change in Eddie.

466
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,597
So, thanks to her idiotic move,

467
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:27,559
she's dead in 24 hours
if she doesn't get a new liver.

468
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,061
It was selfless. She loves him.

469
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,813
How does that disagree
with what I just said?

470
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,857
Test was negative
for AAT deficiency.

471
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:37,235
Myelofibrosis fits, but testing
takes at least 48 hours.

472
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,654
We should try
a partial donation from a live donor.

473
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,531
Damage is too severe.
She needs a whole new liver.

474
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:45,243
No diagnosis, no liver.
No liver, no living.

475
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,036
What do you know?

476
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,498
It is myelofibrosis.

477
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,417
Says so right here.

478
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,835
Who wants to tell Cuddy?

479
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,212
How many times have you lied
to the transplant committee?

480
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,213
Just twice.

481
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,798
How many times has it worked?

482
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,717
I don't quite see
how that's relevant.

483
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,432
Cheese it, it's the coppers.

484
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,768
We're not just gonna leave them to die
while you fixate on Kutner.

485
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,438
Technically,
he's not our patient,

486
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,315
so I'm really only
leaving her to die.

487
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,941
We've already explored
the usual options,

488
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,652
shouldn't we at least
explore unusual ones?

489
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,323
Absolutely. Don't worry, this is why
God gave me two ears.

490
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,160
Kutner would say we should just
come clean with Cuddy.

491
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,539
Wow, if only
he were here to say that.

492
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,042
I'm sure Cuddy would be
bound to fall for the old,

493
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,629
"Hey, the dead guy won't mind
that we're wasting..."

494
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:48,306
I need an incurable romantic to talk
to an incurable romantic.

495
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,599
Kutner wasn't murdered.

496
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:53,269
You deduce that by removing your
sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?

497
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:57,690
Suicide means you could have helped him,
murder lets you off the hook.

498
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,947
Needs a liver. Has a liver.

499
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,157
He can make a partial donation.

500
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,619
The faster he agrees,
the faster she gets to not die.

501
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,412
Partial won't be enough,
she needs a whole liver.

502
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,332
And he'd never
survive the procedure.

503
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,253
Nice symmetry, huh?

504
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:23,341
He dies on the table,
you give her his whole liver.

505
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,302
If he's gonna do this,
he's gonna do this for love.

506
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,264
Thought he should talk
to someone who spoke the language.

507
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,685
You want me to
die on the table?

508
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,687
We don't want you to.

509
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,105
Your wife needs you to.

510
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,357
MY heart?

511
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,608
Is still dying.

512
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,819
You have a couple days at most.

513
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,989
But this could buy us
enough time to save her.

514
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,116
When can I say goodbye?

515
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,451
You can't.

516
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:54,080
If she knew what we were planning,
would she be okay?

517
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,958
She'll resent me.

518
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:02,046
She'll be alive.
Nothing else matters.

519
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,776
You can't do the transplant.

520
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:27,905
Only if he said no, but your urgent
hovering means he said yes.

521
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:31,117
His fingers have nodules.
I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.

522
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:34,162
Or you sprinkled
too much wishful thinking in your tea.

523
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,457
Obese man with lung cancer. Two easy
explanations for his heart failure.

524
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,001
Nodules could mean something else,
something curable.

525
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,419
Go back to the ER.

526
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,588
My thanks to you
and your cold feet.

527
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,049
What's going on?
I'm giving you a shot at a cool result.

528
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,676
Better yet, a chance to prove
other doctors idiotic.

529
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,470
Except you're wrong.

530
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,014
You figure that out by taking off
your sunglasses

531
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,600
to the strains of a Who song?

532
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,769
The guy who killed
Kutner's parents

533
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,313
died of an aneurysm
two months ago.

534
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,565
Kutner hid from everyone.

535
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,151
You didn't get a chance
to save him. No one did.

536
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:09,155
Run the test. Find out if you have
a chance to save Eddie.

537
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:19,999
Bad news.

538
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,001
Love can't save you.

539
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,838
On the other hand,

540
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,842
mold can.

541
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,887
Your heart failure was caused
by a fungal infection

542
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,515
called cardiac blastomycosis.

543
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,183
Started as nodules
in your lungs,

544
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,312
which every doc, except one,
mistook for cancer.

545
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,980
It's very rare, very curable.

546
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,816
I'm starting you
on itraconazole.

547
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,151
But how come I was getting better
without the medicine?

548
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:50,154
Your emotional state
bumps your catecholamines,

549
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,614
which help raise
your prolactin...

550
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,032
My emotional state?

551
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:57,161
Three months of treatment, you'll be
back to your buff, chiseled self.

552
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,123
I don't want the treatment.

553
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,209
Do the transplant.

554
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,297
You'd be trading the certainty
that you'll live

555
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,217
for the uncertainty
that she'll live.

556
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,803
I was ready to die anyway.

557
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,889
Now you get to be nicer
to your next wife.

558
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,813
If you won't do it, release me.

559
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:29,152
And when I get hit
by a car and show up in your morgue,

560
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,948
you can give her my liver then.

561
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,331
You're basically asking us
to commit murder.

562
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,083
I was yesterday, too.

563
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:47,545
There's a difference when he has 20
years to live instead of two days.

564
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,672
Not really, not legally.

565
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,809
That's your way
of convincing us to do this,

566
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,426
by saying it's no more immoral?

567
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,845
The idiot is gonna do this
with or without us.

568
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,513
This way, we can
protect the organ.

569
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:58,931
We should be protecting him.

570
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:02,059
So we strap him to the bed,
wait till his wife dies?

571
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,853
I'm not doing this.

572
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,067
I will.

573
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,822
We've already had
one pointless death.

574
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,955
Eddie? What's going on?

575
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,792
I don't know.
He just came and got me.

576
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,795
Your husband
has a curable disease,

577
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,255
but he wants to die
so he can give you his liver.

578
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,674
Are you okay with that, or would you
rather he take the treatment?

579
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,134
You son of a bitch.

580
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,469
Eddie, don't.

581
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:37,887
You have to let me do this.

582
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,806
Charlotte, can you hear me?

583
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,478
She spiked a fever. LP shows her
white cells through the roof.

584
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,854
She's infected everywhere.

585
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:47,939
I should fire you.

586
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,899
I just did
what you failed to do.

587
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:52,068
Convince Eddie to live
and let his wife die.

588
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,153
Infection means
we have a new clue.

589
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,405
And a full
two or three hours to figure it out.

590
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,449
Sarcoidosis.
Hits the spleen and the liver.

591
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,575
She'd have lung issues.

592
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,940
Scleroderma inﬂames the tissue.

593
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,663
No skin or GI problems.

594
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,915
What is she hiding?

595
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,083
You don't know that...

596
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,968
Either we have all the clues
and we're idiots

597
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,711
or we don't have all the clues.

598
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:13,297
Possible exposure.
People, places.

599
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,759
Both.

600
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,515
Bad lie.

601
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,809
Did you really think
the beaches in Hawaii

602
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,936
were just like
the beaches in Rio?

603
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,981
The disease-bearing sand flies
are completely different.

604
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,607
She's never been to Rio.

605
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:32,817
Who'd you go with?

606
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,486
Why are you doing this?

607
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,614
I don't actually
need to know who it was,

608
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,366
I just need to know
that you went,

609
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,744
so we can know that you have
visceral leishmaniasis.

610
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,165
But since Lancelot there
was ready to die for you,

611
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,710
he might want
the answer to both.

612
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,637
Last year.

613
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,099
It was nobody you knew.

614
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,521
Rio was supposed to be ours.

615
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,733
I got tired of waiting.

616
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:18,112
I'm so sorry.

617
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,375
Start her on antimony.

618
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,920
Have Cuddy find her a liver.

619
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,592
They were all ready to die.

620
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,886
But for guilt, not love.

621
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,597
You can't feel
that much guilt without love.

622
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:56,108
New York Mercy's medevacing a liver.
It should be here...

623
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:59,362
Tell them to turn around.
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.

624
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,365
We diagnosed it too late.

625
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,122
Everyone's heading over
to Kutner's funeral.

626
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,667
You're welcome to ride with me.

627
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,002
I'm going to
stay with Charlotte.

628
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:19,423
She bought you some time
to save Eddie,

629
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,300
it'll give her death
some meaning.

630
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,178
No, it won't.

631
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,689
- I was wrong about you.
- No, you weren't.

632
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,565
You're in pain.

633
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,110
And you're romanticizing.
Again.

634
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,946
You worked with him
every day for two years,

635
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,364
and you never saw this coming.

636
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,824
No one saw it coming.

637
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,201
But you see everything coming.

638
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,995
This has never been
about what you missed,

639
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,830
this is about
why you missed it.

640
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:56,419
You're terrified that you're losing
your gift, losing who you are.

641
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:00,256
And I'm terrified
of what you'd do then.

642
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,927
Unless you feel there's more to do here
to cure me,

643
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,430
don't you have
the funeral to go to?

644
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,842
I'm taking a ride.

645
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,803
Off to one side.

646
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:52,183
It is a personal thing.

647
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:56,395
Where? When I can't stand.

648
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:02,526
Up in this cage
I'm not regretting

649
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:09,283
I don't need a better thing

650
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:13,788
I'll settle for less.

651
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:20,669
<i>It's another thing for me</i>

652
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,257
I just have to wander.

653
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:30,805
Through this world alone.

654
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,872
Stop before you fall.

655
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:02,962
Into the hole
that I have dug here.

656
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,467
Rest even as you.

657
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:15,057
Are starting to feel
the way I used to

658
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:21,564
I don't need a better thing.

659
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:26,235
Just to sound confused.

660
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:33,033
Don't talk about everyone

661
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:40,708
I am not amused by you.

662
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:47,006
'Cause I'm gonna lose you.

663
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:52,595
Yes, I'm gonna lose you.

664
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:58,225
If I'm gonna lose you.

665
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:10,070
'Cause I'm gonna lose you.

666
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,784
Yes, I'm gonna lose you.

667
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:21,790
If I'm gonna lose you

668
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:29,506
I'll lose you now for good
