1
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,416
145 pounds. Johnson, Miller.

2
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,722
House.

3
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,059
House.

4
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,939
I know you're not asleep.

5
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,691
That insight would be
a lot more impressive

6
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,695
if you weren't just a product
of my exhausted brain.

7
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,990
Aren't you curious
about why I'm here?

8
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:44,457
Curious why no French maid's outfit,
no spanky pants...

9
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,836
I'm a hallucination,
not a fantasy.

10
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,341
It's insomnia. Four nights
without REM sleep can cause...

11
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,552
That might explain why
you're hallucinating,

12
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:59,305
doesn't explain why you're hallucinating
Wilson's dead girlfriend.

13
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,725
Probably because of my secret
and very unconscious desire

14
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:03,810
to get Wilson into my bedroom.

15
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,536
Or maybe your guilt
over Kutner's suicide

16
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,565
reminds you of how guilty
you felt about me.

17
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,026
Who cares why you're here?

18
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,195
A decent night's sleep
and you won't be.

19
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,790
Guess I'll be around
a few more hours.

20
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,802
Need some coffee?

21
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,890
Addictive substances are no substitute
for nature's healing balm.

22
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,017
Let's make this fast.
I need to sleep.

23
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,854
Deaf 14-year-old started
hearing imaginary explosions.

24
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:54,986
Exploding head syndrome. Cool.
Obviously his brain knows how to hear.

25
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,822
Patient went deaf at age four,
complication of meningitis.

26
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,991
So, why no cochlear implant?

27
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:03,369
Usual suspects
are insomnia, which he doesn't have,

28
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,787
migraines, which
he doesn't get,

29
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,248
and head trauma, which
didn't show up on the CT.

30
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,083
Damn imaginary pen.

31
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,254
Mom's signature's on
everything. Did Dad die?

32
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,424
No, I doubt it. He was a sperm donor.
Medical records couldn't be cleaner.

33
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,551
So, we're left with
temporal lobe seizure.

34
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,594
Wrong.

35
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,804
Someone at the wrestling meet
would have noticed a seizure.

36
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,223
Could have just looked like
a bad shot to the leg.

37
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,936
Put him in the seizure lab, see if
his head blows up all over again.

38
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,147
You're gonna ignore
your own subconscious?

39
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,815
Gonna be the limp
leading the blind.

40
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,578
I need a scrip
for sleeping pills.

41
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,956
My neighbor's dog has
been keeping me awake,

42
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,042
and it seems strangely
invulnerable to poison.

43
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,837
Why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest
Dr. Chase here?

44
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,714
I'll take that as
a "Congratulations."

45
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,633
We're discussing a case.

46
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,302
Why did he close that file?

47
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:05,181
Wedding in two weeks?
I'd say you were pregnant,

48
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,643
but I don't think Chase's body
is mature enough to produce sperm.

49
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,687
It's a small ceremony,
why wait?

50
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:13,773
Mighty-night.

51
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,818
Drugs with no lecture?
He wants you out.

52
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,155
Interesting case?

53
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,157
Possible prostate cancer
came into the ER.

54
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,826
Pencil cup.

55
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:36,504
No wonder his prostate is enlarged.
It's full of pool cues and cigars.

56
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:38,715
Chase's best man doesn't
get here till the day of the wedding,

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,592
so I asked Wilson to
throw his bachelor party.

58
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,886
No retired ministers
available to plan it?

59
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,639
Chase doesn't want
some big, raucous party.

60
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,849
So she says.

61
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:51,978
Luckily, there are people in this world
ready to stand up for what's right.

62
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,896
No, no, no.
I don't want you to...

63
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:59,569
Listen, of the two things I do well,
bachelor parties rank towards the top.

64
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,071
I get to help, right?

65
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,913
Starting five hertz.

66
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,792
House made it through
that entire differential

67
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,296
without mocking our patient
for not having a cochlear implant.

68
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,091
The patient doesn't want an implant
because he's comfortable with who he is.

69
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,718
It's admirable.

70
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,929
He's deaf, that's not an identity,
it's a disability.

71
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,181
It's also a culture.

72
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,559
The deaf have their own schools,
their own language.

73
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,977
Still no spiking.

74
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,353
Going to 20.

75
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:39,734
Anything I can simulate with a $3 pair
of ear plugs is not a culture.

76
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,947
No sign of seizure.
Temporal lobe activity is still clean.

77
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:48,409
Doctors. Doctors, he can't see.
One of his eyes.

78
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,704
"The limp leading the blind."

79
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,582
Is that supposed
to mean something?

80
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,418
I didn't think so.

81
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,379
So, exploding head syndrome
plus vision loss.

82
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,757
Subclavian steal syndrome.
Vascular defect

83
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,843
coupled with constant arm movement could
siphon blood flow from the brain.

84
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,095
We should do
an angio, check his...

85
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,930
Knock yourselves out.

86
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,108
How did I know he
was gonna go blind?

87
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,363
Don't get cute, Gazoo. You're
in my mind, you're obviously there.

88
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,281
C-reactive protein.

89
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,535
I noticed in his file
it was slightly elevated.

90
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,122
I figured the stress of the seizure lab
would drive the inflammation even higher

91
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,624
and lead to optic neuritis.

92
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,168
That's a lot clearer
than "the limp leading the blind."

93
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,963
It was just a glimmer.
I couldn't put it into words.

94
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,756
It was a long shot.

95
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,176
I don't even remember
the C-reactive protein level.

96
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,221
Obviously you do,
you just don't know it.

97
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,599
How high is K2?

98
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,017
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

99
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,603
But I read a book
about it years ago.

100
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,981
A fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover,
bending over to...

101
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,859
28,251 feet.

102
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,653
Cool.

103
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,698
An all-access pass
to my own brain.

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,660
Go play the kid some music.

105
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,786
Why?

106
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,664
Another long shot.

107
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,210
We're using iodine dye to track the
blood flow in your neck and arm.

108
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,862
House, what are you doing?

109
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:51,532
What does it look like I'm doing?
Fighting the power.

110
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,630
Feel that? How cool is that?

111
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,634
Apparently your mom doesn't
care what you're missing.

112
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,177
You're an ass.

113
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,348
He says he feels
the vibrations in his abdomen,

114
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,225
but not his hand.

115
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,601
What does that mean?

116
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:26,609
It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.

117
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,871
Thought you were
gonna get some sleep.

118
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,165
The case got interesting.

119
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,887
It's like the zoo.

120
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,515
Except you can
bang on the glass as much as you want.

121
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,100
How'd you know about
the neuropathy?

122
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,351
Good question.

123
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:01,811
Enough with the riddles.

124
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,105
Tell me about it.

125
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,816
Think wrestling record.

126
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,235
Juggling.

127
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,447
No, pins, three pins.

128
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,158
Patient was pinned
in his last three matches.

129
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,785
Leading up
to that he was 15-and-0.

130
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,247
I figured his balance was off
from diminished sensation.

131
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,666
Could be increased ICP
from a brain tumor.

132
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,543
That we missed on the head CT?

133
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,838
Cutting weight for wrestling
could've led to rhabdomyolysis.

134
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:32,008
Patient went up a weight class
three months ago.

135
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,926
Foreman's right.

136
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,849
Actually, increased
ICP could make sense.

137
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,933
You just said...

138
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,476
I was processing.

139
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,276
It also puts a new
symptom on the table.

140
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,278
His deafness.

141
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:57,074
What if it was caused by NF2 cancer,
instead of his childhood meningitis?

142
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,868
So, meningitis was
a coincidence.

143
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:02,455
Or a by-product of the cancer
suppressing his immune system.

144
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,414
MRI his head.

145
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,542
If you're right about
NF2, his deafness may be reversible.

146
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,187
I'll set it up
and talk to the patient.

147
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,173
You two doing anything?

148
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,356
Do you know what a
"Broken Cowboy" is?

149
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,775
It was on House's
list of requirements.

150
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,735
I have three theories.

151
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,697
Why is House so into
this bachelor party?

152
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,699
He needs to have a reason
to be into a bachelor party?

153
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,910
He needs a reason
to be into anything.

154
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,745
Give me your wallet.

155
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,626
House could be trying to tempt Chase
into cheating, break them up.

156
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,991
You think House
is into Cameron?

157
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,588
I think House is into
Cameron being into him.

158
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,633
Marrying Chase would
shatter that fantasy.

159
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,019
If Chase cheats, they shouldn't be
getting married in the first place.

160
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,973
So, you're okay with House getting Chase
smashed enough to make a stupid mistake?

161
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,684
Being drunk doesn't change who you are,
it just reveals it.

162
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,275
You think she can
do the Broken Cowboy?

163
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,693
God, I hope so.

164
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:19,240
NF2 is an extremely slow-growing cancer,
which makes it very treatable.

165
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,034
If we're right, taking out the tumor

166
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,204
means there's a chance
you'll regain your hearing.

167
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:33,295
No, they said you have to.

168
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,715
What's wrong?

169
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,760
He wants you to treat the cancer,
but leave him deaf.

170
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,097
Sorry. It doesn't
work like that.

171
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,685
But why?

172
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,769
I don't know.

173
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,881
Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP,
but no masses on or around the nerves.

174
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,757
It's not cancer.

175
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:22,386
Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth
ventricle, could still indicate a tumor.

176
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,762
We brought pictures.

177
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,098
The fact that you sent me
on a scouting mission...

178
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,725
No skirts.

179
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,143
You're not on the guest list.

180
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:33,230
Bachelor parties are an ancient and
sacred male rite of passage.

181
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,984
The ventricle bowing is most likely
a pre-existing anatomical anomaly,

182
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,111
not the indication of a tumor.

183
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,946
No way to know for sure
without a brain biopsy.

184
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:41,989
If I get drunk enough,

185
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,658
there's a chance I might make out
with one of the strippers.

186
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,202
Or become one.

187
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,828
- Sold.
- Sold.

188
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,790
We can't just drill
into our patient's brain on a hunch.

189
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,167
- God, not her.
- God, not her.

190
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,799
She's the one that got me
hooked in with Madoff.

191
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,380
Taub's right. It's not cancer.

192
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,507
Yeah, by all means,

193
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:03,052
abandon a great diagnostic
theory because it's difficult to prove.

194
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,639
Do a biopsy. We need to take a better
look at his fourth ventricle.

195
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:07,723
Or an older look.

196
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,809
The mom is never gonna let us touch
his brain without some evidence.

197
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,938
Patient broke his nose years ago.
Hospital could've done an MRI.

198
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,775
Okay-

199
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,697
The main reason my third wife
and I eloped

200
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,784
was to avoid House's bachelor party.

201
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:32,790
Have you seen Caligula?

202
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:42,758
My patient's brain now versus three
years ago. See any difference?

203
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,595
Is he telling you
to avoid the party?

204
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,514
I took an oath to do no harm.

205
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,140
Sure, don't come,

206
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:53,644
if you want your wedding
vows to be meaningless.

207
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,730
This should be interesting.

208
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:00,776
You are going to commit
to that one special woman forever,

209
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,236
which is beautiful.

210
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,280
But if your commitment
the day after the wedding

211
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,864
is the same as
your commitment the day before,

212
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,783
then the wedding meant nothing.

213
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,661
So, and I see
no logical way around this,

214
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,788
if you want your marriage to matter,

215
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,834
you have to be a wanton, trolling,
muck-covered pig the day before.

216
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,878
You're evil. See you.

217
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,272
The wall of the fourth ventricle
changed,

218
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,466
it isn't
bowed in the older scan.

219
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,594
Evidence of NF2, right?

220
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,097
You'd need to do
a brain biopsy to confirm.

221
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,438
I'm not going
to the bachelor party.

222
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,607
Every time I go to
one of your parties,

223
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:44,111
I end up embarrassing
myself in some new and unexpected way.

224
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,740
That whole thing with the duck
was hardly unexpected.

225
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm not going.

226
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:50,826
Okay-

227
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,952
It's not okay.

228
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,628
Do you know who we need?

229
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,963
That stripper you got for
Wilson's bachelor party.

230
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,466
You could do body shots
right off her.

231
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,886
Why go back to that well?
In the nine years since Wilson's party,

232
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,806
a whole new generation of hot girls
have been abused by their stepfathers.

233
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,767
She loved cats.

234
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:18,812
Why would you remember
that a stripper loved cats?

235
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,191
Chase has a cat, they'll bond.

236
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,654
House, you entertaining
yourself up there?

237
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,243
Just rehearsing for the
revival of Evita. What did you find?

238
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,287
Biopsy shows nerve
inflammation consistent

239
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,790
with increased
intracranial pressure.

240
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,000
Something's wrong,
but it's not cancer.

241
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,673
He's gonna go
through life deaf.

242
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,882
He's okay with that.

243
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,510
He has no idea
what he's missing.

244
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,053
His mom's a moron.

245
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,431
He's gonna pay for her stupidity
for the rest of his life?

246
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,975
Are we okay with that?

247
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,985
Why are you closing? You're supposed
to put in a cochlear implant.

248
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,487
That wasn't in the paperwork.

249
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,491
Really? Well, someone must have
screwed up. I'll go track it down.

250
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,952
- <i>I'll wait.
- That's a great idea.</i>

251
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,956
Let the kid spend more timeunder
anesthesia with his skull cracked open.

252
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,499
I'll wait.

253
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,128
I've been known to lie
to serve my own agenda.

254
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:28,006
An implant does absolutely
nothing to help me diagnose him.

255
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,845
Let's get an implant
tray in here.

256
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,957
Just try to relax.

257
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,011
Her son didn't
want the implant.

258
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,431
If he still doesn't want it, after
having time to adjust, I'll take it out.

259
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,017
I'll blind him, too, if he wants
to experience that culture.

260
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,477
Remove it now.

261
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,480
Kid just had brain surgery.
He's not stable.

262
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,359
Ms. Miller, I'm not trying to minimize
Dr. House's wrongdoing,

263
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,486
but the best thing
for your son...

264
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,737
Why is she sitting?

265
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:36,909
She's not yelling, not threatening,
not pacing, just sitting.

266
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,870
Understand, Dr. House?

267
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,290
House, focus.

268
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,251
I need you to say you
accept the arrangement.

269
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,004
No problem. You're not mad.

270
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm mad.

271
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:53,759
Not mad enough.

272
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:55,964
You wanted your son to hear.

273
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,722
You just didn't have the guts
to make him get the implant.

274
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,851
Once my son is stable,
I want that thing out of his head.

275
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,778
Why did you do this?

276
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:16,532
Because he is ignorant
and he's being raised by an idiot.

277
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,618
Not good enough,
you always have...

278
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,621
My patient is opting
into a handicap.

279
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,458
He's an insult to all
the other gimps out there.

280
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,253
Okay-

281
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,757
But I'm still putting Foreman
in charge of the case.

282
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,551
That's the arrangement?

283
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,888
Okay-

284
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,273
You're okay with
Foreman in charge?

285
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,733
Who you calling?

286
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,861
Oh, right, you don't want
to look like a lunatic.

287
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,821
Yeah, about that.

288
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,573
You think we did
the wrong thing?

289
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,618
I'm not sure. I'm not
even sure why we did it.

290
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,246
That argument you made to Cuddy
sounded pretty good.

291
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,789
To you, maybe.

292
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,925
Huh. I figured by now you'd be at
the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.

293
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,803
Yeah, you did something stupid.
Quick, better mock someone.

294
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,847
Why did you do it?

295
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,558
Why did I give a human being
the power of hearing?

296
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,312
You can ask God the same question,
he'll give you the same answer.

297
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,689
Patient has a fever now, too.

298
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,358
Probably just a post-op
complication. Arnold-Chiari?

299
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,735
Not without muscle weakness.

300
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,903
Pseudotumor Cerebri?

301
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,363
We checked his eyes
before the surgery. No papilledema.

302
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,573
Candy?

303
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,994
I'm pretty sure Wilson's stripper's
name was something sweet.

304
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,331
Maybe his fever is more
than a post-op reaction.

305
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,874
His girlfriend
was sick a few months ago,

306
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,585
- maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr.
- Lolly?

307
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,546
They swap spit, virus travels
to his brain, leads to meningitis,

308
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,089
leads to increased
intracranial pressure.

309
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,133
I agree. Taffy?

310
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,384
I agree.

311
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,431
Go ahead, start him on
ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.

312
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,807
Keep making decisions
like that,

313
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,019
it really bolsters the illusion
that you're in charge.

314
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,733
Why aren't you in my office?

315
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,778
Because I know what
the word "my" means.

316
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:22,074
I did something insane, and you're
not all over me analyzing why.

317
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,619
It was nice.

318
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,749
I gave that idiot an implant to prove
to him what an idiot he's been.

319
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:31,708
How is that nice?

320
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,711
You didn't do it to solve the case,
you didn't do it to save his life,

321
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:38,090
you did it to make his life better.
It was a caring act.

322
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:44,304
Which you did in a way that
was immoral and illegal, but baby steps.

323
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,765
Doesn't sound like us.

324
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,018
You can't make me go
to the bachelor party.

325
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,144
I know.

326
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,563
And you're okay with that?

327
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,273
What choice do I have?

328
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,747
Seth!

329
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,960
Please, God...

330
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:22,801
Seth.

331
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:28,974
Yes.

332
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,897
Seth.

333
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,842
Oh!

334
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,845
I think he just wet the bed.

335
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,570
Kid's dehydrated but stable.

336
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,823
Thankfully the fountain of whizz
seems to have stopped for the moment.

337
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,119
Not before hosing
Epstein-Barr off the table.

338
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,496
Now, eat up.

339
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:36,583
We're gonna pick out the ice cream
flavors for the bachelor party.

340
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,921
Could be a systemic
autoimmune disease. Sarcoido...

341
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,466
This tastes like vodka.

342
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,053
Well, it would be stupid if it tasted
like bourbon. That's the brown one.

343
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,262
It is vodka?

344
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:54,267
Flash frozen in a secret process.
Guy figured it out in his basement.

345
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,773
Limoncello. Genius.

346
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:04,361
Symptoms came on too hard and too fast.
Sarcoidosis is progressive.

347
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,282
Remember, in med school,
when Donovan gave grand rounds,

348
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,326
there was that guy
who was peeing liters.

349
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,913
Glomerulonephritis. Wrestler, steroids
could have damaged the kidneys.

350
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,624
The scotch is nice.

351
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,292
His urine would've been brown.

352
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,296
Donovan ruled out osmotic diuresis,
kidney disease...

353
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,048
Pheochromocytoma?

354
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,259
No hypertension, plasma
metanephrine is normal.

355
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,468
Devic's?

356
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:31,263
It happened at night.
That was the clue.

357
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,767
Night, recumbent body
position, changes in BP...

358
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,022
It's his heart.

359
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,610
Run a 12-lead EKG,
watch him for four hours.

360
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,362
Foreman concurs.

361
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,746
What the hell just happened?
Everything started to fade away.

362
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,792
You're getting better at focusing,
ignoring everything that doesn't matter.

363
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,378
Uh-oh!

364
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,715
He looks pissed.
I think he might hit us.

365
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,801
Is your eyesight
better than mine?

366
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,262
We need to talk about
the bachelor party.

367
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,348
Excellent topic choice.

368
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:19,561
I mean, surgery is so boring, and my
lying to you is just so yesterday.

369
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,897
It's my fault for letting you
talk me into the implant.

370
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,357
Cameron is not gonna be
happy about this party.

371
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,859
But, you, on the other hand...

372
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,445
Plan on spending
the rest of my life with Cameron.

373
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,031
So, I need to cancel
the fart band?

374
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,950
So, I need you to kidnap me.

375
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,871
Spoken like a true Aussie.

376
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,706
By the way, if you know where

377
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,083
I can get the sheet music
to Waltzing Matilda...

378
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,966
Hey! Want some ice cream?
We're having a sundae bar.

379
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,260
Sweet.

380
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,681
That's her name!

381
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,974
Sundae or Bar?

382
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,310
Karamel.

383
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,729
With a "K."

384
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:36,596
Bath room?

385
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,601
Down the hall, two doors,
on your right.

386
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,186
Thanks.

387
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:51,778
Do I sound like her?

388
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,783
It takes time.

389
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,586
You still haven't slept?

390
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,340
And then I have
a clever response.

391
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,760
EKG, normal sinus, normal
intervals. His heart's fine.

392
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,679
His heart's not fine.

393
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:21,766
The heart was fine during this test.
The arrhythmia's hiding.

394
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,852
Or we were wrong
about the heart.

395
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:24,978
Could be the thyroid.

396
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,939
Hashimoto's would explain
the kid's urine and brain pressure.

397
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,151
- Treadmill.
- Or the arrhythmia is hiding.

398
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,654
We need to stress him.
Put the patient on a treadmill.

399
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,448
The patient just
had brain surgery.

400
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,742
A stress test could cause
a brain bleed and kill him.

401
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:42,412
I value your opinion.
I value rejecting your opinion.

402
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,873
You're not doing this.
You haven't been sleeping...

403
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,167
Cuddy doesn't actually
want you in charge.

404
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:51,004
She just wants to avoid
a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.

405
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:54,632
And if I let you risk our patient's life
testing an organ we already tested,

406
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,218
we accomplish neither.
Run a thyroid panel.

407
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:08,063
How do we get him into the stress lab
without Foreman's sign off?

408
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:11,358
We could kill Foreman.
Is she new?

409
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:17,906
Focus. The lab simulates stress.
What if it's not simulated?

410
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,575
We could tell him his
girlfriend dumped him.

411
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,120
It's a tough sell since she never leaves
the room for more than five minutes.

412
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,914
We could kill her.

413
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,085
Or asthma meds. Force the heart
to beat faster.

414
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,379
Revealing the arrhythmia.

415
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,672
Nice idea.

416
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:35,757
It was yours.

417
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,828
I just left the room
for a few minutes.

418
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:50,647
He ripped out his implant.
So much for improving his life.

419
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,316
Actually, I think
we just saved it.

420
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,823
Look at that. Arrhythmia.

421
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:08,540
You were right about the heart.
I should have listened to you.

422
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,127
The correct phrasing would be,
"I should always listen to you."

423
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,505
He's got problems everywhere.
What goes everywhere?

424
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,674
Blood.
Could be thrombocythemia.

425
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,919
Excess platelets lead to
clotting throughout the body.

426
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,248
Not with a normal
platelet count.

427
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,512
So the clotting
doesn't start in the blood,

428
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,347
it starts in
the lungs. Pulmonary embolism.

429
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,559
We should do a VIQ scan,
see if his lungs are clear.

430
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,029
Go.

431
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,752
Are you sure I did this
at Wilson's party?

432
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,839
Last time, you used grain alcohol
instead of the Sambuca.

433
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,424
And it worked?

434
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,061
Well, it explains my lack of eyebrows
by the end of the evening.

435
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,319
By the power of Grayskull, I...

436
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,121
This is why we're rehearsing.

437
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:37,128
Ever wonder what's happening every time
our patient gets sicker?

438
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,379
Not right now.

439
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,340
First symptom, wrestling.

440
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,718
Then, under the lights
of the seizure lab...

441
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,637
Are you going somewhere with this?
Because this feels...

442
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,514
Just keep doing what
you're doing. It helps.

443
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,644
Then, under the stress
of blindness, then, post-op fever.

444
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,021
What do all the symptoms
have in common?

445
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,567
Heat.

446
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,823
See, if you hadn't been here,
that would've just popped into my head,

447
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,535
which actually would
have been way cooler.

448
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:14,123
Foreman, kid's got Uhthoff phenomenon,
which means it's MS.

449
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,751
Start him on
double-dose interferon.

450
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,419
Let's get our drink on.

451
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,714
Not before I've added chemical burns
to this guy's cause of death.

452
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,093
Patient's responding
to interferon.

453
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,762
Looks like I can retire
as department figurehead.

454
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,265
Dr. Robert Chase?

455
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,767
We're with the Department of
Citizenship and Immigration.

456
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,144
Did you recently apply
for a marriage license?

457
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,688
Ah... Yes.

458
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,107
According to our records,
your work permit has expired.

459
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,692
If you could come with us?

460
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,402
I'm his fiancée.
I can come along and clear this...

461
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,779
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Illegals only.

462
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,283
I'm sure it's a mistake.

463
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,785
I'll call you as soon as
I know what's going on.

464
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,374
Don't let House get him
in too much trouble.

465
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:25,320
Allow me to welcome
you to the best night of your life.

466
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,796
Now, a few ground rules
for the evening. Safety is job one.

467
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:48,259
We have now gone 18 days
without an injury in the workplace.

468
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:53,723
Yes, these girls are all working their
way through law school, don't test them.

469
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:54,891
House!

470
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,852
I knew you couldn't stay away.

471
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,527
This is my apartment!
You can't do this.

472
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,571
Clearly reality begs to differ.

473
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,992
Where's my furniture?

474
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,535
Out back somewhere.

475
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,620
James!

476
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:19,832
Karamel?

477
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,127
Hey.

478
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,008
How's your wife?

479
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,635
We got divorced.

480
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,805
- How's your cat?
- Dead.

481
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,558
How about we go have a drink?

482
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:40,311
- This way.
- Okay.

483
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,478
You're okay with this?

484
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,105
I paid 50 bucks for this.

485
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,358
You guys are great together.
Trust is everything.

486
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,528
I'm gonna get some air.
Keep it real.

487
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,593
You should be out there, enjoying
the lap dances of your labors.

488
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,680
I kind of like it in here.

489
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,807
Me, too.

490
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,771
To us, figuring out MS.

491
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,984
And the blindness and neuropathy, and
arrhythmia, and anything else we did.

492
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,991
What exactly did my team do?

493
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:21,621
Looked good
in their lab coats, except for Taub.

494
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:27,335
Some people just
work better alone, so to speak.

495
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,129
One more drink.

496
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,924
No. I can't.
I gotta take a break.

497
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,384
Meet Karamel.

498
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,598
Maybe one more drink.

499
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:56,155
What's that taste?
Is that strawberry?

500
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,913
House, you in there?

501
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,376
Use the other bathroom.
It's in the kitchen, looks like a sink.

502
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:12,505
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from
the stripper's body butter or something.

503
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,132
Is he okay?

504
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,510
One of the residents
had an EpiPen, so he's fine.

505
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,680
But we're taking him to
the hospital to be safe.

506
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,723
Okay-

507
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:31,566
I knew that Chase was allergic
to strawberries, didn't I?

508
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,071
That's why you wanted
Karamel at this party.

509
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:41,534
I suggested Karamel
'cause she was great at Wilson's party.

510
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,496
I knew about her body butter,
I knew about his strawberry allergy.

511
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:49,625
I tried to kill Chase?

512
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:54,547
Why would I do that?
I don't want Cameron.

513
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,593
You're not a big fan of other people's
happiness either.

514
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,642
Hello.

515
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,230
You confirm? Thanks.

516
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:17,445
That kid we saved, he's dying.

517
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:20,114
It's not MS.

518
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,325
We were wrong.

519
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:29,957
Thank God
you're okay. What happened?

520
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,918
- There was a girl...
- Long story.

521
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:36,380
Your patient's lung failure rules out
MS. We put him on a ventilator.

522
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:38,716
Enlarged lymphs could...

523
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,927
Are any of you sober?

524
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,890
Turn around, you need
to go to the hospital.

525
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,352
I need to sleep.

526
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,235
I'm you. You can't
just shut a door.

527
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,947
You tried to kill Chase.

528
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,867
I need to push you
back down, you're dangerous.

529
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,245
It's the hospital.

530
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,288
I'm not answering.

531
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:14,919
Hello.

532
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,754
I'm here with your team,

533
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:21,634
trying to sober them up so they can help
treat your dying patient.

534
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,135
Foreman's dying patient.

535
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:28,224
What causes lung failure plus
your patient's previous symptoms?

536
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,600
Eosinophilic pneumonitis.

537
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,435
White blood cells accumulate,

538
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,897
clog up the lungs,
lead to heart problems. It fits.

539
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,649
House, are you there?

540
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,444
It's not
eosinophilic pneumonitis.

541
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,487
I gotta crash.

542
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,364
House, don't hang up.
We need your help.

543
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,490
I can't.

544
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,409
We can solve this.

545
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,121
Good night.

546
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,166
Eosinophilic pneumonitis
could actually make sense.

547
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:58,713
No, House ruled it out because it would
affect the larynx. Patient would be

548
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:01,132
hoarse.

549
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,343
Which we wouldn't
notice in a deaf kid who rarely speaks.

550
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,306
Wait. Everyone's
getting breath mints.

551
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,395
We need to hear Seth speak.

552
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:18,190
That means taking out the tube.
Isn't that dangerous?

553
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,234
It's the safest way to confirm
what's wrong with him.

554
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,361
I need him to breathe out
once I pull on the tube.

555
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,779
Okay-

556
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,419
Say "ah."

557
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,141
I'm sorry, we were wrong.

558
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:58,397
I need to suction out your
throat before we re-intubate.

559
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,697
Your son smoke?

560
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,366
I don't think so.

561
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,660
Tobacco stains on his teeth.

562
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,501
He says he used to chew tobacco
to cut weight for wrestling.

563
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:19,585
Used to?

564
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,962
Chewing tobacco wouldn't
explain his symptoms.

565
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,757
But not chewing tobacco might.

566
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,385
Taub was right.
It's sarcoidosis.

567
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:33,015
The tobacco releases toxins, those
toxins suppressed his immune system.

568
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,017
Once he quit chewing,

569
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,437
the absence of those toxins kicked
a dormant condition into hyper-drive.

570
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,608
Is it treatable?

571
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:47,404
Usually responds to corticosteroids
and methotrexate.

572
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,990
I'll start the meds.

573
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,331
I need sleeping pills.

574
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,585
I was gonna hit up Wilson, but he's
not answering his phone.

575
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,671
He must have left
it in his pants,

576
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:07,925
which he wasn't wearing when the police
found him trying to walk home, oddly,

577
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,136
from his own apartment.

578
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,266
Pills.

579
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:20,104
Your patient is doing fine,
thanks to your team.

580
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:25,359
It wasn't eosinophilic
pneumonitis, was it?

581
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:28,028
Sarcoidosis.

582
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:29,155
Good.

583
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,367
House, please, talk to me.

584
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:47,381
I haven't slept through the night
since Kutner killed himself.

585
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,984
The wrestling
might have to wait.

586
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:11,238
I'm gonna tell your doctors
to repair your implant.

587
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,827
I know.
And then you ripped it out

588
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,413
rather than live with
it for a few days even.

589
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:24,501
I'm your mother.
This is my call.

590
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:29,715
I don't know if I'm making
the right one, but it's mine to make.

591
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,508
Sleep well?
