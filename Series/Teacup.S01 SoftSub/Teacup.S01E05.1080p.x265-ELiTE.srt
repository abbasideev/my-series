1
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,642
Did you see the look Maggie gave me?

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,021
Maggie didn't give you a look.
She knows what happened.

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,156
She doesn't know who it happened with.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,258
Well, it's only a matter of time.

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,195
Horses seem better, so I'm... I'm going.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,597
- You should take Ruben with you.
- Maggie, I don't know.

7
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,033
You're saying you don't
wanna go with the husband

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,102
of the woman that you've been fucking?

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,273
- You must be Maggie.
- This is lt. Olsen.

10
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,243
A big part of my job was to locate

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,403
and isolate Carmen navarro.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,181
He's not who he says
he is. And all of this,

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,117
whatever it's for, it's not fucking good.

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,122
- Edward!
- Anybody here?

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,890
Carmen! Brian!

16
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,115
My god.

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,584
Hello?

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,096
Hello?

19
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,092
Jesus...

20
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,074
A conundrum. That's what this is.

21
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:09,211
Cause I don't know if you're here to
help me or finish the job, you know?

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm gonna need you to give
me one really good reason

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,784
why I shouldn't finish this cigarette
and shoot you in the fucking head.

24
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,689
You've come to finish me off?

25
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,330
I'm gonna be the one
who fucking finishes you.

26
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,636
I swear to you, I just came here for help.

27
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,039
I told you. Another man in a mask

28
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,508
- mcnab.
- Yeah. He...

29
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,443
He was at our house. We live nearby.

30
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,345
Why don't you stop fucking lying?!

31
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,814
I am not lying! I swear
to god I'm not lying!

32
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,951
I am not lying! I'm
telling you, my son is sick.

33
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,252
He is really, really sick!

34
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,820
That's the bullshit part. Why come here?

35
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,758
- Because...
- Why not go to a fucking hospital?

36
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,859
Please.

37
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,852
Please, please, please... Please.

38
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,557
Fuck!

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,492
Okay.

40
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,835
I'm telling you, we tried
to get into town, but...

41
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,115
This part is gonna
sound like bullshit, I know,

42
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,217
but there's this paint, okay?

43
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,719
This blue line of paint on the ground

44
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,754
marking this, I don't
know what you call it,

45
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,390
this kind of... This kind of force field.

46
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,351
If you cross the line, you die!

47
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,923
Listen to you.

48
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,736
Acting like you're telling the truth,

49
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,871
like I don't know what lies sound like.

50
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,041
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Keep playing dumb,

51
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,111
- I'm gonna put a bullet in your stomach.
- I am not lying!

52
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,682
Not about my son, not about the line,
and not about the goddamn force field!

53
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,775
Stop fucking saying "force field"!

54
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,290
If you'd really met mcnab,

55
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,791
you'd know that's not what it is.

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,852
Okay, fine. What the hell is it then?

57
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,433
I'm telling you, it's a trap.

58
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,335
A cage.

59
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,796
An invisible, goddamn death trap cage.

60
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,300
How it works is miles
above my pay grade.

61
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,936
And besides, the "how"
of it doesn't matter.

62
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,482
What matters is it's real,

63
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,084
it's bad, and you can't fucking see it!

64
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,943
Take it down a notch.

65
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,155
Hey, new guy. Travis.

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,681
What the hell you doin'?

67
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,284
Sorry. I'm... just... Jesus.

68
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,239
You don't even know the
trap's there until it's too late.

69
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,917
You think you're going for a walk,

70
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,977
and then, bam! Just like that...

71
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:19,912
You're dead.

72
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,750
I mean, they make it that way
so nobody'll know the trap's there.

73
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,519
Think they're so fucking clever.

74
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,834
But I know it's there.

75
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,664
- Suddenly...
- Wait... Who's "they" again?

76
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,078
Visitors.

77
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,547
That's right. That's right.

78
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,582
I would've called them little green men,

79
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,141
but you call 'em visitors.

80
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,387
And any one of us in here could be...

81
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,580
One of these visitors.

82
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,584
Even you. Right?

83
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,097
I could be.

84
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,231
Yes.

85
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:04,967
Word to the wise.

86
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,636
Don't let mcnab follow
you into the bathroom

87
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,338
unless you wanna get probed.

88
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,347
Yeah, that's funny.

89
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,973
But do me a favor.

90
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,519
Try laughing at this.

91
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,723
- Jesus.
- Yeah... That's what I thought.

92
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,626
All I did was brush up
against the edge of the trap.

93
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,062
- Barely touched it.
- No one needs to see that.

94
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,230
This is real.

95
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,098
This is happening!

96
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,267
And not someday.

97
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,102
It's happening now.

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,537
They are here.

99
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,962
And they walk among us!

100
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,508
That's it! You're done. I told ya.

101
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,067
Give me your keys.

102
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,803
Now. Come on.

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
How am I supposed to get home?

104
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,710
Not my problem, mcnab.

105
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,648
Taking my keys, big al,
makes it your problem.

106
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,655
What about him?

107
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,103
Fine. New guy? Here.

108
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,127
Catch.

109
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,809
That scar.

110
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,613
What about it?

111
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,650
What really happened?

112
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,954
I said what really happened.

113
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,130
And you've got no idea how this
invisible death trap thing works?

114
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,699
Doesn't mean it's not real.

115
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,369
Yeah, but it has to
have something, right?

116
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:01,107
Some kind of energy or power source.

117
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,011
There's a source.

118
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,556
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

119
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,118
It's... it's iridescent, and it's alive.

120
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,465
Get near it, and it calls out to you

121
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,592
like a... like a siren song.

122
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,227
Like a what?

123
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,165
Like a bug light.

124
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,001
It lures you in.

125
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,603
Mesmerizes you.

126
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,073
Closer and closer...

127
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,108
Until, zap!

128
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,949
Give me a reason why I'd lie.

129
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,186
Most people don't need a reason.

130
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,856
Let you in on a little secret?

131
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,927
I'm not most people.

132
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,671
Hey...

133
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,354
For fuck's sake.

134
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,799
You okay in there?

135
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,104
I'm coming in.

136
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,553
What the fuck?

137
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,756
Whoa! Whoa, I was just...

138
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,015
I-I was just checking on you.

139
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,052
Just don't.

140
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,387
I don't care.

141
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,836
Don't care if anybody...

142
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,996
Thinks I'm full of shit, either.

143
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,432
A liar.

144
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,168
Off my rocker.

145
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,438
But you.

146
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,912
I see it in your eyes, Travis.

147
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,449
You see what?

148
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,318
You're asking yourself

149
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:53,026
"what if this crazy, old bastard's
actually telling the truth?"

150
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,379
I am not some kind of alien in disguise.

151
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,058
Which is exactly

152
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,185
what an alien in disguise would say.

153
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,568
Just shut up and don't fucking move.

154
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,094
How then? Hey.

155
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,674
How do I prove I'm not
one of these visitors?

156
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,300
That's the whole thing.

157
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,202
You can't.

158
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,115
Mcnab would have told you that.

159
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,916
Well, he wasn't exactly talking to me.

160
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,278
He just pointed a gun at us and
wrote down on this whiteboard thing, so.

161
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,730
Listen... I-I don't know what happened

162
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,066
or what's happening here, but hey,

163
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,325
I do know you need help. You do.

164
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:03,139
My wife, she's a doctor. We
have medicine. She can help

165
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,341
thought you needed help for your son.

166
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,109
Now your wife's a fuckin' doctor?

167
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,978
Can't keep your goddamn story straight.

168
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,513
Not that kind of doctor.
She's a veterinarian.

169
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,382
Just fuckin' stop. Doctor. Veterinarian.

170
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,584
Sick kid. No idea what happened here.

171
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,551
Or you're not lying and you do need help.

172
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,354
Fucking conundrum.

173
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,831
All I ever wanted was a little control.

174
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,568
Control over my life,
over what happens to me.

175
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,439
Idiot I am.

176
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,576
I fell for it.

177
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,914
You're smart, on the ball.

178
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,126
You know what I'm talking about.

179
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,929
Guys on TV, the Internet,

180
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:03,966
going on about flying saucer, ufos,

181
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,602
alien autopsies.

182
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,304
All bullshit.

183
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,597
And all based on something you can see.

184
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:14,067
Guy in a rubber suit type stuff.

185
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,939
What I'm saying, is no... body.

186
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,851
No nothing.

187
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,953
No there there.

188
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:28,257
Travis! If I... Think...
non-corporeal entities.

189
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:28,834
No ufos?

190
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:31,861
Who needs a spaceship
when you don't have a body?

191
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,929
Yeah, but meteors?

192
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,767
Thousands of meteors smack
into earth every single year.

193
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,959
A visitor just hitches a ride,

194
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,271
and nobody blinks an eye.

195
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,839
Think about it.

196
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,912
And they steal our bodies?

197
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,847
I didn't say "steal."

198
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,783
I said "inhabit."

199
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,275
Control.

200
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,555
Hey, listen.

201
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,424
I don't need you to be a true believer,

202
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,651
at least not until you truly believe.

203
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,355
I'm just glad you're still listening.

204
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,990
It means you got a critical brain.

205
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,635
No judgment.

206
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,561
No scoffing. Just...

207
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,530
Take it in, weigh the evidence...

208
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,433
Then decide for yourself.

209
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,342
Then what do they do?

210
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,579
After they inhabit you?

211
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,659
You got good visitors, you got bad ones.

212
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,561
From the same place.

213
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:42,555
When a good one shows
up, a bad one hunts it down.

214
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:44,857
Well, why?

215
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,869
Why here?

216
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,838
Million-dollar question.

217
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,398
And you zeroed right in on it.

218
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,334
There's that critical brain.

219
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,338
Razor sharp, Travis, razor sharp.

220
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,514
So, how come you know all this stuff?

221
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,192
There, look.

222
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,103
Right on time.

223
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,305
Shit, no, that-that's not

224
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,642
well, it could be
something. Could be nothin'.

225
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,119
Give me a minute.

226
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,712
This guy's with me.

227
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,790
Can he hold a gun?

228
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,495
- That's a good question.
- Should we find out?

229
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,598
Let's take a ride.

230
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,935
That would've flunked
you out of the academy.

231
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,460
Give me this.

232
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,928
Thumbs clear.

233
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,198
Point it at your target.

234
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,977
Line up the index and middle finger.

235
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,404
It's simple, effective.

236
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,822
What's the deal with the
photos of you guys anyway?

237
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,959
Shooting a stranger, that's easy.

238
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,396
Shooting a friend, that's hard.

239
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,574
So, you're not police anymore.

240
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,578
Me and the force parted
ways, that's correct.

241
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,618
That was nice, Travis. Just know,

242
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,397
shooting isn't what's going to save you.

243
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,366
A visitor, it's made of nothing.

244
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,436
It's like... vapor or air.

245
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,538
Shooting can't kill it.

246
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:38,207
And you can kill the host.

247
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,833
But the visitor?

248
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,902
It'll just hop into somebody else.

249
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:46,006
But here's the thing.

250
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,208
We've got our eyes on someone.

251
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,220
Someone who's being
inhabited by a visitor.

252
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:52,779
Shut the fuck up.

253
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,350
Mary Alice ducker.

254
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,164
Just looks like some lady, right?

255
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,757
- Yeah.
- Trust me,

256
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,103
that's a visitor.

257
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:08,337
A bad one.

258
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,976
How do you know?

259
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,412
People I'm with, Carol and Milo,

260
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,071
the ones in that chat room I showed you,

261
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,417
been following her
going on two years now.

262
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,777
Just following her for no reason?

263
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,255
There's that critical brain of yours.

264
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,614
Christ!

265
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,250
I wondered that too.

266
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,218
But trust me,

267
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:33,829
they have their reasons.

268
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,466
No deviation from her daily routine,

269
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,635
until two weeks ago, that is.

270
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,395
Then all of a sudden,
she gets real active.

271
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:47,476
Buying a gun, zip ties,
all kinds of gearing up,

272
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,245
getting ready kind of activities.

273
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,013
Jesus, I don't know about this.

274
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,250
Well... we do, so.

275
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:58,220
Mary Alice's behavior,
all the meteor activity,

276
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,023
means another visitor is coming.

277
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,191
A good one.

278
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,456
Put this up.

279
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,436
We don't know when
she'll make her move,

280
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,137
but it's going to be soon.

281
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,539
Clock's ticking.

282
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,474
When the good visitor gets here,

283
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,177
Mary Alice is going to hunt it down.

284
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,646
When she does, we hunt her down,

285
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,481
and she leads us right to it.

286
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,074
Then what?

287
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,056
Then we save the fucking day.

288
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,548
That's what.

289
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,495
Are you sure?

290
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,466
I mean, how come
you know all this stuff?

291
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,071
What if you're just.

292
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,542
I don't know...

293
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,954
Chasing shadows?

294
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:23,530
Baby blue.

295
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,900
Bluest eyes you've ever seen.

296
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,070
My daughter Alyssa.

297
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:38,945
Ten years ago, long before I moved here,

298
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,983
Alyssa, she just... Went
for a walk in the woods.

299
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:48,388
That's it, a walk.

300
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:51,257
And came back changed.

301
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:56,896
A visitor, a good one, was inhabiting her.

302
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,898
I thought.

303
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,635
I don't know what I
thought. I tried to call 9-1-1,

304
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,938
but the phones were dead.

305
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:09,809
The trap had already been sprung
and Alyssa was being hunted.

306
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,415
Then a bad visitor knocked on our door.

307
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:19,495
"My name's Adam, and I'm here to help."

308
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,530
Dressed like an EMT,

309
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,100
looked like someone who would help.

310
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:28,628
I wanted to be relieved,
but it didn't make sense.

311
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,966
He saw doubt on my
face, pointed a gun at me.

312
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,603
I froze.

313
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,615
He also had a bottle of this liquid,

314
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,250
and he drank some of it,

315
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,519
forced Alyssa to drink some.

316
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,157
Then he dragged her out of the house.

317
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:49,582
I chased after them.

318
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,594
But they just...

319
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,987
Walked through the
trap like it was nothing.

320
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:58,234
When I reached the edge of the trap,

321
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:01,203
the pain was absolute.

322
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,830
I mean, it was everything.

323
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:07,734
But, somehow, I fell backwards.

324
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,246
Of course, I tried to get back up

325
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,938
and go through it, but...

326
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,251
This time I could tell the trap was close

327
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,843
'cause I could feel it.

328
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,954
Bet I'd feel it

329
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:22,048
if one of those traps was close right now.

330
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,684
That ache.

331
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,021
And then,

332
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,190
at some point, the...

333
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,760
The trap, it was just gone.

334
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:38,631
And... Of course, by then, so were they.

335
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,639
It took Alyssa.

336
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,777
Not far.

337
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,079
It turned out...

338
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,983
Well, I'm guessing it
had someone waiting.

339
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:03,399
Someone it could move the
visitor inhabiting Alyssa into.

340
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:06,059
So, the bad one let her go.

341
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,061
No.

342
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,132
I found Alyssa...

343
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,737
The next morning... Dead.

344
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,983
Throat cut,

345
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,744
in a dumpster behind
a convenience store.

346
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,145
This is...

347
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,614
This is what the visitor made her drink.

348
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:53,716
This... this is the liquid.

349
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,946
It's yours.

350
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,492
- What? No, I can't...
- yes, yes.

351
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,151
Yes, yes, yes.

352
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,061
Thank you.

353
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:37,183
Nobody gets hurt?

354
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,021
Not if I can help it.

355
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,298
What do you need me to do?

356
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,169
I need you to drive the car.

357
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,321
Hey, take a zip tie.

358
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,928
- What am I supposed to do with it?
- Just in case.

359
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:45,185
Can you shut the fuck up?

360
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,354
Steady.

361
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,674
Is that her?

362
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,878
Mother fuck!

363
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,547
I've seen that car before.

364
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,015
No, that's not her.

365
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,583
That's fucking Hayden.

366
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,085
Who's Hayden?

367
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,087
Hayden's the asshole you're replacing.

368
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,788
That's his mask you're
gonna be wearing.

369
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,090
Replaced? I thought we were

370
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:15,491
he's gonna fucking spook her.

371
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,650
Hayden was a member of
our little band of brothers.

372
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,653
Until he preemptively shit the
fucking bed. Told you he's a psycho.

373
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:28,704
Yeah, that's right. Get
the fuck out of here.

374
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,641
That was fucking cutting it too close.

375
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,777
We're fine. We're good.

376
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,077
Got a visual.

377
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,219
That's her.

378
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,730
Let's go.

379
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,890
Whoa. Look, look.

380
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,228
She brought help.

381
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,740
Looks like a killer.

382
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,909
Bet she trained him to do just that.

383
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,544
Jesus.

384
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,036
All right, let's go.

385
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,364
Gotcha.

386
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:01,764
Woman in the doorway. See?

387
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:04,124
That's got to be our good visitor.

388
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,336
She just looks sick.

389
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,039
Jesus Christ. Meteor hits
in the immediate vicinity

390
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,108
less than 48 hours ago. Fact.

391
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:15,978
Our target, locked and
loaded, comes here. Fact.

392
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:20,483
And that woman is behaving exactly
like somebody who's being inhabited.

393
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:23,977
We're just gonna march up and
accuse some lady of being a killer alien?

394
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:27,156
And do what with the
other lady? Kidnap her?

395
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,891
- Travis.
- I'm just... I'm just trying

396
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:32,585
you wanna just sit here and watch
bad shit happen to that family?

397
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,323
Or you wanna save some lives?

398
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,106
- Fuck it. Fuck!
- Okay.

399
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,442
Fuck.

400
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:15,971
Eyes wide, boys! Eyes wide!

401
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,198
This is fucking insane.

402
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,278
- On the move!
- What do I do?

403
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,023
Just set the pool up.

404
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:35,791
No, wait. Come on.
We're not really gonna

405
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:38,051
Travis, please!

406
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:44,066
Clear!

407
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,406
There!

408
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,870
Fuck, come on.

409
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,673
Come on. God dammit. Fuck.

410
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,618
Man down, man down!

411
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,030
Fuck! Fuck.

412
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,267
Fuck.

413
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,913
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

414
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,741
Mcnab!

415
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,177
Stay there!

416
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,323
Holy...

417
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:17,486
There's no time, Travis! I'm sorry!

418
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,611
Mcnab!

419
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,246
Wait, please!

420
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,092
- Don't leave me!
- She's setting the trap!

421
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:25,185
Wait, please!

422
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,554
No!

423
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:34,227
Fuck.

424
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,641
Please... Please pick up, please pick up.

425
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:41,510
Please don't leave me...

426
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,671
Come on, mcnab. Please,
please, please don't leave me...

427
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,787
So the visitor... It moved into you?

428
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,656
The voice in my head?

429
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:39,459
The voice that's me?

430
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:44,564
There was another voice in there.

431
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,334
Yelling.

432
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,278
Angry.

433
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:52,839
A fucking battering ram of a voice.

434
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,788
And then everything went weird

435
00:37:58,812 --> 00:38:02,992
and dizzy, and I felt like I was drowning.

436
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:07,163
But I didn't die. I just kept drowning...

437
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,856
Drowning and drowning in this nothing.

438
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,695
I tried to fucking fight it. I
tried to swim to the surface.

439
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:20,600
And... I did.

440
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:24,213
Just for a second, I-I broke through,

441
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:26,682
and I was me.

442
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,744
And I was able to say something.

443
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,548
I said, "stop."

444
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,685
Please, stop.

445
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,890
But it didn't.

446
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,717
Who... who are you?

447
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:13,486
Where am I?

448
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,918
Mcnab!

449
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:20,930
Where the fuck did you go?!

450
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:29,038
Travis. Travis?

451
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:30,172
Travis!

452
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:32,866
Shit!

453
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:40,683
Okay... look at me... Look at me...

454
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:43,519
We're gonna get... We're
gonna get you outta here.

455
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:46,046
We're gonna... we're
gonna get you to a hospital.

456
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:51,951
What... what are you saying?

457
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,052
Fuck it!

458
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:37,797
I was so fucked up, it moved into Olsen.

459
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,837
Which I thought was a
good thing, you know?

460
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,850
'Cause all I wanted was
to get the fuck out of there.

461
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:48,875
Hide.

462
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,791
I saw her go into the fucking silo.

463
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:07,694
I saw her set the trap.

464
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:10,563
And what did I do?

465
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,066
Just stood there.

466
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,138
Maybe I could have stopped her.

467
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:22,242
Maybe I could have stopped all of this.

468
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:27,256
There's got to be some way to turn
the fucking trap off, though, right?

469
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,718
Only one who can stop it
is the visitor who made it.

470
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:35,355
Anyone else, it'll kill 'em.

471
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:39,993
It'll draw 'em in, like a moth to flame,

472
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:42,371
then kill 'em.

473
00:44:05,211 --> 00:44:06,980
I don't wanna die.

474
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:11,951
Not here, not like this.

475
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,856
But at least this way.

476
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:21,094
I don't have to die alone, anymore.

477
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:26,766
Please, I am begging you.

478
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,378
I am begging you.

479
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:32,072
All you have to do is let me go.

480
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:57,130
My aunt Julie

481
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:03,236
she's the only family who
ever gave a shit about me.

482
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:07,007
Died when I was a kid.

483
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:10,810
She believed in all this stuff.

484
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,346
The martians...

485
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:16,282
Lights in the sky...

486
00:45:17,717 --> 00:45:19,786
We're not alone.

487
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,961
Wish I could tell her she was right.

488
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,099
Actually...

489
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:36,369
Maybe I can.

490
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:40,616
No, no, no, no, no, no!

491
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:06,800
Ruben!

492
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,968
James!

493
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,984
James.

494
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:27,954
It won't let me leave!

495
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,124
It's getting closer.

496
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,538
Don't leave me!

497
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:36,629
Hold on!

498
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,144
I found an ax. I can break you out.

499
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,489
Move away from the wall!

500
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:56,049
I can't! Just... do it now!

501
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,051
We gotta get home.

502
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:39,292
I don't have a fucking home!

503
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,582
We don't got time for this.

504
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,385
I'm sorry.

505
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,462
It just happened.

506
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:19,199
Things don't just happen.

507
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,972
We gotta go.

508
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,417
We can't just leave it.

509
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:30,553
Ruben, everyone back
at the house is in danger.

510
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,787
We gotta go.

511
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:35,514
Can you ride?

512
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:38,218
Fuck you.

513
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:58,071
Arlo!

514
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:16,556
My god.

515
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,428
Arlo! Hey.

516
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:25,165
Arlo. My god. Are you okay?

517
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,843
My god.
