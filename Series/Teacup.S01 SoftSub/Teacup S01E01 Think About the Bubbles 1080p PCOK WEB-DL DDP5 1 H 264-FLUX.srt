1
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,510
Murder.

2
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,546
Maker.

3
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,418
Murder-maker.

4
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,154
- Come here.
- No way.

5
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,722
Oh, come on. Be brave.

6
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,801
It's a tempest in a teacup.

7
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,203
What's a tempest?

8
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,038
It's like a really big storm.

9
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,307
That's what we've got.

10
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,243
A really big tempest
in a teacup.

11
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,347
Yeah. Hey, will you grab me
a piece of paper?

12
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,029
Okay. Ready?

13
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:21,201
Count of three. Ready?
One, two, and three.

14
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,536
- Three!
- I got it.

15
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,506
I'm gonna go outside and let
him go. You wanna come?

16
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,876
No way. But do it right there
so I can see?

17
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,444
Okay, you got it.

18
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,247
Dad's gonna think
this is awesome.

19
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,955
How about this is our thing?
You and me?

20
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,657
Yeah, cool. Just us.

What are you doing?

33
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,759
I was just up in the hayloft

34
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,695
cleaning up
this submarine fort thing
I built for Arlo.

35
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,466
Might repaint Mer's
tea party table too.

36
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,103
It's dumb. I know they don't
go up there anymore.
I just thought, "Why not?"

37
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,638
Are the animals still worked up?

38
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,609
Yeah. Goats... Sagebrush,
especially Ginger.

39
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,745
I don't know. It's weird.

40
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,813
Something got 'em
really spooked.

41
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,617
You, uh, make peace with my mom?

42
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,753
I will.

43
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,321
Okay.

44
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,425
You want me to walk Ginger
down to the clinic
so you can check her out?

45
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,361
Uh, I already closed
everything up for the weekend.

46
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,497
This is hard...

47
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,301
not talking about what's really
going on with us, Maggie.

48
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,370
I told you, James,

49
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,372
I'm not ready to talk.

50
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,565
You ready?

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,804
- One...
- One, two, three.

52
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,483
Hey.

53
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,651
Whoa. Okay...

54
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,621
Settle. Settle.

55
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,857
Jeez. Okay.

56
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,794
Hey...

57
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,699
Here.

58
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,669
What's up with you, huh?
Come here.

59
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,837
- Hey.

60
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,607
All right.

61
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,091
Mr. Goat?

62
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,526
Where are you, Mr. Goat?

63
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,095
I am glad that you're here.

64
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,432
You say that now.

65
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,435
- Look, Ellen...
- You know, I-I was lonely.

66
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,071
I-I was living alone.

67
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,774
So that's why I'm thrilled
to be here.

68
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,909
But it's not just because
of that

69
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,912
or because I get to see
these kids grow up, but...

70
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,049
I'm-I'm here for James.

71
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,217
Maggie...

72
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,154
I'm here for you too.

73
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,058
Well, I shouldn't have said
what I said earlier.

74
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,197
Remind me what that was...

75
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,103
You're not a pothead and I don't
think you have an addled brain.

76
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,238
I wish I could get
everybody else stoned

77
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,909
so that people wouldn't stare
at the old lady with the tremor.

78
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,877
Well, one, fuck anybody
who stares.

79
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,714
And two, I really do understand
why you smoke,

80
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,750
and it's fantastic
that it helps you,

81
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,252
and three, it's not you
that I'm angry with.

82
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,922
Look,
it's none of my business,

83
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,324
but if there's anything
that you need...

84
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,260
Thank you.

85
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,099
Well, you also know
that I'm not the easiest person
to help on a good day.

86
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,102
You know, recognizing
that you have a problem

87
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,137
is often the first step.

88
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,174
I appreciate everything that
you're doing, and I apologize
for being a bitch.

89
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,411
That smells wonderful,
and I will now grab the troops

90
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,414
for a lovely family meal.

91
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,290
Hey, have you seen
your brother?

92
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,227
- What?
- That's rotting your brain.

93
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,262
My brain's in better shape
than yours.

94
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,297
Well, one might think so, but...

95
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,469
"Two households,
both alike in dignity,
in fair Verona,

96
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,838
where we lay our scene,
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

97
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,507
where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean.

98
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,442
- From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes..."
- Mmm.

99
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,678
Can you name the four chambers
of a cow's stomach?

100
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,714
Rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum.

101
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,150
Gosh, I hope I pass the test.

102
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,218
That's my girl.

103
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,188
- Now, where's Arlo?
- How should I know?

104
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,190
Well, he was up here
a minute ago.

105
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,459
Oh, dinner's ready.

106
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,298
No Arlo?

107
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,635
Oh, no. I-I thought I heard
someone go out,

108
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,470
but I was so into the cooking...

109
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,108
Hey, have you seen Arlo?

110
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,310
He's probably hiding.

111
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,080
He, uh...

112
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,682
he jack-in-the-boxed
out of our closet last week

113
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,417
and it scared the shit
out of me.

114
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,452
Right.

115
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,421
Yeah, he, uh, did the same
thing to me yesterday.

116
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,417
It's the Shanleys.

117
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,120
You gotta be kidding me.

118
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:12,132
Hey, Maggie,
it's our horse, Scout.

119
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,567
You gotta help him, please.

120
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,802
Dad?

121
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,672
Mer, your brother's MIA.
Can you go look for him?

122
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,142
- I wanna see what's going on.
- Mer, please, can you just
go find him?

123
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,612
I'll go. I'll go. I'm sure
Arlo's just hiding for fun.

124
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,080
- Yeah.
- Okay.

125
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,119
- Hey... Hey, Scout.

126
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,157
- Hey, boy. Oh...

127
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,694
Okay, you're all right.

128
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,096
I gotcha. Oh...

129
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,398
Nicholas said he did all that
to himself.

130
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,133
What, a rattlesnake scare him?

131
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,869
Might panic, bolt.
But this?

132
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,939
We're sorry for showing up
after hours. If it weren't
an emergency...

133
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,010
Oh, no, it's fine.
Ruben, how about you, me,
and Scout head to the clinic.

134
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,279
Uh, why am I not seeing Arlo?

135
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,182
- It's okay, Mom's got him.
- No, she doesn't.

136
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,686
Okay. Meryl, can you check
the barn and garage?

137
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,488
The rest of us
will double-check the house.

138
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,491
I got him. I got him.

139
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,693
Okay, let's go.

140
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,229
- Arlo?

141
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,597
Arlo!

142
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,067
All right. Easy...

143
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,604
Can you back him out?

144
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,643
Our animals have been
acting strange too.

145
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,245
Must be something.

146
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,091
Oh my God...

147
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,227
What did you do?

148
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,835
Hey, Arlo, you up there?

149
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,407
- Arlo, I'm counting to five.

150
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,877
Anybody else
use a little courage?

151
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,679
I'm certainly not gonna say no.

152
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,980
Yeah, sure thing.

153
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,449
I just rode him out
to check the fence lines.

154
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,919
It's part of my chores.
It was so... weird.

155
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,921
I was telling him "whoa"
to stop,

156
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,224
but that's when Scout started
bucking and neighing.
He got spooked.

157
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,627
And I was calm
like you taught me, Mom,
and I got him to stop.

158
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,129
But then he just put his head
up against the fence

159
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,999
and started moving it back
and forth and back and forth.

160
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,935
But I thought he was maybe
scratching an itch,

161
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,870
but he started doing it
really, really hard.

162
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,676
I could see that he was bleeding
and he just kind of twisted up
against the fence and fell.

163
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,013
It was so scary.
I ran to get Dad.

164
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,485
Maggie's gonna take care
of Scout, okay?

165
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,821
I'm gonna go up
just to be triple-sure,

166
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,190
and then... I guess it's time
to head outside.

167
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,061
Uh, Valeria, could you grab
a couple of flashlights
from the living room, please?

168
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,263
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

169
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,616
Our secret.

170
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,069
This is from his first album.

171
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,971
Oh, I'm impressed.

172
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,409
♪ He's a perfect stranger... ♪

173
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,147
What is that?

174
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,349
Same kind of thing
happened in the car.

175
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,886
I think Dad said it was just,
like, the weather or something.

176
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,225
Hey, uh, do you know
what I like to do?

177
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,360
What?

178
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,962
Uh, whenever I'm,
you know, worried

179
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,065
or sad, or scared,

180
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:10,637
I like to name the thing
out loud, whatever it is,
and then I add a "but."

181
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,006
What?

182
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,645
Well, "Arlo is missing...
but we're gonna find him."

183
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,617
And, "This is scary,
but I have a little whiskey
to give me courage."

184
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,495
* If you see him
in the subway ♪

185
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,366
♪ He'll be down
at the end of the car ♪

186
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,016
All right...

187
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,484
You ready?

188
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,786
- Whoa.

189
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,059
Okay, nice and easy.

190
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,563
Easy. Okay.

191
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,133
Okay. Steady. Steady.

192
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,502
Easy, easy, easy.

193
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,440
Okay...

194
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,210
The eyes look fine.
We have a few cuts,

195
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,312
but nothing too terrible.

196
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,582
Just like that, we're looking
at a bright-side situation.

197
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,819
What?

198
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,288
If this is bright side,
I don't want to see the dark.

199
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,324
Ah. Well, the nose is why
all the blood.

200
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,860
It's a lot of bleeding
with the nostrils.

201
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,431
If it wasn't his muzzle,
I'd just use staples.

202
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,507
You wanna learn
how to stitch a wound?

203
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,875
Absolutely.

204
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,185
All right.

205
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,153
Let's see.

206
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,657
- Oh, shit.

207
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,625
Shit?

208
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,861
Shit.

209
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,498
I should have seen that.

210
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,575
Hey.

211
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,710
You haven't said anything
to Ruben?

212
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,579
No. I would have told you.

213
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,814
I know, it's just
when you pulled up--

214
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,783
Hi. Nothing?

215
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,518
One of the goats is gone, too.

216
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,321
- One of the goats is gone...
- Something is going on.

217
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,457
Donald Kelly called this morning
asking if we'd seen Duke.

218
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,992
Dog never leaves Claire's side.

219
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,627
All of a sudden,
this morning on a walk,

220
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,096
he just starts getting
squirrelly and runs off?

221
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,898
- Hmm.
- Dad.

222
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,933
Are we worried, like,
for real?

223
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,670
Are we worried? No.
We are not worried.

224
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,239
We are not worried.
Arlo is hiding,

225
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,907
or he went after
a missing goat.

226
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,277
Stupid goats are always going
into the woods.

227
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,779
Exactly, then it got dark.

228
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,947
You guys always say
if we get lost to stay put.

229
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,950
That's right. Now Arlo
is sitting there like a goof,

230
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:13,987
waiting for someone
to come find him.

231
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,221
- Okay?
- Okay.

232
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,691
Take Nicholas, go into the woods
around the back.

233
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,193
We'll go around the front,
meet somewhere in the middle.

234
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,395
- Aye-aye, captain.
- Aye-aye.

235
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,436
Come on, let's go find
that gremlin.

236
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,804
Yup...

237
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,675
Hello?

238
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,312
Is anyone out there?

239
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,850
I... I think I'm lost.

240
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,618
Gunshot... calmate...

241
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,188
Gunshot... Calmate...
men-strange... murder-maker.

242
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,491
Ella esta mintiendo.
Ella esta mintiendo!

243
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,626
Murder-maker. Run-ran-hide.

244
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,430
Calmate... gunshot...
men-strange... murder-maker!

245
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,400
Ella esta mintiendo!
Murder-maker.

246
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,603
Murder-maker!

247
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,045
Arlo!

248
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,848
Arlo!

249
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,054
Come on, Arlo,
enough is enough.

250
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,290
Your family's awesome.

251
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,892
Are you kidding?

252
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,960
Arlo?

253
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,530
- Your dad's funny.
- My dad thinks he's funny.

254
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,467
Okay, well, your mom... I mean,
that was some scary shit.

255
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,636
But now it's just not.

256
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,839
- And what she's doing
with Scout, it's--
- Yeah, she's great...

257
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,107
with animals.

258
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,742
Your grandma's way cool too.

259
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,711
Smokes a ton of pot.

260
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:18,712
Even cooler.

261
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,680
- It's for pain and stuff.
- Oh.

262
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,317
She's got multiple sclerosis.
Her hands never stop shaking.

263
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,120
No, I, um, I saw that. Yeah.

264
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,390
My parents, they fight a lot.
My mom's always on me
about something.

265
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,027
And now, my stupid brother
has vanished, so.

266
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,763
So, yeah, totally awesome.

267
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,333
Do you wanna hear a joke?

268
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,968
- No.
- Oh...

269
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,139
- Okay, fine, go ahead.
- Okay, so,

270
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,743
what do you call a banana
eating a banana?

271
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,145
What?

272
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,980
"Canabananalism."

273
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,558
- What are you doing?
- What? What do you mean?

274
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,595
"Your family's so awesome..."
"Wanna hear a joke..."

275
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,096
What's...

276
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,234
Arlo? You out there?

277
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,872
- What was that? Shh, shh...
- What was what?

278
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,483
Is that Arlo?

279
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,155
Doesn't sound like Arlo.

280
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,262
It's called
the sternocephalicus.

281
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,431
But the muscle,
it's not what worries me.

282
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,666
If that thing is long enough,
it could have

283
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,668
nicked the jugular,
the carotid.

284
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,204
- Pull it out and...
- Yes.

285
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,541
There's no getting around it, though.

286
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,578
I'm gonna need you
to hold his head real good
this time, okay?

287
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,151
All right. Nice and easy.

288
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,590
Nice and easy.

289
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,426
- Shh.

290
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,196
Okay. Three, two, one.

291
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,734
- Hold tight.

292
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,435
Shh.

293
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,142
Okay... just a little blood.

294
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,583
Okay.

295
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,518
Okay.

296
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,624
All right,
you're gonna be just fine.

297
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,826
He's gonna be just fine.

298
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:49,529
You okay?

299
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,900
This bright-side situation
we got goin' on here
all of a sudden...

300
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,602
Whew!

301
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,238
You're all right. Nice and easy.

302
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,473
Arlo!

303
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,909
Arlo!

304
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,311
Did you see the look
Maggie gave me?

305
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,914
Maggie didn't give you a look.
She knows what happened,

306
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,582
but doesn't know
who it happened with.

307
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:11,851
Okay, well, it's only
a matter of time.

308
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,253
Okay...

309
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,288
Arlo!

310
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:19,225
Yeah, I'd be really worried
if this was my first rodeo,

311
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:23,363
but... but this was before
Arlo was born, actually.

312
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:27,701
Maggie's usually at her best
when bad things happen.

313
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,071
She takes control and does
what needs to be done.

314
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,606
I know. Ruben's the same way.
He's a man on a mission.

315
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,209
Yeah, but not this time.

316
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:40,880
Maggie couldn't find Meryl
anywhere. Nowhere.

317
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,083
Not-not the barn,
not the hayloft

318
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:45,852
where I built this little
table and chairs

319
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,921
for her to have her tea parties.
Not the clinic.

320
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,790
Checked every cupboard
and closet in the house.

321
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,860
Up here, down the driveway.
Nothing.

322
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,894
Nothing.

323
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:58,264
Then I come home from work
and I-I...

324
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,033
I'd never seen Maggie
like that.

325
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,302
I mean,
she was paralyzed, frozen.

326
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,572
Could barely speak.
She just...

327
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,640
just sat there shivering.

328
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,711
Where was Meryl?

329
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,347
In the fucking oven.

330
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,916
- In the oven?
- Yeah.

331
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,519
Yeah, we read her
Hansel and Gretel.

332
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,621
The witch wants to bake them,
you know?

333
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,290
So Mer climbed in
just to see if she could fit,

334
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:27,560
and... [whistles] ...somehow
closed the door, too.

335
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:31,097
She wanted us to come find her
but the door was too heavy

336
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,733
and she got stuck.

337
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,468
Good Lord.

338
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,837
Yeah, no way out.
So what does she do?

339
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,507
Kid falls asleep.

340
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,311
And we didn't find her
until we come into the kitchen
to wait for the police.

341
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,615
God, it was so scary.

342
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,021
Kids...

343
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,691
They're just so stupid.

344
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,060
They're stupid.

345
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,328
I mean, I love 'em both so much
it hurts, but...

346
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,535
Why am I telling you this
right now?

347
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,305
'Cause you really are worried.

348
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,576
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- Yeah.

349
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,378
And you love your kids.

350
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,981
- Of course, more than anything.
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,984
And you love Maggie too.

352
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:33,193
- We found the Kellys' dog.
- And we found Mr. Goat too.

353
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:34,894
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

354
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,097
- Good, good, good.

355
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,239
What is that?

356
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,476
Okay. Hey, guys?

357
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:51,277
Everyone back to the house
right now.

358
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,816
Keep going. Go, go, go.

359
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,635
- Did you find him?
- No, but I will.

360
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,437
What does that mean?

361
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,039
Hey. Where are you going?

362
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,974
Meryl, what are you doing
with the goat?

363
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,944
I found him
in the woods. Dad?

364
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:31,978
Yeah?

365
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:42,689
Duke!

366
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,157
Duke!

367
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,193
Did you happen to see
our son, Arlo?

368
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,662
No, we're just out
looking for our dog. Why?

369
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:51,698
How long's your son
been missing?

370
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,199
An hour, tops.

371
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,502
James, what are you doing
with the bat?

372
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:59,305
We saw a coyote.
At least I think it was
a coyote, I'm not sure.

373
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,608
Whatever it was, there was
something wrong with it.

374
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,843
That's why we're here.

375
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,945
That wasn't a coyote you saw.

376
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,281
It was a dog. A big one.

377
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,183
No collar, nothing.

378
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:12,252
The way he was eyeballin' us...

379
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,220
- We think he was rabid
or something.
- Yeah.

380
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,389
Growlin', hackles up.
We thought for sure

381
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,459
the bastard was gonna lunge,
then he took off.

382
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:20,894
You got kids.

383
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:24,297
Wanted to make sure
you had a heads-up.

384
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,801
Jesus Christ, man.
What are you doing?

385
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,436
Hey, if it were my kid...

386
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:31,671
- It's not your kid.
- Did you not hear
what I just said?

387
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,373
Yeah, I heard you
loud and clear.

388
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:35,308
There's a rabid dog.
Getting ready to play softball?

389
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,644
You're getting ready to drop
into a fucking war zone.

390
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:40,780
How about you just show me
where you saw the dog,
and I'll take care of it.

391
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,916
James!
Oh my God.

392
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:46,586
Arlo!

393
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,388
Arlo...

394
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,324
- Arlo! What happened?
Oh my God.

395
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,326
Maggie, his arms.

396
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,863
- Oh my God.
- Those look like finger marks.

397
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,565
Like-- Like someone
grabbed him.

398
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,935
Hey. Hey...
Who did this to you?

399
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:06,172
Buzz-goat, wasp-find...
men-strange, murder-maker...

400
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:09,309
Esta mintiendo!
Run-ran-hide! Run-ran-hide!

401
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,078

men-strange, murder-maker...

402
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,246
- Ella esta mintiendo!
- It's okay.

403
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:15,048
Run-ran-hide!
Run-ran-hide!

404
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,751
Buzz-goat, wasp-find...

405
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,252
ella está mintiendo.

406
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,221
Men-strange, murder-maker!
Ella está mintiendo...

407
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,023
Run-ran-hide!
Run-ran-hide!

408
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:26,359
Oh, my God... Arlo! Arlo? Okay.

409
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:28,228
Oh my God! Oh my God...

410
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,470
¿Hola?

411
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,506
¿Quien es?

412
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,475
Is someone there?

413
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,248
Ayudame, por favor.
