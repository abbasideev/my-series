1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,385
- Ruben!
- James.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,044
Hold on!

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,090
We can't just leave it.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,958
Everyone at the house
is in danger. We gotta go.

5
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,426
It's fine if you hate me.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,662
I don't hate you, I feel bad for you.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,696
James was right.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,897
About what?

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,523
How cold you can be.

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,926
Harbinger says mcnab is good.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,138
It's the other one, assassin, that's bad.

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,663
Meryl said that harbinger

13
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,875
is on some kind of a mission.

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,410
- What is it?
- To find the machine.

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,545
What happens when you turn it on?

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,580
We prepare.

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,948
Prepare for what?

18
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,050
The invasion.

19
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,551
This is the liquid.

20
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,643
It's yours.

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,288
We need to find grandma.

22
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,524
You really believe she'd hurt us?

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,548
Yeah.

24
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,952
I don't think it's me. Not anymore.

25
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,330
It could be in any one of us.

26
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,600
It does say if we can
just find out who it is,

27
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,802
there's a way to get
the assassin out of them.

28
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,960
How?

29
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,462
We drown them.

30
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,627
Shit.

31
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,781
Valeria?

32
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,754
For the kids.

33
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,835
I would have done the same thing,

34
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,828
but no one's getting past Nicholas.

35
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,997
Not on my watch.

36
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,288
I remember the barn.

37
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,948
I remember that man, Olsen.

38
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,850
And then

39
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,321
pitch black.

40
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,789
Nothing.

41
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,470
Well, not nothing, but

42
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,963
I mean, I-I tried to cry out.

43
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,909
I know I could have done it,

44
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,845
but I was just... I was just too tired.

45
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,605
And too scared.

46
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,776
I heard something...

47
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,157
Someone was whispering.

48
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,959
Someone awful.

49
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,527
In my head.

50
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,654
They kept whispering, and whispering.

51
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,827
I couldn't make out the words.

52
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,799
And then I was back in the barn.

53
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,869
And you didn't see anyone then?

54
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,639
Maybe a movement, or a shape.

55
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
But... I felt like I'd been hit by a truck.

56
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,012
Yeah, I get it.

57
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:11,051
But... anything could be a clue.

58
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,721
What if we did know?

59
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,725
What if we actually figured out who it is?

60
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,572
Are we really gonna drown someone?

61
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,166
We should do another sweep.

62
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,512
Mcnab's hurt.

63
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,536
He's scared.

64
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,584
In his own fucked up way, he was
trying to help. He's not coming back.

65
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,143
You don't know that.

66
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,421
And this?

67
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,956
This is a waste of time.

68
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,125
- Somebody's gonna see the smoke.
- Yeah?

69
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,626
And think we're burning leaves.

70
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,296
- Ruben, it's Monday.
- So what?

71
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,699
So, ups, fed ex, mailman...

72
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,201
Somebody will come today.

73
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,128
And will they be here before
another one of us dies?

74
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,111
I didn't think so.

75
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,590
Jesus Christ! It's not me.

76
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,292
Well.

77
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,317
That was easy.

78
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,986
Fuck you.

79
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,655
What are we supposed to do, then?

80
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,059
Not stand around a
fucking campfire, that's what.

81
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,701
Someone needs to check
if his... yeah, I'm on it.

82
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,238
Throw one of those on.

83
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,884
Nobody's gonna think "burning leaves"

84
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,143
if you get some black smoke goin'.

85
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,985
Hey.

86
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,299
Bet you forgot about these.

87
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,891
I did.

88
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,895
Still any good?

89
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,933
Ooh. Wow.

90
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,569
That was awful.

91
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,006
Give me one.

92
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,876
Thanks.

93
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,123
Fuck.

94
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,639
Keep expecting
someone to just open fire.

95
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,131
Yeah.

96
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,477
I don't know, I think it's
more targeted than that.

97
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,115
Olsen, he didn't shoot.
He... he insinuated himself.

98
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,450
You know?

99
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,409
He was patient, subtle.

100
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,847
Nothing subtle about navarros.

101
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,622
We can't do this.

102
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,468
"Check for signs of life."

103
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,271
"Put your ear near their
mouth and watch their chest"

104
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,817
I mean, it just sounds insane. It's crazy.

105
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,209
I know.

106
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,879
I know. But...

107
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,124
What if?

108
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,461
I mean, if it were to
actually come down to it.

109
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,353
Then what?

110
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,133
Of all of us, you'd be the one to

111
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,534
- don't do that.
- Don't do what?

112
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,237
Act like I'm not just as
terrified as everybody else.

113
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,772
I'm just saying, you're very good at

114
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,340
very good at what?

115
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,844
Go on.

116
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,370
Very good at being so fucking cold?

117
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,006
That I could drown somebody?

118
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,144
Just... end a life.

119
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,114
Is that what you're saying?

120
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,084
- Maggie...
- And let's say I did that.

121
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,021
And let's say I was actually
able to bring somebody back.

122
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,767
And that somehow, some way,

123
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,802
it actually fucking worked.

124
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,105
Then what?

125
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,398
We figure it out.

126
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,477
What you mean is I figure it out.

127
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,846
No, I mean "we."

128
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,648
Together. We figure it out.

129
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,907
Yeah.

130
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,077
Yeah.

131
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,047
Yeah, you don't get to do that either.

132
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,446
Whatever you're thinking, this isn't that.

133
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,081
So what is it?

134
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,076
Well, if I'm right, it's a way out.

135
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,321
Bullshit.

136
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,513
Follow me.

137
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,891
Keep your rifle pointed
at me the whole time.

138
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,795
I'll show you what I'm gonna do. Then
you can decide if it's bullshit or not.

139
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,221
Or shoot me now.

140
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,991
Otherwise, I'm going.

141
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,155
No sign of mcnab. Nothing's upstairs.

142
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,358
Except Olsen.

143
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,560
Don't think about it.

144
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,472
Well, it's kind of hard not to.

145
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,409
Okay, people need to eat,

146
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,512
and this stuff's all
just gonna go bad, so...

147
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,039
Will you hold this open for me?

148
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,454
Yeah.

149
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,314
This... and this...

150
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,090
Hey.

151
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,060
I didn't sleep.

152
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,197
Obviously.

153
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,077
I was all alone, and
Ruben had already left

154
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,947
and Nicholas was upstairs, safe.

155
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,941
And there was this little bit of light,

156
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,586
and, you know, it was almost dawn,

157
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,414
and just for a minute, I thought about...

158
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,426
Bread pudding.

159
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,063
Bread pudding.

160
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,332
Ruben loves it. Nicholas, especially.

161
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,135
I wish I could make it. There's this,

162
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,070
restaurant, luckily, where we all go,

163
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,263
just the three of us.

164
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:49,269
And just for a minute,
I actually felt hopeful.

165
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:54,283
You know, like somehow
this could all turn out okay.

166
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,985
- It-it's crazy.
- No.

167
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,754
It's not crazy.

168
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,247
- It's not?
- Absolutely not.

169
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,251
Because every once in a while

170
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,494
things actually do turn out okay.

171
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,192
It says there's this family in Maine.

172
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,793
They had masks on.

173
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,528
Real masks, like mcnab's,

174
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:43,432
and the mom, she
had an assassin in her,

175
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,658
so they tied her up and
drowned her in a lake.

176
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,697
How come nobody's
heard about any of this?

177
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,567
They've been keeping
it a secret on purpose.

178
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,581
It says there's these... Groups online

179
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,308
and that they talk about
being, the... the resistance.

180
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,778
The underground.

181
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,591
It's-it's so... cool.

182
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,718
And it worked. In Maine, they
forced the assassin out and got away.

183
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,289
How did they know?

184
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,193
I guess the mom was herself
when they brought her back.

185
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,729
"Brought her back."

186
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,299
Like, from the dead.

187
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,501
Well, yeah.

188
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,654
You know, I read that, once,

189
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,247
that drowning's just like going to sleep.

190
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,619
You know who wrote that?

191
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,130
Who?

192
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,823
Someone who's never drowned.

193
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,013
James said it won't do anything.

194
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,215
Fuck James. He doesn't know.

195
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,783
The kid, Travis. He said mcnab told him

196
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,677
Travis is dead. And
you're gonna trust mcnab?

197
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,092
We need to go back, Ruben.

198
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,450
Now.

199
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,794
When you moved that
fence line, did I do anything?

200
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,972
- What?
- I could've.

201
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,766
Said something. Got
lawyers involved. But I didn't.

202
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,978
I own plenty without it and I
didn't want to start something.

203
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,948
I don't know what the fuck
this has to do with anything.

204
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,616
It has to do with you and me.

205
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,942
We've known each other a long time.

206
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,520
Been neighbors a long time.

207
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,155
Left each other alone for a long time.

208
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,681
So the fuck what?

209
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,259
So, I don't like the way you do things.

210
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,995
And I bet you got plenty
of problems with me.

211
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,865
We let each other do what
we're gonna do and leave it at that.

212
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,536
What the fuck are you talking about?

213
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,616
I need you to let me
do what I'm gonna do

214
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,218
and leave it at that. That's
what I'm talking about.

215
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,332
God dammit.

216
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,742
So after Olsen, Maggie
was alone with you here.

217
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,278
James was alone when
he went to check on you.

218
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:56,258
We were all alone at some point
while we were searching for you,

219
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,394
so it could be... me.

220
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:03,490
Or, Ruben, or Donald,
who found you in here.

221
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,738
Ruben was at the fire.

222
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,084
But I didn't see him while I was there.

223
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:25,378
We've all been trying to stay as
far away from each other as we can.

224
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,885
Still... Do you need me here?

225
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,390
No, there'll be plenty to cook later on.

226
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,791
Hey.

227
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,928
You all right?

228
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,867
I don't even know anymore.

229
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,870
It's amazing.

230
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,739
I said, don't stare at it.

231
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,978
Yeah, I heard you, it's just... don't.

232
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,552
- James said...
- I know what he said.

233
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,822
But you saw. That woman.

234
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,134
Edward. Brian.

235
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,827
Yeah. Carmen in the woods.

236
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:22,896
Claire.

237
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,098
We got to try.

238
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,571
Fuck it. Light it up.

239
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,829
I guess the visitors,
harbinger and assassin,

240
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,165
they move from person to
person through their mouths.

241
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,594
It has to be really close.

242
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:31,207
How close?

243
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,299
Well, it's not like covid.

244
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,969
It's, I don't know, like...

245
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,104
Like what?

246
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,977
Like.

247
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,580
- I don't know.
- Like kissing?

248
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,620
Well... Maybe.

249
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,656
Just not across the room, or...

250
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,201
Across the table.

251
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,171
Like... right next to you.

252
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:03,730
Right in front of you.

253
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:07,600
But, like, how close, do you think?

254
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,071
Like...

255
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,709
Like a foot?

256
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,913
I don't know.

257
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,750
Less?

258
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,629
This close?

259
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,542
Closer.

260
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,643
Like this?

261
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:54,848
I think it's got to be really, really close.

262
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,776
- I should...
- Yeah.

263
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,521
I should probably check on him.

264
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:27,289
Yeah.

265
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,958
Yeah, you should.

266
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,185
And I'll, I'll stay here.

267
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,630
And I'll keep watch.

268
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,890
- Okay.
- And I'll catch my breath.

269
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,694
That was...

270
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,196
That was a lot.

271
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:46,099
No, it wasn't.

272
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,236
This is.

273
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,727
Okay.

274
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,787
It's got something to do
with where the machine is.

275
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:44,157
The machine harbinger's
supposed to turn on.

276
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,796
What is it?

277
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,767
I don't know.

278
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,336
Looks like

279
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,008
like lightning?

280
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,587
Or, like

281
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,918
like a map.

282
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,203
Look, if the two of us were to do it...

283
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,239
And everyone stays as
far away as possible

284
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,985
I mean, the clinic, the barn, the woods.

285
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,845
I mean, maybe. Maybe.

286
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:43,249
Right, but what happens after?

287
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,729
I mean, you can't revive
someone without mouth-to-mouth,

288
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,998
and you can't do mouth-to-mouth if...

289
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,466
If you're wearing a mask.

290
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,803
Right, and if we somehow
force assassin out of someone

291
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:57,530
like, out into the open air?

292
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,910
Yeah, and then you took off
your mask to resuscitate them...

293
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,447
Right. What's stopping
assassin from just...

294
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,072
Moving into me?

295
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,909
I don't know.

296
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,391
I mean, all of this is pretty
pointless, considering

297
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:18,118
one of us could just be
talking to assassin right now.

298
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,086
I'm not assassin.

299
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,055
You're not?

300
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:25,392
It's me. I can't prove it, but it's true.

301
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,037
That's a relief.

302
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,630
- Maggie...
- I wish I could believe you.

303
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:35,268
You know, at some point, we're
gonna have to start trusting each other.

304
00:30:37,637 --> 00:30:41,884
Yeah, I didn't trust you before we
found out that one of us could be a killer,

305
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,878
so I'm not sure how I'm
supposed to trust you now.

306
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,598
My god.

307
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,195
This is nuts, not knowing
who's good or bad.

308
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:10,103
What?

309
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,281
That first time that you

310
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,607
came to my parents'
house for Thanksgiving.

311
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,178
God.

312
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:25,361
Your mother started it, she
did. What'd she say to your dad?

313
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,531
"Tom, I think you and James
actually look a lot alike."

314
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,902
Your dad, he didn't miss a fuckin' beat.

315
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:34,804
"Yeah, salt and sugar look a lot alike too,

316
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:37,940
but one makes everything taste
better and the other one rots your teeth."

317
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,033
It's still there.

318
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,292
You can't destroy it!

319
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,970
But... there's something we can do.

320
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,112
Hey, mom, what is it? What's wrong?

321
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,014
What's wrong?

322
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,517
You have to come with me right now.

323
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:56,976
No, I can't. I have to stay here.

324
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,788
No, you don't. Not anymore.

325
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,281
- Why not?
- Because.

326
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:04,517
I know who assassin is.

327
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,463
Wait a second.

328
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:28,308
It fits!

329
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,480
That's us.

330
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:41,664
Belknap mountain.

331
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:43,223
This has to be it.

332
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,593
We've got to show Nicholas.

333
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:52,332
Nicholas?

334
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,819
I didn't want anyone else to hear.

335
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,421
Or... see.

336
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,255
See what?

337
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,990
- I...
- mom, careful!

338
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:09,692
It's fine, it's fine.

339
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,251
Okay.

340
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:14,220
No. What are those?

341
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,533
They're for sedating Arlo.

342
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,326
For capturing harbinger. I
found them in Ellen's room.

343
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,472
Yeah, so she was
lying. She's still assassin.

344
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:26,442
No, no. No, no, she's not assassin.

345
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,201
So who is?

346
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:30,980
You are.

347
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,593
Nicholas?

348
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:47,587
What are we... What
are we doing out here?
