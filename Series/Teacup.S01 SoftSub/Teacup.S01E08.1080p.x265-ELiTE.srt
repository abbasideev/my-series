1
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,911
We don't know anything,
except that it's here

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,646
and it's probably in one of us.

3
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,292
Everyone, listen. If we find out who it is,

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,160
there's a way to get
the assassin out of them.

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,820
- How?
- We drown them.

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,289
It says there's this family in Maine.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,535
The mom, she had an assassin in her,

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,904
so they tied her up and
drowned her in a lake.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,106
How did they know?

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,465
The mom was herself
when they brought her back.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,078
It says there's these groups online,

12
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,948
and they talk about being the resistance,

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,583
the underground.

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,309
- I've seen that car before.
- That's fucking Hayden.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,888
Hayden was a member of
our little band of brothers.

16
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,158
Until he preemptively shit the
fucking bed. Told you he's a psycho.

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,127
A visitor is made of nothing.

18
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,063
It's like vapor, or air.

19
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,955
Shooting can't kill it.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,367
You can kill the host.

21
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,170
But the visitor, it'll just
hop into somebody else.

22
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,130
I said, don't stare at it.

23
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,334
Light it up.

24
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,240
You can't destroy it!

25
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,543
But there's something we can do.

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,388
Hey, mom. What is it?

27
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,924
What's wro... what's wrong?

28
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,184
I know who assassin is.

29
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,163
- I found them in Ellen's room.
- She's still assassin?

30
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,931
No, no. She's not assassin.

31
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,223
So who is?

32
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,868
You are.

33
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,908
Hey.

34
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,679
Yeah. I've got it.

35
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:11,284
No. Just tell me where mcnab is.

36
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,817
It's still gonna hurt like hell,

37
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,118
but these will help.

38
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,453
All we need is one piece

39
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,946
and that should be
enough for everybody.

40
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,417
There's not enough in there for
anyone to make it over the line alive.

41
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,297
Is there enough for me to

42
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,899
- I think so.
- You think so?

43
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,167
Yeah.

44
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,639
Here we go.

45
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,491
This gonna work?

46
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,659
It has to.

47
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,940
Fucking hell.

48
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,185
Ruben!

49
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,995
Get up! Come on!

50
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,978
Like Nicholas said...

51
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,981
Easy-peasy.

52
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,882
Yeah.

53
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,672
Assassin can't be
killed, so how do we win?

54
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,532
I just... I don't know.

55
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,079
How many people have died now?

56
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,238
Claire.

57
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,006
Carmen.

58
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,186
Edward.

59
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,545
Brian.

60
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,549
There was a woman
beside navarros' barn.

61
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,260
Olsen.

62
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,653
The kid in the basement.

63
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,855
Travis.

64
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,927
He had been shot I don't
know how many times.

65
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,666
He was gonna die. I
think he knew it, too.

66
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,675
He told me all he ever
wanted was some control.

67
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,855
Of his life. Of something, anything.

68
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,879
But...

69
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,821
There was no stopping
what was happening. Was...

70
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,057
Nowhere to go to get help, and...

71
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,029
There was nothing to
do, and if there was.

72
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,570
I'm really sorry.

73
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,574
No, I'm sorry.

74
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,955
Until he turned the gun on himself,

75
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,081
I thought I was gonna
die down there too.

76
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,918
And all I kept thinking... Praying...

77
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,624
Was I hope Maggie
knows how sorry I am.

78
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,771
There was nothing I
could do to save him.

79
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,041
It must have been awful.

80
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,880
It wasn't unfamiliar.

81
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,916
What wasn't?

82
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,955
I-I don't think I've ever
really felt like I've had control.

83
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,069
What do you mean?

84
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,327
Of my life.

85
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,862
My job.

86
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,841
Us. Our life.

87
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,610
The kids. All of it.

88
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,703
It's always felt like it all...

89
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,906
It all just happened somehow.

90
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,778
And then I look at you.

91
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,792
You with work.

92
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,651
You with our kids.

93
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,229
You with everything.

94
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,922
You've always had control.

95
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,758
You've always been in control.

96
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,894
Just.

97
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,865
I think I wanted some of that.

98
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,844
Valeria and I got close at work.

99
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,124
As friends, at first.

100
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,249
And...

101
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,386
Part of it was because
she understood that feeling.

102
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,857
The things in life turning
out the way they did.

103
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,435
Without any say.

104
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,732
I don't know. I liked
being understood that way.

105
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,135
Does that make sense?

106
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,107
Nothing makes sense right now.

107
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,011
I know.

108
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,694
That's not true.

109
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,952
Arlo.

110
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,723
Meryl.

111
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,426
They make sense.

112
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,028
What about us?

113
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,035
I know we don't right now.

114
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,172
Could we make sense again?

115
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,248
I don't know.

116
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,253
Maybe.

117
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,725
Maybe is all I can give you right now.

118
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,830
I'll take maybe.

119
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,784
- We know where to go.
- We can't get out.

120
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,968
Assassin could be in anybody.

121
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,279
Even if we knew who it was,
assassin could move to somebody else.

122
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,657
So we're fucked?

123
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,392
Arlo chenoweth.

124
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,527
What? It's true, isn't it?

125
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,416
There is something we can do.

126
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,508
What?

127
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,246
Assassin.

128
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,525
I don't get it.

129
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,957
Lock the door.

130
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,950
Don't let anybody in except me.

131
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,494
Okay?

132
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,020
Okay.

133
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,942
Are you okay?

134
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,235
It's my mom. Assassin's my mom.

135
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,380
She tried to grab me. I-I got away, but,

136
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,782
I think she was gonna try
to drug Arlo or something.

137
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,517
What... what do you mean?

138
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,912
She had... she had these.

139
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,699
Hey. Okay, we need
to go warn everybody.

140
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,959
- Wait.
- What?

141
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,929
- Let me just say something.
- What?

142
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,408
Whatever happens, I'm so
glad we found each other.

143
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,510
- Seriously, I need you to know...
- I left Arlo alone.

144
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,171
Are you really gonna make me tell
you another one of my dumb jokes?

145
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,760
Nicholas, stop...

146
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,575
Meryl, what... what happened?

147
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,967
No! No.

148
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,226
Arlo, what are you
doing out of your room?

149
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,862
It's meryl. She's doing bad things.

150
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,224
Let's go.

151
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,757
All of this...

152
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,094
The blood...

153
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,364
The tears...

154
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,767
The struggling...

155
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,081
Meryl.

156
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,248
Meryl, come on. I know you're

157
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,151
- if only you knew what's coming.
- No.

158
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,643
Listen to me, meryl. I promise

159
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:54,280
you'd realize just how utterly

160
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,050
insignificant you all are.

161
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,931
Just give me what I want.

162
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,156
No.

163
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,769
No, I can't let you anywhere near Arlo.

164
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,595
Then I'm gonna have to kill you.

165
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,631
Yes, you are.

166
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,709
Maybe not.

167
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,323
Maybe.

168
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,328
I'll just kill her.

169
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,963
No.

170
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,197
No, you won't.

171
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,856
Of course I will.

172
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,535
That's what I thought.

173
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,526
Get your mask on! Your mask!

174
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,252
Get your mask on!

175
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,602
- Grab her legs!
- Jesus!

176
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,877
Go! Let's go!

177
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,033
Drink it, step over the line, and get help.

178
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,292
- I'll go first.
- And then run like hell.

179
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,472
- I didn't have to help you.
- Didn't have to shoot me either.

180
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,730
Nicholas!

181
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,735
What happened?

182
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,573
I-I-I was with mom. She said she
knew who assassin was and then...

183
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,052
- I-I don't remember.
- Let's get you inside.

184
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,644
Guys?

185
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,577
I can't do this!

186
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,046
- You have to, Maggie!
- I can't do it!

187
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,305
Come on, let's go. You have to! Go!

188
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,712
Maggie, wh...

189
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,365
Get her!

190
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,932
Get her!

191
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,658
Come on...

192
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,363
Come on, meryl...

193
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,645
No.

194
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,418
Meryl...

195
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,421
Meryl...

196
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,764
Please... Come on, meryl...

197
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,146
Meryl! Please...

198
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,354
Come on...

199
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,091
Meryl, please...

200
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,999
Meryl!

201
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,849
My god...

202
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,120
Mom...

203
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,056
Meryl!

204
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:55,217
James and Maggie
are in there with meryl.

205
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,886
- She's...
- and Valeria?

206
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,680
I... I

207
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
I don't know.

208
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,191
Now we're not trapped.

209
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,059
No, we're not.

210
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,901
We need to go.

211
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,413
- Where's mom?
- I'll find mom.

212
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,548
I'll go get Maggie and James...

213
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,683
- And meryl too?
- I'll get everybody.

214
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,685
Stay out of sight. Get to the road.

215
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:30,953
I'll meet you there. And then

216
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,089
we all get the hell out of here.

217
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,449
In the Van that Olsen
bastard drove up in.

218
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,160
Easy-peasy.

219
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,452
Come on.

220
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,323
Hey... we should all go together.

221
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,435
I gotta go get mom and the chenoweths.

222
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,794
- But dad...
- Hey.

223
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,721
Dad?

224
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,222
You...

225
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,760
You need to run.

226
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,281
Meryl. Meryl, pick up
the syringe and the knife.

227
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,749
Meryl, do it.

228
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,425
Run!

229
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:55,504
Nicholas, don't look.

230
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,206
- Mom!
- Don't look, Nicholas!

231
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,844
Don't look! It's okay.

232
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:07,273
No... no... Don't... don't.

233
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,885
- She's...
- Honey, don't look.

234
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,545
Okay? Look at me. Look at me...

235
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,814
Mom?

236
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,283
I know, honey. I know.

237
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,576
- Mom...
- Yes, she's gone.

238
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,311
She's gone. I know, she's gone.

239
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:36,335
Just look at me.

240
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,010
Dad!

241
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,950
James!

242
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,927
James!

243
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,963
James!

244
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Shit.

245
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,151
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast...

246
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:24,520
- Mom, that's dad...
- I know it is.

247
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,492
Mom.

248
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:31,151
Fuck...

249
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:36,999
Damn it.

250
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,734
Give me the Ketamine.

251
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,360
- What?
- The syringe and the knife.

252
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,362
Stay inside!

253
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,535
None of this will make any difference.

254
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,029
You're wrong. It will.

255
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,296
No.

256
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,134
No, it really won't.

257
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,369
We both know what's
gonna happen now.

258
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,007
Arlo, quick! Quick.

259
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,626
Come on, quickly, quickly.

260
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,585
- No, mom! Mom.
- Arlo...

261
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,497
- Remember the wasp?
- What?

262
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,432
The wasp and the teacup.

263
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,158
Remember the teacup?

264
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:47,586
Arlo, get back.

265
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,321
Go.

266
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,961
Why don't you just give up?

267
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:00,133
Because that's not what we do.

268
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,508
You can't win.

269
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,176
We don't have to win.

270
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,369
We just have to trap you.

271
00:30:55,855 --> 00:31:00,427
Help me... Help...

272
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,095
Dad...

273
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,265
- Mom?
- Please...

274
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,411
It's dad!

275
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,980
I know, I know, I know

276
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,082
I know, I know, honey. I'm sorry.

277
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:17,486
- We can't!
- I know! We have to... Mom... no!

278
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,189
I know... Mom, he'll suffocate!

279
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:25,485
I know, I know... I know... No...

280
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,090
He'll die, mom.

281
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,426
He'll die.

282
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:35,595
He's gonna die.

283
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,302
Arlo...

285
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,305
Meryl.

286
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,715
I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Meryl, I'm sorry.

287
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:21,608
I'm so sorry...

288
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,234
It's over.

289
00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:00,042
- You sure?
- Yeah.

290
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,144
Someone's got to stay with the animals,

291
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,470
just in case.

292
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:10,119
You're coming right back, right?

293
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:11,754
Absolutely we'll be back.

294
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,146
Okay, then.

295
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,654
I'm sorry.

296
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:22,755
No...

297
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,490
No...

298
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,503
Take that.

299
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,338
It's, still nothing.

300
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,183
Where do we go?

301
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,509
The police? Hospital?

302
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:19,522
We'll go to the fire station in new hope.

303
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:20,546
For now.

304
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,344
Meryl.

305
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:26,622
- What?
- Harbinger says

306
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,491
we need to go to belknap mountain.

307
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:31,127
We need to make sure
everybody's okay first. Okay?

308
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,062
Harbinger has to turn on the machine.

309
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,197
- I know.
- Whoa.

310
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:36,623
What is that?

311
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,388
Who here is mcnab?

312
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,039
I-I'm Carol.

313
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:18,932
And this is Milo.

314
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,702
You found me.

315
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:26,439
We found you.

316
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,484
It's okay.

317
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:30,019
They know what's going
on. They're here to help.

318
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:32,488
I got worried when you
stopped posting on the chat room

319
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,614
and then stopped answering texts.

320
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:36,492
You know, I figured

321
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:38,394
you wouldn't be far
from your last location.

322
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:40,096
You... you figured right.

323
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,132
We have people hurt. We're
trying to get to the fire station.

324
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,858
For sure.

325
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:46,760
We'll follow you.

326
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:51,798
Just let me get this
one thing out of my bag.

327
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:57,937
God, that's Hayden.

328
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,415
What are you doing?!

329
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,574
Get out of the way!

330
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm gonna need you to just listen.

331
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Okay?

332
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,831
Listen and look.

333
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:13,980
Zip ties to hold you.

334
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:19,586
Ketamine to drug you.

335
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,857
These people, they
were not your friends.

336
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,459
This is real.

337
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,030
The bastards are waking up.

338
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:32,065
And I'm telling you...

339
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,901
They are everywhere.

340
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:39,172
Now, you can go it alone.

341
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,076
In which case, I can pretty much
guarantee that you're fucked.

342
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,046
Or you can follow us.

343
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,883
And maybe, just
maybe, you might survive.

344
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:54,621
The choice is all yours.

345
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:58,725
So...

346
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:01,961
What's it gonna be?

347
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:23,016
We're not going anywhere until
you tell us what the fuck is going on.
