1
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,414
The man in my head...

2
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,792
He says we're trapped.

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,392
God dammit!

4
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,837
What the fuck is happening?

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,472
It's coming.

6
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,066
And it kills everything that gets in its way.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,478
- Let me... go!
- No!

8
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,175
Claire...

9
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,693
Hey.

10
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:42,322
I need you to look after
Arlo when he wakes up.

11
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,457
Okay.

12
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,695
- Nicholas still in there?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,399
He used to be such a goofball.

14
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,401
He still is, but

15
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,673
now he's also kind of...

16
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,884
Yeah. Yeah, I guess he kind of is.

17
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,789
Cuddle with me for a minute.

18
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,957
Mrs. Kelly.

19
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,516
Claire.

20
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,820
She died?

21
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,324
She did.

22
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,834
What happened, mom?

23
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,871
I would tell you if I knew.

24
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,846
I would love to keep hanging out
with you and Arlo here all day, but

25
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,351
there are things that I need to do.

26
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,796
Yeah, I know.

27
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,789
I really need you to...

28
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,459
Be an adult for a little while.

29
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,661
Can you do that?

30
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,832
Yeah.

31
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,969
Yeah, I can do that.

32
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,870
Should have gone to
the navarros' last night.

33
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,173
No, no. Not in the dark.
Not with whoever's out there.

34
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,466
And certainly not with
whatever this line is.

35
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,047
"Don't trust anyone." Sure it
goes all the way around us?

36
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,907
Any other day, I'd say
he was a whack job, but...

37
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
Not today?

38
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,920
Not today.

39
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,524
I'll just cut through the
woods by the back pasture.

40
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,859
It's pretty much a
straight shot to Carmen's.

41
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,962
Well, whatever you do, you should
probably take Ruben with you.

42
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,066
Yeah, but that'd be leaving
you guys without somebody too.

43
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,868
Between Ellen and Valeria and I,

44
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,705
I think we're fine. So please, take Ruben.

45
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,007
Maggie, I don't know.

46
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,177
We have absolutely no idea
who or what is out there, so...

47
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,479
Well, that's... that's what I'm saying.

48
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,971
That's not what you're saying.

49
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,517
Okay, so what am I saying?

50
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,404
You're saying you
don't wanna go with the

51
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,545
husband of the woman
that you've been fucking.

52
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,755
How'd you find out?

53
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,790
Does it matter?

54
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,528
No, it doesn't matter
because I told you it's over.

55
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,007
Does Ruben know?

56
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,982
- Maggie, we can still try...
- try to what?

57
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,551
I don't know. Get through
whatever the hell this is,

58
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,177
and then, I don't know...

59
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,224
Okay. Can we try not
to feel betrayed too?

60
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,016
Or humiliated?

61
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,530
Or sick about the fact
that Valeria is sleeping

62
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,232
in our fucking living room?

63
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,491
Could we try that?

64
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,927
Just go.

65
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,571
Maggie, I'm sorry.

66
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,573
Who cares if you're sorry?

67
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,175
I mean, who cares about any of that?

68
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,643
Obviously you do.

69
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,612
No, I don't, because I can't.

70
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,905
Because I have to be better than that.

71
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,318
And that's what I'm gonna be.

72
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,844
For meryl and for Arlo and for me.

73
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,786
I need to go check on
Donald. Change his bandages.

74
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,657
Maggie, I'm sorry. I really am.

75
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,097
And I do love you.

76
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,135
Wouldn't hurt so much
if you didn't, James.

77
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,331
Ma?

78
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,933
Yeah?

79
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,601
Can I come in?

80
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,860
Hey.

81
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,138
Hi.

82
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,707
I'm gonna walk down the driveway.

83
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,209
Maybe somebody will come by?

84
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,846
Yeah, well, it's Sunday.
Mail isn't coming, but...

85
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,617
And I was thinking we might wanna cook
some of the stuff that's in the fridge.

86
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,387
No electricity, frozen
stuff's not gonna last.

87
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,957
I mean, sure. Can't hurt. Freezer
in the barn has stuff in it too,

88
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,216
if... you know, if you want.

89
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,187
What was that?

90
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,890
You heard?

91
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,324
Just the tone.

92
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,403
It doesn't matter right now.

93
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,630
Well, when it does matter, do you think

94
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,932
yeah.

95
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,645
Yeah.

96
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,718
There you go. You okay?

97
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,119
Well, I'm not... not okay.

98
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,655
I don't know. There's
some cramps, and...

99
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,923
These tremors.

100
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,182
Right.

101
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,186
Nothing I can't handle.

102
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,835
I woke up this morning thinking
maybe it's all just a bad dream.

103
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,327
Yeah, afraid it still is.

104
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,872
I'll be back with help.

105
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,809
Everything is gonna be okay in the end.

106
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,814
And if it's not okay... it's not the end.

107
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,182
What is that, John Lennon?

108
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,050
- Or Noel coward.
- Sure.

109
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,152
I don't know. Either way, desperate times

110
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,824
call for reassuring quotes from mom.

111
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,184
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

112
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,956
Love you.

113
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,766
Hey.

114
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,302
You get any sleep?

115
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,039
I'll sleep when this is over.

116
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,109
Okay, well...

117
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,114
Are you all right?

118
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,018
No idea how to answer that.

119
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:58,234
Okay, well, I was supposed to drop
Nicholas off at the ever sons' today,

120
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,403
so maybe when we don't
show up or answer our phones...

121
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:04,164
Even if somebody came by our
place to check on us, it won't matter.

122
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,266
Why not?

123
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,268
Because nobody knows we're here.

124
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,907
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, to do something.

125
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,043
Well, don't do anything stupid.

126
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,954
Or brave.

127
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,714
Keep it cowardly.

128
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,716
Got it.

129
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,435
Scout looks good.

130
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,172
Yeah. Yeah, he does.

131
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,486
But you're gonna tell
me he needs to stay put.

132
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,812
I am.

133
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,782
You got two other horses in that barn.

134
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,486
You, wanna go with James?

135
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,458
The only thing dumber than
him going alone is us letting him.

136
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,039
Know how to use one of these?

137
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,009
They make me a little nervous, but yeah.

138
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,144
The thing to remember is take your time.

139
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,579
Even if there is no time.

140
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,180
Slow is smooth.

141
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,140
Smooth is fast.

142
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,058
Slow is smooth.

143
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,860
Smooth is fast.

144
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,128
Got it.

145
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,486
Hey, Ruben?

146
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,822
Yeah?

147
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,828
Thanks.

148
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,499
We'll get through this.

149
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,501
Both of us.

150
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,398
Hey, Donald?

151
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,872
I just came down to
get my jacket and just...

152
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,541
All right, why don't you come with me.

153
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,410
Come on.

154
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,612
Here.

155
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,316
Come on.

156
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,526
Okay.

157
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,009
Come on goats, enough.

158
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,562
Still okay with me borrowing
one of your horses?

159
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,265
Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I be?

160
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,750
The goats are still spooked.
Definitely less than yesterday.

161
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,075
The guy in the mask...

162
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,380
According to his drawing,
the line makes kind of a circle.

163
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,716
He also said don't trust anyone, so.

164
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,285
Say it is a circle.

165
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,531
I'm hoping Edward and
Carmen's is outside of it,

166
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,258
but close enough for us to talk to them.

167
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,360
Otherwise...

168
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,663
Otherwise what?

169
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,733
The navarros are just
as fucked as we are.

170
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,397
Okay.

171
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,623
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

172
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,634
What is it?

173
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:02,271
It's, something that's
really not made for people,

174
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,398
but it will help you with the pain.

175
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:12,138
I don't think I've ever
been this fucking tired.

176
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,141
Okay. Why don't you lie down? Here.

177
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,063
Who's this for?

178
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,533
Sometimes there's a horse
that I need to look after overnight.

179
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,302
Your boy?

180
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,795
He's, sleeping.

181
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,531
I'd love to have a son.

182
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,801
A real family, you know?

183
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,281
We wanted kids, Claire and me.

184
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,440
We thought we were gonna.

185
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,144
Not now. I'm.

186
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,780
I'm talking ten years back.

187
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,217
Claire.

188
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,188
She was... she was so excited.

189
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,262
You know? But then...

190
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,201
It didn't happen.

191
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,749
I'm so sorry, Donald.

192
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,475
She said we were gonna try again, but...

193
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,190
- God.
- No, you... you need to rest.

194
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,227
- The body...
- We will take care of Claire, I promise.

195
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,689
No, no, no, not Claire.
There's a body in the woods.

196
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,807
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

197
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,743
Jesus.

198
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,313
Man, how'd he know where to paint it?

199
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,384
Well, maybe he's the one
behind whatever the hell this is.

200
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,722
Yeah, I don't know. He was
acting like he did it to help us.

201
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,701
Sometimes people act like one thing,

202
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:13,693
even though they're something else.

203
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,599
Nobody'd know.

204
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,768
Nobody'd know what?

205
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,381
What happened if one of
us ended up over the line

206
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,774
out here in the middle of nowhere.

207
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,179
Just saying.

208
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,148
Be careful.

209
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,559
That don't look good.

210
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,563
Yeah.

211
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,800
Could be they're after
something that crossed the line.

212
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:58,238
Died that way. A coyote
or deer, maybe. You know?

213
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,817
Or maybe some new nightmare.

214
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,877
Either way...

215
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,947
Yeah, either way.

216
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,583
Let's go.

217
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,304
I think he's, like, learning words.

218
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,197
- What?
- Watch.

219
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:25,965
Hey.

220
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,401
Who are you?

221
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,449
Warning-alert.

222
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,942
Prem... prem... premonition.

223
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,348
Harbinger.

224
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,885
So, "harbinger." That's... that's you?

225
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,422
So, where's Arlo?

226
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,793
Arlo... sleep-rest.

227
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,342
Sleep-safe.

228
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,344
Quiet-unscathed.

229
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,270
Got it. So that's a relief.

230
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,840
Is it?

231
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,975
Arlo?

232
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,557
Last night, my mom told my dad

233
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,759
Arlo said there's a voice in his head

234
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,385
telling him things.

235
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,730
That's super scary.

236
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,789
But it's not the scariest part.

237
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,569
He said the voice,

238
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,661
it told him there's something coming.

239
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,932
Something that's gonna kill us. All of us.

240
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,746
What is it you said we
need to do, harbinger?

241
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,338
- Hide or die?
- Trapped.

242
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,473
Hide-or-die.

243
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,390
- Assassin?
- Assassin-kill-murder.

244
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,792
- Assassin-kill. Assassin-kill-murder.
- Arlo...

245
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,894
- Assassin-kill. Kill!
- Arlo.

246
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,497
- Stop. Let go!
- Kill!

247
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,823
- Arlo, stop, you're hurting me.
- Trapped. Hide-or-die!

248
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:00,293
- You all right?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:01,928
Yeah, I'm okay.

250
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,800
Trap?

251
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:11,037
- Arlo?
- Not-no.

252
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,116
Not... trapped.

253
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,975
Not-trapped.

254
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,486
Not-trapped.

255
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,955
Arlo, where are you going?

256
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,866
We should go with him.

257
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,636
- I told my mom I'd watch him.
- We can watch him and go.

258
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,395
- No, we're supposed to stay.
- Hey, meryl?

259
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,468
You have to listen to harbinger.

260
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,472
Arlo...

261
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,785
Are you all right?

262
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,579
I am. It's weird. Really weird.

263
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,447
But it's not bad.

264
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,059
He's not bad. He's good.

265
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,729
And he's scared, so
he's hiding in my head.

266
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,797
There is no "he," Arlo, okay? It's just you.

267
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,923
Harbinger is real, meryl. He is.

268
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,670
And he's telling the truth.
We need to go right now.

269
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,563
- Go where?
- He says...

270
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,544
He says it's not far.

271
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,714
Arlo, this is crazy,
okay? It's crazy, isn't it?

272
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:21,751
Any crazier than that blue line
and what happened to Mrs. Kelly?

273
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:25,187
It is crazy, but assassin is coming, meryl.

274
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,023
And assassin won't stop.

275
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,091
You're always saying to trust you.

276
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,893
You're my sister, and you know things.

277
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,596
- That's different.
- It's not different.

278
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,864
I need you to listen.

279
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:38,668
I'm your brother, and right now,
I'm the one who knows things.

280
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,569
So I need you to trust me.

281
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,928
Please.

282
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:46,866
Maybe we should find your
mom, or my dad, or somebody.

283
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,903
No.

284
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,107
Arlo says there's no
time, so there's no time.

285
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:12,168
James told me about
your... yeah. My ms?

286
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,537
- Do they happen often?
- The tremors?

287
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,105
Only if always is often.

288
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,099
- Wow.
- It does take some Patience.

289
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,479
My husband, William,

290
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,781
he used to say, "Patience is a virtue."

291
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,216
It used to make me nuts.

292
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,752
- Why?
- Because virtue is a virtue.

293
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:34,481
Patience is just tolerating
bullshit and not being annoyed.

294
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,850
Yeah, I like that.

295
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:39,729
That man was a pain in my ass,

296
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,889
but I sure did love my life with him.

297
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,701
It kept me sane, you know?

298
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,127
Kept me grounded.

299
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,166
A good marriage will
do that, don't you think?

300
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,752
James told you.

301
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,678
Well, nobody had to tell me.

302
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,489
When Ruben and I first
got married, moved here.

303
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,324
I thought...

304
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:26,066
Farming seemed like such a
storybook kind of life, you know?

305
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,102
But it's just not.

306
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:34,507
It's non-stop, and it is all of this...

307
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:38,278
Just all this nothing.

308
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,158
My god. Look.

309
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,985
My god. The line.

310
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,011
Wait! Don't cross the line.

311
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,222
- Stop! Stop!
- Wait, stop! Stop!

312
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,324
Stop! You have to stop!

313
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,059
Wait! Wait! Wait!

314
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,961
Wait!

315
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:26,702
Coming over to this
side's a piece of cake.

316
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,228
Heading back the other way...

317
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,663
Well, that's the problem.

318
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,168
But I guess you know that already.

319
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,116
We don't know anything.

320
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,310
All-all we know is... We're terrified.

321
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,257
I hate to say it, but...

322
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,051
Terrified's a pretty good place to start.

323
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,006
It's not far, is it, Arlo?

324
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,166
I don't think he's Arlo.

325
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:09,636
Harbinger?

326
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,340
It's close.

327
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,393
- What's that?
- What's what?

328
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,785
That.

329
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:30,857
You know, with all the animals
acting so weird, I thought...

330
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,294
You know, to protect us.

331
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,198
What, it's not... it's not cool?

332
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,910
No, it's cool.

333
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,268
It's really cool.

334
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:50,086
Arlo? Harbinger!

335
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,345
Arlo?

336
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:11,164
I guess this is where
all the animals went.

337
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,134
What is this?

338
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,102
Mine.

339
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,047
It's mine.

340
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,305
What does that mean?

341
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:29,916
This is mine.

342
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,888
Did you come from...?

343
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,303
Arlo? Hey, don't.

344
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:10,990
Whoa.

345
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,293
Arlo, what is that?

346
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,143
Toxin... bad... poison.

347
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,469
That's poison?

348
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,371
Poison.

349
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:29,909
So, what are we gonna do with it?

350
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,512
We drink it.

351
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,964
- Hey, Edward!
- Anybody here?

352
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,523
Carmen! Brian!

353
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,036
I'll go this way. You check the barn.

354
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,895
- Meet at the house?
- Yeah.

355
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,590
Go. Go on. Get!

356
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:33,600
Hello?

357
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:38,905
Edward!

358
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,651
Ruben!

359
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,064
Fuck.

360
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,059
Carmen?

361
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,562
