Dad?

11
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,507
I see it.
What is happening?

12
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,210
Why are
the lights doing that?

13
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,578
Somebody call 911!

14
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,450
I'm on it.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,852
I'll call too.
I don't know what's going on,

16
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,254
but there's just--
there's just no signal.

17
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,324
Be faster if we head
to the fire station in New Hope.
They have a paramedic there.

18
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,625
Dad?

19
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,727
I'm getting the car.

20
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,497
I'm not getting
anything either.
Okay. Okay.

21
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,132
Help him.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,735
- Okay. You got him?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,372
M-Maggie, we should hurry.

24
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,707
- Okay, you got him?

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,323
- Come on.

26
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,592
God dammit.

27
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,485
It won't start.
I even tried to pop the clutch.

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,355
No, I-I'm getting you
and your boy to the hospital.

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,694
All right, come on.

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,434
Oh, come on.

31
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,269
Nothing?

32
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,610
What the fuck is happening?

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,484
Okay, we're gonna
take Arlo inside.
Whoever did this is still out--

34
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,020
- Dad. Dad. Dad? What's going on?
- Shh. It's okay.

35
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,257
Don?
- It's okay. I know.

36
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,594
Let's go inside.
I'm gonna get a lantern.
Watch your step here.

37
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,863
Nicholas? Come and help me
find candles, please.

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,997
Yeah, yeah, I'll...

39
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,267
Go.

40
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,036
Just-- Yup. Okay.

41
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,907
Duke, stop! Stop!

42
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,943
- Stop.
- Ruben, where are they?

43
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,511
- In the house.
- Okay.

44
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,481
Um... help me
saddle up the horses.

45
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,483
We can ride to our place
and get Valeria's car.

46
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,586
Everybody else, can we just
go inside, please? Thanks.

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,521
Donald, where you goin'?

48
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,890
Whoever's up there,
they hurt your kid.

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,026
You're gonna get help,
and you absolutely should.

50
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,462
But by the time the cavalry
shows up, that sumbitch
gonna be gone, count on it.

51
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,800
So I'm gonna keep the fucker
busy till you get back.
Sound good?

52
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,370
Absolutely.

53
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,706
Don.

54
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,043
Claire. Claire, come on.

55
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,513
- Come on.
- Don! Don.

56
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,515
Come on. Come on, please.

57
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,063
Okay, eyes seem fine.

58
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,365
Arlo, can you follow my finger?

59
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm not seeing any broken bones.

60
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,443
Breathing is fine.

61
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,846
Pulse is slow.

62
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,481
God, you're so calm.

63
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,950
When things go wrong,
Mom gets calm.

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,786
Whatever happened,
I don't think that this
is your blood.

65
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,688
Oh, thank God.

66
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,391
I'm starting to think
he might have a concussion, though.

67
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,693
I don't have a concussion.

68
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:59,432
- Arlo.
- Hey. Hey, you. You're back.

69
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,801
- What's going on?

70
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,139
Um, you know, we're just
getting you checked out,

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,008
and just getting you
all cleaned up.

72
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,576
Ouch.

73
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,914
"Stop" ouch?
Or "grin and bear it" ouch?

74
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,686
- You faker.
You were faking.

75
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,155
- I'm not a faker.
- Oh, sure you are.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,923
Gotta be the center
of attention.

77
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,627
Okay, now wait.
Aren't you the one
who hid in the oven

78
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,429
just so your parents
could come find you?

79
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,398
What? Shut up.
- I...

80
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,633
Mom, I thought
that story was a secret.

81
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,672
Okay, um, I don't think
that Arlo's faking it.

82
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,475
Doesn't... look like
these are fake, does it?

83
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,579
Looks like someone
might have tried to grab you.
Is that right?

84
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,682
Maybe.

85
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,652
It's gonna be okay, Arlo.

86
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,487
It is?

87
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,056
Absolutely.

88
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,491
I'm your sister. I know things.

89
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,493
So you have to trust me, okay?

90
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:07,934
You know what?
I think, um, maybe
you're just too dirty

91
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,136
for cotton balls and peroxide.

92
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,138
Meryl, would you mind
grabbing me, um,

93
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,740
the towels
from the linen closet?

94
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,609
- On it.
- And Nicholas,
grab me a couple cold packs

95
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,078
from the downstairs bathroom, please?

96
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,146
And Valeria?
Could you just make sure

97
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,817
that the windows
and doors are closed
and locked downstairs?

98
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,919
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,953
Of course.

100
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,069
Okay, um...

101
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,006
it's just you and me right now.

102
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,510
I need you to tell me
what happened
and who did this to you.

103
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,946
I don't know who did that.

104
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,551
Okay.

105
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,620
That's okay.
You don't have to know.

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,892
- You don't have to know
right now.

107
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,703
I do know one thing.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,775
Okay, what's that?

109
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,944
We need to go.

110
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,147
Go where?

111
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,049
Away from here. Right now.
As fast as--

112
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,718
No, we're not going anywhere.
We're gonna get you cleaned up.

113
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,253
- Okay? Then we can talk--
- Wasp-brave, murder-maker.

114
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,754
Wasp-brave, murder-maker.

115
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,122
- Wasp-brave, murder-maker.
- Arlo, you're okay.

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,590
Murder-maker. Murder-maker!

117
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,825
I'm right here. Arlo!

118
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,263
- Arlo!

119
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,634
- No!
- Stop it!

120
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,271
- All right, it's okay.
- It's okay...

121
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,672
Arlo?

122
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,874
Hide-die, gun-shot,
teacup-brave.

123
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,778
- Mom? What's wrong with him?

124
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,783
Wow. Um... I'm bleeding.

125
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,152
- Oh, shit.

126
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,854
Meryl, would you?

127
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,555
Yeah, okay.

128
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,158
Hey, hey, hey. Arlo.

129
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,994
- Shh...

130
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,932
I got it. You go. It's okay. Go.

131
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,701
Okay, come with me.

132
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,539
Hey. Hey. Hey.

133
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,974
Feels like waiting
for the other shoe to drop,
but...

134
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,744
at this point, I mean,
how many more shoes
are there left to drop?

135
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,381
Should we help
with the kid? Or...

136
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,350
Maggie's got it handled.

137
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,821
All right, yeah.
I have to do... something.

138
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,256
Well-- Well, you--

139
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,359
- You don't have to do that.
- No, it's fine. I want to.

140
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,927
I wanna do something too.

141
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,963
Maybe I should just walk home
and call 911 from there.

142
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,865
Nobody's gonna mess with me
if I have Duke.

143
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,034
We should all just stay put.

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,176
I've just never seen
anything like that.

145
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,211
What was he saying?

146
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,213
I think he's in shock.

147
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,782
Could he have done that
to himself?

148
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,251
Arlo didn't do that to himself.

149
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,155
I-I'm just saying maybe.
Or maybe not. I didn't--

150
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,925
- I didn't mean to--
- We know. It's fine.

151
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,772
You know,
back in the Stone Age,

152
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,674
when I was a little girl,

153
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,310
one day, all of a sudden,

154
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,780
my head, my neck, my glands

155
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,415
just swelled up.

156
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,751
Just all of a sudden.

157
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,453
I-I looked like a balloon.

158
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,959
My mother took one look at me,
and she burst into tears.

159
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,329
They rushed me to the hospital,

160
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,198
they did all kinds of tests,
and...

161
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,801
What was it?

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,904
Cat scratch fever.

163
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,412
I-I know. I know.
You can laugh, but--

164
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,746
That's not a real thing.

165
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,114
Except it is.

166
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,151
One of our outdoor cats
had scratched me the day before.

167
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,219
And I had bad headaches.

168
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,821
I had a high fever.

169
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,256
Lasted about a month.

170
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,026
And then, I was good as new.

171
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,495
Wow, cat scratch fever.

172
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,933
All I'm saying is,
stuff happens, right?

173
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:13,006
I mean, weird things happen
to kids, and...

174
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,910
...it all turns out okay.

175
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,315
But sometimes it doesn't,
does it?

176
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,289
I mean, sometimes kids get stuff
and it turns out really,
really bad.

177
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,970
- Seriously?
- It hurts.

178
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,274
- Stop.

179
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,153
Are you scared?

180
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,890
Are you?

181
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,394
Absolutely petrified.

182
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,802
I... I bet my mom's right.

183
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,438
Arlo got a concussion.
They can make you do
weird stuff.

184
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,407
No, no, but it's crazy.

185
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,708
How did it happen?
Who grabbed him?

186
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,111
What's up with the cars
and the animals,
the power going out--

187
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,846
Just hold still.

188
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,086
Okay.

189
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,189
- What?

190
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,825
You act like your mom's
such a pain in the ass.

191
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,127
Yeah, well, she is.

192
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,165
Your mom's your hero,
and you wanna be just like her.

193
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,201
Is that why you try so hard
at school?

194
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,469
I don't have to try.

195
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,870
You're always studying.

196
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,839
And you're always goofing off.

197
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,383
What do you call a bird

198
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,019
who's, like, too afraid to fly?

199
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,954
What?

200
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,991
Chicken.

201
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,462
Just when I thought
things couldn't get worse.

202
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,141
I'm petrified too.

203
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,283
We can be petrified together.

204
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,123
Yeah.

205
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,959
Maybe we can.

206
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,936
Maybe whoever Arlo ran into
did it.

207
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,972
Fucked with the engines,
cut the power line.

208
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,573
Yeah, I thought of that too.
But why?

209
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,077
Yeah, wouldn't explain
Donald and Claire's truck
either.

210
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,146
Or no signal on our phones.

211
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,215
Yeah, well...
...I'll tell you one thing.

212
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,452
And I can't believe
I'm saying this.
I'm glad Donald's on our side.

213
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:18,024
Maybe it's some kind
of electromagnetic pulse?

214
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,227
- Like with a nuclear bomb?
- Sure, yeah. Or a solar flare?

215
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,329
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm talking about.

216
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,365
- I don't know anything
about science.
- James.

217
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,071
Oh, sh-shit!

218
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,525
Hey!

219
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,230
Hey!

220
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,477
Hey!

221
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,281
Hey!

222
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,150
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

223
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,053
What's going on?
Why are you wearing that mask?

224
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,455
This is insane. My son is hurt!

225
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,392
- He could've been the one that--
- Our cars won't start.

226
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,395
We don't have cell service.
We don't have power. Uh--

227
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,098
I don't know what's going on,
I don't know
who the hell you are,

228
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,200
but we need help,
and your car is-is working, so--

229
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,501
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

230
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,037
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What are you doing?

231
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,573
Hey!

232
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,639
Just a little gauze and tape, okay?

233
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,380
Goat-brave, run-hide...
wasp-die, gun-shot...

234
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,648
I'm not gonna let you
leave again!

235
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,451
Run-ran-hide... woman-go...

236
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,722
Woman-go! Go! Go!

237
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,257
No!

238
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,863
- Listen to me!

239
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,632
Arlo, stop!

240
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,472
It's not me, Mom.

241
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,342
I'm not doing this.

242
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,578
It's...

243
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,316
What's happening?

244
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,421
I don't know.

245
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,723
I don't know.

246
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,796
I'm scared.

247
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,235
I know. I know.

248
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,538
I'm scared too.

249
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,308
Dad says you're never scared.

250
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,478
Oh. I've been scared
lots of times.

251
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,247
When were you scared?

252
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:03,883
Well...

253
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,321
I was scared
when your sister got lost.

254
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,625
I don't remember that.

255
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,626
Yeah.

256
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,296
You weren't born yet.

257
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,467
Do you know where we found her?

258
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,501
Where?

259
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,237
In the oven.

260
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,242
I was really scared
even after that.

261
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,644
I was scared
for a really long time.

262
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,347
How scared were you?

263
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,888
I was so scared
that I made your dad promise

264
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,391
to never tell anyone about it.

265
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,260
Not ever.

266
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,663
It was our secret.

267
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,770
Will you sing the song?

268
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,806
Now?

269
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,208
- Yeah. Yeah, now.
- Yeah.

270
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,443
- Please.
- Okay.

271
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,445
Okay.

272
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,684
♪ You give me inspiration ♪

273
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,255
♪ You give me love ♪

274
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:19,325
- ♪ My little lighthouse ♪

275
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:24,731

276
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,907

277
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,531
I'm your little lighthouse.

278
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,703
Yeah.

279
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,339
Yeah, you are.

280
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,554
Feels like dominos
are dropping here,

281
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,758
one right after the other.

282
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,432
Animals acting all weird.

283
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,501
The cars.

284
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,003
The kid.

285
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:42,742
Some kind
of new COVID fever bullshit.

286
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,446
Or...

287
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:51,785
well, maybe it's just that
Satan got in the boy somehow.

288
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,388
Sorry, Chenoweths.

289
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,093
ER is not gonna cut it.

290
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,696
And insurance doesn't
cover exorcisms,

291
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,764
so you're shit out of... luck!

292
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,984
Oh, Christ.

293
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,096
Oh, shit.

294
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,935
{\an8}Hey, boy. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

295
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,837
Hey, easy, easy.

296
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,845
Gotcha. Okay.

297
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,848
- Gotcha.

298
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,016
Easy.

299
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,485
Easy...

300
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,797
- Oh, Christ.

301
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,799
A dead body...

302
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:17,137
pitch black...
big, bad fucking dog.

303
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,906
Fan-fucking-tastic.

304
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,889
Those two Xs
are supposed to be us?

305
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,894
That line is this blue line?
And that line goes
all around us?

306
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:42,996
Fuck this.
We need your car, man!

307
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,031
- Whoa! Fuck!

308
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:46,966
Jesus.

309
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,505
It's a line of paint
on the fucking ground!

310
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,909
Hey!

311
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,111
Guys!

312
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,213
Donald!

313
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,520
Hey! Hey!

314
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,235
What the...

315
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,589
- What the fuck?

316
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,705
"Don't cross the line."

317
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,807
Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:02,776
Hey.

319
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,545
Hey, you gotta tell us
what all of this is

320
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,580
right the fuck now!

321
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,039
What does that mean?

322
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,053
Where are you going?

323
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,956
- Hey. Hey...

324
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,192
- Where are you going?

325
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:06,072
Oh, shit.

326
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,690
This is stupid.

327
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,828
Claire.

328
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,831
Hey, Claire, that was a gunshot.

329
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,035
Okay, why don't you just stay
until Don gets back?

330
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,971
That was probably Donald
taking care of the problem.

331
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,939
Besides, someone needs
to call 911,

332
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,808
get the Sheriff
and an ambulance.

333
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,044
We have a landline.
So, I'll call,

334
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,745
and I'll drive our car
back here.

335
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,715
Claire...
there's someone out there.

336
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,384
I have Duke. I'm going home.

337
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,119
I'll be fine.

338
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,357
That's what I'm gonna do, yes.

339
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,025
Yes. Yes, we are.

340
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,960
I'll be fine. Come on, Duke.

341
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,963
- Come on, Duke.
Claire, hey.

342
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,336
Here.

343
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,137
Thank you.

344
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:12,906
I'll come right back.

345
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,876
Come on, brave boy.
Come on, brave boy.

346
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,863
What the hell was that?

347
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:40,066
Something is going
very fucking wrong here.

348
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:44,237
Shit. Hey, look.
Look, look, look.

349
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,073
What is it?

350
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,409
Duke, damn it!

351
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:50,877
- Fuck!
- Is that Claire?

352
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,078
She's heading
right for the line.

353
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,413
- Hey!
- Hey, Claire! Claire!

354
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,282
Cut it out!

355
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,884
What is wrong with you?

356
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,824
Stop!
Stay back! Claire!

357
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,059
- Duke!

358
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,862
Stop! Hey!
- Dammit!

359
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,031
No, no, no.
Don't cross the line! Hey!

360
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,767
No, Claire! Claire!
Wait, no!
Claire!

361
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,301
- I'm going home!
No, no, no!

362
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,203
Don't cross the line!
The line!

363
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,106
- No, no, no, no, no!
Don't! Don't!
- Stop! Stop! Hey! Hey!

364
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,475
- What are you talking about?
- You do not understand.

365
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,011
- Just--
- Let me go!

366
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,246
No!

367
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,917
Aah!

368
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,720
Oh, my--

369
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,201
Claire.

370
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,975
Claire! Claire!

371
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,044
No!
- Claire! Claire!

372
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,949
Claire! Claire! No!

373
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:50,130
Maggie!

374
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,332
Claire! Claire!
Maggie!

375
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,335
Everyone back in the house
right now.

376
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,942
We need to go downstairs now.

377
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,514
Arlo?

378
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,158
Run-ran-hide-hid.

379
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,460
Nice... man... gun... shot.

380
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,328
T-- T--

381
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,101
T-- T-- T--

382
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,338
T-- T--

383
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:33,306
Trap.

384
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,076
Trapped.

385
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,079
Run... ran... hide.

386
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:41,247
Trapped.

387
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,215
Okay.

388
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,356
He...

389
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,991
He says we need to hide.

390
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,328
Who says?

391
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,230
The man.

392
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,001
What man?

393
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,137
The man in my head.

394
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:06,239
He says we're trapped.

395
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,341
And we need to hide.

396
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,911
Why?

397
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,480
Because it's coming, Mom.

398
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:15,982
It's coming.

399
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,252
