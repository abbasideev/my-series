1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,289
This is real. It's happening now.

2
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,892
They are here! And they walk among us!

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:21,864
All the meteor activity means
another visitor is coming. A good one.

4
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,332
Everybody takes a sip

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,558
- and we walk over the line?
- Yes.

6
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:29,638
No!

7
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,697
No.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,943
- Stop! Stop!
- No!

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,480
You got good visitors, you got bad ones.

10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,474
When a good one shows
up, a bad one hunts it down.

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,623
Fuck!

12
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,400
Fleetwood Mac, cheap
red wine, and sex.

13
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,770
Lots and lots of sex.

14
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,797
That was pretty much
our first year of marriage.

15
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,068
I never thought I'd love
anyone the way I loved William.

16
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,247
That was, until James came along.

17
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,283
I took one look at him, and I said

18
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,153
I would climb mountains
and swim oceans

19
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,714
and fight monsters for that little boy.

20
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:33,095
And then when William died, I
thought half my love died with him.

21
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,498
I mean, I had half left for James,

22
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,023
but then, that was it.

23
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,505
But it turns out that love is like
anything else. You can't control it.

24
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,940
Because you came
along, and baby meryl,

25
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,910
and Arlo, who popped out early.

26
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,345
Thirty-one weeks.

27
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,604
I'd do anything for those kids.

28
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,373
Yeah, I know.

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,743
Looks like the bleeding
has finally stopped.

30
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,356
But where are they? And are they okay?

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,591
I just want to see them
with my own two eyes.

32
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,218
And I wanna hug 'em
and tell 'em I love 'em.

33
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,098
And keep them safe. I'm rambling.

34
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,790
And that's fine.

35
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,395
I killed him.

36
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,799
And that's fine too.

37
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,769
Yeah, you're in shock.

38
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,216
Your hands, they've stopped shaking.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,709
It's probably the adrenaline too.

40
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,855
Too bad it won't last for a while.

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,090
You're not going anywhere.

42
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,291
But the kids.

43
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,293
Donald and I are on it.

44
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,652
- We'll be right behind you.
- Okay.

45
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,270
They're back.

46
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,857
It's fine, it's fine.

47
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,514
I-I didn't mean to. Mcnab,
he was pointing a gun at us,

48
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,284
and I would never hurt
anybody on purpose,

49
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,919
not a person, not an animal

50
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,655
- I know you wouldn't, honey.
- I don't even like squashing bugs.

51
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,124
You were protecting yourself.

52
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,283
And meryl, and Arlo.

53
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,261
And that's a good thing, honey, okay?

54
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,653
Keeping your friends safe.

55
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,132
I just wanted to help get the liquid.

56
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,535
But mcnab, he had that creepy
mask, and he just grabbed us.

57
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,472
I... dropped the liquid.

58
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,906
W-What are you
talking about, the liquid?

59
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,875
Harbinger, he had this
way for us all to get out.

60
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,302
It was this-this rainbow
liquid. He said it's-it's poison,

61
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,615
but if you drink just a little bit
of it, you can walk over the line.

62
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,051
- Easy... peasy, he said.
- Wait, safely?

63
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,144
Yeah, totally safe.

64
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,948
We got some in a jar, but
that's when we heard a car.

65
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,827
That was mcnab. He was
parked on the other side of the line,

66
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,497
but when he saw the jar of
liquid, he came running at us,

67
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,533
right over the line, and the jar broke.

68
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,860
But I think maybe there's
still some of it left in it.

69
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,963
Take me to mcnab's car.

70
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,722
Meryl, grab the 3 mil
syringe and the ropivacaine.

71
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,148
Gonna need the needle
driver and forceps, please.

72
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,594
Hey, I want him close but not this close.

73
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,730
- Can you...?
- Yeah, yeah, got him.

74
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,266
Come here, bud. Here we go.

75
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,134
Okay.

76
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,626
Look out.

77
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,529
Gonna put you right here, okay?

78
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,766
Hey...

79
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,311
You're sure you're okay, right, Arlo?

80
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,837
I'm okay, dad.

81
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,972
Come here.

82
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,518
Harbinger wants mom to know...

83
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,145
- Who?
- Harbinger.

84
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,458
What does harbinger want?

85
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,584
Harbinger says mcnab is good.

86
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,888
It's the other one, assassin, that's bad.

87
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,691
Harbinger and assassin, got it.

88
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,225
Good man.

89
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,564
Navarros?

90
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,703
What about you? Are you okay?

91
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,839
I'm okay.

92
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,877
You need to go check on your mother.

93
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,689
What? What happened?

94
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,592
Donald, could you...?

95
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,628
Yup, I'll fill you in. Come on, Duke.

96
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,487
- Come on.
- Okay...

97
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,067
- Come on. Duke, come here.
- Sure you got this?

98
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,192
Meryl?

99
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,995
I got this.

100
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,897
Okay.

101
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,976
And you're telling me
Olsen here being dead

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,069
doesn't mean we're out of danger?

103
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,647
I mean, yeah, that's
what the kid, Travis, said.

104
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:56,519
The other visitor, assassin, it could
have just moved into somebody else.

105
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,979
Jesus Christ!

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,214
Yeah...

107
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,885
- Well...
- What?

108
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,133
Now, you and I got
here, and then Valeria...

109
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,370
Wait, back up, back up. None
of you actually saw this happen?

110
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,739
That's what I was saying.

111
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,508
Your mom said he cut himself free,

112
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,744
- he came after her...
- Yeah.

113
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,381
At first, I-I figured it
was just-just insanity,

114
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,782
you know, like everything else,

115
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,185
but tell me this doesn't
look like he was shot

116
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,844
while he was sitting up.

117
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,157
While he was still helpless.

118
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,426
- Exactly.
- Fuck.

119
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,852
Means that...

120
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:45,234
Which means you need to go tell
Maggie and I need to go see my mother.

121
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,793
Come on.

122
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,753
You don't wanna know.

123
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,712
And I don't wanna tell you.

124
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,692
What does that mean?

125
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,818
It means there's something out there.

126
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,220
Something so...

127
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,369
It means they were
dead when we got there.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,929
My god... It means nobody's coming.

129
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,999
But you're okay?

130
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,234
No, I'm not.

131
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,104
Well, what about James? He...

132
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,841
- What about him?
- Well, you...

133
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,088
Well, you... You said they were dead.

134
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,814
But his face.

135
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,117
I did some of that, yeah.

136
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,197
It's over. I ended it.

137
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,973
Okay... This isn't...
Going to come out right.

138
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,143
But it wasn't about you.

139
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,946
And it wasn't about James.

140
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,326
It was about me. There
was something missing.

141
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,350
For me.

142
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,964
I do regret the lying, I regret hurting you,

143
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,667
and if it means losing you,

144
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,761
then I would really, I would really regret...

145
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,767
It just wasn't my intention.

146
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,347
That wasn't your intention?

147
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,250
Are you fucking kidding
me? No, why would i...?

148
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,309
Mom? Dad?

149
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,157
Nicholas.

150
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,128
Here.

151
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,817
- Ruben?
- Dad?

152
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,165
- Here, you just...
- I said, I've got it.

153
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,734
It's fine. I can... I can help you.

154
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,026
Guys?

155
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,406
Get behind me. Slowly.

156
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,209
Slowly.

157
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,288
Slowly.

158
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,691
- Nicholas? You need to shoot it.
- Yeah.

159
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,327
- What?
- Chamber a round. Do it.

160
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,330
- It just wants the liquid.
- Honey, but we need that liquid.

161
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,833
You have to shoot it,
Nicholas. Shoot it now. Now!

162
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,575
Jesus.

163
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,300
It's all true.

164
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,409
It's gone.

165
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,445
God dammit.

166
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,315
So fucking close.

167
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,778
Harbinger's not hurting you, right?

168
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,471
You're okay?

169
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,087
Harbinger trusts me, and I trust him.

170
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:34,290
And we're being brave, both of us.

171
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,825
Yeah.

172
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,484
Yeah, you sure are.

173
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,400
Meryl said that harbinger
is on some kind of a mission.

174
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,992
Is that right?

175
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,628
Yes.

176
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,930
Okay.

177
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,932
What is it?

178
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,746
To find the machine.

179
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,405
To go to it.

180
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,641
And I must be very quiet.

181
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,143
Why?

182
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,946
So I don't wake them.

183
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,859
Wake who?

184
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,651
They're sleeping, hidden.

185
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,388
The other assassins.

186
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,960
Hidden... in people?

187
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:27,967
Right.

188
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,236
Okay, and...

189
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,373
And this machine. What
happens when you go to it?

190
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,542
I am the on switch.

191
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,945
What happens when you turn it on?

192
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,281
We prepare.

193
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,384
Prepare for what?

194
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,287
The invasion.

195
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:48,898
My god.

196
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,523
Wait.

197
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,033
Mom?

198
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,044
She's not in the house.

199
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,522
What are you doing?

200
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,415
We got a problem.

201
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,654
It's not about one
assassin. It's about dozens.

202
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,056
Hundreds, maybe.

203
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,634
All of them sleeping, just
waiting to be woken up.

204
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,661
And the visitor, in your son,
may well be the best hope we have

205
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,439
of surviving this invasion.

206
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,341
That's why he has to come with me.

207
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,276
Please, just put the gun down. Please.

208
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,581
Other than myself and the
boy, I don't know who to trust.

209
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,074
You can't trust the person
who just saved your life?

210
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,778
Mcnab! Hey!

211
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,681
- It's okay. I'm back.
- Back the fuck up!

212
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,059
Let's just talk.

213
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,694
There's no time.

214
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,153
I know about the visitors.

215
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,523
Travis told me everything.

216
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:58,725
Travis?

217
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,161
Travis is dead.

218
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,596
Olsen too.

219
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,177
That's what it does!

220
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,578
It destroys and kills!

221
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,480
Doesn't stop. Not ever.

222
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,649
I'm not gonna let you
take Arlo. I'm just not.

223
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:18,087
There's a killer here! It could be
any one of you! And it's after your son.

224
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,124
Okay! Okay. What if you didn't
have to take Arlo to take harbinger?

225
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,260
Have harbinger move
into me. You can take me.

226
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,561
No. None of us are going with him!

227
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,463
- Shut up! Stop!
- Okay, stop. Please...

228
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,032
Stop, stop!

229
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,634
Quick! Go, go, go.

230
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,611
Hey, Donald. Donald...

231
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,748
My god.

232
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,650
Shit.

233
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,763
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.

234
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,123
He's gone.

235
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,241
Not going anywhere.

236
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,938
No, there's no one in there.

237
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,750
We'll go to Arlo's room.

238
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,218
- Hey, lock the door?
- Okay.

239
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,552
- Dad.
- Yeah?

240
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,553
Come with us.

241
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,856
- Honey, I can't.
- But mcnab, he's

242
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,792
yeah, he's still out there
somewhere, I know, but,

243
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,651
we need to find grandma.

244
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,588
'Cause you think she's not herself?

245
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,569
Like Arlo with harbinger,
you think she's assassin.

246
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,930
That's right.

247
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,700
You really believe she'd hurt us?

248
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,934
Yeah.

249
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,848
Meryl, come on.

250
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,850
Hey, mer. Look at me.

251
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,544
Everything's gonna be okay.

252
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,258
Sure you're up for this?

253
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,936
I'm nowhere near up for this.

254
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,105
What is that?

255
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,630
Hey...

256
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,848
- Sh...
- That's you.

257
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,684
- Where the hell have you been?
- Trying to find a way out.

258
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,687
- Mcnab ran off.
- What? I thought he was too hurt.

259
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,124
Maybe he is, maybe he
isn't. But he's out there.

260
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,559
Yeah, my mother is too.

261
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,185
What do you mean? What happened?

262
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,721
I don't even know where to start.

263
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,861
Harbinger...

264
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,177
If it's true that you can leave
Arlo and move to someone else,

265
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,836
then move to me.

266
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,939
No.

267
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,842
Why not?

268
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,889
With harbinger in
me, you can protect us.

269
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,791
You and dad and meryl.

270
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,950
But if harbinger was in
you, I can't protect you.

271
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,585
Okay, there's gotta be another way.

272
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,792
Hey, guys, it's me.

273
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,427
It's Nicholas.

274
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,907
- Hey.
- Hi.

275
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,931
Come in.

276
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,813
My parents told me to come up here.

277
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,081
Is Ellen really...?

278
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,105
Yeah.

279
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,118
She's the last person I'd ever think to be

280
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,243
yeah, I know.

281
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,534
I wish there were something
we could do to help.

282
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:42,191
I know.

283
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,416
Maybe there is.

284
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,287
Ruben, slow down.

285
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,864
Please.

286
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,759
Hey.

287
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,300
I don't wanna be alone.

288
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,815
Just stay here.

289
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,933
Looks like a lot of answers in here.

290
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,301
It's mostly confusing,

291
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,428
but there is some
stuff that makes sense.

292
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,744
Shh.

293
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,131
Lock the door behind me. Mom?

294
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,756
Meryl.

295
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,177
Okay.

296
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,588
Okay, okay...

297
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,870
Hey.

298
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,062
Hey, Duke.

299
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,804
I don't think it's me.

300
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,374
Not anymore.

301
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,953
I-I don't know where it went,

302
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,189
but it's not in my head.

303
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:54,457
I can't hear it.

304
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:58,418
Or... or maybe it's still in
my head, but it's hiding.

305
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,030
Or... Christ.

306
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:03,966
I could be lying right now,
and I don't even know it,

307
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,593
but I don't know anything.

308
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:09,205
Are we just gonna leave
grandma tied up like that?

309
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:10,589
It could still be in Ellen.

310
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:13,667
It could be in any one of us.
Why don't you go to the kitchen?

311
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,281
When you and Ruben were
off alone, either one of you

312
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,484
we should never split
up when looking for Ellen.

313
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,786
Look, I think that's the bottom line.

314
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,078
We don't know anything.

315
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,115
Except that it's here, and
it's probably in one of us.

316
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,853
And the navarros?

317
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,768
There's nothing at the navarros'.

318
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,069
That's bullshit, James.

319
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,594
It's the only reason we're trapped.

320
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,239
It can't be destroyed. I told you that.

321
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,299
- We didn't even try.
- Ruben, it was killing you.

322
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,182
- What are you...
- what the hell are you doing?

323
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:56,585
We don't know anything, so
unless you want to tie all of us up...

324
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

325
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,424
We really can't trust each other, can we?

326
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:04,193
That's right. On top of being
totally and completely screwed,

327
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:06,829
we are also now totally
and completely screwed.

328
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,798
- What do we do now?
- Find a fucking way out.

329
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:10,933
- There is no way out.
- And there's no way to tell

330
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,492
which one of us this is in, right?

331
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,905
No. Travis said no.

332
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,239
That poor fucking kid.

333
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:20,543
And Olsen? He wasn't
doing it. It was assassin.

334
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,379
What about mcnab? He's
still out there somewhere.

335
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,638
He is, so we keep watch,

336
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,883
no one goes off alone
if they don't have to,

337
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,909
and we stay in groups
as much as possible.

338
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,287
And to keep Arlo safe, we isolate him.

339
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,646
- Yes.
- Nobody goes in and out of his room.

340
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,591
Well, except for meryl and Nicholas.

341
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:37,560
I think we can all agree it isn't them.

342
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,228
They weren't here when it happened.

343
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:40,763
Good. Nobody else.

344
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:43,466
Well, how long are we
supposed to do this?

345
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,658
Until assassin makes...

346
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,570
Some kind of, I don't know, mistake.

347
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,505
Something that shows us who it is.

348
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:52,141
All right, we stay alert.
We watch each other.

349
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:53,776
So this is the solution? We do nothing?

350
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,170
Yeah, it is. Unless you got a
better idea, that's what we're doing.

351
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,282
I can't believe we're just gonna sit here

352
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,619
with that thing, that
monster inside one of us.

353
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:07,890
And we're talking, like assassin
isn't in this room right now,

354
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,525
listening to every word we say.

355
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,427
I am not waiting for this bastard

356
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,362
to decide "enough is enough"

357
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:16,589
and watch one of us go
apeshit and hope for the best.

358
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,267
Everybody, listen.

359
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,536
Okay, wait. Don't come any closer.

360
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,938
Look, I didn't find
anything about getting out,

361
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:26,475
but it does say, if we
can just find out who it is,

362
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:29,369
that there's a way to get
the assassin out of them.

363
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:31,938
How?

364
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,042
We drown them.
