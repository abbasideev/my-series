1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,641
My god. Look.

2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,122
- Wait!
- You have to stop!

3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,215
Wait! Wait! Wait!

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,127
Coming over to this
side's a piece of cake.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,430
Heading back the other
way, that's the problem.

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,800
Last night my mom told my dad
Arlo said there's a voice in his head.

7
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,335
He told 'em there's something coming.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,694
Something that's gonna kill us.

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,573
Assassin-kill-murder. Assassin-kill!

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,241
- Where are you going?
- We should go with him.

11
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,643
You have to listen to harbinger.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,246
Harbinger is real, meryl.
And he's telling the truth.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,571
We need to go right now.

14
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,488
- What is this?
- Toxin.

15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,089
Bad... poison.

16
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,624
So what are we gonna do with it?

17
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,792
We drink it.

18
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,250
Anybody here?

19
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,565
Somebody down there?

20
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,821
Okay. Can you grab this?

21
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,313
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,183
Okay.

23
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,894
Okay.

24
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,196
So, everybody takes a sip of this

25
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,465
and then we walk over
the line? Easy-peasy?

26
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,800
Easy-peasy.

27
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,802
But it's poison.

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,804
Yes, it is poison.

29
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,541
So, if we drink too much,
like all these animals...

30
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,676
Dead.

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,810
Drink too little?

32
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,945
Walk over the line, and then dead.

33
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,206
Don't drink it at all,
assassin shows up and...

34
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,641
Dead.

35
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,344
Dead, dead, and...

36
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,655
Dead.

37
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,815
Hey. Let's go.

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,650
Come on.

39
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,398
So you're telling us that
everything that has happened,

40
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,400
the electricity, the phones, the engines...

41
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,570
And what about the line and what
happens when someone tries to walk over it?

42
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:18,474
The effect the line has, the odd
and aggressive behavior of animals,

43
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,911
and as I said, some
people too, yeah... all of it.

44
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,281
It's terrifying and tragic,
but not beyond explanation.

45
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,849
Well, what is the explanation?

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,851
We'll get to that, I promise,
but first and foremost,

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,455
I am here to get you all
out of this, okay? Safely.

48
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,458
- Obviously, that's good to hear.
- But this is insanity.

49
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,326
One thing at a time, please.

50
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,261
Of... of course.

51
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,731
Now, you said there are nine.

52
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,867
You two, the two men
who went to the neighbors'.

53
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,502
Right, James and Ruben.

54
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,472
One man in the clinic,
injured, a woman with him.

55
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,308
- Donald and Maggie.
- Maggie's a veterinarian.

56
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,610
Medical professional,
that's good to know.

57
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,403
And the three children. No one else?

58
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,782
There was the guy with
the mask holding the signs.

59
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,519
I know all about him. But
no unannounced visitors?

60
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,547
- No one hurt, acting strange, confused?
- No, no. Nobody.

61
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,034
You must be Maggie.

62
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,527
This is lieutenant Olsen.

63
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,611
We're trapped, but we have a way out.

64
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,813
The way out could kill
us, but not if we're careful.

65
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,570
What are you doing?

66
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,649
Your grandma told me that
when things are screwed up...

67
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,875
She says whatever's going
wrong and then says "but"?

68
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,946
There's a bad guy coming,
but he's not here yet.

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,451
Hit my forehead. It was
bloody and it hurt a lot, but...

70
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,430
The girl I've been in love
with since the second grade

71
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,589
took care of it and made me feel better.

72
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,529
We need to go home.

73
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,367
Yeah, okay.

74
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,450
What was she even doing up there?

75
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,752
I don't know.

76
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,420
Unfortunately, I do.

77
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,747
This is why I was asking
about unannounced visitors.

78
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,125
What do you mean?

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,095
A big part of my job was to locate

80
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,097
and isolate Carmen navarro.

81
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,133
- God. Why?
- Why? What... what happened?

82
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,403
As I understand it,
she had become erratic,

83
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,539
confused, left the
navarro property on foot,

84
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,974
missing since yesterday.

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,843
And what was wrong with her?

86
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,901
Was she sick?

87
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,714
Yes, but... it's more than that.

88
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,917
What happened to Carmen has something
to do with that blue line, doesn't it?

89
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,110
It's all connected, yeah.

90
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,948
Now, as far as you know, are
you the only one who saw Carmen?

91
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,962
I mean, Donald was talking about her.

92
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,431
He was in the woods last night.

93
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,400
- Donald's the one in the clinic?
- Yeah.

94
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,659
Do you know if Carmen was
dead when Donald saw her?

95
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,139
I mean, he didn't know it was Carmen.

96
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,875
He... he said "body."

97
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,668
"The body." So yeah, he
thought Carmen was dead.

98
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,015
Well, that's, actually good.

99
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,541
Is it?

100
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,622
If someone had come into contact
with Carmen when she was still alive,

101
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,647
well, we'd have a real problem.

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,861
What does that mean, "a real problem"?

103
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,029
Maggie.

104
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,600
Arlo was in the woods
last night before Donald.

105
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,827
And.

106
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,072
I mean, he's definitely been acting...

107
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,640
Well, he hit his head.

108
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,833
I mean, he has a concussion.

109
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,536
Arlo is...

110
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,671
My son.

111
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,973
You know where Arlo is right now?

112
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,488
I think the kids are upstairs.

113
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,524
- Take me to them?
- They're actually in the barn.

114
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,059
- They are?
- Yeah.

115
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,561
Arlo was feeling a lot better

116
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,830
and he wanted to go and, feed the goats.

117
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,099
I thought, you know, it's
a really good distraction

118
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,635
given everything that's happened
so I can take you over there.

119
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,961
Good.

120
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,634
Here.

121
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,118
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

122
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:26,479
What did the man write on
the sign? "Don't trust anyone."

123
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,838
Why did you say that?

124
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,597
Why did I say what?

125
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,843
You know what I'm talking about.

126
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,912
Yeah, I do.

127
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,070
So?

128
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,716
Because it's true.

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,918
And with everything
that's going on right now,

130
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,644
if I didn't tell you

131
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,113
look.

132
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,829
Arlo!

133
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,088
Harbinger!

134
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,926
I wanna talk to my brother.

135
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,832
Let me talk to Arlo now.

136
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,800
Enough is enough.

137
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,537
You sound just like mom.

138
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,182
Good.

139
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,141
Then you know I'm not kidding around.

140
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,021
I want answers, okay? Real answers.

141
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,557
Nicholas asked you
where harbinger came from,

142
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,292
and you pointed to the sky.

143
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,617
That's right.

144
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:41,330
So you're saying what? Outer space?

145
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,898
That's where harbinger's from?

146
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,057
Yeah.

147
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,170
And... and assassin's the one

148
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,107
who made that horrible line
in order to trap harbinger?

149
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,131
Yeah.

150
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,101
Why does assassin
want to stop harbinger?

151
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,708
Harbinger's here...

152
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,711
Harbinger's on a secret mission.

153
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,681
What does that mean, secret mission?

154
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,195
It's a car.

155
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,788
Okay, let's go.

156
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,334
So, what are you?

157
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,602
What am I?

158
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,671
You're a-a police officer?

159
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,697
A lieutenant, yes.

160
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,832
With the Birmingham police.

161
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,034
Alabama?

162
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,746
We're nowhere near Birmingham.

163
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,275
I'm part of a task force made
up of police, army, marines.

164
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,145
We're from all over and we travel all over.

165
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,258
So, where is everybody else?

166
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,783
We work alone.

167
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,329
Until a situation becomes untenable.

168
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,154
And this isn't untenable?

169
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,226
I get it, but no, it's not.

170
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,161
Not yet.

171
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,907
You wanna tell me what's
really going on here?

172
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,408
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

173
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,677
The line. What the hell is it?

174
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,646
The line itself, it's nothing.

175
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,171
It's, just a line.

176
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,118
The man who painted it
is trying to help, I guess,

177
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,187
but he doesn't have all the information.

178
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,724
And he's unstable, so he's
doing more harm than good.

179
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,017
- That's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

180
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,229
The way things have
been explained to me is

181
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,133
it's a very strong,
concentrated kind of vibration,

182
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,028
and when complex organisms
come into contact with it,

183
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,798
well, you know what happens.

184
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,344
And what causes it?

185
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,404
Short answer is, we don't know.

186
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,717
We do know that it can
disrupt signals and currents.

187
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,912
It adversely affects animals
and sometimes humans.

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,050
So, was there some
kind of a confrontation?

189
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,986
With Carmen?

190
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,831
Yeah.

191
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,334
Something pretty
horrible happened to her.

192
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,303
Obviously there was a very
serious altercation after she left,

193
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,763
but before? No.

194
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,834
And it wasn't with you, right?

195
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,870
I arrived after Carmen went missing.

196
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,807
And not with anyone
from your task force?

197
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,080
I told you, I work alone.

198
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,726
Right, but what happened with Carmen,

199
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,261
you said it was connected.

200
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,388
You think it might be part of
what's happening with Arlo?

201
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,902
Well, it could be your son just
has a concussion, like you said,

202
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:37,873
but there have been
instances of whatever this is

203
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,734
moving from person to person.

204
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,083
They could be up in
the hayloft, so, you know,

205
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,942
we should...

206
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,307
Your son's not up here.

207
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,377
No, he's not.

208
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,994
Carmen's wrists had marks on them,

209
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,553
like she'd been restrained.

210
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,923
What you said about what
happened to her, it's not true, is it?

211
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,062
Not all of it.

212
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,463
No.

213
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,475
So, is it that you're
not telling us everything,

214
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,003
or is it that you're just lying?

215
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,140
You're smart.

216
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,178
It won't help.

217
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,183
What do you mean? Why not?

218
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,952
Because there is no one else coming.

219
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,355
And there is no way out.

220
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,905
The only way for any
of you to survive this

221
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,563
is if you take me to your son.

222
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,434
No.

223
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,338
No, I'm not gonna do that.

224
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,408
Sure you will.

225
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,463
He's not who he says he is.

226
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,099
And all of this, whatever
it's for, it's not fucking good.

227
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,467
Okay, but if he is police

228
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,636
Carmen had marks on her
wrists, like she'd been tied up.

229
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,405
He has zip ties on his belt.

230
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,073
What does that prove?

231
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,441
Nothing, if it's just about that,

232
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,900
but this guy's been lying
ever since he got here.

233
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,948
- What?
- He

234
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,983
he doesn't look like a liar to me.

235
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,352
Well, that's the thing about liars,

236
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,154
isn't it, Valeria?

237
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,347
They look just like everybody else.

238
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,456
Okay, well...

239
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,560
If he's not here to do good,
then who the hell is he?

240
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,439
I don't know, someone dangerous.

241
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,207
What do we do now?

242
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,900
I have no idea.

243
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,210
You know.

244
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,181
About... James and me.

245
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,188
Do I?

246
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,291
It's over.

247
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,332
It's fine if you hate me.

248
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,202
I don't hate you.

249
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,438
You don't?

250
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,209
What good is that gonna do?

251
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,080
I feel angry, sad.

252
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,949
Betrayed.

253
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,087
I don't hate you, I feel bad for you.

254
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,990
Why is that?

255
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:28,428
I thought it was because you aren't
the good person that I thought you were.

256
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,307
But then I realized, I feel bad for you

257
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,201
because you aren't the good
person that you thought you were.

258
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,571
And that's gotta hurt.

259
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,275
Knowing that.

260
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,493
Yeah... James was right.

261
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,694
Yeah?

262
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,353
About what?

263
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,390
How cold you can be.

264
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,631
Who the hell are you?

265
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,620
It really doesn't matter.

266
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,479
It absolutely matters.

267
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,384
Just bring your son to me.
We're running out of time.

268
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,262
I'm not gonna do that.

269
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,497
- You need to bring me Arlo...
- Stop!

270
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,799
Before it's too late.

271
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,268
- Just...
- I'm not gonna say it again!

272
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,128
We... we can't just keep hitting him.

273
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,308
If Ellen comes back,

274
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,654
just don't let the kids up here.

275
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,147
Hey... where are you going?

276
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,550
God...

277
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,199
She's got it all wrong.

278
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,401
No, I don't think she does.

279
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,104
Well, then you've got it all wrong too.

280
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,530
Well, I think I'm okay with that for now.

281
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,362
What the hell is that about, right?

282
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,132
It is not the time or the place.

283
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,112
It's fucking ridiculous.

284
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,514
I can't get it out of my head.

285
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,186
It's an earworm.

286
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,797
A what?

287
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,589
An earworm.

288
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,525
It's when you can't get
a song out of your head.

289
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,295
An earworm?

290
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,665
I like that.

291
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,609
I can't help you like this.

292
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,190
And I get it, I do. This is all scary.

293
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,559
And... confusing.

294
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,895
And Maggie's right to
be worried about her son.

295
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,198
But if you don't cut me loose right now,

296
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,456
things are gonna get...

297
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,776
I, I saw Maggie on the way to the clinic.

298
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,912
- So...
- She'll be back. The kids?

299
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,514
They're not in the
house, I can't find them.

300
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,817
Maybe they heard us and got scared.

301
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,819
W-Went to hide in the woods?

302
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,346
You wanna go?

303
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:07,923
You go.

304
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,649
We have to watch him.

305
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,189
Okay...

306
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,528
Yell, if... I will.

307
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,733
I will.

308
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,490
Shit.

309
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,793
Shit...

310
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,593
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

311
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,961
You're up.

312
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,263
Yeah, I don't wanna miss the fun.

313
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,788
Anybody find a way out of this mess?

314
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:31,798
It's... It's... There's
just somebody... He's...

315
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,035
Sorry... Take... take it easy.

316
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,708
Hey.

317
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,644
It's just... I thought he was...

318
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,883
It's Arlo and the kids and...

319
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,419
Just tell me what's going on.

320
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:56,332
We need to... I'm sorry.

321
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,801
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay. It's okay.

322
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,037
You don't have to. You
don't have to. It's okay.

323
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,496
It feels like everything all at once, yeah?

324
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,976
Yeah, c-Claire had 'em too.

325
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,978
Claire had 'em too.

326
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:13,573
It feels uncontrollable... But it's not.

327
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,443
You got this.

328
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,112
You got this.

329
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:23,817
Just breathe.

330
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,686
Just breathe.

331
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,858
Breathe.

332
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,833
Arlo, come on. Hurry up. Come on.

333
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,711
Stop.

334
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,675
- No.
- What?

335
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,630
No!

336
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,922
Yeah.

337
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,890
No.

338
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,498
Hey, don't. That... that line...

339
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,883
- Let go!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

340
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,443
- No!
- No!

341
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,536
Shit... shit... no.

342
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,695
What... what do we do?

343
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,965
We help him.

344
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,610
It's okay, it's okay. Here.

345
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,837
Here, let me help you.

346
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,652
Man.

347
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:30,977
Nicholas, give me that.

348
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,082
All right, this is gonna hurt.

349
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,801
I... I'm sorry. I'm really

350
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:49,094
he's... he's assassin, right?

351
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,498
I know you.

352
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,808
You...

353
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,744
You're...

354
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,857
It's you.

355
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,015
Yes.

356
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,484
You were that woman.

357
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,063
Now I am here.

358
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,831
Now I am Arlo.

359
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,022
And you are mcnab.

360
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,894
I am.

361
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,565
I was trying to help you.

362
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,944
Almost got you to the car.

363
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,637
We were almost safe.

364
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,907
But then you ran.

365
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,577
I lost you.

366
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,916
But god damn it, I found you again.

367
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:45,952
Yes.

368
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,521
Yes, you did.

369
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,572
What's wrong with your hands?

370
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,997
Nothing, they just shake.

371
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,679
I think you're worried
Maggie might have lost it.

372
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:06,772
I think I'm worried we
all might have lost it.

373
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,590
Could you...

374
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,158
Could you just come get this blood off?

375
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,627
It's getting in my eye.

376
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,153
It burns.

377
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:25,901
Please. What am I gonna do?

378
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,560
I can barely move.

379
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,596
Not even barely.

380
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,770
Don't do anything.

381
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,672
I won't.

382
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,716
What are you...

383
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,948
That's better.

384
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,960
Where's mcnab?

385
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,395
Where's Travis? What
happened to Travis?

386
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,154
He's...

387
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,696
Who... Who are you?

388
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,075
What's happening?

389
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,900
Fuck.

390
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,230
There we go.

391
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:00,266
A conundrum.

392
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,402
That's what this is.

393
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:07,107
'Cause I don't know if you're here to
help me or finish the job, you know?

394
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,881
What...?

395
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,328
Basically, I'm gonna need you
to give me one really good reason

396
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,389
why I shouldn't finish this cigarette
and shoot you in the fuckin' head.
