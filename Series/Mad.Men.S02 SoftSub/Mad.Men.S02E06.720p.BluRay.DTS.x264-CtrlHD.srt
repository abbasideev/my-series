1
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,006
You're asking if I've seen these before?

2
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,842
They've been running this for ten years.

3
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,469
The Playtex people are jealous.

4
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,720
They shouldn't be.

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,139
Maidenform is a dream,
but Playtex is a bra.

6
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,558
I've never seen either brand go wrong.

7
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,934
I had four of these up in my dorm.

8
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,020
I didn't even know what advertising was.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,397
Why now? Sales are strong.

10
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,441
Someone has a wife with an opinion.

11
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,526
They would like to do
what Maidenform is doing,

12
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,445
not what we're doing.

13
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,615
Why? Then they both
have the same campaign.

14
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,200
I love how they don't need a diagram.

15
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,868
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,536
And if so, why?

17
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,498
I do,

18
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,459
and I agree with
the 95 women we surveyed

19
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,419
about how well it fits.

20
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,671
I find they both open easily.

21
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,965
I like a happy client,

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,842
although you'd think
someone would be able

23
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,219
to talk them out of jumping
onto a bandwagon

24
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,930
- as solid as this.
- Maybe they want us to raise the bar.

25
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,349
Why, because their share
of the market keeps increasing?

26
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,642
You see them every four months.

27
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,726
Why not throw them a bone?

28
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,894
Let them see they're paying for creative.

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,063
Just wrinkle it a little.

30
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,606
I went to sleep in my bra,

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,483
and l thought I was so-and-so.

32
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,152
Thank you for that.

33
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,905
Just for fun, let's say
we're Iooking for new,

34
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,574
and by new l mean old Maidenform.

35
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,495
Peggy, you dig in around
Playtex's unique benefits.

36
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,830
Just the man to do it.

37
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,081
What do I tell them?

38
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,083
Tell them you couldn't get a hold of me.

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,006
Mr. Phillips, your ex--

40
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,758
your wife--

41
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,260
Mrs. Phillips--

42
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,345
Pauline. I see her.

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,097
Thank you, Joyce.

44
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,018
Hey, felIa.

45
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,938
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.

46
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,567
Someone made you
smell like a girl, yes.

47
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,111
Come on. This way.

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,364
Hey, slugger.

49
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,699
Hey, Dad.

50
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,117
- Precious.
- Hi, Daddy.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,580
- You look well.
- So do you.

52
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,915
How's your mother?

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,501
Worse. She's very erratic.

54
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,754
Did you see the guy up at Brigham

55
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,047
that Bob Levinson recommended?

56
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,133
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

57
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,052
I can't leave right now.

58
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,304
I wish you would have told me

59
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,722
that you were going to be early.

60
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,557
Well, I know you're not
good in the afternoons.

61
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,934
That's not true anymore.
You know that.

62
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,103
Okay.

63
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,230
You two have a good time.

64
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,982
I will try and call you from Nana's.

65
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,358
Did you get a suite?

66
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,485
They opened up the room next door.

67
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,195
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,157
'Cause he's a good boy. Yeah.

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,326
We're going to have
a wonderful time on the town.

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,745
I got tickets
for A Funny Thing Happened.

71
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,079
We saw it.

72
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,706
Not from these seats.

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,291
I should go.

74
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,090
So, you'll have to wait
a little while in my office,

75
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,092
do your studies, work up an appetite.

76
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,093
It's Memorial Day.

77
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,762
All I have is German vocabulary.

78
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,764
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.

79
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,099
Nice dog.

80
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,309
Who are these?

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,811
This is my son Mark
and my daughter Patricia.

82
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,104
A handsome family.

83
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,106
And this is Chauncey.

84
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,734
I hope he can't smell cat on me.

85
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,527
Freddie and I work together.

86
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,112
Can l bend your ear a minute?

87
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,614
Spit it out, Freddie.

88
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,993
We're going to need
another box of brassieres.

89
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,413
Yes. Of course.

90
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,041
Enjoy your holiday.

91
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,752
Come on, Chauncey.

92
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,551
Her skin cleared up,
but she still looks unhappy.

93
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,803
She's a cheerleader.

94
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,930
For who, the University of Dour?

95
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,183
Does she have any cute friends?

96
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,602
These are the top three.

97
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,522
I'm sorry, but compared to the kids
on American Bandstand,

98
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,815
they look miserable.

99
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,108
Those kids are drunk.

100
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,109
Really?

101
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,276
I don't know.

102
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,321
What about the idea of them
going on a date?

103
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,158
Mr. and Mrs. Fresh Face.

104
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,035
We could do multiple panels in print,

105
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,121
but it would really translate to TV.

106
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,163
How?

107
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,540
Like a contest?

108
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,792
No, it's a story.

109
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,003
Anticipation as they get ready,

110
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,880
fixing their hair to look perfect.

111
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,174
Their skin, it's not even on their mind.

112
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,885
They're two kids
who used to haνe a problem.

113
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,263
Thanks, Clearasil.

114
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,266
Maybe, but it's prom night,

115
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,229
and it ends with him at the door
and her and a corsage,

116
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,523
the first moment
they see each other.

117
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,649
And Dad with the Brownie?

118
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,818
Clearasil. . .

119
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,903
and some kind of line.

120
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,323
What about "Thanks, Clearasil"?

121
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,617
I need to think about it.

122
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,494
I can work with that.

123
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,580
You want to run this
by your father-in-law?

124
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,415
Eventually.

125
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,295
Have a nice holiday.

126
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,935
So how the hell are you, Don?

127
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,103
Good. How are you, Crab?

128
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,646
Glad to be in shorts.

129
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,898
You don't play?

130
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,524
I don't mind watching.

131
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,984
Whenever it's this hot,

132
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,570
l think about that summer
they executed the Rosenbergs.

133
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,905
It was always about to rain.

134
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,239
I remember that.

135
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,908
We were still in Manhattan.

136
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,242
- I don't miss it.
- Yep.

137
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,912
We get them to close Sing Sing,
we'll be in Shangri-la.

138
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,455
I keep having this dream

139
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,290
that there's a power failure
and the gates open.

140
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,126
Hadn't thought of that.

141
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,586
Let's change the subject.

142
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,255
Eventually, I just said, "Fine.

143
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,801
"lf Lem Jones Associates is falling apart,
maybe it's time to move on."

144
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,803
I hadn't heard about that.

145
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,222
I guess you PR men have the best PR.

146
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,225
Yeah, I went to Rogers & Cowan
and left it burning behind me.

147
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,518
What happened over there?

148
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:26,612
I was on the team that took the fall
for the Cuban Revolutionary CounciI.

149
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,280
The Bay of Pigs?

150
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,075
The CIA hired us
to help inspire the Cuban people

151
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,286
to a coordinated wave
of sabotage and rebellion.

152
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,538
You handled that?

153
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,833
Not as badly as they did.

154
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,293
But I don't know when Don's going
to be able to get away.

155
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,170
High-class problems, my dear.

156
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,632
Marcie, we should say
hello to Chuck and Ann.

157
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,229
I didn't know you belonged here.

158
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,107
I've been coming here
since l was a kid.

159
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,817
We're guests of the Pattersons.

160
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,029
Where's Tara?

161
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,741
Over there, l think.

162
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,326
I haven't seen you riding.

163
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,745
I suppose that's true.

164
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,206
I know you changed your schedule,

165
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,834
and I'm afraid l had
something to do with that.

166
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,044
No. Don't be ridiculous.

167
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,800
All I wanted to say is
please ride when you want.

168
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,343
I'll stay out of your way.

169
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,388
It's very nice to see you.

170
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,099
Arthur, it's okay.

171
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:41,270
As we used to say in college,
let's be friends.

172
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,356
Good. Because l think
you would have enjoyed

173
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,358
seeing me get nosed
into the trough the other day.

174
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,693
No.

175
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,069
Yes.

176
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,740
Mommy! Mommy!

177
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,123
WelI, it's nice to see you.

178
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,541
You as well.

179
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,713
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.

180
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,799
Still, all that vigor disappeared

181
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,385
when he found out
he couldn't get anything done.

182
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,304
It's Versailles.

183
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,348
Jackie's smiling all over the world.

184
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,058
He's chasing starlets.

185
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,476
Everybody's happy.

186
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,394
I'm building a bomb shelter.

187
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,437
Really?

188
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,232
If you see Petra, don't mention it.

189
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,691
She doesn't want people to know.

190
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,652
Good seeing you, Don.

191
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,362
Let me know if you need a reference.

192
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,446
We'd love to have you here.

193
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,032
If l could have everyone's attention
for a moment.

194
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,575
Please be seated.

195
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,411
It is a tradition

196
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,415
that we have our ribs and fashion show
on this day every year.

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,419
Well, this is not to dim
our resolute admiration

198
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:52,758
for the fortitude of those
who have so nobly served our country,

199
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:57,096
many of whom will not be
enjoying ribs this afternoon.

200
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,892
If you could please stand,
all servicemen,

201
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,938
for a moment of our
insufficient appreciation.

202
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,148
Including Lester Aaron.

203
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,235
Lester was a Rough Rider.

204
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,238
Please, heroes, on your feet.

205
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,814
Can you close the door?

206
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,941
You're letting the air out.

207
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,484
Those look delicious.

208
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,403
It's not the club,

209
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,905
but at least you know
l washed my hands.

210
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,782
How are things in the circus?

211
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,200
Damn serious.

212
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,203
What is this?

213
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,621
J&B.

214
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,290
The network sent me a case.

215
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,959
This is why l don't have a TV.

216
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,337
You want something else?

217
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,504
He'll suffer through it.

218
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,006
Do you know where you're summering?

219
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,966
We were thinking Point O'Woods.

220
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,385
I have to work, though.

221
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,388
Mother's going to expect you on Fishers.

222
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,599
I see her crossing the widow's walk
with an eye to the sea.

223
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,808
Peter.

224
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,560
I was on the phone
with her the other day,

225
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,520
and you were all she talked about.

226
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,190
- Really?
- No. I'm kidding.

227
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,194
I don't think I know
what's funny about that.

228
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,612
Judy, would you help me
with the corn?

229
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,240
Now, listen. Don't scrimp.

230
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,575
Take a vacation.

231
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,535
Don't Trudy's folks have
some incredible vacation spread?

232
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,121
It's not about the money, Bud.

233
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,248
I'm very important to the agency.

234
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,708
My absence is felt.

235
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,545
Yes. Well.

236
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,758
Let's see how
the Ottomanelli Brothers treated us.

237
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,556
And here's Annette FogeI
ready for the playa.

238
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,725
That's Spanish for beach, gentlemen,

239
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,644
and that's where you'll want to be.

240
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,565
If something sportier
is what you're looking for,

241
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,859
- check out--
- I have to go.

242
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,152
. . .last year's singIes champion.

243
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,530
Really? You're really going?

244
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,241
I wouldn't think you'd want to leave this.

245
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,118
People will be working. I should stop by.

246
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,661
Okay.

247
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,081
You're going to miss the sparklers.

248
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,833
Call me from the emergency room.

249
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,585
Oh, and this delight, Judy Sawyer,

250
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,839
is ready for the beaches of California,

251
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,551
where she loves to do the Watusi.

252
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,688
Room 301 .

253
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,609
Hello.

254
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,778
You're there. Good.

255
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,904
Yes.

256
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,408
But there's been a change of plans.

257
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,243
I'm spending the day with my son.

258
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,619
We're going to the beach.

259
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,371
Your son?

260
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,789
He's 1 8.

261
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,711
I don't know why
I never brought him up.

262
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,633
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills
for the next ten days.

263
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,303
Los Angeles. That's far away.

264
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,639
No. It's some club in Kentucky.

265
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,266
Still far away.

266
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,896
I could stay out at the beach,
and you could join.

267
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,647
You never saw it.

268
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,149
Don't do that.

269
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,651
What? You never think about it?

270
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,653
No.

271
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,948
I do. All the time.

272
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,702
The car on its side,
your body crushing me.

273
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,497
I don't know why I think about it.

274
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,748
Maybe I do.

275
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,584
I'll call you.

276
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,544
I'd like that.

277
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,070
Morning.

278
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,448
Hello.

279
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,744
I ran that "Thanks, Clearasil" thing
by my father-in-law.

280
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,870
He loved it.

281
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,747
I'm glad.

282
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,959
The libraries were closed yesterday.

283
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,294
What did you do?

284
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,545
I was working,

285
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,754
and then there was a barbecue.

286
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,382
It was too hot.

287
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,926
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.

288
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,553
It goes along for a while,

289
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,929
and then it takes a turn

290
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,889
and ends up exactly where
you thought it was going.

291
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,767
John Wayne shot him.

292
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,769
Have you seen it yet?

293
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,105
It's okay. You saved me 50 cents.

294
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,357
I'm sorry. l hate people who do that.

295
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,278
I know you don't like the line.

296
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,906
Look, it's all about keeping
your father-in-law happy.

297
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,367
I do my job, you do yours.

298
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,120
What's that supposed to mean?

299
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,247
Nothing.

300
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,959
Just play with it.

301
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,085
Okay?

302
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,007
So you're stilI out there in Brooklyn?

303
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,258
Yes.

304
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,510
Where again?

305
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,012
Marine Park?

306
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,805
No, I moved a while ago.

307
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,266
I'm on my second apartment,
in Prospect Park.

308
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,602
East 83rd Street.

309
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,354
It's a ghost town.

310
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,981
But my brother came to my cookout.

311
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,524
Who were you with?

312
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,653
My family.

313
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,155
Pete, look, I really do
have a lot of work to do.

314
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,323
Of course.

315
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,160
Let me know where you land.

316
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,961
How was your day off?

317
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,838
Restful.

318
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,757
I went to the beach.

319
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,841
Too much, I see.

320
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,094
I got it behind my knees.

321
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,221
I couldn't sit down.

322
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,806
Morning.

323
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,891
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.

324
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,938
Has your wife seen that yet?

325
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,775
Do me a favor.
Let me be there when it happens.

326
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
Is that why you're here?

327
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,861
Concerned for my well-being?

328
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,572
Here's your cigarette. Be on your way.

329
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,449
But wait. There's more.

330
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,868
You are going to have lunch with Duck.

331
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,829
Perhaps on a train car,

332
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,081
because I want you to sign an armistice
on American Airlines.

333
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,083
What are you talking about?

334
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,876
I've been in the meetings.

335
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,046
Errol Flynn is gone,
and so is my taste for swordplay.

336
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,423
You two need to put them away.

337
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,508
I have.

338
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,884
I've been married for over 20 years.

339
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,846
l know the difference between a spat
and spending a month on the couch.

340
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,389
Don't go to bed angry.

341
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,608
Two hot chocolates.

342
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,319
I don't want it.

343
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,904
Sure you do.

344
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,906
lt's good when it's hot
to drink something hot.

345
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,909
If you continued with the Scouts,
you would have learned that.

346
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,371
Patty, you can use the phone,
but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.

347
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,040
Daddy has a morning meeting.

348
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,877
There's a food cart.
It'll be here in 20 minutes.

349
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,962
No scraps for Chauncey.

350
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,548
I have money. I have $1 50.

351
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,799
Mark.

352
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,925
That's good.

353
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,927
How did you get that tidy sum?

354
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,929
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.

355
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,389
And why would he do that?

356
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,020
Because he wants us to be happy
when he marries Mom.

357
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,234
We all want you to be happy.

358
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,904
And whatever his intentions,
it's very generous.

359
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,031
He already asked her.

360
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,700
Well.

361
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,955
You must have known eventualIy

362
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,209
that your mother and I
might be starting new lives.

363
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,503
We understand. We don't care.

364
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,963
It's not easy for her.

365
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,217
With you away at St. Paul's now,
she's lost her man of the house.

366
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,053
Franklin Reeve is a good man.

367
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,014
Mom's going to stick you with Chauncey.

368
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,390
What?

369
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,726
We're supposed to say good-bye to him.

370
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,728
She can't make you do that.

371
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,188
Dad, he's your dog.

372
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,439
And I've learned to live without him

373
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,525
so you two kids
could have some consistency.

374
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,985
Frank's allergic.

375
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,000
Your mother will be here in a half an hour.

376
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,303
Where are we?

377
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,305
We had an interesting idea.

378
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,642
We?

379
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,977
Are you on Playtex?

380
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,187
He wants to get credit for his idea.

381
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,814
You sure about that?

382
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:55,068
WelI, we went out the other night,
after the meeting--

383
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,445
you know, a little extra hours after hours--

384
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,030
and l looked around the bar.

385
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,490
We all did.

386
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,658
From what I understand,

387
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,370
PIaytex has an amazing bra,
but it doesn't take you anywhere.

388
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,621
Well put.

389
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,415
So I was thinking.

390
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,792
Women right now
already have a fantasy,

391
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,752
and it's not going up the Nile.

392
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,754
It's right here in America.

393
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,008
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

394
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,467
Every single woman is one of them.

395
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,011
Watch this.

396
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,601
Jackie.

397
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,395
Marilyn.

398
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,063
Jackie.

399
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,107
Marilyn. . .

400
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,277
WelI, Marilyn's really a Joan,
not the other way around.

401
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,871
That is an idea
and an impressive presentation.

402
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,082
Well, you always say
it's a 24-hour-a-day job.

403
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,251
Apparently, I've already signed off on it.

404
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,302
I don't know if all women
are a Jackie or a Marilyn.

405
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,179
Maybe men see them that way.

406
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,097
Bras are for men.

407
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,059
Women want to see themselves
the way men see them.

408
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,186
You're a Jackie or a Marilyn--

409
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
a line and a curve.

410
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,230
Nothing goes better together.

411
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,107
Which do you think I am?

412
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,692
Gertrude Stein.

413
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,112
I would say you're more classical,

414
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,822
Hellenic.

415
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,199
Irene Dunne.

416
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,452
I love Irene Dunne.

417
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,913
Peggy, you're going
to have company on this.

418
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,748
CongratuIations, Kinsey.

419
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,209
You forced your way onto an account.

420
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,379
Mr. Phillips is here.

421
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,673
Sorry I'm late.

422
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,132
Get back. Out.

423
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,134
Who's the new account man?

424
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,887
It's Chauncey. Sorry about that.

425
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,140
Listen, any idea
when I can schedule Playtex?

426
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,308
We're laying track.

427
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,227
I think you can bring
the train in tomorrow.

428
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,937
Something new, I hope.

429
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,147
Can l drop some crumbs, at least?

430
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,733
Two sides of one woman--

431
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,528
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.

432
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,488
Maybe it's two girls.

433
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,448
But definitely two flavors--

434
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,825
vanilla and cherry.

435
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,159
Sounds good.

436
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,161
Don, your girl says you're free for lunch.

437
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,955
She's in charge.

438
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,206
Come on, Chauncey.

439
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,333
Come on.

440
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,254
Thought you all were listening.
Let's go.

441
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,923
Freddie.

442
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,383
What, sweetheart?

443
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,431
I wish you would have told me
you were going to work Tuesday night.

444
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,598
If you have something better,

445
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,142
I'll run it by Don.

446
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,019
He already likes that.

447
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,937
Yes, he does.

448
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,272
Isn't that our goal?

449
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,191
I'm not saying l had a better idea,

450
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,193
but now I'm not eνen a part of it.

451
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,945
All I had to do was be in that bar.

452
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,823
Believe me,
you didn't want to be in that bar.

453
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,241
The work's done.

454
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,994
Now go write me some titiIlating copy.

455
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,508
Mr. Draper is here to see you.

456
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,968
Send him in.

457
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,223
Are you coming by to pick me up?

458
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,225
No.

459
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,021
It's just I wasn't really pIanning
on coming back after lunch.

460
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,398
Any way we can have
this conversation now?

461
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,025
Conversation?

462
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,611
Roger told me it was
just a friendly lunch.

463
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,489
I know.

464
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,907
People start giving you things.

465
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,325
They think it's cute.

466
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,535
I've got a crate of that crap somewhere.

467
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,249
That's quite a playing field you have there.

468
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,335
I don't like anything on it but ashes.

469
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,422
I thought maybe your secretary
was better than mine.

470
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,217
Nobody's secretary's better than yours.

471
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,552
You creative directors.

472
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,308
All l can say is it's been hard
to figure things out around here.

473
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,519
Eighteen months in?

474
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,354
We can't be that unusual.

475
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,107
I'm doing the job you hired me to do.

476
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,776
I tell people that SterIing Cooper
is the only place to be.

477
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,779
You've been pitching more to me
than you have to clients.

478
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,280
What does that mean?

479
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,034
It means you've been
selling their ideas to me

480
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,369
more than mine to them.

481
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,793
When l was in the Marine Corps,
l missed duty.

482
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,670
Fell down the steps or something.

483
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:28,758
My squad leader covered,
but then I confessed to the men.

484
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:33,513
He laid down some rifle fire for me,
and I acted like I didn't need it.

485
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,849
That's not the situation
l want to be in here.

486
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,852
So what, you're covering for me?

487
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,687
Who am I in this story?

488
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,313
I'm grateful, Don.

489
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,858
If you hadn't brought me in,
where would l be?

490
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,318
Some fifth wheel at McCann?

491
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,238
Look, I did everything l could
for you on American Airlines.

492
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,282
It was a risk worth taking.

493
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,242
People think of us differently.

494
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,202
What do you want me to say?

495
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,579
That we're on the same team?

496
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,330
That I love being in your unit?

497
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,916
Sarge, I'm scared?

498
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,836
You have an "I told you so," okay?

499
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,005
Can we move forward?

500
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,174
I'm the one that looks bad.

501
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,884
It hasn't hurt the company.

502
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,098
Yes.

503
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,433
Of course we can.

504
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,354
And I will tell Roger we had Iunch.

505
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,107
Well. Good, then.

506
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,358
Okay.

507
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,003
Where did you come from?

508
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,673
You don't want to know.

509
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,643
Wait.

510
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,188
I love it.

511
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,108
I'm warm and l'm cold.

512
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,488
What time is it?

513
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,703
A little after 4.

514
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,915
I have to get ready.

515
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,960
Where are you going?

516
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,544
My daughter's in a play.

517
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,339
Daughter?

518
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,757
Is that everyone?

519
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,511
She's at Sarah Lawrence.

520
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,520
How much preparation do you need?

521
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,775
You don't want me to go.

522
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,696
I took the afternoon off.

523
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,281
For me?

524
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,540
You're a lion, aren't you?

525
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,751
Now l know what you like.

526
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,964
You can go.

527
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,550
I know I can.

528
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,513
Do you want to stay here?

529
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,473
Watch TV?

530
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,726
Go through my things?

531
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,440
I would never leave you alone in my place.

532
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,483
Yes, you would.

533
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,694
Stay.

534
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,154
Relax.

535
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,408
Believe me, I'm the same way.

536
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,788
It has to come out somewhere.

537
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,297
I'll get you out in time
for dinner, I promise.

538
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,757
What's going on?

539
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,510
You here to audition?

540
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,512
No one told me about this.

541
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,474
I'm taking pictures.
You can look at the pictures.

542
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,059
I didn't know you'd want to come.

543
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,519
Is Paul in there?

544
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,396
A lot of guys are in there.

545
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,856
You can come in if you want.

546
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,651
No. I'm just surprised
because I have an eye for this.

547
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,320
Don't worry about Kinsey.

548
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,322
I won't let him put anything together
without you.

549
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,699
Who's next?

550
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,420
Hey, girl.

551
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,383
You look lost.

552
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,550
Chauncey.

553
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,885
Here he is.

554
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,553
I apologize, Chauncey.

555
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,555
I thought you were a girl.

556
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,224
Beautiful dog.

557
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,225
Where have you been hiding him?

558
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,228
I made my wife give him back to me.

559
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,021
Missed him too much.

560
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,564
I like dogs.

561
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,941
Dogs are better than wives.

562
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,275
Never a problem communicating.

563
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,445
I like having one in the office.

564
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,697
Makes us look more easygoing,

565
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,575
friendly, you know, to clients.

566
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,868
Maybe I'll bring one in, too.

567
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,703
What breed do you have?

568
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,289
I don't have one.

569
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,208
I was going to get one for the office.

570
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,086
I don't think that's a good idea.

571
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,130
Good night, Campbell.

572
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,423
Come on, Chauncey.

573
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,615
What were you doing
in SterIing Cooper?

574
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,909
There was a casting call for Playtex.

575
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,202
Right.

576
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,998
The fellas are calling it the bra-ditions.

577
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,958
That's funny.

578
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,418
You work there?

579
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
I do.

580
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,630
Want me to find out how it went?

581
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,633
I already know. Not well.

582
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,428
I find that hard to believe.

583
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,513
WeIl, they fall in love
with a picture of you,

584
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,640
and then you come in,
and they're disappointed.

585
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,728
But it doesn't make any sense
because alI they need is a picture.

586
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,440
I didn't bring my camera with me,

587
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,151
but I can't imagine it
being better than this.

588
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,655
I don't know. Maybe l Iook tired.

589
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,200
I just flew back from working in London.

590
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,993
London?

591
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,164
What's your name?

592
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,753
Peter Campbell.

593
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,632
Oh, my. Account executive.

594
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,152
I love the taste of Scotch.

595
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,659
Thank you.

596
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,705
Stop. Turn around.

597
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,998
Let me look at you.

598
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,005
When l first saw you,

599
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,715
I thought you were foreign.

600
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,426
Really? Is that right?

601
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,888
Hold that.

602
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,643
I have company.

603
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,275
I'll be right back.

604
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,253
Who was that?

605
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,422
- My mother.
- Really?

606
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,090
What, you didn't think I had a mother?

607
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,843
It's okay.

608
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,856
Hold on.

609
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,867
Up the long, delirious, burning blue,

610
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,204
I topped the windswept
heights with easy grace

611
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,167
where never lark or even eagle flew.

612
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,006
And while with silent lifting mind

613
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,800
I strode the high untrespassed

614
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,928
sanctity of space,

615
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,222
put out my hand,

616
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:59,477
and touched the face of God.

617
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,566
You want me to fix you something?

618
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,403
What's that?

619
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,821
Cereal.

620
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,155
No. That.

621
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,409
Do you like it?

622
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,744
I bought it at the auction.

623
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,955
Can l speak to you a minute?

624
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,212
What? What's wrong?

625
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,880
Where are you going in that?

626
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,841
Swimming.

627
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,468
You asked me if I like it. I don't.

628
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,011
What are you talking about?

629
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,931
I'm talking about
a 1 5-year-old lifeguard.

630
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,599
I'm talking about
a bunch of tennis pros,

631
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,269
not to mention all those loafing
millionaires taking the summer off.

632
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,396
- Do you want to be ogled?
- Oh, Don.

633
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,231
Everybody bought one at the auction.

634
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,150
It's desperate.

635
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,613
I didn't know that.

636
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,908
I have to go.

637
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,410
See you tonight.

638
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,048
Joan, there you are.

639
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,926
Are you aware that I'm
on the Playtex account?

640
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:56,927
What about it?

641
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,598
Please tell the girls
I am to be included in all the memos.

642
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,475
Sure. For a moment there,

643
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,227
I thought you were just another person
coming to ask me about my brassiere.

644
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,313
Why aren't I on the list?

645
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,940
I don't know what to tell you.

646
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,942
I'm not involνed in that.

647
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,781
There's business going on,
and I'm not invited.

648
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,032
I'm a good drinker.

649
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,201
What are you asking me?

650
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,952
You know how this office works.

651
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,704
Parts of it.

652
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,664
Forget it.

653
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,958
I've never had your job.

654
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,877
I've never wanted it.

655
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,670
You're in their country.

656
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,506
Learn to speak the language.

657
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,424
You don't talk that way.

658
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,676
I don't need to.

659
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,137
And honestly,

660
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,139
you've never listened to a word l've said.

661
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,560
You want to be taken seriously?

662
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,771
Stop dressing like a little girl.

663
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,070
Jacqueline Kennedy,
Marilyn Monroe.

664
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,072
Women have feelings
about these women

665
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,824
because men do.

666
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,536
Because we want both,
they want to be both.

667
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,914
It's about how they want
to be seen by us--

668
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,999
their husbands, their boyfriends,

669
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,459
their friends' husbands.

670
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:13,045
Here's the idea, very simpIy.

671
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,130
The bra is called the Harlequin.

672
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:18,300
In fit and form,
it should be your very best.

673
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,262
It comes in black and white.

674
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,476
Jackie, Marilyn.

675
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,687
Same incredible fit,

676
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,981
two different women.

677
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,066
And the beauty of it is
it's the same woman,

678
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,693
the same model.

679
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,152
Look at that. lt is.

680
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,321
And even if you don't notice it,

681
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,698
you still get a bit of an "Aha"

682
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,032
when you read the copy.

683
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,951
"Nothing fits both sides of a woman

684
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,370
better than Playtex."

685
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,792
It's a very impressive idea, Don.

686
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,043
I like the girl.

687
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,255
So will your customers.

688
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,048
It's a very flattering mirror.

689
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,509
This definitely moves you
into Maidenform's neighborhood.

690
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,805
But sales have been so good

691
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,224
when we talk about
how well our brassieres fit.

692
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,686
I don't know what to say.

693
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,439
We were talking in the cab
on the way over.

694
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,610
Let Maidenform have
women's imaginations.

695
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,820
We'll take their money.

696
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,073
I couldn't have said it better myself.

697
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,076
WelI, I apologize for the goose chase.

698
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,079
We're very sorry.

699
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,790
No one else can have
this campaign, right?

700
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,334
It's yours.

701
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,919
We'll keep it on file for you.

702
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,880
A pleasure.

703
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,465
- Thanks again.
- Thanks for coming in.

704
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,260
That was a waste of inspiration.

705
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,679
These people.

706
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,848
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

707
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,725
They made up their minds
on the way over.

708
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,393
Why put up a fight?

709
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,104
I think we bought
a couple years of security.

710
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,856
If they ever decide
they want to go that way,

711
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,191
they know we can do it.

712
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,112
Listen, we would love
to show our appreciation

713
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,697
by entertaining
you gentlemen tonight.

714
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,908
And you can put it on our bill.

715
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,243
Make sure Don knows he's invited.

716
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,662
Where should we go?

717
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,788
Surprise us.

718
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,832
If we were to take you
to see some girls in their underwear,

719
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,459
would you feel like you're at work?

720
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,252
No. That sounds good.

721
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,380
Well, let us clear the decks.

722
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,839
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.

723
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,883
That's on 44th and 8th.

724
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,511
We will be there,
and the tab will be open.

725
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm going to go tell CampbeIl.

726
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,848
Take care.

727
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:30,933
Good to see you.

728
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,226
- See you there.
- Bye-bye.

729
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,161
Mr. Phillips.

730
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,622
We have artwork
in the evening papers, son,

731
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:54,790
and I don't have them.

732
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,291
Someone's supposed
to put them on my desk,

733
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,292
Friday or not.

734
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,669
Should I get some?

735
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,254
What do you think?

736
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,257
I'll be right back.

737
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,754
It's flattering to be able
to keep you interested.

738
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,339
Stop talking.

739
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,782
Why don't you want me to talk?

740
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,576
You know you want me to.

741
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,245
Do l?

742
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,913
You do.

743
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,553
Touch me.

744
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,388
No.

745
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,398
Don't stop torturing me.

746
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,402
I want the full Don Draper treatment.

747
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,028
You're spoiling the mood.

748
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,239
I wanted it, and I got it,

749
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,907
and it's better than they said.

750
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,410
What?

751
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,873
Have no fear.

752
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,417
You're known as a connoisseur.

753
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,336
You have lots of fans.

754
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,881
Are you talking about me?

755
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,632
I wasn't, no.

756
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,009
Well, who was?

757
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,385
What?

758
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:57,806
Who?

759
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,560
Sarah Tierney at Random House.

760
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,400
I don't know who you're talking about.

761
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,402
Stop.

762
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,740
This is nobody's maiden voyage here,

763
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,283
handsome.

764
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,704
You have a reputation.

765
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,457
Enjoy it.

766
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,302
Does it make you feel better
to think that l'm like you?

767
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,440
My goodness.

768
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,442
Gloνes come off.

769
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,077
I like this.

770
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,204
You want to blindfold me?

771
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,336
What are you doing?

772
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,587
Are you going?

773
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,261
I told you to stop talking.

774
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,731
Thank you.

775
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,757
People are going to think
you're the mayor.

776
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,234
Hey, look, it's Peggy.

777
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,902
What are you doing here?

778
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,529
I don't know.
I heard we were celebrating.

779
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,072
I thought l'd stop by.

780
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,490
Did you now?

781
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,492
- Stay for one drink.
- Okay.

782
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,454
You're staying all night, honey.

783
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,497
Now you got the best seat
in the house.

784
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,666
Tell me what you want for Christmas.

785
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,258
Yeah!

786
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,566
What do you want for breakfast?

787
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,984
Grapefruit.

788
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,748
Hey, Daddy.

789
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,792
Hey, you.

790
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:04,594
I'm not going to talk.

791
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,930
I don't want you to cut yourself.

792
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,790
Are you okay, Daddy?

793
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:37,669
You know what, Sally?

794
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,921
I think you better leave me alone.

795
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,082
