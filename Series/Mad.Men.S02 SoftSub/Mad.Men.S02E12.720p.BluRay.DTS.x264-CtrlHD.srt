1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,793
Sally, those go in your room!

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,753
And, Bobby,
put your trucks in the toy box.

3
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,213
I'm not your maid.

4
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,172
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,632
Nothing.

6
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,884
Get over here.

7
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,136
You could burn the house down.

8
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,304
You're hurting me.

9
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,472
Good.

10
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,849
I can't believe you were smoking.

11
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,975
I wasn't.

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,810
Go upstairs.

13
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,479
You're not going to be
watching television.

14
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,314
You're not going to be
playing with your friends.

15
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,607
I'm taking away Barbie.

16
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,066
- You're mean.
- You bet.

17
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,401
Get in there.

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,321
I'm telling Daddy when he gets home.

19
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,655
Go ahead.

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,992
He left because
you're stupid and mean.

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,036
You want to sleep in there?

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,372
Why won't you let him come home?

23
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,214
Is that what you think?

24
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,008
His suitcase is here, and he's not.

25
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,933
Daddy's on a trip.

26
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,018
I told you.

27
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,895
It's for business.

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,856
Can we call him on the phone?

29
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,651
It's long distance.

30
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,571
And I know he'd be very upset
about you doing what you just did.

31
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,532
Please don't tell.

32
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,576
Take your school books upstairs.

33
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,453
As soon as Carla gets here,

34
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,789
I'm going riding,
and l want a good report.

35
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,105
Who wants a Popsicle
when it's snowing?

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,065
Don't they sell enough
during the summer?

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,025
Obviously not.

38
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,112
I loνe Popsicles.

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,074
I can't think in here!

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,285
It's a storage closet, not an office.

41
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,911
I calIed the meeting.

42
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,663
So where are the refreshments?

43
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,208
Why do moms give treats?

44
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,918
There's no good reason.

45
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,254
My mom would come out
to the truck with us.

46
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
She'd break the Popsicles in half,

47
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,385
then giνe it to us
like Jesus at the Last Supper.

48
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,012
Sounds cheap.

49
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,763
No. My mother did it, too.

50
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,265
It was great.

51
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,975
In Vermont, we made our own ice cream.

52
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,519
It was a pain in the ass.

53
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,944
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.

54
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,321
So?

55
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,615
You can do it all year 'round.

56
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,912
It's a ritual. It's like Communion.

57
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,331
It's kind of CathoIic, isn't it?

58
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,957
It's Christian--

59
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,210
as in behavior, not religion.

60
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,087
Let me tell you something.

61
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,465
The Catholic Church
knows how to sell things.

62
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,761
Any calls?

63
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,556
Mr. Peterson had some question
about your expenses regarding--

64
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,308
Why doesn't he just die already?

65
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,893
Lutèce.

66
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,979
Christ. It's IBM.

67
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,314
Myopic.

68
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,398
What else?

69
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,736
And you have an appointment
with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,987
Who's that?

71
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,615
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.

72
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,492
I'm sorry. What?

73
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,743
Mrs. Campbell set it,

74
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,496
and, well, I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

75
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,081
Good luck.

76
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,419
Yes, of course.

77
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,587
Thank you.

78
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,839
I think it's one of the most bIessed things

79
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,509
that a person would give
a home to an abandoned child.

80
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,304
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell on the line?

81
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,933
Just get me Bert Peterson.

82
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,398
Well, hello there.

83
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,941
Hello, Bertram.

84
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,568
Is Florence with you?

85
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,988
No. She's taking care of her mother.

86
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,364
Then we were thinking

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,783
about going to the Breakers
through New Year's.

88
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,369
She's a good companion, isn't she?

89
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,288
She's moody.

90
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,834
Damn it, Alice. l don't ask much of you--

91
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,461
My stockings cost more
than your carpeting.

92
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,549
Have you looked everything over?

93
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,467
It's a very generous offer.

94
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,096
I always say it's
the smartest thing I ever did,

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,306
helping you out.

96
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,560
22.50 per share per year
for the next 1 0 years?

97
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,229
To think that Mother
thought you were a failure.

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,690
She made me who l am.

99
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,901
Do you mind if I have a drink?

100
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,612
Sweet vermouth, please.

101
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,242
You can trust Cleveland.

102
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,537
You said on the telephone
you were undecided.

103
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,372
What's your hesitation?

104
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,667
I promised to take care of Roger.

105
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,254
Let Roger Sterling
have what he always wanted--

106
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,174
to die in the arms of a 20-year-oId.

107
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,010
The truth is you don't want to retire.

108
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,345
And I hate to say this, Bertram,

109
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,264
but you are old--

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,058
older than me.

111
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,769
l can't even imagine
what that must be like.

112
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,979
Charming.

113
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,982
Please. You're not well.

114
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,485
This is what I do.

115
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,196
It's a merger.
You can continue to do it.

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,823
I'll be as useful
as the Queen of England.

117
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,534
Don't you want to go to Montana?

118
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,204
You ruined that poor architect's life.

119
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,456
Go visit your cattle.

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,250
I do love them.

121
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,506
But you can't trust the Brits.

122
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,402
I've left a letter on my bureau.

123
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,155
If I'm not back in two days,
the police will be here.

124
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,324
Why would you bring that up?

125
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,243
Because I don't want you to hurt me.

126
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,746
I just want to know
where my husband is.

127
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,665
It's a simple misunderstanding.

128
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,375
There's a lot of men with my name.

129
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,794
Well, you're the only one
who used my husband's serial number

130
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,671
to get a driver's license.

131
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,881
Car title. Apartment lease.

132
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,842
Do you have a birth certificate?

133
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,010
In a safe deposit box.

134
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,178
Will you stop?

135
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,014
I saw the look on your face.

136
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,558
I don't know what to say.

137
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,059
There's been a mistake.

138
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,687
Can't you be a human being?

139
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm his wife.

140
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,816
I don't care what he asked you to do.

141
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
I need to know.

142
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,902
I have to get back to work.

143
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,571
Stop lying.

144
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,656
You've been caught.

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,992
Don't make me do something
l don't want to do.

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,709
He died.

147
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,460
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,379
What?

149
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,883
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,302
Are you sure?

151
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,985
He never said he had a wife.

152
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,322
Seven years.

153
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,752
I'm very, very sorry.

154
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,587
What happened?

155
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,173
He was killed in combat.

156
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,842
So, who are you?

157
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,388
They thought I was him and he was me.

158
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,349
I didn't think I was hurting anyone.

159
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,352
I can't belieνe it.

160
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,064
I just had to get out of there.

161
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,194
What are you going to do to me?

162
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,364
He never mentioned me?

163
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,951
I didn't know him long.

164
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,327
Maybe--

165
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,703
What's your name?

166
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,081
Anna.

167
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,210
I don't know what to say.

168
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,671
I'm making good money, if that's--

169
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,590
I know I owe you more than money.

170
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,052
I have his purple heart

171
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,054
and his dog tags, if you want them.

172
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,724
He wanted to marry my sister.

173
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,520
She looks just like me,
with two good legs.

174
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,818
What is your name?

175
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,237
Dick Whitman.

176
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:19,201
WelI, Dick, what do I do with you?

177
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,256
Well, this is a welcome surprise.

178
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,094
I can come back.

179
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,512
No. Come.

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,264
See this.

181
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,498
I guess alI you needed was an audience.

182
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,875
Are you next?

183
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,793
I don't play.

184
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,628
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.

185
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,005
Hi.

186
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,883
It's called "In The Hall
of the Mountain King."

187
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,551
It's scary.

188
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,803
I know.

189
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,306
Take a lollipop. I'll see you next week.

190
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,148
Bye, Mrs. Draper.

191
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,818
You're tan.

192
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,904
Are you here on vacation?

193
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,739
No.

194
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,783
Business.

195
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,247
You look good.

196
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,375
Where are your things?

197
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,419
Or are you just here for the day?

198
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,338
I didn't even think about it.

199
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,426
I didn't mean to intrude. I can--

200
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,552
Are you in trouble?

201
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,388
No.

202
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,556
Well, then, what?

203
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,770
Can l take a shower and lie down?

204
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,480
Of course.

205
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,905
Trudy!

206
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,323
You're late.

207
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,909
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?

208
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,244
I put us on the list.

209
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,913
And, I don't know,
we went right to the top.

210
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,165
WelI, I'm not going, and neither are you.

211
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,500
Peter, you're shouting.

212
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,127
Don't do that.

213
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,046
Listen to me very carefully.

214
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:40,592
We are not adopting a child.

215
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,010
That's final.

216
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,637
Will you calm down, and we can talk--

217
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,764
Hell's bells, Trudy! That is final!

218
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,267
You don't speak to me that way!

219
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,233
You have lost your mind!

220
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,879
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.

221
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,507
I am, but my autopilot's working.

222
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,396
What are you doing?

223
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,524
You're tired. Let me do the driving.

224
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,860
It's okay.

225
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
Joanie.

226
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,530
Stop.

227
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,948
Honey.

228
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,037
You know what? I am tired.

229
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,663
Okay.

230
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,720
Is something wrong?

231
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,932
Where'd you pick that up?

232
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,016
Greg, stop that.

233
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,394
You know there is no before.

234
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,896
Right.

235
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,862
I'm sorry that I don't know
alI the things you want.

236
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,156
But you do.

237
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,410
I'm on call again on Wednesday.

238
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,642
These pants have a 38 inseam.

239
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,979
Harold.

240
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,148
I would like to meet him.

241
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,025
I kicked him out.

242
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,402
Even though old ladies shouldn't be picky.

243
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,825
It's beautiful here.

244
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,995
You like the porch?

245
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,414
You paid for it.

246
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,254
I think about you.

247
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,799
Just in passing, I'll wonder.

248
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,513
They were making
a commercial on the pier.

249
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,184
And then you called me.
How about that?

250
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,102
You've been in California too long.

251
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,775
How old are your children now?

252
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,029
Sally is 8.

253
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,530
Bobby is 5.

254
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,580
If you don't want to talk
about what happened,

255
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,833
that's fine.

256
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,211
But you can, you know.

257
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,131
I always felt that we met
so that both of our lives could be better.

258
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,053
That's just how it is between us.

259
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,014
I ruined everything.

260
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,355
My family, my wife,

261
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,148
my kids.

262
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,651
I'm sure that's not true.

263
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:13,073
My brother came to find me.

264
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,325
I told him to go away.

265
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,661
I didn't know you had a brother.

266
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:24,376
I've told you things I've never told Betty.

267
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,757
Why does it have to be that way?

268
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,343
You love her.

269
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,850
You don't have to tell her everything.

270
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,519
I'm sure there are things
about her you don't know.

271
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,065
Do you want to call?

272
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,233
No.

273
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,071
That would just confuse things.

274
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,783
So, what are you going to do?

275
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,994
I don't know.

276
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,210
I have been watching my life.

277
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,837
It's right there.

278
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,011
I keep scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

279
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,100
I can't.

280
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,730
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,496
Did you get the same thing
in your stocking last night that l did?

282
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,414
What are you talking about?

283
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,083
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered

284
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,419
to put a lot of marmalade on your toast.

285
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,005
Sit, Roger.

286
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,426
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.

287
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,011
Yes. Well,

288
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,848
I don't like being in the position
of having to sell off my life's work

289
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,726
because you have
an increase in overhead.

290
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,687
So Mona's crying
on your shoulder now?

291
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,357
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.

292
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,484
Well, let her know it didn't work out.

293
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,277
Bert,

294
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,530
I know you don't think
I got my hands dirty.

295
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,949
I'm sorry l missed the Great Depression.

296
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,576
Still, I have served this
place for the last 20 years.

297
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,829
It's a merger.

298
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,038
We can still come to work in our building,

299
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,414
in our offices,

300
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,209
only there will be diamonds
on the doorknobs.

301
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,966
So we'Il have a meeting of the partners.

302
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,893
And for your information,
Jane makes me very happy.

303
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,312
That's good to know.

304
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,402
As Don illuminated,

305
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,821
advertising is essentiaI for aerospace,

306
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,739
especially in reaching out to the public

307
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,409
to see that congressmen vote

308
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,412
for the spending bills
which bring new jobs.

309
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,290
Actual advertising, not public relations.

310
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,002
I have your father-in-law on line 1 .

311
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,349
Tom. How are you?

312
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,812
Well, Peter, to be honest,

313
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,814
l don't like having
to make this phone call.

314
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,400
Why not?

315
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,569
WelI, we've been thinking
about things over here,

316
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,405
and we're going to haνe to
put Clearasil up for review.

317
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,868
Really? That's a shock, Tom.

318
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,162
Now, why would you do that?

319
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,955
Sales have been spectacular.

320
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,290
All right, calm down.

321
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,044
I said review, not that we're moving.

322
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,879
You'll have 90 days to turn it around.

323
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,464
Turn what around?

324
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,466
You're distracted.

325
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,676
What are we talking about, Tom?

326
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,304
Look, son--

327
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,014
Every good businessman knows

328
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,392
that if his wife's unhappy,
his work suffers.

329
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,938
Yes, they seem very directly related
in this case.

330
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,481
Don't they, Tom?

331
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,275
Trudy's happiness should
be your first priority.

332
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,112
I think you should pull
Clearasil right now.

333
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,156
I don't think you're going
to get what you want.

334
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,908
What about my daughter?

335
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,327
She's my wife. That's between us.

336
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,120
You know what?

337
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,164
I was in love with Trudy when I met her.

338
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,749
And then you stuck your nose in,

339
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,377
put these ideas in her mind,
and made her unhappy.

340
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,712
What do you mean,
you "were" in love with her?

341
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,298
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

342
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:45,095
Yes. Perhaps it is best
if we just give notice.

343
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,554
Good-bye, Tom.

344
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,855
I bought you some clothes.

345
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,712
Tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,176
There's something else.

347
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,720
What?

348
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,347
I met a girl.

349
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,349
Another one?

350
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:36,730
She's so beautiful and happy.

351
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,939
She's a model.

352
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,151
And she's from a good family,

353
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,444
and she's educated.

354
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,070
What's her name?

355
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,406
Elizabeth. Betty.

356
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,907
I want you to meet her.

357
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,201
Look at you.

358
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,662
You're in the lavender haze.

359
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,209
I just like the way she laughs

360
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,878
and the way she looks at me.

361
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,130
Yes.

362
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,007
You are very hard to look at.

363
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,637
I want to ask her to marry me.

364
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,015
Dick, that's wonderful.

365
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,522
WelI, I need you to give me a divorce.

366
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,567
Well, of course.

367
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,694
I never thought of that.

368
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,362
You should hire a lawyer out here.

369
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,364
I'll pay for it.

370
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,618
And l want you to know that l'm
going to take care of you forever.

371
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,412
You don't have to do that.

372
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,831
I do.

373
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,875
You don't owe me anything.

374
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,631
This whole life.

375
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,799
If it wasn't for Don,

376
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,592
- if it wasn't--
- Stop that.

377
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,055
So. . .

378
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,268
there'll be another Mrs. Draper.

379
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,439
I guess so.

380
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,360
You'll have a family.

381
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,445
That'll be good for you.

382
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,949
I want to.

383
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,577
This will probabIy be
our last Christmas together.

384
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,079
Why?

385
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,251
You can be my cousin.

386
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,961
No.

387
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,174
This is a chance at a whole new life.

388
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,683
Thank you, Anna.

389
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,275
So, where's Don?

390
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,070
I'm sure you remember Peggy OIson.

391
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,948
She'Il be walking you through this.

392
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,950
And when Don climbs out
from under the weather--

393
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,329
Don has signed off on all of this.

394
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,083
When l was little,

395
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,335
my mother would take a twin pop

396
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,962
and break it in half

397
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,716
and give one to me
and one to my sister.

398
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,552
We were completely equal in her eyes.

399
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,012
Beloved.

400
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,055
Everyone does this with Popsicles,

401
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,474
but they may not
realize what it means.

402
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,603
It has nothing to do
with an ice cream truck

403
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,313
on a hot summer day,

404
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,439
or the flavor,

405
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,357
or the color.

406
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,611
It's a ritual.

407
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,156
You take it, break it,
share it, and love it.

408
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,412
People do do that.

409
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,086
This act of sharing,
it's what a Popsicle is.

410
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,715
It's the same treat from the freezer
as it is from the truck.

411
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,592
I don't care if it's snowing or hailing

412
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,719
or 1 00 degrees.

413
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,972
You can still take it, break it, share it,

414
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,557
and love it.

415
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,061
I like the way
she's handing out the pops.

416
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:07,649
The kids are excited, but. . .

417
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,525
the mom reminds me of something.

418
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,779
No, this is original.

419
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,076
WelI, I can tell you this now,

420
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,787
but we wanted something
with the word "love" in it.

421
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,331
When asked, the first thing
people say is,

422
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,874
"I love Popsicles."

423
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,684
Carson residence.

424
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,687
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.

425
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,856
Hello, Betty.

426
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,899
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm at my wit's end.

428
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,905
Sally-- I think she may
need priνate school.

429
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,491
How does Becky like
Rockland Country Day?

430
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,786
Well, it's a drive,
but she seems more independent.

431
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,958
I haven't seen you at the stables.

432
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,128
I saw it in the paper that Tara and Arthur
are getting married next weekend.

433
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,882
Yes, I heard that.

434
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,927
I hope they're very happy together.

435
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,433
Are you there?

436
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,106
Betty, I'm sick about it.

437
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,943
I'm sorry.

438
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,112
That's why they calI them crushes.

439
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,698
It was more than that.

440
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,367
Really?

441
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,953
I'm telling you,
I haven't been able to sleep.

442
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,122
I keep thinking about him.

443
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,585
I think Raymond knows.

444
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,545
I can't even look at Becky.

445
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,714
What did you do?

446
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,134
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.

447
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,554
You did?

448
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,722
Don't act surprised.

449
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,474
He toId me all the things
you said about me.

450
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,808
I was grateful.

451
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,311
Why would you do that?

452
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,855
What?

453
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,024
You wanted him, too. You know you did.

454
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,902
There's a difference
between wanting and having.

455
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,404
You did everything you could
to encourage me.

456
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,573
I didn't make you do anything.

457
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,241
My God, you're an awful woman,

458
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,493
you know that?

459
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,996
No one made you sleep with him!

460
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,425
I'm going to tell you this,

461
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,636
and you can tell all your little friends.

462
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,846
This is a delicate piece of machinery.

463
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,723
You don't just shove paper in it.

464
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,225
You don't bang on the buttons.

465
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,143
You don't sit on the glass.

466
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,269
If you want it to work,

467
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,563
you have to treat it with respect.

468
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
What do you want?

469
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,953
I need to speak with you.

470
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,038
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,

471
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,164
and unless you want to pull
me there in a rickshaw,

472
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,290
I have to get going.

473
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,377
WelI, I'm a copywriter.

474
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,837
Why, did l call you something else?

475
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,589
No. I don't know if you're aware,

476
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,092
but I brought in
the Popsicle account today.

477
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,135
On my own.

478
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?

479
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,556
I gotta go. Wait.

480
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,599
I need my own office.

481
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,687
It's hard to do business and be credible
when I'm sharing with a Xerox machine.

482
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,108
Freddie Rumsen's office
has been vacant for some time.

483
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,443
I think I should have it.

484
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,528
It's yours.

485
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,405
Really?

486
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,240
You young women are very aggressive.

487
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,242
I didn't mean to be impolite.

488
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,618
No, it's cute.

489
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,621
There are 30 men out there
who didn't have the balls to ask me.

490
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,790
There you are. Mr. Sterling, Miss Olson,

491
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,501
this is my fiancé, Dr. Greg Harris.

492
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,336
So you're the one who got our Joanie?

493
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,921
Yes, I am.

494
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,923
You're a lucky man.

495
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,510
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.

496
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,053
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.

497
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,140
It's a pleasure to meet you.

498
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,602
l have a dinner reservation,
and l don't think I'm going to make it.

499
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,353
Well, we do as well.

500
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,688
We're going to La Côte Basque.

501
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,482
I thought you hated French food.

502
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,108
There's a new chef.

503
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,737
Good night, Ginger.
Pleasure to meet you, Greg.

504
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,660
Let me get my purse.

505
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,040
Fix me a drink, will you?

506
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,917
I don't know.

507
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,211
Isn't that what these guys do all day?

508
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,129
I've seen the movies.

509
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,339
Pretend like I'm your boss.

510
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,592
Donald Draper.

511
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,010
Okay, one drink.

512
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,278
Dr. Harris, are you trying to examine me?

513
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,280
Maybe.

514
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,492
Not in here.

515
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,703
That Sterling guy knows
an awful lot about you.

516
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,789
I've been working here for nine years.

517
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,878
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.

518
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,386
It's okay.

519
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,887
No, l mean it.

520
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,644
Come on.

521
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,402
Greg, this isn't fun.

522
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,904
This is what you want, right?

523
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,531
Stop.

524
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,574
It's okay.

525
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,033
Greg, no!

526
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,941
Are you ready to go?

527
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,654
I don't want to miss our reservation.

528
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,323
No, of course not.

529
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,173
They're changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

530
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,759
Christopher Robin went down with Alice.

531
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,594
Very good.

532
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,137
You look well, Roger.

533
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,513
Best baby-sitter in the world.

534
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,435
So.

535
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,896
I calI to order a meeting of the partners

536
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,733
in the presence of our attorney,
Mr. Whitehouse.

537
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,193
Members attending--

538
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,903
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,

539
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,365
Roger Sterling, senior partner,

540
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,909
and Alice Cooper, secretary-treasurer.

541
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,703
And Donald Draper, absent.

542
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:23,292
We are meeting to discuss the merger
with Putnam, PowelI & Lowe,

543
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:28,047
the details of which
we've all had time to examine,

544
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,715
including Mr. Whitehouse.

545
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,258
Where's Mr. Draper?

546
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,844
Do you want me to go get
a picture of him so you can stare at it?

547
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,930
His 1 2% makes him

548
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,891
mathematically insignificant.

549
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,728
Still, l would like to know
what he thinks, wouldn't you?

550
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,647
He's very savvy.

551
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,898
Alice--

552
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,735
I'm sorry, I don't know
whose eyes to look at.

553
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,155
Where is Draper?

554
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,659
He took a business trip to California.

555
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,536
He's taking some time.

556
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,578
Marital troubles.

557
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,455
Don't write that down.

558
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,457
He stands to make over
half a million dollars.

559
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,834
Let's proceed, shall we?

560
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,019
That a '34 Sedan?

561
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,021
Mostly.

562
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,441
What'd you do to it?

563
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,277
Made some improvements.

564
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,405
It's got a '60 Nailhead,
backed up '39 LaSalle transmission,

565
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,948
and a '40 banjo rear end.

566
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,618
Two Fords and a Buick.

567
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,828
What happened here?

568
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,289
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.

569
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,457
You know anything about hot rods?

570
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
No, but I remember these.

571
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,963
I used to sell them. Used.

572
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,923
All motor, no weight.

573
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,050
How fast does it go?

574
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,345
Well, that one does
a quarter in 1 1 seconds.

575
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,431
This one's going to scare people.

576
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,518
Yeah, the color on that one,

577
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,978
I've never seen anything like it.

578
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,482
I'm Kess. That's my kid Doogie.

579
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,484
Dick.

580
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,779
The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder
of "Indian-no-place."

581
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,280
Walt. Indianapolis.

582
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,741
You guys need any help?

583
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,075
I'm looking for work.

584
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,827
Working on hot rods?

585
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,412
I don't know. Don't people buy them?

586
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,999
There's a couple of custom shops,
and they do great,

587
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,002
but l came out here to get into it,
and I'm working at a bar.

588
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,253
He's an artist.

589
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,630
He could build a car, look just like you.

590
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,508
I'd love to see you race.

591
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,842
Sunday.

592
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,344
Lions Drag Strip.

593
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,553
Long Beach.

594
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,142
I'll look into that.

595
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,367
Mr. Sterling?

596
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,868
Yea.

597
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,204
Miss Cooper?

598
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,747
Yea.

599
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,458
Bertram Cooper?

600
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,838
Yea.

601
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,676
So we'll proceed.

602
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,222
Mr. Whitehouse
will prepare a counteroffer.

603
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,849
Wonderful.

604
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,058
Meeting adjourned.

605
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,393
Well done.

606
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,521
Look who just got richer.

607
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,524
This is good for you, too.

608
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,110
You have your children to think of.

609
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,195
I just have the one.

610
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,613
Really?

611
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,347
Hello, Joan.

612
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,932
Hello.

613
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,434
Have you heard from him today?

614
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,852
No.

615
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,938
Do you think it's odd?

616
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,691
I don't think about it at all.

617
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,319
CongratuIations.

618
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,529
Thank you.

619
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,573
Your fiancé is so handsome.

620
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,949
He is.

621
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,036
He's the doctor you hope to see
but only exists in the movies.

622
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,871
Thank you.

623
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,459
He's specializing in thoracic surgery.

624
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,127
It's very difficult.

625
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,296
And he νolunteers
at Harlem Hospital Center,

626
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,964
stitching up Negro children.

627
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,925
Well, he's a keeper.

628
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:41,967
When's the wedding again?

629
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,428
Look who I found protesting in the lobby.

630
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,138
Our man from the evening news.

631
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,973
Welcome back.

632
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,976
Look at you. What's different?

633
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,520
Nothing. How was Mississippi?

634
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,606
I think we made a difference.

635
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,775
And it was the adventure of a lifetime.

636
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,402
Sheila dropped him three days into it.

637
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,572
There's a Bankers Box in the corner.

638
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,449
What the hell is this?

639
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,492
My new office.

640
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,077
What?

641
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,829
Why don't you just put on
Draper's pants while you're at it?

642
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,665
You have your own office? You?

643
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,832
I'm the head of television,

644
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,044
and I spend the day
staring at an orangutan.

645
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,588
I have some unpacking to do.

646
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,507
Has anyone heard from Don?

647
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,008
Yes. He called.

648
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,301
He wants you to get back to work.

649
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,430
I'd get a new couch if I were you!

650
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,307
Thank you!

651
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,062
Do you know who l talk to about this?

652
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,107
I'll have it taken care of.

653
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,108
Christmas.

654
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,776
I'm getting married at Christmas.

655
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,320
That's wonderful.

656
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,163
Hello?

657
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,875
Sally, can you come in here?

658
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,419
I'm in the living room.

659
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,048
Hello, Mommy.

660
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,720
I want to talk to you.

661
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,138
Okay.

662
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:22,901
I realize I haven't been
completely fair to you.

663
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,156
And if there is something you want,
I'd love to give it to you.

664
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,242
You're getting to be a big girl.

665
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:35,372
Someday you'll want something,
and l won't be able to give it to you.

666
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,714
Oh, Mommy,

667
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,174
they're beautiful.

668
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,383
Thank you.

669
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,472
You're welcome.

670
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,183
Can we go now?

671
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,479
Do you have homework?

672
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,605
Arithmetic,

673
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,690
but l can do it in the car.

674
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,113
Sally, now that you're a big girl,

675
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,282
I'm going to tell you something.

676
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,790
Your father and I are
having a disagreement,

677
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,708
and he went away.

678
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,253
Where did he go?

679
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,049
I'm not sure.

680
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,760
When is he coming home?

681
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,598
I don't know.

682
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,810
I know it's hard to understand.

683
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:42,731
But I promise,
everything's going to be okay.

684
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:43,982
Okay.

685
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,739
Mommy, you're bleeding.

686
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,452
Go take those in the kitchen
and have a snack.

687
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,038
I'm going to change.

688
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,883
That's an ink blot.

689
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:10,968
You see what you want to see.

690
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,304
You don't have to pick them.
Just put your palm on the deck.

691
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,251
Did you read it?

692
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,503
I did.

693
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,214
Reminded me of New York.

694
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,674
And it made me worry about you.

695
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,930
What about the cards?

696
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,600
Should I be worried?

697
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,144
It's all here.

698
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,855
You're definitely in a strange place.

699
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,815
But here is the sun.

700
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,737
That can't be good.

701
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,030
It is.

702
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,073
It's the end of the world.

703
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,075
It's the resurrection.

704
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,120
Do you want to know
what this means or not?

705
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,914
No, l don't.

706
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,177
I can smell the ocean.

707
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,929
This is the one.

708
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,306
Who's she?

709
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,101
She's the soul of the world.

710
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,646
She's in a very important spot here.

711
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,024
This is you,
what you are bringing to the reading.

712
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,611
She says you are part of the world.

713
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,196
Air, water.

714
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,908
Every living thing is connected to you.

715
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,329
It's a nice thought.

716
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,039
It is.

717
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,917
What does it mean?

718
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:12,089
It means the only thing keeping you
from being happy

719
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,383
is the belief that you are alone.

720
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,641
What if that's true?

721
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,436
Then you can change.

722
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,148
People don't change.

723
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,697
I think she stands for wisdom.

724
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,616
As you live, you learn things.

725
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,346
Come in.

726
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,475
Hello.

727
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,561
Look at you, celebrating.

728
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,521
You getting a secretary?

729
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,231
Yes.

730
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,650
Well, she's in for it.

731
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,904
You should get some pictures in here

732
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,533
of your family
or some people or something.

733
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,536
I want to put up my campaigns.

734
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,038
Isn't that Freddie's bar?

735
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,289
He left it.

736
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,458
How the hell did you swing this?

737
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,252
I'm sleeping with Don.

738
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,920
It's really working out.

739
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,510
I haven't told anyone

740
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,804
because it's probably
a formality at this point,

741
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,640
but Clearasil's pulled out.

742
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,559
How did that happen?

743
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,811
Sales have been great.

744
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,313
What about your father-in-law?

745
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,107
I guess I'm not doing my job.

746
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,984
I know that's not true.

747
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,154
Don'll dance on my grave,
if he ever comes back.

748
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,867
Did something happen in Los Angeles?

749
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,163
Yes.

750
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,998
He disappeared .

751
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,291
He didn't even check out.

752
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,251
I almost called the police.

753
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,253
Well, why didn't you?
Maybe something happened.

754
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,423
Well, it didn't surprise me.

755
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,883
I know some things about him.

756
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,719
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.

757
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:27,349
All I'm saying is
he may not be coming back.

758
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,226
He's done it before.

759
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,689
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,

760
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,025
I am sure it's with good reason.

761
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,741
Guess I should probably go home.

762
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,539
CongratuIations.

763
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,209
Good night.

764
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,401
