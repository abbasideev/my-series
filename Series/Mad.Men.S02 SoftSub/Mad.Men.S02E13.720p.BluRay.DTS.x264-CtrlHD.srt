1
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,596
Mrs. Draper, sorry about the chill in here,

2
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,890
but my wife took the oil heater upstairs.

3
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm fine.

4
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,185
So, as I thought last week,

5
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,813
the spotting was not caused
by your horseback riding,

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,524
but rather, as I suspected,

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,067
you're going to have another baby.

8
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,447
Really?

9
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,906
Well, we've been here before.

10
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,200
You'll have to start
eating right, sleeping,

11
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,827
avoid strenuous activity,

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,120
no riding.

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,872
Just take it easy.

14
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,499
That's what husbands are for.

15
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,835
I can't believe this.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,045
I understand this was a surprise,

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,923
but blessings come that way.

18
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,092
Of course.

19
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:38,014
I'll need you to undress
so I can examine you.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,020
Dr. Aldridge, are you sure?

21
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,565
Are you concerned
about your appearance?

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,360
You've been blessed
with a very resilient figure.

23
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:56,199
Dr. Aldridge, I can't
have a baby right now.

24
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:05,625
Mrs. Draper, if we're having
the conversation I think we're having,

25
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,045
there are alternatives, obviously.

26
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,965
But l find it hard to believe that,

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,383
as a married woman of means,

28
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,677
you would even be considering that.

29
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:22,266
That is an option for young girls
who have no other options.

30
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,980
I guarantee,

31
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,025
the minute you tell your husband,
your friends,

32
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,653
you'Il stop worrying.

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,530
Get in the swing of things.

34
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,575
Let's see if I can wrestle
that heater from Charlene.

35
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,016
With love from Ken Cosgrove
and Pete Campbell.

36
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,142
Why'd you need it today?

37
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,020
Cooper wanted the ad
revenue projections early.

38
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,355
Why?

39
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,858
Great. CIearasil is missing.

40
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,109
Honestly, I don't know.

41
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,027
You don't think it's anything to do

42
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,029
with Draper being AWOL
in California, do you?

43
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,948
No, I figured that out.

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,993
Campbell says there's
an aerospace gold rush.

45
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,452
I bet Draper's landing a big one.

46
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,081
I haven't heard anything.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,918
Or he's breaking off,
opening his own shop in L.A.

48
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,047
Or he's finding a good spot
for Sterling Cooper West.

49
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,049
I'd love to go to California.

50
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,259
I could get a convertible.

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,971
Whatever it is, they're evaluating us.

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,639
If Kennedy's speech goes past 8:30--

53
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,183
that's Lucy and then Danny Thomas
and then Andy Griffith--

54
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,394
I'll take it in the shorts.

55
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,147
Why am I sick to my stomach?

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,071
Good. You're here.

57
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,116
I'm waiting on a call
from North American Aviation.

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,701
It's 1 0:00 there.

59
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,077
They should just be getting into work.

60
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,080
I was just wondering if you told anybody
about Clearasil yet.

61
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,083
I guess it must have slipped my mind .

62
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,919
I don't know what's going on,
but Harry said

63
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,004
there's some kind of
emergency accounting.

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,089
Everybody had to turn in
their numbers early.

65
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,969
What am I gonna say to Duck?

66
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,096
That my father-in-law hates me?

67
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,099
Pete, just tell the truth.

68
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,559
Don't worry about the outcome.

69
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,478
People respect that.

70
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,189
Thank you.

71
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,152
I don't want you blaming Creative.

72
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,188
How long have you been here?

73
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,024
Half an hour.

74
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,359
I didn't want to bother you.

75
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,153
Where have you been?

76
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,947
You disappeared.

77
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,159
I had to have some time
to think about things.

78
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,037
Must be nice.

79
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,581
Needing time and just taking it,

80
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,500
all on your own terms,

81
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,168
not wondering what anybody thinks--

82
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,420
me, the children--

83
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,879
Bets.

84
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,385
I'd do anything I could
to undo what happened.

85
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,931
What happened?

86
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,394
I was not respectful to you.

87
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,027
WelI, now l know I'm not crazy.

88
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,695
That heIps.

89
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,365
I can't walk away from this.

90
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,411
I want to be with you.

91
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,747
I want to be together again.

92
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,208
I don't know.

93
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,210
Honestly, things haven't been

94
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,795
that different without you.

95
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,928
I need to see the kids.

96
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,141
I can't deal with this right now, Don.

97
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,225
I'll call.

98
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,102
We'll make arrangements.

99
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,321
Thank you for seeing me.

100
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,239
What's your poison?

101
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,574
I don't know.

102
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,576
It's okay, Campbell.

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,328
Whatever you're having.

104
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,795
Sit down.

105
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,555
Clearasil is pulling out.

106
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,557
Sales are strong, Creative is strong,

107
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,727
but we are not suited
for business together.

108
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,313
Your father-in-law.

109
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,190
Yes.

110
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,567
That's a sticky wicket.

111
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,444
Indeed.

112
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,571
I'm working on something to replace it.

113
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,284
Campbell, I'm counting
on your discretion here.

114
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,287
Okay.

115
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,748
The British agency
Putnam, Powell & Lowe

116
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,292
is taking a controlling share
of Sterling Cooper.

117
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,546
Clearasil is in conflict
with Lever Brothers.

118
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,630
We're merging--

119
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,299
well, being merged with.

120
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,219
Your loyalty and enthusiasm
during the American Airlines thing

121
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,387
showed real character.

122
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,931
Thank you.

123
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,475
I'd like you to replace me
as head of Accounts.

124
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,104
I'm trusting you with this information

125
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,313
because I am going
to be the president

126
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,731
of the new Sterling Cooper.

127
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,571
CongratuIations.

128
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,489
CongratuIations to you.

129
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,744
I don't know what to say.

130
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,331
You say "Thank you,"
and then you don't say anything.

131
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,584
Such news has to be
broken in the right way.

132
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,838
Is Don on board with my promotion?

133
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,173
I'm the president.

134
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,341
I don't need his permission, do I?

135
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,426
Right.

136
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,344
If Don shows up, he'll fall in line.

137
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,346
He'll have to,
or find another profession.

138
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:39,393
That's why God put
non-compete clauses in contracts.

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,478
Well. . .

140
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,563
thank you.

141
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,238
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

142
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,325
This government, as promised,

143
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,578
has maintained the closest surveillance

144
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,498
of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.

145
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,376
Within the past week,

146
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,546
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

147
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,758
that a series of offensive missile sites

148
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,093
is now in preparation

149
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,387
on that imprisoned island.

150
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,974
The purpose of these bases
can be none other

151
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,186
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability

152
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,438
against the Western Hemisphere.

153
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,067
Upon receiving the first
preliminary hard information

154
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,693
of this nature,

155
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,613
last Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m. ,

156
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,116
I directed that our
surveillance be stepped up.

157
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,534
And having now confirmed. . .

158
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,953
. . .the Soviet Union

159
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,789
for supplying Cuba in this
new military buildup

160
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,417
and asked Russia to stop
arming Castro's Cuba.

161
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,128
The President did not order
a direct military action. . .

162
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,129
Welcome back.

163
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,422
Hildy.

164
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,465
. . .if we are prepared

165
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,967
to sink Russian ships carrying. . .

166
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,260
. . .Eastern Daylight Time,

167
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,719
the Armed Forces of the United States

168
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,264
are under instructions to stop. . .

169
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,724
Mr. Draper, you're
a sight for sore eyes.

170
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,143
Hello, Joan. lt's good to be back.

171
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,353
How are you?

172
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,689
Like everyone eIse today,
very distracted.

173
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,148
Don.

174
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,441
Hello, Peggy.

175
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,152
You look well. How was California?

176
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,529
Sunny.

177
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,197
Do l work for you now?

178
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,241
I hope it's okay.

179
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,909
Mr. Sterling gave me
permission to switch.

180
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
I landed the Popsicle account.

181
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,791
So, other than her office and haircut,

182
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,376
is there anything new
I need to know about?

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,044
After you.

184
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,971
The world continues without us.

185
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,473
There's no reason to take it personally.

186
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,143
Do you want to know
if you've been missed?

187
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,979
That's half your correspondence.

188
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,733
Mr. Sterling has been very anxious
to speak to you on a daily basis,

189
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,484
and Mr. Phillips, of course.

190
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,528
I'll need the copywriters
and Sal in here

191
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,113
to get me up to speed.

192
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,489
Call Roger in a half an hour

193
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,158
and tell him l'll meet him
in a half an hour.

194
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,243
And Mr. Phillips--

195
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,911
maybe I'll run into him
in the men's room.

196
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,496
I sent your paychecks home.

197
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,498
I assume you've spoken to Mrs. Draper.

198
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,375
Did she call?

199
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,294
Not today.

200
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,589
I think that's enough to start.

201
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,429
We have a safety protocol
for Civil Defense.

202
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,930
I don't want to start a panic,

203
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,058
but I think people
have the right to know.

204
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,518
Trust me. I don't think
there'll be a point

205
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,605
in taking those stairs
or diving under a desk.

206
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,775
So, you're back.

207
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
What happened?

208
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,533
One minute I'm standing
next to you in the carport,

209
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,911
and the next I'm tap dancing
for General Dynamics.

210
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,580
Sorry I missed that.

211
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,415
I can't drive, Don.

212
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,875
It's amazing I made any meetings at all.

213
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,085
But you did.

214
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,544
Of course I did.

215
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,670
Did you ever think I'd left you there

216
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,089
because I thought
you could handle it?

217
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,134
How did it go?

218
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,805
I'm this close
to North American Aviation.

219
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,723
Then I was right, wasn't I?

220
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,142
You handled it.

221
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,727
Good work.

222
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,109
I know you want everything
the minute you want it.

223
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,653
Sometimes it's better
to wait until you're ready.

224
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,489
So you think I'm ready?

225
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,824
Yes.

226
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,617
You proved it.

227
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,373
Now I have to play
a little catch-up ball.

228
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,333
Of course.

229
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,002
Welcome back, Don.

230
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,811
You wanted to see me?

231
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,938
About three weeks ago.

232
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,607
Hope you were looking
for a job in California,

233
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,609
because you're going to need one.

234
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,071
l'll stack my absences
up against yours any day.

235
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,407
You can't just do that.

236
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,075
It was important.

237
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,786
And from what I can see,
the walls are still standing.

238
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,787
They are.

239
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,706
But we sold them

240
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,250
and the rest of the company
to Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

241
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,877
What?

242
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,128
It's done.

243
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,589
They're coming in Friday
to discuss strategy,

244
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,340
management structure, and logistics.

245
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,135
You'Il find one of these
buried in a stack of crap on your desk.

246
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,638
So how much?

247
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,600
You'll clear a little
over half a million dollars.

248
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,729
Best vacation you ever took.

249
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,816
Look who suddenly
has nothing to say.

250
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,945
Duck put it together.

251
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,656
Ran into them in a bar or something.

252
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,700
Duck was in a bar?

253
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,369
He doesn't have a wife.

254
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,205
Any conflicts?

255
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,291
WelI, Mona hasn't been pleasant
since my engagement.

256
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,543
No. With the deal.

257
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,629
But congratulations.

258
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,838
Thank you.

259
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,635
Very few conflicts.

260
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,178
Coop and Alice jumped on it.

261
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
I wasn't going to make trouble.

262
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,725
WelI, now you can go
back to your office

263
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,769
and figure out
how much l made on this.

264
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,439
I guess so.

265
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,654
Kennedy's daring them to bomb us,

266
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,281
right when I got a second chance.

267
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,992
We don't know what's really going on.

268
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,577
You know that.

269
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,501
As Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro

270
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,588
push our leadership towards
the threat of nuclear war,

271
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,383
it is tempting to be angry.

272
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,718
But I urge all of you to remember

273
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,471
that even on the cross

274
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,974
Jesus forgave his transgressors.

275
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,770
And although we cannot control
these frightening events,

276
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,024
let us take charge of our own souls,

277
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,610
and let us prepare ourselνes

278
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,905
for the most important
summit meeting of all.

279
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,826
And so we pray.

280
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,790
We are all sinners, every one of us,

281
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:22,004
but at least give us the courage

282
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,548
and the common sense

283
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,758
to admit it,

284
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,761
to confess it,

285
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,847
and to repair it.

286
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,475
And give us the assurance

287
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,647
that when this temporary
life on earth ends,

288
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,775
we will be welcomed
back into your arms

289
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,903
in your heavenly kingdom.

290
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,655
Amen.

291
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,715
She's awfully quiet.

292
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,426
I think I know what that's about.

293
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,678
She's terrified like the rest of us.

294
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,222
I think she's being smug
because she has a bomb shelter.

295
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,267
Really? I don't even like to go
in the subway.

296
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,685
There's no air.

297
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,812
I prefer you stop talking about this.

298
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,814
You're upsetting my daughter.

299
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,609
WelI, The Times says you should teIl
your children the truth.

300
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,736
You tell your children.

301
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,698
Carlton says he heard
the market crashed

302
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,867
because there are Russian
troops off Key West.

303
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,369
They're closing the lnterstate.

304
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,828
They can't do that.

305
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,580
Marie, l'm about to leave.

306
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,832
I'm done, okay?

307
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,837
It's nice to feel the warmth
of the community in a time of crisis.

308
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,924
Mrs. Draper, I'll be with you in a minute.

309
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,929
I wish we had a shelter
so I could slam the door in her face.

310
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,225
Betty, you're wan.

311
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,603
Do you want a MiItown?

312
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,980
It's the only thing that's keeping me
from chewing my nails off.

313
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,732
No.

314
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm pregnant.

315
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,330
CongratuIations?

316
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,377
Jessica was an accident.

317
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,546
Look how happy I am now.

318
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,048
It's not a good time.

319
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,758
But is it ever?

320
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,969
Look at this world we live in.

321
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,974
I can't do it.

322
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,894
What am I going to do?

323
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,605
WelI, what can you do?

324
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,234
I don't think you understand.

325
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,070
It's not a good time.

326
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,575
Are you serious?

327
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,411
Yes.

328
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:04,082
There's a doctor in Albany.

329
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,043
If you go to Puerto Rico,
they do it in a hospital.

330
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,588
Of course you don't want
to go down there right now.

331
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,173
No.

332
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,385
Sometimes the best thing

333
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,013
is just to do nothing and wait.

334
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,558
Mrs. Draper, I'm ready for you.

335
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,938
I'll come by and check on you.

336
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,025
No, I'm fine. You're probabIy right.

337
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,913
What are you doing in here?

338
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,039
And where's Virginia?

339
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,248
The Soviets fired on us,

340
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,209
or we fired on them
or something. Fix it.

341
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,252
I came in to get away
from this speculation.

342
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,968
Damn it. You see what you did?

343
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,971
I hope the Soviets got a guy like you
to build those missiles.

344
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,890
Everyone's looking
at each other in the street.

345
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,476
They're looking at you
because you've got Castro's beard.

346
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,105
Now they want a list of people
in all the departments.

347
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,983
So? That's you and Danny Lindstrom.

348
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,527
They're counting all the money.

349
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,111
They're counting all the peopIe.

350
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,947
You said this was about an L.A. office.

351
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,990
You told us it wasn't bad.

352
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,493
Someone knows what's going on.

353
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,578
I swear, if it wasn't important,

354
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,913
I wouldn't have asked.

355
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,043
We're doing what we can.

356
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,295
The phone company's
completely overloaded.

357
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,007
Actually, Lois,
this is more of a security issue.

358
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,468
Certain calls may have been made

359
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,012
using the code words "Los Angeles."

360
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,347
Lois, have you heard anything

361
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
about them opening
a West Coast office?

362
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,143
You know I'm not allowed
to talk about what I hear in there.

363
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,687
You can tell us.

364
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,063
It's not going to hurt you .

365
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,566
We'll really owe you.

366
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,610
Well. . .

367
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,659
Have you ever heard
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe?

368
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,244
London?

369
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,371
Yes. Trans-Atlantic.

370
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:11,001
Mr. Phillips has made a deal
for them to buy Sterling Cooper.

371
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,212
No.

372
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,297
No!

373
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,883
It's done.
They take the keys Friday.

374
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,843
Are they purchasing
Sterling Cooper,

375
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,221
or are they combining with them?

376
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,725
It's a merger.

377
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,727
From what we could put together,

378
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,312
they want a New York office,

379
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,731
and they want it filled with us,

380
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:38,069
but there's definitely
going to be some. . .

381
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,155
redundancies.

382
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,704
Thank you.

383
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,997
Wait a minute.

384
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,166
If any of you gets to stay,

385
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,502
one of you has to take me
off the switchboard.

386
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,338
Yeah. Of course.

387
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,881
If.

388
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,263
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

389
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,560
We missed you.

390
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,895
I missed you, too.

391
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,151
I like your hotel room.

392
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,029
There's a rollaway
there for you, Bobby.

393
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,449
We can go to the movies
or Chinese food.

394
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,534
I want you to behave yourselves,

395
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,744
and brush your teeth.

396
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,080
Do you want to join us?

397
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,206
Mommy doesn't like to eat.

398
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,542
No, l haνe plans.

399
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,462
Do you want to pick them up
in my office tomorrow?

400
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
No, drop them off in the morning.

401
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:42,467
I'm going riding. Carla will be there.

402
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,803
Okay.

403
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,847
Good night.

404
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,141
Good night, Mommy.

405
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,317
Can we order room service?

406
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,202
How can I heIp you?

407
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,829
Can l get a glass of water?

408
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,289
Sure.

409
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,046
What else?

410
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,549
I don't know.

411
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,634
A gimlet.

412
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,066
Thank you.

413
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,444
The gentleman's taken care of it.

414
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,492
Tell him l said thank you.

415
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,077
I will,

416
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,662
but it means he's going
to come talk to you.

417
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,248
We'll see about that.

418
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,565
I think this is the place to be tonight.

419
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,901
I waIked through Times Square.

420
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,069
Empty.

421
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,489
Doesn't seem real, does it?

422
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,741
That's true.

423
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,285
You don't look worried.

424
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,996
I'm trying not to think about it.

425
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,375
To not thinking about things.

426
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,964
What's your name?

427
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,010
Thank you so much for the drink.

428
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,763
I'd just like to enjoy it,
if you don't mind.

429
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,308
No. Of course.

430
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,102
Nice meeting you.

431
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
. . .degrees for New York City.

432
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,313
Cloudy skies.

433
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,315
Further action of an unspecified nature

434
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,608
is being considered to deal

435
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,319
with the continuing
Soviet missile buildup in Cuba.

436
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,697
That statement from
Department Press Officer Lincoln White,

437
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,699
a revelation
that construction of missile sites

438
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,825
is continuing.

439
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,912
It's delicious.

440
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,289
You're crazy.

441
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,040
Can l have a milk shake?

442
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,333
What's wrong with root beer?

443
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,585
Daddy?

444
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,547
It'll take 45 minutes, you know.

445
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,841
Daddy, knock-knock.

446
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,842
Who's there?

447
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,343
Dwayne.

448
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,428
Dwayne who?

449
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,140
Dwayne the bathtub.
Mama, I'm dwowning.

450
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,517
Can we watch TV?

451
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,107
Can you watch these for me, please?

452
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,301
What are you doing here?

453
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,099
I'm waiting.

454
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,521
I'm married.

455
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,997
I was just about ready
to come by and pick you up.

456
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,500
I know, Wally, and I'm sick about it.

457
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,085
I could just die.

458
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,047
Yeah, well, before you go
and do something like that,

459
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,923
I got an idea.

460
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,426
What if I got Beaver to call your sister

461
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,511
and see if he could
talk her into going?

462
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,349
Say, maybe that would work.

463
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,354
So what is your name?

464
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,818
What are you doing in there?

465
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,078
We were just about to close.

466
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,538
Anita wanted to come,
but she's with the children.

467
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,540
That's where she should be.

468
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,292
My mother baked.

469
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,960
Thought we'd all
appreciate something fresh

470
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,545
if we get stuck in here.

471
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,090
And how are you?

472
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,633
I don't know.

473
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,677
Nuclear war.

474
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,554
We could be gone tomorrow.

475
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,350
WelI, isn't that always the case?

476
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,561
That's true.

477
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,564
You believe in God.

478
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,733
I've seen that in you
from the moment we met.

479
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,074
Sometimes I feel

480
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,078
he calIed me to this parish
to reach you.

481
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,124
No. I didn't know that.

482
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,584
Well, it's true.

483
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,130
Hell is serious and very real,

484
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,840
and unless you unburden yourself,

485
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,174
you cannot know peace.

486
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,344
I understand that, Father,

487
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,596
but you're upsetting me right now.

488
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,224
That is your guilt, Peggy.

489
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,769
All that God wants is for you
to reconcile with him.

490
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,147
Don't you understand

491
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,857
that this could be the end of the world

492
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,316
and you could go to hell?

493
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,946
I can't believe that's the way God is.

494
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,118
Good night, Father.

495
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,419
Really? The silver?

496
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,379
There could be Iooting.

497
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,672
A mob is going to come

498
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,883
to the 1 4th floor
of this apartment building?

499
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,802
I wish you would come with me right now.

500
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,638
What if something happens?

501
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,683
Rehoboth Beach
is 90 minutes from D.C.

502
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,644
You don't understand these bombs.

503
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:58,272
Your parents' deck chairs
will be on Fifth Avenue.

504
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,775
Are you trying to make me more upset?

505
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,737
lf for some reason
the train doesn't work,

506
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,614
just take a few hundred
dollars in cash

507
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,449
and pay someone to drive you.

508
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,701
This is ridiculous.

509
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,496
If I'm going to die,
I want to die in Manhattan.

510
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,706
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.

511
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,958
There's no difference, Trudy.

512
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,125
And I want to be here,

513
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,710
and you want to be with your parents.

514
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,712
Why do you always
make it about that?

515
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,340
And yes, l love my parents,
and they love me.

516
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,841
Do you?

517
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,511
If you did, you'd want to be with me.

518
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,597
You're right.

519
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,483
I'll help you pack the car.

520
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,322
The first Russian ship
that proceeded through the area

521
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,741
patrolled by our Navy forces. . .

522
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,743
Bad news.

523
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,828
What?

524
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,913
The conference room's signed out all day.

525
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,748
And I checked the fridge.

526
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,750
There's canapés, really good ones.

527
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,753
They shampooed
the carpets last night.

528
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:03,838
Campbell.

529
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,300
PPL's coming in today.

530
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,884
You told me she told you that.

531
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,761
You're not worried?
Why'd you come in?

532
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,887
I don't know.

533
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,931
I'm just waiting to see what happens.

534
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,808
I talked to my father-in-law about it.

535
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,060
Regime change is always tricky.

536
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,854
You want to stay neutral.

537
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,981
The loyalists are always hung,

538
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,066
and you don't want to get
caught in the fallout.

539
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,527
What's wrong with you?

540
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,446
Aren't you loyal to anyone?

541
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,406
They don't care about us.

542
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,366
We're just a bunch
of salaries on a ledger.

543
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,785
They'll draw a line
and get rid of everything below it.

544
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,705
I like this company the way it is.

545
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,467
Have a minute?

546
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,927
From the look of this,
that might be all I have.

547
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,888
May l?

548
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,813
I'm coming to you anonymously, Don.

549
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,815
I know something
I think you should know.

550
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,360
What?

551
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,570
I know about the merger,

552
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:13,866
and l know that Duck Phillips
is going to be the president.

553
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,494
How do you know that?

554
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,663
He told me.

555
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,706
Why would he do that?

556
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,917
Picking sides, I guess.

557
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,712
Why are you telling me this?

558
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,173
I don't know.

559
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,467
I just thought if I was you,

560
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,511
I would want to know.

561
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,139
Thank you.

562
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,399
You know they stopped
a ship this morning.

563
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,779
I bet the Russians are reconsidering,
now that we made a stand.

564
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:09,922
Carla, what's this?

565
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,549
That's from Mr. Draper.

566
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,644
"Dear Betty,

567
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,020
"l'm sitting in the Roosevelt

568
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,897
"looking at the backs
of Bobby and Sally's heads

569
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,108
"as they watch TV.

570
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,193
"l'm not letting them
change the channel

571
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,903
"because watching
the news makes me sick,

572
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,989
"and they can see it.

573
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,910
"I think about you
and how I behaved

574
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,912
"and my regret.

575
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,915
"I know it's my fault
you are not here right now.

576
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,251
"l understand why you feel

577
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,919
"it's better to go on without me,

578
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,923
"and I know that you won't
be alone for very long,

579
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:58,053
"but without you
I'll be alone forever.

580
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,765
"l love you.

581
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,849
Don."

582
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,108
Gentlemen, now that we've done
haggling over the dowry,

583
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,320
it's time to slip into the tent
and spend a night with the bride.

584
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:22,286
We imagine that Sterling Cooper
will remain somewhat autonomous.

585
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,746
You bought us.

586
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,498
We don't expect autonomy,

587
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:31,003
but who's going to be minding the store
when you all fly back to England?

588
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,963
Since we've worked with him before

589
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,965
and he knows both companies,

590
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,219
Duck Phillips will be
President of Sterling Cooper.

591
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,554
My goodness.

592
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,723
Obviously, I accept.

593
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,893
That makes sense.

594
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,895
CongratuIations.

595
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,440
Well, I promise, in spite of this title,

596
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,818
I will treat the founders
of Sterling Cooper

597
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,694
with the respect they deserve.

598
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,822
Duck, it has now become your meeting.

599
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,865
Tell us what you see.

600
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,370
I find myself a little unprepared here,

601
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,913
but I know this.

602
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,707
I'd like to bring this company
into financial maturity.

603
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,001
The last two years,
we've been held back.

604
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,878
Good Creative is important,

605
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,964
but it can't be running the show.

606
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,008
Our business is about
buying time and space,

607
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,927
and right now that means television.

608
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,763
The bigger we are,
the cheaper we can get it.

609
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:26,767
I don't think l heard
the word "client" once.

610
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,019
Well, Bert,
when the economy is good,

611
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,312
people buy things,

612
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,022
and when it's bad, they don't.

613
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:36,485
There's no reason for us to be tied
to Creative's fantasies of persuasion.

614
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,741
It certainly is an ambitious way
of thinking about things.

615
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,371
What?

616
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,540
I think it sounds like a great agency,

617
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,668
and I think Duck is the man to run it.

618
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,546
I just don't think I'll be a part of it.

619
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,717
You don't want to be a part of it?

620
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,177
If this is the agency you want,

621
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,054
Duck is the man for the job.

622
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,807
This is what I'm talking about.

623
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,392
Artistic temperament.

624
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,728
Don, is this really necessary?

625
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,937
It is.

626
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,063
Because he loves this room

627
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,982
and hearing his own voice
and saving the day.

628
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,484
Except this time,
he's got to get with the team.

629
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,987
Don, you can either honor your contract

630
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,698
or walk out that door with nothing
and start selling insurance.

631
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,994
I don't have a contract.

632
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,997
We're close.

633
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,790
We didn't think we needed one.

634
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,587
Gentlemen.

635
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,634
I selI products, not advertising.

636
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,388
I can't see as far into the future as Duck,

637
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:50,684
but if the world is still here on Monday,

638
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,186
we can talk.

639
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,107
Don, hold on.

640
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:02,863
Let him go.

641
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,406
It'll take a second to find some kid

642
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,784
who can write a prose poem
to a potato chip.

643
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,118
Calm down.

644
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,328
Let him throw his tantrum.

645
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,038
The man disappeared
for three damn weeks,

646
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,540
and l put this deal together.

647
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,292
What more do you need to know?

648
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,215
Duck, would you
excuse us for a minute?

649
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,220
Of course.

650
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,067
This doesn't affect the merger, does it?

651
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,902
No.

652
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,905
He never could hold his liquor.

653
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,326
Mr. Draper, your wife called.

654
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,953
She wants you to come home.

655
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,832
You should go home as well.

656
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,667
I can't even think right now.

657
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,253
Greg says they put St. Luke's on alert.

658
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,266
Your bag.

659
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,726
I don't need it.

660
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,186
Good night.

661
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,521
. . .this correspondent

662
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,189
that there is more
firepower now in Cuba

663
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,275
than at any time during World War. . .

664
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,206
Why are you smiling?

665
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,250
Because you're still here.

666
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,210
I was hoping
the train would be empty.

667
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,588
Have a drink with me.

668
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,506
Okay.

669
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,103
Why are you still here?
Trudy must be worried.

670
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,981
What is it with you?

671
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,232
What?

672
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,528
You never let me talk
about what I want to talk about.

673
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,909
What do you want to talk about?

674
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:15,329
About what you said about the truth.

675
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,415
Can l tell you the truth?

676
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,793
Why wouldn't you?

677
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,212
You make it so hard.

678
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,172
What are you talking about?

679
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,342
You.

680
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,349
I've been thinking
about everything that's going on.

681
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,228
And I thought. . .

682
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,522
who'd care if I was gone?

683
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,524
I mean, Trudy would care,

684
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,359
but she doesn't know me.

685
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,821
But you do.

686
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,282
And I know you.

687
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,079
And I think you're perfect.

688
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,291
I'm not perfect, Pete.

689
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,377
Yes, you are.

690
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,673
And I wish l had picked you then.

691
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,218
Pete.

692
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,517
I love you.

693
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,602
And I want to be with you.

694
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,234
What?

695
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,404
Didn't you know that?

696
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,036
Pete,

697
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:43,417
I could have had you in my life forever
if I wanted to.

698
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,337
What do you mean?

699
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,216
I could have had you.

700
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,428
I could have shamed you
into being with me.

701
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,724
But I didn't want to.

702
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,228
I don't understand.

703
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,446
You got me pregnant.

704
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,868
I had a baby,

705
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,828
and l gave it away.

706
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,915
What?

707
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,295
I had your baby,

708
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,465
and l gave it away.

709
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,344
Are you serious?

710
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,352
You can't be serious.

711
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:47,481
I wanted other things.

712
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,734
I don't understand.

713
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,407
Well,

714
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,411
one day you're there. . .

715
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,082
and then, all of a sudden. . .

716
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,252
there's less of you,

717
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,921
and you wonder

718
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,633
where that part went,

719
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:19,429
if it's living somewhere outside of you.

720
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,894
And you keep thinking. . .

721
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,397
maybe you'll get it back.

722
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:36,238
And then you realize. . .

723
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,533
it's just gone.

724
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,871
Why would you tell me that?

725
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,669
I'm sorry, Pete.

726

730
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,505
set out to intercept the Marucla.

731
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:21,468
