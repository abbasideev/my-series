1
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,399
It's smooth, it's brown.

2
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,638
Now, Sinatra drinks it.
Why shouldn't you?

3
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,842
This bulging?

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,418
No.

5
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,510
Can you get somebody to clean up
the loose chips on the bar?

6
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,146
It's messy. And if I decide
I want to spill some during the bit,

7
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:00,885
it's not going to be funny
if there's already some there.

8
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,255
Going again.

9
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,295
Rolling. Sound, speed.

10
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,695
"Utz Are Better Than Nuts"
bar scene, take 6.

11
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,293
Action.

12
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,070
Imagine my horror when
a night on the town turned ugly.

13
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,232
This is a nice place for nice people,

14
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,709
and the jerk behind the bar,
he throws a bowl of nuts at me.

15
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,904
What am I, a squirrel?

16
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,647
Well, lucky for him,
I bring my own wherever I go.

17
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,912
Am I crazy? I don't think so.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,784
Just you try and stick your face
into a can of nuts.

19
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:33,984
Take it from a nut.

20
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,651
Utz are better than nuts.

21
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,331
Don't cut. No. I want to do that again.

22
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,028
Roll the camera over that way 5 feet
and come in around the lapels.

23
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,597
Quiet, please.

24
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,334
Still rolling.

25
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,104
Just try sticking your face
into a can of nuts.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,417
Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,

27
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,852
watching as the great airship Hindenburg

28
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:06,117
attempts to tie off its mooring mast and...

29
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,352
Oh, my God!
She suddenly burst into flames!

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,951
Oh, God! Look at the size of it!

31
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,758
It's horrible! Oh, the humanity!

32
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,526
Hey, get Sitting Bull on the phone.

33
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,101
We found the last buffalo.

34
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,699
Hey, get a wider lens, right?

35
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,067
We want to shoot her in CinemaFat.

36
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,232
Hey, Jimmy, what do you say
we take a little break?

37
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,809
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

38
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,242
I want to see if Gepetto's
building a fire in there.

39
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,110
That man is an animal.

40
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,276
Jesus, Jimmy.

41
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,821
Just for your information,
this guy's laughing over here.

42
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,071
Are you going right home?

43
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,408
No.

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,842
I have marketing.

45
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,072
I have to pick up Don's watch.

46
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,547
- You bought Don a watch?
- I got it repaired.

47
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,277
He was bathing the kids with it.

48
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:08,285
I've been looking for one for Raymond.

49
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,254
- We're coming up on 10, you know.
- 10?

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,190
Poor man has to think of something
for the girl who has everything.

51
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,284
Did you make any suggestions?

52
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,226
I do love your car.

53
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,093
That's not romantic.

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,635
Did you hear the part
where I said 10 years?

55
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,727
I shouldn't be saying that.

56
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,504
He looks like a little boy.

57
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,872
I guess.

58
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:36,345
He reminds me of Monty Clift
in A Place in the Sun,

59
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,907
learning how to ride so he can
worm his way into the upper crust.

60
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,647
Somewhere there's a pregnant girl
floating in a lake.

61
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,656
I'm from the South.
There are such people.

62
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,460
I think he needs a different horse.

63
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,964
He's on the worst one we have.

64
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,124
I apologize.

65
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,862
I knew it would be a challenge,
or I would have done it myself.

66
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,131
Thank you, Gertie.

67
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,072
You have to admit... he is handsome.

68
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,167
He's got that going for him.

69
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:08,109
Shall we?

70
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,674
I have to get my purse.

71
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,148
No. You're not going anywhere.

72
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,446
We have to meet her.

73
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,987
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,

74
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,954
this is Tara Montague, my fiancée.

75
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,889
Sarah Beth Carson.

76
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:21,982
Betty Draper.

77
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,994
You must be the ladies he rides with.

78
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,961
We're among them.

79
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,295
Artie, are you the rooster around here?

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,334
I think they make fun of me.

81
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,837
We don't. That would be cruel.

82
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,567
Well, I've done plenty of things for him.

83
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:39,235
And I'd love to continue doing so.

84
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,177
Pleased to meet you.

85
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,709
She's pretty.

86
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,287
Very pretty.

87
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,049
Prettier than I expected.

88
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,591
I think she's about right.

89
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,189
I spend too much time here.

90
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,161
I actually dreamt about him.

91
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,755
I think it was him,

92
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,731
or a version of him that could ride.

93
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,326
I'll see you Saturday.

94
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,701
No. You'll have him to yourself on Saturday.

95
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,798
Becky has a dance recital.

96
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,434
It's so horrible to put
girls that fat in a leotard.

97
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,877
Stop. She'll outgrow it.

98
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,345
She did.

99
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:27,453
Happy Thursday, Mr. Crane.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,618
Thank you.

101
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,752
You've never opened
one of these, have you?

102
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,096
Hey, Todd.

103
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,304
Yes, Mr. Crane?

104
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,704
Nothing. Get the door, will you?

105
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,175
Damn it.

106
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,429
Whoa.

107
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,803
You in the middle of something?

108
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,309
We're going to the Oyster Bar.

109
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,474
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

110
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:12,864
Hello.

111
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,626
Good. You are home.

112
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,030
Never got any better.

113
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,625
I almost threw up waiting for our elevator

114
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,966
and then just came back
and got undressed.

115
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,699
Sorry.

116
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,004
But aren't you sweet to call
and check up on me.

117
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,770
Harry?

118
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,472
Harry?

119
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,879
What's wrong?

120
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,578
You told me you wanted me
to tell me if I was upset.

121
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
What did I do?

122
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,847
Oh, no, honey.

123
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,356
No, it's nothing.

124
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,390
You do sound upset.

125
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,584
Something is wrong.

126
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,059
Harry, do I want to hear this?

127
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,357
Would you stop? Let me talk?

128
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,898
Okay. Were you fired?

129
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,897
I accidentally opened
Ken Cosgrove's paycheck.

130
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,562
So?

131
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,900
What's he gonna care?

132
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,372
Tampering with the U.S. Mail?

133
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,999
He makes 300 a week.

134
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,910
What? That mannequin
makes $300 a week?

135
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,003
He's not married.

136
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,548
We have one on the way.

137
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,675
I hate this place.

138
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:07,911
I should quit.

139
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,282
That's your response?

140
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,753
The hours you work?

141
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,483
Forget about Kenny.

142
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,116
If they have that much money to spend,
they should spend it on you.

143
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,285
You're making that place.

144
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,193
I don't know about that.

145
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,095
What are you worth?

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,634
You go in there and ask for it.

147
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,930
Demand it.

148
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,438
Be polite, but think about
what you're worth to them.

149
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,236
No. No, I can't do that.

150
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:34,437
I didn't know this was about
you feeling sorry for yourself.

151
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:35,808
I'm hanging up.

152
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,246
Do you know where I can get
a number 10 envelope

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,511
with a windowpane
and a green stripe on the side?

154
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,087
No.

155
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,849
I need to lay down.

156
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,424
Yeah. Right.

157
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,288
Well, feel better.

158
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,373
Do you have a number 10 envelope
with a windowpane?

159
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,739
No. Why?

160
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,176
Can you make one?

161
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,112
No. Why?

162
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,212
Can you fix this one?

163
00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,880
Make it so it can look unopened?

164
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,685
You need a fake passport, too?

165
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,989
I got Ken Cosgrove's paycheck by mistake.

166
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,085
I opened it.

167
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,858
How did that happen?

168
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,626
A mistake.

169
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,133
Well, just throw it away.

170
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,204
He'll ask for it by the end of the day,

171
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,567
and they'll cut him a new one.

172
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,799
Don't throw it away here, though.

173
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:09,999
People go through the trash.

174
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,633
Of course.

175
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:14,610
Are you upset about getting caught?

176
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,249
Or are you upset about what you saw?

177
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,410
I don't know if this
would mean much to you.

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,181
It's 300 a week before taxes.

179
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,522
We're married.

180
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,598
I have a baby due in August.

181
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,688
You know what Jennifer said?

182
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,927
She thinks that I should just go in
and demand a raise.

183
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,662
You told your wife about this?

184
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,337
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.

185
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,671
- I didn't know what to do.
- There's nothing you can do.

186
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:47,267
That's why you don't tell your wife.

187
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,903
Wish you hadn't told me.

188
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,504
I think she's right.

189
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,709
But isn't Media a meritocracy?

190
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,807
You think that?

191
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,284
What's that supposed to mean, anyway?

192
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,548
I have plenty of merit.

193
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,420
Merit defined within reason.

194
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,256
As in this place can't run without you?

195
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,762
Well, how the hell do I do that?

196
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,857
Then you're worth every
penny they're paying you.

197
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:12,400
Thanks, Sal.

198
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:22,479
Mr. Draper, Mr. Sterling and Ben Cosgrove
are here to see you.

199
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,548
Ken.

200
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,911
Bad news.

201
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,417
So bad I don't feel like telling you.
Cosgrove.

202
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,482
We were shooting Jimmy Barrett
for Utz, and...

203
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,683
Don't pussyfoot around.
Just tell him.

204
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,657
I'm trying to tell him.

205
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,820
- Give me a cigarette.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,988
Why don't you get your own?

207
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,655
We have a whole storeroom full of Luckys.

208
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,529
Because I don't smoke.

209
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,467
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling
made a surprise visit to the set,

210
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,596
and they got the full
Jimmy Barrett treatment.

211
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,106
Mr. Rumsen's coming in.

212
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,574
I don't care that you drink, Freddie,

213
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,542
- but it's interfering with your job.
- Whoa.

214
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,909
Only an idiot would put
Jimmy Barrett in a room with her.

215
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,208
No visits.

216
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,544
How bad was it?

217
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,846
He called her the Hindenburg.

218
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,855
And he said something
about the whale in Pinocchio.

219
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,720
Did you laugh in front of the Schillings?

220
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,297
Of course not. I was mortified.

221
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,660
You know, my mother's heavyset.

222
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,028
I stopped it right away.

223
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:19,035
So what we're dealing with here
is you failed to control Jimmy Barrett,

224
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,764
and you failed to control Mr. And Mrs. Utz,

225
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:23,966
so maybe both of you
aren't suited for these tasks.

226
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,544
- Mr. Phillips is here.
- Perfect.

227
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:31,411
Utz is gonna lose Jimmy,
and we're going to lose Utz.

228
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:33,416
Oh, God. I miss the '50s.

229
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,817
Has anyone tried to save this yet
besides Leopold and Loeb over here?

230
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,389
Can't get the Schillings on the phone.

231
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,889
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.

232
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,325
Well, I'm sure he'll feel real bad
about it tonight and give her a call.

233
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,362
Don, can you work him over?

234
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,557
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.

235
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,224
Don's going to fix it.

236
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,996
He knows what that nut means to Utz
and what Utz means to us.

237
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,469
Fix what, exactly?

238
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,836
Fix this mess that was made
because Freddie got him drunk.

239
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,808
Come on. Cosgrove should have
told me they were here.

240
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,434
I would have never let her near that set.

241
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:02,206
I did. I told Lois.

242
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,941
I took them by here, but you were out.

243
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm going to talk to the Schillings,

244
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,821
then I'm going to explain
the facts of life to Jimmy.

245
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:16,859
That'll work.

246
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,157
A guy like that must know
how to make a charming apology,

247
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:20,492
or he'd be dead.

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,932
Where were you?

249
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,704
At the printer's.

250
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,809
You should tell your girl that.

251
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,644
Lois.

252
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,248
Close the door.

253
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,451
Sit down.

254
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,531
No. Stand.

255
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,192
I'd like to find a way not to be cruel,

256
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,701
but I don't think it'd be serving
either one of us.

257
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,897
Are you firing me?

258
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,038
Oh, no.

259
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,133
It's nice to see that you care
about something.

260
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,375
Are you trying to think
of what you can possibly say

261
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,778
to make up for what's happened here?

262
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,076
What happened?

263
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,950
I think you're not suited for this job.

264
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,749
What did I do?

265
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,587
In addition to being incompetent,

266
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,957
you threatened my reputation,
and not just today.

267
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,622
Mr. Draper, I try to cover
for you all the time.

268
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,166
You do not cover for me.

269
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,428
You manage people's expectations.

270
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,762
Can you be more specific?

271
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,965
You really want that?

272
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,975
No, I guess not.

273
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,704
You're not suited for this job.

274
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:43,872
It's not an insult. It's just the way it is.

275
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,887
Stick to the switchboard.

276
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,183
Please tell Miss Holloway on your way out.

277
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,485
Yes, Mr. Draper.

278
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,933
Is there something due
tomorrow I don't know about?

279
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:06,935
No.

280
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,144
Already finding ways
not to go home, are we?

281
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,887
Edgar Fladen, CBS, please.

282
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,391
- Hello.
- Flatty.

283
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,517
Harry Crane. How are you?

284
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,823
Still at work, same as you.

285
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,192
How you like it over there?

286
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:36,927
Did Sterling Coo lose
some of its drunken luster?

287
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,332
I don't know.

288
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,997
I was thinking maybe I have
to move out to move up.

289
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,040
Well, forget about here.
They're picking us off.

290
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,438
I'm one gone paleface.

291
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,568
Well, thought I'd ask.

292
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,373
Keep your ear to the ground
for me, will you?

293
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,176
- It doesn't have to be there.
- Hey, how about some concern?

294
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,217
I just lost Lever Brothers
and Kimberly Clark

295
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,444
from one of my biggest shows.

296
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,817
We're lousy with sponsors over here.
What do you need?

297
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,219
Don't get excited.

298
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,052
Sponsors drop out for a reason.

299
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,557
Not always.

300
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,390
Okay. Try this on.

301
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,464
The Defenders. Top 20 show.

302
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,964
E.G. Marshall, Bob Reed.

303
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,931
Lawyers, but, you know, they really care.

304
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,936
So the writers turn in this script
about a cannibal.

305
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,972
A cannibal lawyer?

306
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:19,241
The director eats up all this time
refusing to do it,

307
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,437
like his résumé isn't filled with crap,

308
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:24,913
and surprise, the writers have
only one other script ready...

309
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,484
something we threw away last year

310
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:32,717
because they used the word "abortion"
30 times in 51 minutes.

311
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,052
Why?

312
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,559
Because they show one, opening scene.

313
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,256
Exactly.

314
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,423
The whole thing was a ploy
to get us to shoot it.

315
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,330
They think they're so clever.

316
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,266
I tell you, I miss the blacklist.

317
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,098
Send it over. I want to see it.

318
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,366
I'm sure.

319
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,907
It's going on the air, sponsor or no.

320
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,603
I'll watch it with you in the bar
where I'll be working.

321
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,646
Send it over.
Let me see what I can do.

322
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,805
All right.

323
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,715
Miss Holloway, good morning.

324
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,586
I will be taking care of you
while we search for a suitable candidate.

325
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,750
I am really sorry about that.

326
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,919
Did she leave everything
in a condition you can follow?

327
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,487
Perhaps if you were involved
in the selection.

328
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,793
What can I tell?

329
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,495
I'll just continue looking
for another Miss Olson.

330
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,969
No. I want someone
who'll be happy with that job.

331
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:23,700
Well, for the time being, that's me.

332
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,105
How about a cup of coffee?

333
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,768
I think I remember how you take it.

334
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:27,845
Sure.

335
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,647
Is Jimmy Barrett shooting today?

336
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,376
Yes. At EUE.

337
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,276
What time do they start?

338
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,615
They were supposed to start this morning,

339
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,188
but Mr. Barrett's been showing up around 4.

340
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,087
Wake me at 3:30.

341
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,887
We'll start with your correspondence.

342
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,161
Did you go to that office

343
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,961
for the purpose of obtaining
an illegal operation?

344
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,002
Yes.

345
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,661
Were you pregnant?

346
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,137
Yes.

347
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,175
Then you went to Dr. Montgomery
for an abortion.

348
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,265
Yes.

349
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,106
Was the abortion performed?

350
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,304
Just a moment.

351
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,178
Mr. Preston, aren't you going to object?

352
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,774
The witness is not
a qualified medical expert.

353
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,353
The defense is willing to concede

354
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,285
that an operation was performed
on Miss Stafford,

355
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,516
which resulted in the termination
of a pregnancy.

356
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,593
Very well. You may proceed.

357
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,064
Come here a lot, do you?

358
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,501
Not if everything's running smoothly.

359
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,232
So buy me a drink.

360
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,740
I think there's been plenty of drinking here.

361
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,537
Jimmy around?

362
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,772
He left early. Rehearsal at the Copa.

363
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,847
Forgot this.

364
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,506
Isn't that our tuxedo?

365
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
He likes it better.

366
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,219
Great. So let's go talk to him.

367
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,448
There's no reason for that.

368
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,151
Talk to his manager.

369
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:49,385
How can I help you?

370
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,090
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,530
In the pitch, you were
introduced as his wife.

372
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,001
Would you prefer I pretend to be his sister,
like I did in the old days?

373
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,870
Wife, manager, someone should have
kept a lid on him yesterday.

374
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,966
I've seen the man sober.
He's not funny.

375
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:08,045
- Mrs. Barrett...
- Bobbie.

376
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,274
He can come in here with vomit
in his pockets for all I care,

377
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,011
but these people are his benefactors.

378
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,054
Like the Medicis of Florence,

379
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,020
they're patrons of his art.

380
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,092
Mr. And Mrs. Utz.

381
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:26,163
I want you to imagine something
that Jimmy obviously can't.

382
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:30,394
The Schillings were very excited
to see their favorite comedian.

383
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,562
Then they know that being picked on
by Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.

384
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,469
No one was laughing.

385
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,098
That's not what I heard.

386
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,699
I'll tell you what.

387
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,403
They're in the big city for the weekend.

388
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,073
Why don't they just go out
and buy a thicker skin?

389
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,855
You are aware that all of this
can go away.

390
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,251
No more free tuxedos?

391
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,520
We have a contract.

392
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,520
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.

393
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,531
You?

394
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,734
Jimmy doesn't have a lot
of patience for business

395
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,269
or for businessmen.

396
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,397
In fact, I'm pretty sure
he already hates you.

397
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,236
Really?

398
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:15,142
Some glib ad man in that suit,

399
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:18,374
cigarette perfectly in hand,
not a hair out of place,

400
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,576
here to tell him he's been a bad boy?

401
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,085
Well, he has been.

402
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,179
So what do you suggest I do?

403
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,694
Well...

404
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,523
he has to know that you're a fan

405
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:35,121
and that he knows more than you

406
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,996
and that he's got a shot with your wife.

407
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,967
Girlfriend? Both?

408
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,333
Wife.

409
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,871
So who's gonna have
a talk with him, you or me?

410
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,534
Neither of us.

411
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,407
I have to go.

412
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,548
Let me drive you over.

413
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,317
Give up, will you?

414
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,285
It's raining.

415
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,447
What's that?

416
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,287
Hail.

417
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,475
I don't want to do this.

418
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,810
Doesn't feel that way.

419
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:14,423
Hi, Daddy.

420
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,432
Hi, Daddy.

421
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,263
Hey, you.

422
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,427
How was work?

423
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,472
Fine.

424
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,938
Can I ask Daddy?

425
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,410
What do you want?

426
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,242
I'm fine.

427
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,551
You can ask him, but he's not
gonna disagree with me.

428
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:41,920
Ask me what?

429
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,463
Can we go riding
with Mommy on Saturday?

430
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,035
No.

431
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:54,897
There are just gonna be mommies there.

432
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,234
I'll need you to watch them.

433
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,071
- It's a couple of hours.
- Okay.

434
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,610
But she promised.

435
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,509
"She"?

436
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,812
Not this Saturday. It didn't work out.

437
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,117
You can ride me around the den.

438
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,547
I picked up your watch. Good as new.

439
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:18,295
Open it.

440
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,995
I got it monogrammed.

441
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,336
Wow, Bets.

442
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,834
Thank you.

443
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,553
What are you doing?

444
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:22,182
I think she's out of gas.

445
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:23,521
Thought I'd fill her up.

446
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,062
They feed them in the barn.

447
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,462
You're ruining that horse
for whoever has her next.

448
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:29,555
I want it on record.

449
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,261
She was ruined when I got to her.

450
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,565
Just pull up on the reins.
Straighten her out.

451
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,666
You can't let her do that.

452
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,437
You don't for a minute think
you might be hurting her?

453
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,343
She needs to be told what to do.
Don't be afraid.

454
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:47,111
I'm not afraid, but I am curious
why I'm riding Nehi

455
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:49,379
and you've got Copenhagen.

456
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,546
Some horses have better names.

457
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,954
Where's your girl friend, Mrs. Carson?

458
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,722
Her daughter has a ballet recital.

459
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,855
I'm really not afraid, you know?

460
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,796
I've just always been more
comfortable with animals

461
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,925
when they were on
the other end of my rifle.

462
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,867
That's a terrible attitude.

463
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:10,737
It is, and I've tried to explain it to Tara,
but she won't listen.

464
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,073
All the men in her family ride like this.

465
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,978
They also don't work,
so maybe I'm wrong about it.

466
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:20,312
I should go warm him up.

467
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,578
Tally-ho.

468
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:35,156
I'll be right back.

469
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,630
Hello.

470
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,833
Hello. It's Don Draper.

471
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,130
Can you talk?

472
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,501
I'm glad you called.

473
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:18,541
How are you?

474
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,110
Weren't you afraid you'd get Jimmy?

475
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,372
No. I wanted to invite you both to dinner.

476
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,607
Monday night.

477
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,275
A command performance.

478
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,852
I was thinking Lutèce.

479
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:31,319
It will be formal. Can you get him there?

480
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:34,391
I told you. He does whatever I say.

481
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,459
Keep it small.

482
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,393
My wife, the Schillings, you.

483
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,522
Okay. If that's what you want.

484
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,660
What do you want?

485
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,773
So...

486
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,372
it's that kind of phone call, is it?

487
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,639
Where are you?

488
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,042
In my home.

489
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,277
With my children.

490
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:02,875
Really?

491
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,849
I like being bad and then
going home and being good.

492
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,795
I'll see you Monday.

493
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,932
Have a wonderful weekend.

494
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,923
Did you have a nice ride?

495
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,891
Don't smoke in here. They hate it.

496
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,432
I don't know.

497
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,503
Place burns down, I could give this up.

498
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:55,094
I assume you're trying to be funny,
but most of the people who ride...

499
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,173
Hold on.

500
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,732
Mrs. Draper, I'm so sorry.
That's not what I meant.

501
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,277
Just because you don't know
what you're doing

502
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,812
doesn't mean the rest of us are silly.

503
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,443
I apologize.

504
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:08,584
Girls and their horses.

505
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:11,443
I can't figure you out.

506
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,923
Why would you want to do that?

507
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,517
When Tara came to visit,
I could tell she was jealous.

508
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,960
Of your two old lady friends.

509
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,091
She certainly seems like
a girl who has everything.

510
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,533
She does.

511
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:26,660
When she was at Wellesley,

512
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,103
she came for a couple
of weekends to New Haven.

513
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,868
I remember those.

514
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,272
So exciting.

515
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:36,472
We got into a kind of pattern
where there'd be a warm reunion,

516
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,517
a football game, and some kind
of obscure argument.

517
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:44,179
You know, I would soothe
and she would pout.

518
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:47,416
You know, Mr. Case,
having been married for some time,

519
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,686
I can tell you your fiancée
would be very unhappy

520
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,762
with you sharing this with a stranger.

521
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,760
Arthur.

522
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,964
I don't know why I brought that up.

523
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,767
I guess I just remembered going home
with her that first time.

524
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:05,637
Pulling off the Merritt Parkway
and hitting this long, private road.

525
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:09,338
You know that Scott Fitzgerald story,
A Diamond as Big as the Ritz?

526
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,846
No.

527
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:15,009
Her house is a slightly smaller version
of my high school.

528
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,713
And I realized why she was
so happy all the time

529
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,155
and why she was so angry
when she didn't get what she wanted.

530
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,250
All girls are like that.

531
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,522
- You aren't.
- You don't know that.

532
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,358
You are so beautiful.

533
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,162
Thank you.

534
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,861
So different than Tara.

535
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,165
Tara is very beautiful. You know that.

536
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,673
She doesn't need anything.

537
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,265
What she does need, anyone can get her.

538
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,512
You're nervous about getting married.

539
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,673
You'll see.

540
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,341
You don't know what she'll mean to you.

541
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,751
But I think about you.

542
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,047
Why would you do that?

543
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,886
Arthur, I like being around you.

544
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,360
Don't say anything to ruin that.

545
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,296
You're so profoundly sad.

546
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,363
No.

547
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,907
It's just my people are Nordic.

548
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,005
Don't do that.

549
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,140
Don't tell me what to do.

550
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,322
You're so profoundly sad.

551
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,353
You're wrong.

552
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,561
I'm grateful.

553
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,434
Hey.

554
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,197
How was it?

555
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,034
I'm sorry I'm late.

556
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,767
Thank you for watching them.

557
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,342
Come in here.

558
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:20,774
I should get cleaned up.

559
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,175
I don't care.

560
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,712
Listen.

561
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,408
How do you feel about
Lutèce Monday night?

562
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,285
Lutèce?

563
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,615
Pleased, I guess.

564
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:37,091
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.

565
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,926
Why?

566
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,056
Business.

567
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,898
Hunt Schilling from
Utz Potato Chips and wives.

568
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:50,371
Is this one where I talk or I don't talk?

569
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,271
You need to charm him.

570
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,310
I need you to be shiny and bright.

571
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,743
I need a better half.

572
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,677
Monday night.

573
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,806
You have plans?

574
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,180
I'll have to find something to wear.

575
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,549
It's no notice. No notice at all.

576
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:07,385
Birdie, we'll go there alone another time.

577
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,994
What is it?

578
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,040
What is it?
What's this got to do with you?

579
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,411
"He helped me," says Sam.

580
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,379
Is this you?

581
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,042
They're writing this about you?

582
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,552
Answer me!
Are you mixed up in this?

583
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,520
- Answer me!
- Mr. Mason.

584
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,091
You keep out of this!

585
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,161
Sandra Mason.

586
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:46,058
I was reading about this.

587
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,927
I was thanking God that my daughter

588
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,898
wasn't the kind of a girl that was...

589
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:53,868
would be mixed up
in anything ugly like this.

590
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,836
Please, Daddy, don't.

591
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,774
I was even feeling sorry for the parents
of the girls who were involved.

592
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,606
- Please. Please.
- Please?

593
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,873
18 years old!

594
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,414
You have to have an illegitimate child

595
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,781
taken away from you by some filthy doctor!

596
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,285
Mr. Mason!

597
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,878
You get out of my house!

598
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,357
I do want to see the rest of this,
but I get the idea.

599
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,087
Then behave as though you...

600
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:24,264
Top 20 show, prime time,
for pennies on the dollar.

601
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,734
And it's the perfect match
for Belle Jolie lipstick.

602
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,305
Really? How does that work?

603
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,874
Controversy means viewers.

604
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,843
Women will find a way to watch this.

605
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:36,742
Maybe just because
they don't want to get left out.

606
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,144
Is that true?

607
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,243
There's no doubt in my mind.

608
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,946
We can talk to them
about putting on a warning.

609
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,422
Research shows rules
are made to be broken.

610
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,619
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.

611
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,855
This discussion, it's uncomfortable.

612
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:54,225
This show is troubling.

613
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:58,267
It's catharsis. That's hard to come by.

614
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,499
What is better than tears to make a girl
ready to hear she can be beautiful?

615
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,437
I'd love to see a spike.

616
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,103
But what do I do when Hugh Brody
asks what the hell this is?

617
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,510
Belle Jolie is a family company.

618
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:12,479
This is not wholesome.

619
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,575
There are limits to what
you can get out of daytime.

620
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,678
I don't want Belle Jolie
to be part of this debate.

621
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,690
So you think girls who buy lipstick
aren't gonna be interested in this?

622
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,361
I don't care where they stand.
So it's political.

623
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:28,056
Politics are in.
Women will be watching.

624
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:29,860
Young women.

625
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,195
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,039
Well, we thought you should know about it.

627
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,369
I have to say I'm very impressed
you brought this to us.

628
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,003
I wish we were
a different kind of company.

629
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,014
We all work for someone.

630
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,687
It was a pleasure.

631
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,985
How's it going?

632
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,058
Very well, thank you.

633
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,537
You said you wanted to see me?

634
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,201
Yes, I did.

635
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:15,869
You're Harry Crane, right?

636
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,277
Yes, I am.

637
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,407
Certain things have come to my attention.

638
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:21,916
Oh, no.

639
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,385
I heard about it third-hand,
and I thought it sounded reckless,

640
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,012
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.

641
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:27,715
Mr. Cooper knows about this?

642
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,417
I think someone told on you.

643
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:31,517
And it backfired.

644
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,426
- Mitch.
- Doesn't matter.

645
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,498
Cooper thought it showed initiative.

646
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,430
So you're in here now.

647
00:35:37,534 --> 00:35:38,592
I'm smiling. What do you want?

648
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,474
Well...

649
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,600
I guess, for one thing,

650
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,337
I think that we should have
a television department.

651
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,504
All the other agencies have them.

652
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:52,047
And I think I should run it.

653
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,613
You're now the head
of the Television Department,

654
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,947
which is comprised solely of you.

655
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,521
Anything else?

656
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,185
Well, actually...

657
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,782
I think I deserve a raise.

658
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:16,606
And I think...

659
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,073
you've already received a sizable reward.

660
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,905
Let's not get greedy.

661
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm not being greedy.

662
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:24,012
Are you arguing with me?

663
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:27,148
How much do you make?

664
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,617
- $200 a week.
- Plus drinks.

665
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,213
Give me a number.

666
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,125
How about 310?

667
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:39,957
No one makes that around here.
Not even close.

668
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,294
How about two and a quarter? Say yes.

669
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:45,125
Yes.

670
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,327
I'll throw in new business cards.

671
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,995
You drive a hell of a bargain.

672
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,441
So I finally told them
that we really enjoyed visiting,

673
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,611
but we'd rather stay in a hotel.

674
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,189
Made my daughter-in-law happier.

675
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,623
Luckily, we're a long way
from those problems.

676
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,161
Although, I do love the idea
of Bobby and Sally

677
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:14,594
having apartments and families.

678
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,022
Where is he?

679
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,127
Who?

680
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,467
Jimmy Barrett.

681
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,338
I...

682
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,240
No, Hunt.

683
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,142
I don't think that would be a good idea.

684
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,714
Edith, please.

685
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,043
He wants to apologize.

686
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,221
Oh, dear.

687
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,791
Well, he certainly picked a nice place.

688
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,355
Hello, everybody.
Sorry we're late,

689
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:48,294
but one of us likes to make an entrance.

690
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,298
Hello. Bobbie Barrett.

691
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,958
Pleasure.

692
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,230
- We've met before.
- I remember.

693
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,532
Mr. Draper.

694
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:58,538
This is my wife Betty.

695
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:00,940
Betty, this is Bobbie and Jimmy Barrett.

696
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,978
Oh, my. I am such a fan.

697
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,209
You know, when you imagine
someone saying that to you,

698
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,842
you always hope it's her.

699
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,353
And this one. My God.
Are you two sold separately?

700
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,684
Look, it's JFK.

701
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,123
And you're not Jackie,
but you're definitely his type.

702
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:17,352
I've met him.

703
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,450
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.

704
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,553
You remember Hunt and Edith Schilling.

705
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,393
How could I forget?
They bought me a car.

706
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:23,625
A pleasure as always.

707
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,793
And the little lady.
Look at you, all dolled up.

708
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,835
So, what do you do, sweetheart?

709
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,036
I want to know everything.

710
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,510
I'm a housewife.

711
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,774
I bet little birds hang up your laundry.

712
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:41,442
And we have a little boy and a little girl.

713
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,918
Is that everything? Or you want
to let my imagination run wild?

714
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,080
By the way, I loved you
in Gentleman's Agreement.

715
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,988
Good evening, mesdames et messieurs.

716
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:52,061
The chef has prepared many spécialités

717
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,390
which I will have the pleasure of...

718
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,464
Just a minute, Monsieur Le Pew.

719
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:55,998
Any chance we can get a drink order filled?

720
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,930
Sorry, everybody,
but Jimmy's down a quart.

721
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,333
Two Johnnie Walkers, rocks.
Bobbie, you want anything?

722
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,200
Dubonnet with a twist.

723
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,737
And make it fast,
while this place is still French.

724
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,509
I hope you all like spit in your food.

725
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,547
Come on. I come here all the time.

726
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:15,015
Now, I have a few key
questions for Mrs. America.

727
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:18,019
Remember, Betsy,
everything's riding on this.

728
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,089
So really, what fills your days?

729
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,589
Eating bonbons?

730
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,250
Hitting tennis balls with the needy?

731
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,223
Actually, I spend a lot
of my time riding horses.

732
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,958
It's really a passion for me.

733
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,431
And for them, I bet.

734
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,298
So, big horses?
Give me an education.

735
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:35,871
- You don't want to hear about this.
- No, I do.

736
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,305
Is it the beauty pageant thing
where they walk in little bitty steps?

737
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:40,035
I'll be right back.

738
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:44,138
No. That's dressage.

739
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,306
I knew that.

740
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:48,009
It's the same kind of saddle,
but I do jumping.

741
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,379
You two do any jumping?

742
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:51,476
I'm sorry.

743
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:53,613
Can you excuse me a moment?

744
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,056
All this talk about horses?

745
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,459
What, are you expecting a Chinese baby?

746
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,695
I don't know what it is,

747
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:10,432
but one thing I know is it's not Chinese.

748
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,371
We're both very proud of you.

749
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,704
Well, good.

750
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,040
Because a 121/2% raise
is nothing to sneeze at.

751
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,706
I don't care about the money.

752
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:22,717
Well... the money's nice.

753
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,811
I just can't wait to go
into the phone company tomorrow

754
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,584
and tell the girls that my husband

755
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,125
is the head of television
at Sterling Cooper.

756
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,717
Do you feel well enough to go in?

757
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:33,523
Because you don't have to.

758
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,029
You're sweet.

759
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,603
What did you do?

760
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,868
Well, I took this TV show
that no one wanted to sponsor,

761
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,738
and I told one of our clients about it.

762
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,276
And you sold it?

763
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:52,974
No, but everyone was impressed
that I recognized the opportunity.

764
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,812
What's the show?

765
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,647
Just some show.

766
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:02,681
You wouldn't like it.

767
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,495
You look great.

768
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:17,368
Do I?

769
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:18,998
I'm not feeling great.

770
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,940
Why not?

771
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,636
I'm gonna be brief

772
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,044
because I don't like
leaving him alone out there.

773
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:26,615
They're loving it.

774
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,447
They're being polite.

775
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,818
The window for this apology is closing.

776
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,086
It needs to happen before the appetizers,
or they will leave.

777
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,354
Really?

778
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,862
Because I was thinking about that,

779
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:43,455
so I took a look at Jimmy's contract...

780
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,865
well, me and a lawyer...

781
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:49,530
and I realized Jimmy doesn't
have to apologize at all.

782
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,269
In fact, they're gonna have to pay him,
even if they fire him,

783
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,541
especially because hurt feelings
isn't a very good reason.

784
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:01,581
So what is this all about?

785
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:06,384
I think an apology,
and a public one like this one,

786
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,254
has to be worth $25,000.

787
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,122
And I want it in the paper.

788
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,719
Say it's a bonus.

789
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:31,112
Believe me, I will ruin him.

790
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:36,578
Do what I say.

791
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,931
- Don't get up.
- I wasn't gonna.

792
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,269
But this one knows about horses.
Who knows?

793
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,775
I've been spending the whole time
watching her lips move.

794
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:11,879
Well, I hope we haven't ordered yet
because there really is something

795
00:43:11,988 --> 00:43:13,649
that we need to get out of the way.

796
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,088
He's picking up the check.

797
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,750
I mean, there's really no debate, is there?

798
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,227
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling,

799
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,993
Jimmy has something
that he'd like to say to you.

800
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:36,068
Honestly, I'd rather eat your chips
than anything in this dump.

801
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:37,544
They have snails here, you know.

802
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,416
That's nice to hear.

803
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,316
Mrs. Schilling... Edith...

804
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,945
I was out of line the other day.

805
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,752
I shouldn't have said it to you,
and not just 'cause you're married to him.

806
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,327
I shouldn't have said it to anybody,
not in that environment.

807
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,589
Sweetheart, look at me.

808
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,393
You, too, Hunt. Can I call you Hunt?

809
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,764
There's the guy under the lights,
and there's me.

810
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,566
He's made me rich,
but he hasn't made me very nice.

811
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,163
I hope we can put it behind us.

812
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,437
I know that's what you do.

813
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,911
I guess I just don't have the stomach for it.

814
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:19,180
Well, I'm famished.

815
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,964
Excuse me.

816
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,317
Bets, you all right?

817
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:02,131
Yes.

818
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,527
What's wrong?

819
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,399
Nothing.

820
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,003
Nothing's wrong.

821
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,405
I'm just so happy.

822
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:25,720
When I said I wanted to be
a part of your life...

823
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,318
this is what I meant.

824
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:37,795
We make a great team.

825
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,399
