1
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,175
"I lay on my pillow
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

2
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,303
"Delicious and destroyed.

3
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,057
"lnhaling the fragrance of the sheets.

4
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:02,311
"Feeling the warmth of where
you were just laying.

5
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,022
"You make me new with laughter.

6
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,525
"You make me old with wisdom.

7
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,070
You make wine taste sweeter."

8
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,948
Who wrote that?

9
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,995
I write a lot of poetry when I'm inspired.

10
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,837
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
by anything you do.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,380
You shouldn't.

12
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,300
It's insulting.

13
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,182
I have to keep you in line,
or I'll lose you.

14
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,850
Yes, you will.

15
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't like the idea of making you older.

16
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,109
I just meant. . .

17
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,447
I don't know.

18
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,999
It doesn't matter how old l am.

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,168
Our souls are the same age.

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,352
Oh, God.

21
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,773
You're getting to me.

22
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,658
How do I know I'm not just
going to eat another mushroom

23
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,995
and this room will disappear
and l'll be back on a train to Trenton?

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,957
Because I love you, Jane.

25
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,506
This is hard for you. I know it.

26
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,969
You don't want me to talk about it,

27
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:03,432
but Margaret and Mona have been
your life for the last 40 years.

28
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,393
30.

29
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,982
Listen, I'm not being impulsive,

30
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,026
because I've been thinking
about this all the time.

31
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,406
I want you to be my wife.

32
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,449
What?

33
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,369
Marry me.

34
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,831
Roger, are you serious?

35
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,708
Will you do that for me?

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,767
90%  of Right Guard users
say they play sports.

37
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,978
60% wear it for their girls as well.

38
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,149
Most impressive, 80%  of the fellas
saying "yes" to the question:

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,985
"Does Right Guard make you
feel more confident at work?"

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,321
Did anyone watch Loretta Young last night?

41
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,864
I was supposed to. What happened?

42
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,617
I can't even describe it, it was so awful.

43
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:07,163
Creative, think old Donnie Draper will mind
if we think better on a full stomach?

44
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,791
Well, if you'lI all swear
Gillette dropped in.

45
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,585
Are you kidding?

46
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,295
Absolutely.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,422
I'll pretend they're here if you give me
some actual ideas.

48
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,841
Right Guard already has
a great campaign--

49
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,134
men being men.

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,969
You know, women smell bad, too.

51
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,262
Not you, of course.

52
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,639
Women have perfume.

53
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,099
"Perfume does not fight wetness."

54
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,977
Loretta Young.
She's my dad's favorite.

55
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,270
The aprons.

56
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,814
The nauseating upholstery on the couch.

57
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,733
Strangers who drop by.

58
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,859
Hear from Kinsey?

59
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,319
What do you mean?

60
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,946
Did you read what's going on down there?

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,614
In this day and age.

62
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,908
The papers said it's gonna be
Little Rock all over again.

63
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,535
I don't know why people
keep stirring up trouble.

64
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,870
It's bad for business.

65
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,205
Just another reason not to watch TV.

66
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,748
Kurt doesn't even have one.

67
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,500
You have to have one. It's your job.

68
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,793
You're gonna miss the playoff.

69
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,796
It's a different Iife for single men.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,048
What do you do with your spare time?

71
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,300
I like concerts. I like park.

72
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,219
He saw Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall.

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,096
I heard him on the radio.

74
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,473
So we're not gonna work at all.

75
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,894
TeIl Right Guard,
short of a new product just for women,

76
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,270
we need more research and time.

77
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,438
And lunch.

78
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,609
Can we split a lobster?

79
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,785
Does he sound like the album?

80
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,788
When you hear him, he plays it himself.

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,999
He must be something to see.

82
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,291
I'd love to go sometime.

83
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,751
So go.

84
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,253
Yes, I shouId.

85
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,838
You will go with me.

86
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,423
What?

87
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,800
You would go with me?

88
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,221
No. I don't want to impose
if you have plans.

89
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,600
When you hear him, you will smile like this.

90
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,104
Pick you up at 8.

91
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,856
I live in Brooklyn. It's a hike.

92
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,733
Neighbors.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,153
Joey says that Duck's in the blind.

94
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,529
It's now or never.

95
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,803
This is why l booked a day early.

96
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,764
What did Ricardo in there say?

97
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,974
He's in hourly contact with TWA,

98
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,143
and they've offered
to buy you new luggage.

99
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,978
And fill it with my things?

100
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,440
Ricardo recommended a tailor. Chinese.

101
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,277
And he said they've got
a whole shop full of swim trunks.

102
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,237
I brought mine.

103
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,573
There's not gonna be any swimming.

104
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,576
The convention doesn't
start for another day.

105
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,744
You want to be the hundredth person

106
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,329
to shake someone's hand
at some convention?

107
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,997
For what, a free pen?

108
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,083
We'll follow up face to face.

109
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,335
Forget Santa Monica.

110
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,504
Take your list,
target some of these guys,

111
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,297
and make them feel special.

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,466
Didn't Roger give you leads?

113
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,717
He did .

114
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,512
I'm gonna need sunglasses.

115
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,851
Come on.

116
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,436
You want to be on vacation, Pete?

117
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,146
Because l can make that happen.

118
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,198
Old-fashioned.

119
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,744
Excuse me.

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,748
My friends and I have
been speculating about you,

121
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,668
trying to decide who you are
and what you do.

122
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,211
Why?

123
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,088
Are you an actor?

124
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,298
No.

125
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,008
Are you an astronaut?

126
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,176
No.

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,219
Someone over there
would like to meet you--

128
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,138
a young woman--

129
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,807
onIy if you are none of these things.

130
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,939
I'm Viscount Monteforte d'Alsace.

131
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,774
- Willy.
- Don.

132
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,152
This is Don.

133
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,821
She's been staring at you all day.

134
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,199
Can't stop talking about you.

135
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,367
I'm Joy.

136
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,582
And this is Rocci.

137
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,836
You look so comfortable
alone by the pool all day.

138
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,380
Made me wonder if you're
waiting for someone.

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,967
I am.

140
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,429
Do you smell that jasmine?

141
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,265
Dine with us.

142
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,810
Maybe another time.

143
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,355
That never happens.

144
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,773
Hello.

145
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,234
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci

146
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,277
and Viscount Monteforte.

147
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,612
Very good.

148
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,322
D'Alsace. Willy.

149
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,032
That's quite a name.

150
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,659
Peter Dykeman Campbell.

151
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,744
Have we met somewhere? Newport?

152
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,039
I have a terrible memory for faces.

153
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,374
Nice meeting you.

154
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,625
Yes.

155
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,960
A pleasure to meet you.

156
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,340
Look for us.

157
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,557
Everybody here is late for everything.

158
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,394
I just saw Tony Curtis in the men's room.

159
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,562
Handing out towels?

160
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,606
Tony Curtis, Don.

161
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,358
A thing like that.

162
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,530
Who's for dinner?

163
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,698
Rodney Barnes.

164
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,533
Classic salesman turned executive.

165
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,911
And this interesting scientist,
Caleb Sawyer.

166
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,414
He has this Optoman thesis.

167
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,207
In addition to rockets,

168
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,376
they're going to start engineering man--

169
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,211
you know, for travel in space.

170
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,589
New organs, super strength.

171
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,633
You know the Soviets are working on it.

172
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,011
Are all of our meetings like this?

173
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,638
It's American Aviation and Rocketdyne.

174
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,889
It's not a joke.

175
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,518
Can l get a drink here or what?

176
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,739
The Raphael was a little tired,

177
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,242
but the Fifth Arrondissement
has most of your good restaurants.

178
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,660
Of course, we kept getting lost,

179
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,287
and every time Sherry asked for directions,

180
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,414
it turned out to be another American.

181
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,874
WelI, there you go.

182
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,252
I'll take Jane to Paris,
and l'll send Mona to Reno.

183
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,754
You don't have to marry her, do you?

184
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,505
No.

185
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,217
Maybe you and Mona couId work out
one of those modern arrangements.

186
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,719
George, stop.

187
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,348
It is possible that you'll get tired of her,
and then where will you be?

188
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,224
Mona doesn't have a right to anything--

189
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,226
not my company money,
not my family money.

190
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,354
She's lucky I'm giving her anything.

191
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,439
And you know what?
We've been miserable for years.

192
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,107
I don't want to die with that woman.

193
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,650
Calm down.

194
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,570
I didn't know that.

195
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,698
This is the life I was always meant to have.

196
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,785
CongratuIations.

197
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,331
Mona has the marriage license,
and she wants to hurt you.

198
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,125
If you want to be with this 20-year-old girl,
you're going to have to buy it from her.

199
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,418
I have to warn you.

200
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:55,089
Women in this situation
become extra irrational.

201
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,632
Well, how badly
does she want to hurt me?

202
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,342
I have a list of conditions

203
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,345
and an alimony that could
support Rita Hayworth.

204
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,847
Think of all the good things
in life and cut them in half.

205
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,017
I want you to push as hard
as you can, but I want it done.

206
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,353
Mr. Phillips is here.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,896
In a minute.

208
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,941
I'll proceed.

209
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,236
But I want you to think about it.

210
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,281
Duck Phillips, this is George Rothman.

211
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,450
Actually, we know each other.

212
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,328
Roger.

213
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,996
It's good to see you, Duck.

214
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,596
Was he for you or against you?

215
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,181
He's supposed to be the best.

216
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,307
Him or Marvin Hughes.

217
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,309
That's who Mona has.

218
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,769
He's her cousin.

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,773
How bad was it? Do I want to know?

220
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,860
I don't think my circumstances
were the same as yours.

221
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,743
What can I do for you?

222
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,329
Actually, this might not be
the best time to talk about this.

223
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,248
Can't you tell I'd welcome
a change in subject?

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,167
WelI, good, then.

225
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,253
What the hell, right?

226
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,009
Listen, we're coming up
on two years together here.

227
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,428
Did you get me something?

228
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:32,853
I think we're at a point in time
where I need to know what your plans are.

229
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,606
A partnership. I think I'νe earned it.

230
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,859
Right.

231
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,947
I'll bring it up at the next meeting
of the partners.

232
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,741
Thank you.

233
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,785
Of course you might have to come in
and be an advocate for yourself.

234
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,370
I'd be proud to present
my accomplishments.

235
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,748
Good. Because I'm at a loss.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,709
What is that supposed to mean?

237
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,670
You haven't exactly delivered
on that 30%  you promised.

238
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,841
I think we've really performed
in a very dismal year.

239
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,010
These things are cyclical. You know that.

240
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,974
Is there some question
about my value to Sterling Cooper?

241
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,226
Just think about the board.

242
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,977
Bert Cooper hates everyone.

243
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,562
And his sister--

244
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,731
well, she does whatever he says.

245
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,526
Don, he's only 1 2 1 /2% ,

246
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,570
but l can't say he's
your biggest cheerleader.

247
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,072
What are you saying?

248
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,698
Everyone thinks you're a fine felIow.

249
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,286
But if I were you,
I'd go out there and make rain.

250
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,292
Thank you for being so candid.

251
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,550
This year we have seen
an historic collaboration

252
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,093
in American aerospace.

253
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,470
Building on Lockheed's new Polaris A3,

254
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,055
Bell Aerosystems,

255
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,765
Aerojet General, and NASA

256
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,059
have developed a restartable rocket engine.

257
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,395
Can we get the lights, please?

258
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,316
We at Space Technology Laboratories

259
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,487
have set our minds
to the challenges of the future.

260
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,741
In July, Khrushchev said the Soviet Union
now has an anti-missile

261
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,327
that can hit a fly in outer space.

262
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,415
Space Technology Laboratories
is leading a coordinated effort

263
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,417
to create an invulnerable warhead--

264
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,836
multiple, independently targetable

265
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,921
reentry vehicles-- M. I . R.V.s.

266
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,591
And North American Aviation's
vernier thruster

267
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,302
allows the primary missile
to correct its trajectory

268
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,598
before shooting off several warheads
hidden inside its nose cone.

269
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,683
The M . I .R.V. can be launched

270
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,185
from a submarine or land
into the stratosphere.

271
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,065
Then it splits off
into 1 4 individual warheads.

272
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,735
That's 1 4 different targets.

273
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,863
1 4 different cities.

274
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,198
1 4 individual warheads,

275
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,701
each with ten times
the payload of Nagasaki.

276
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,955
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,

277
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,291
that's 5 out of 1 4.

278
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,171
Secondary strike capabilities
wiIl be extremely limited

279
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,592
due to the decrease
in infrastructure and population.

280
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,429
Total annihilation.

281
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,270
Do you reaIize that one
of these companies

282
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,398
spends more annually on media
than three Lucky Strikes?

283
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,442
It's a gold rush.

284
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,571
Where are the valets?

285
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,365
So much for cheap labor.

286
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,367
Go see if General Dynamics beat us here.

287
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,077
Drop these by the front desk.

288
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,162
You don't want them under your arm.

289
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,436
Hello.

290
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,855
I think you're happy to see me.

291
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,278
Well, take a good look.
I have to be on my way.

292
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,613
Are you working?

293
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,074
Yes.

294
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,909
That's too bad.

295
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,744
I'm going to Palm Springs.

296
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,496
You should come with me.

297
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,666
I don't know about that.

298
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,463
Why would you deny yourself
something you want?

299
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,879
You want to get your things?

300
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,256
No.

301
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,476
Well.

302
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,935
Why don't we give it a few more minutes?

303
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,356
Enjoy the scenery, order some drinks.

304
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,942
I think Don needed to make a phone call.

305
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,457
Hello?

306
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,001
Just leave the bags there.

307
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,881
Who lives here?

308
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,301
Friends. They're in Sardinia.

309
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,178
I'm supposed to be in Edward's room.

310
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,693
That's Stephanie in the swimming pool.

311
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,489
And Willy and Rocci you've met.

312
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,536
And there's Greta and her friend Carlos.

313
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,163
I'm surprised to see them
in the same place.

314
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,167
Come with me.

315
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,091
Hello, Greta.

316
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,593
Hello, Joy, darling.

317
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,096
Who's this?

318
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,098
This is my friend Don.

319
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,559
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.

320
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,980
It's medicinal.

321
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,071
Good-bye, Carlos.

322
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,413
Come for a swim with me?

323
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,544
You can go inside
and ask for some trunks,

324
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,504
or you can go au naturel.

325
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,470
I think I should go inside.

326
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,223
You're white as a sheet.

327
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,727
Don, are you okay?

328
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,168
Where am l?

329
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,587
You're with me, remember?

330
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,632
You have heat exhaustion.

331
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,592
What are you doing?

332
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,093
It's fine. It's medicine.

333
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,803
Klaus is a doctor.

334
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,556
No, it's okay.

335
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,308
I just need some water and some aspirin.

336
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,145
Everybody out.

337
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,522
I thought you were going
to break your neck.

338
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,193
Next time you feel faint,
lean towards the pool.

339
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,819
See you at dinner.

340
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,656
Little girl, don't get any ideas.

341
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,741
This man needs rest.

342
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,996
I found you some clothes upstairs.

343
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,712
Who are these people?

344
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,006
They're friends.

345
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,929
We're nomads together.

346
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,056
What are you all doing here?

347
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,309
There's an open door policy.

348
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,103
You should rest up for dinner.

349
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,521
Have you ever had Mexican food?

350
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,897
No.

351
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,148
You're gonna like it.

352
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,900
Come out when you're ready.

353
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,922
You're spoiled .

354
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,632
This is great food. This is Mexican.

355
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,051
I don't like Mexican.
I want to do French again.

356
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,137
We're in Califor-- Sweetheart.

357
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,555
Mexican does pig. l don't eat pig.

358
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,017
- I've already told you.
- Okay, well. . .

359
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,649
- He's here.
- Don.

360
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,990
Klaus, could you let Don sit here?

361
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,753
Would you like some wine, Don?

362
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,755
Klaus, is that okay?

363
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,923
He looks healthy enough.

364
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,342
You must be hungry.

365
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,679
Everyone, to our guest.

366
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,600
To not being carried out in a box.

367
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,691
So, Don, what's your story?

368
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't know how to answer that.

369
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,238
Where are you from?

370
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,158
New York.

371
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,409
Try this.

372
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,286
It's a pepper filled with cheese.

373
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,454
Darling.

374
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,747
And there's the sauce.

375
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,084
Joy and Willy think that you're a spy.

376
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,170
But your wallet fell out
when they carried you inside.

377
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,755
You're in advertising.

378
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,340
Or l'm a really good spy.

379
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,847
You'll never meet a group of people
more interested in professions,

380
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,392
and yet, there is not
one of us here who has one.

381
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,602
I'm a physician.

382
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,896
But you don't work.

383
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,649
So I assume you're all well off.

384
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,697
I should take something up.

385
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm smarter than I've ever been in my life.

386
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,997
Not only do I know so much,
but my brain is more agile.

387
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,541
I didn't know that was possible.

388
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,128
And my muscles are
remembering their skilIs.

389
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,546
Are you an athlete, Don?

390
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,549
I played some football in high school.

391
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,177
Willy was a champion fencer.

392
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,180
I made the Olympic team twice.

393
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:38,434
1 948, London. 1 952, Helsinki.

394
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,769
Foils.

395
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,605
It's hardly a sport.

396
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,863
Let's play places.

397
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,573
I'll start.

398
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,741
You have to name a place

399
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,578
that starts with the last letter
of the place that's named.

400
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,498
Kalambaka.

401
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,000
Alaska.

402
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,918
It's not a city.

403
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,503
Amalfi.

404
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,046
Irún.

405
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,298
Naples.

406
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,841
- Stockholm.
- Malagá.

407
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,510
Athens.

408
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,928
Sarajevo.

409
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,180
Oslo.

410
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
Wow.

411
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,350
"O" is impossible.

412
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,643
Odessa.

413
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,813
- Orezzo.
- Osaka.

414
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,148
Oakland.

415
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,733
Dunkirk.

416
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:27,942
Kabul.

417
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,027
London.

418
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,570
- Nice.
- Essen.

419
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,571
Nairobi.

420
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,657
Istanbul.

421
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,742
Lisbon.

422
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,828
Negril.

423
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,371
Lauzon.

424
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,940
How old are you?

425
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,733
I'm 21 .

426
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,401
How old are you?

427
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,071
I'm 36.

428
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,829
You're still warm.

429
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,501
Who are you?

430
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,962
I'm Joy.

431
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,307
There's glazed.

432
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,977
Coconut, crullers.

433
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,397
Bismarks.

434
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,690
Who brought these in, Cosgrove?

435
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,568
I haven't seen contracts,
but this is certainly a good sign.

436
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,486
Gosh, Joan, thank him for me.

437
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,573
We're going to be getting
a delivery like this

438
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,283
every week, with all the varieties.

439
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,660
Lemonaires.

440
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,246
Are these for us?

441
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,914
The spoils of victory.

442
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,583
8:00 in this evening.

443
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,792
Excuse me?

444
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,210
Our destination.

445
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,587
Okay.

446
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,963
Where are you two going?

447
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,465
To the Bob Dylan.

448
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,300
Isn't that interesting?

449
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,510
Peggy and Kurt in the Village, oh, my.

450
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,805
Don't be shy.

451
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,433
I think you two are adorable.

452
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,895
What is with this?

453
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,897
You think Peggy and I?

454
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,190
We do.

455
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,693
I'm homosexual.

456
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,156
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,783
Kurt.

458
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,703
No. I make love with the man,
not the woman.

459
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,626
What?

460
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,048
8?

461
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,468
Of course. Absolutely.

462
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,651
Enjoy the dancing beans.

463
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,487
Did you know about this?

464
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,324
He's from Europe. It's different there.

465
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,700
More for me.

466
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,953
So Kurt is a pervert.

467
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,955
How about that?

468
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,373
He certainly had me fooled.

469
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,418
Mr. Cosgrove, do you want me
to invite the girls in?

470
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,336
I knew queers existed.

471
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,671
I just don't want to work with them.

472
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,258
What, he's the first homo
you ever met in advertising?

473
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,388
You think Smitty's in love?

474
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,350
Which bathroom does he use?

475
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,269
Joan, get the girls in here.

476
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,863
What are you reading?

477
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,782
William Faulkner.

478
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,414
I took a survey of American literature.

479
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,957
So you're in school?

480
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,334
I was at Pembroke.

481
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:59,839
Willy has a house in Rhode Island,
so it seemed convenient.

482
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,591
Didn't fit.

483
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,552
Is it good?

484
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,970
Sex is good.

485
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,972
This book is just okay.

486
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,476
I like sex.

487
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,647
You do, too. I can telI.

488
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,324
Greta and Carlos are arguing.

489
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,912
I knew they had problems.

490
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,622
Greta has.

491
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,332
Carlos never had any.

492
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,464
Good morning.

493
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,798
Do you hear them in there?

494
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,219
The humiliations have been spectacular.

495
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,889
Christian is coming with the children.

496
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,933
I hope you don't mind.

497
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,186
No matter how late I show up,
I'm never later than Christian.

498
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,816
Look at him.

499
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,320
You are so beautiful.

500
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,784
You are a brat.

501
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,452
She has her mother's temperament.

502
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,538
That's why you love me.

503
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,793
I make beautiful babies, don't I?

504
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,088
I'll see you outside.

505
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,717
That's your father?

506
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,097
He doesn't want people to think he's old.

507
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,688
Yes, it's Peter Campbell
from Sterling Cooper

508
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,147
for Clarence Hastings.

509
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,899
Is there any way we can meet here?

510
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,652
I can't drive, and there doesn't
seem to be a taxi

511
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,612
that will take me to Pasadena.

512
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,615
We can meet by the pool.

513
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,170
Thank you. How are you two today?

514
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,638
Duck Phillips.

515
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,223
Saint John Powell, how are you?

516
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,975
Capital, capital.

517
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,518
This is Alec Martin.

518
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,936
Duck Phillips.

519
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,442
By Jove, man, catch up.

520
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,194
I have a bit of a cold .

521
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,738
WelI, it's warm already.

522
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,072
It'll open up the passages.

523
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,949
It's warm, or he would have drunk it.

524
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,329
So, how are you finding New York?

525
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,705
Brief.

526
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,291
We're going to visit
a candy plant for Cadbury.

527
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,876
Then it's fate that l caught you here.

528
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,336
You say fate.

529
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,130
I say another round, garcon.

530
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,174
Have mine.

531
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,139
If you're not drinking, what's this about?

532
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,561
I keep thinking how I miss
doing things your way.

533
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,566
Two years ago, you said
you wanted to come here

534
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:06,942
and be with your children.

535
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,986
They're grown.

536
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,909
It's not a good time.

537
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,702
I'm not going to take no for an answer.

538
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,746
I wouldn't expect you to.

539
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,920
You know, if we were hiring,
you would be at the top of our list.

540
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,007
That's too bad.

541
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,426
I love you New York ad men.

542
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,684
To our noble profession.

543
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,453
How old are your children?

544
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,915
Alec's wife is about to have their first.

545
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,378
Do you think that I have
nothing to offer you?

546
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,966
No, of course not.

547
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,468
You represent
over 20 American companies,

548
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,470
doing business in Europe.

549
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,140
I know you want a U .S. presence.

550
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,601
You're wasting your time doing things
like digging around here for Cadbury.

551
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,770
And you could make a difference?

552
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,107
What if I were to bring you
every account at Sterling Cooper?

553
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,192
Fully serviced and completely satisfied?

554
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,863
What are you talking about?

555
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,365
I'm suggesting that you buy Sterling Cooper.

556
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,908
There are very few client conflicts.

557
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,745
All you have to do
is change the welcome mat.

558
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,455
I didn't know it was for sale.

559
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,041
Roger Sterling has a 20-year-old fiancée,

560
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,628
and his wife's lawyer is not going
to leave him a pot to piss in.

561
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,178
Alec, would you excuse us?

562
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,487
Did he send you here with a price?

563
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,989
Send me here?

564
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,700
51 %  will cost you
a lot less than you think,

565
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,785
plus a finder's fee.

566
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,119
Two percent.

567
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,413
I want to be in charge
of all international business,

568
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,998
and l have to be president.

569
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,751
Creative reports to me,
or the whole thing falls apart.

570
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,636
Thank you for thinking of us.

571
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,556
To old friends.

572
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,854
Hello.

573
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,524
Did you have any trouble finding me?

574
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,858
Neighbors.

575
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,068
Right.

576
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,112
Would you like some wine?

577
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,489
Very much.

578
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,094
Listen, in the office,
I hope you weren't embarrassed.

579
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,639
No. It's okay. It's good.

580
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,935
WelI, if you have a man

581
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,312
that you'd like to go
to the concert with tonight,

582
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,856
I completely understand.

583
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,901
Are you not on the trip tonight?

584
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,450
I don't know why I pick the wrong boys.

585
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,453
You're drinking sad.

586
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,541
I don't know.

587
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,337
What's wrong with me?

588
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,300
You are old style.

589
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,637
No, l'm not.

590
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,225
This is not modern office,
a working woman.

591
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,270
What are you talking about?

592
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,063
I fix you.

593
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,943
We should leave.

594
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,489
Each time, Bob Dylan is late.

595
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,325
He will not miss us a half hour.

596
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,576
Sit.

597
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,663
Look at me. I am very good.

598
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,042
Just a trim.

599
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,919
Yes.

600
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,894
For you.

601
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,937
Oh, my God.

602
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,940
It's okay. It's good.

603
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,788
We're headed to Lyford Cay, Nassau.

604
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,166
Why?

605
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,170
It's what we do.

606
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,048
Something about taxes.

607
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,967
It's very different than here.

608
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,222
I think you'd like it.

609
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:40,985
You'll need a tuxedo.

610
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,320
Will I?

611
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,741
You don't need a passport,

612
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,452
unIess you want to follow us to Capri after.

613
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,414
Stephanie's uncle's an ambassador.

614
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,709
Joy.

615
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,796
My father will take care of you.

616
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,756
He likes having you around.

617
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,175
You're beautiful and you don't talk too much.

618
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,723
I'm not possessive.

619
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,226
You can be with anyone you want.

620
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,325
Hello, Joy. Who is this?

621
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,578
Christian, this is Don.

622
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,413
Bernard and Amelia.

623
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,916
Hello.

624
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,418
Hello there.

625
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,212
Did Isabel ring?

626
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,922
Why would she?

627
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,133
Because I'm sick of her attorneys.

628
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,719
These are my children.
They should be with me.

629
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,557
Are you in Edward's room?

630
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,310
You can have it.

631
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,478
Thank you.

632
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:01,023
As you can see, we're very tired.

633
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,447
Come, Bernard.

634
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,786
You gave away our room?

635
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,084
Looks like someone doesn't want to sleep.

636
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,124
Come in.

637
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,710
Joyce seems to have stepped away.

638
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,798
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane
accidentally opened this.

639
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,633
Thank you, Joan.

640
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,221
My, oh, my. A case.

641
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,140
They're all there. I checked.

642
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,183
All the card says is that it's for you .

643
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,728
WelI, thank you, Miss Holloway.

644
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,272
Why don't you just take this?

645
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,274
As a finder's fee.

646
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,608
A whole bottle?

647
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,901
It's the good stuff.

648
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,987
I know. Thank you.

649
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,155
Anything else?

650
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,364
No, thank you.

651
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,297
The town of Oxford is an armed camp,

652
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,758
following riots that accompanied
the registration of the first Negro

653
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,219
in the university's 1 1 8-year history.

654
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,222
James H. Meredith was formally enrolled
in the University of Mississippi--

655
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,599
Hello, all.

656
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,850
How the hell was California?

657
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,977
Looks like Draper let you off the leash.

658
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,228
Did you see this?

659
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:06,315
Yes, I did. Strange, isn't it?

660
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,108
Americans are free, in short,

661
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,320
to disagree with the law,
but not to disobey it.

662
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,613
For any government of laws. . .

663
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,780
So, how was it?

664
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,991
Spectacular, business-wise,

665
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,785
but I don't know that I'd want to live there.

666
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,662
Here. These are for everybody.

667
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,206
I'd like to see it for myself.

668
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,749
What's wrong with it?

669
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,792
The people.

670
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,628
I don't know.

671
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,796
I'm glad to be home.

672
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,757
Has Don checked in? Is he here?

673
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,634
No. I don't think so.

674
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,594
. . .by force, or threat of force,

675
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,971
could long deny the commands. . .

676
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,431
You look different.

677
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,266
It's my hair.

678
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,018
Right.

679
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,603
Kurt's a homo.

680
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,231
. . .no judge would be sure of his. . .

681
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:04,748
So. . .are you leaving us?

682
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,083
No.

683
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,043
So? What, then?

684
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,754
What if I told you that
the international divisions

685
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,506
of General Foods, Bird's Eye,

686
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,508
Campbell's Soup, Chevron Oil,

687
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,051
Lever Brothers, Hoover,

688
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,803
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines,

689
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,640
and Chrysler can all be part
of Sterling Cooper?

690
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,184
How is that possible?

691
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,853
Saint John Powell,
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

692
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,272
called me the other day.

693
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,775
They want to open up a New York office
to deal with their American clients.

694
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,612
They love the idea of just sticking
a key in the door at Sterling Cooper.

695
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,783
Really?

696
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,493
Is this as solid as American Airlines?

697
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,329
I guess you're happy having to scramble

698
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,206
on the third tier of this industry,

699
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,459
waiting for minor divisions
of major companies to drop in your lap.

700
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,630
On the table will be mountains of money,

701
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,717
internationaI prestige,
a chance at going public,

702
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,302
and we don't have to change our name.

703
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,974
I guess we could think about it.

704
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,644
No. I need to know that you're open to this.

705
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,981
If so, I'm giving them five business days
to try to impress us

706
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,899
with a price for controlling
interest in the agency.

707
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,484
There he is.

708
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,070
There's the man I heard so much about.

709
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:19,740
Five days to make an offer.

710
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,451
Or you can give me a price,
and I'll pass it on.

711
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:26,496
No. Let them open the kimono.

712
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,419
Daddy, Daddy, over here!

713
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,546
This water's cold.

714
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,509
Stop splashing.

715
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,929
Hello. lt's Dick Whitman.

716
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,309
Yeah.

717
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,106
I'd love to see you.

718
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,315
Soon.

719
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,194
No. I didn't bring it with me.

720
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,445
Hold on.

721
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,419
I'll see you soon.
