1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,634
All right, hold on.
I got the turn up here.

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,353
Oh! How cool was that?

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,230
That was way cool!

4
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,070
- My turn.
- Sorry, that's not allowed.

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,988
I just signed
15 pages of forms saying

6
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,200
- you gotta rideon the back.
- I don't see any lawyers around.

7
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,285
- You know that's not the point.
- No.

8
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,288
You just wanna keep
all the fun to yourself.

9
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,708
Come on, Dad!

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,169
You go over 15, we're pulling
over, all right? I mean it.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,630
- You're the best.
- All right, get on there.

12
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,841
- Put on your goggles.
- Okay.

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,802
- Ready?
- Got the clutch in?

14
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,929
All right, that's my boy.

15
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,487
Adam, you're going too fast,
slow it down!

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,660
I mean it, you're going too fast.
Slow down!

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,286
Adam!

18
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,005
Let go of the throttle!

19
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,218
Adam!

20
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,429
Adam! No!

21
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,425
What've you got?
Sixteen-year-old, status post,

22
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,344
ATV crash,
40% burns on his body.

23
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,887
Nasotracheal intubation.

24
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,889
Start a bag of lactated
Ringer's, wide open...

25
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,015
- Will he be okay?
- We'll be with you when we can.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,559
Get him out!

27
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,561
Wait, wait, wait!

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,731
I'll start fluids.
Let's go get him hooked up.

29
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,984
Watch the line.

30
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,673
- Been looking for you.
- Been avoiding you.

31
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,882
Burn Unit can handle it.

32
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,678
If they could handle it,
they wouldn't be asking for you.

33
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,640
- Is that a journal?
- Friend wrote an article.

34
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,933
In Hindi?

35
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,311
They have a cutting-edge
neuroscience program in India.

36
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,689
It says so right on the cover.

37
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,653
Kid's heart rate's messed.

38
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,947
Tachycardia
can be explained by the burn.

39
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,575
I assume
the Burn Unit knew that.

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,620
His potassium's low.

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,622
Which can also be explained
by the burn.

42
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,125
Except I'm sure the Burn Unit's
pumping him with fluids

43
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,711
which means his potassium
should be going up, not down.

44
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,504
Could be amphetamines.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,423
Or bacteria
lunching on his heart.

46
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,676
Or cardiomyopathy,
or some other very bad thing.

47
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,553
He needs an EKG.

48
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,688
Okay, no skin, no EKG.

49
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,065
Is he even
gonna survive the burn?

50
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,443
What, you got
a date or something?

51
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,029
Forty percent of his body.

52
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,698
If the Burns Unit
can prevent an infection,

53
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,700
his body will regenerate
maybe 10%,

54
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,745
surgeons will do 20 or so grafts,
six months in this room,

55
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,290
he'll end up with a series of nasty
scars, maybe some pain,

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,625
but he'll live.

57
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,627
Unless his heart shuts down

58
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,465
'cause we can't figure out what's causing
the low potassium and tachycardia.

59
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,552
We need help from a Belgian doc
named Einthoven.

60
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,970
He's dead.

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,891
While he was alive, he invented a little
dittie called the Galvanometer.

62
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,059
Where do we get one?

63
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,854
Go to any electronics store
that's been open since before 1905.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,775
There's a good chance they've got one
in a corner in the basement.

65
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,695
We need an audio-visual setup
for the lecture hall.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,697
- What for?
- For the lecture.

67
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,158
- What lecture?
- Dr. Weber's lecture.

68
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,870
- Who is Dr. Weber?
- A neurologist, I think.

69
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,289
The memo was from you.

70
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,798
- Where is my assistant?
- She left.

71
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,091
- When?
- Wednesday.

72
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,635
- Seriously?
- Well, the temp agency sent someone,

73
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,803
but she got lost.

74
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,514
Well, when she gets here,
fire her.

75
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,828
Oh, yeah.

76
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,580
- Did you issue this memo?
- Look at that.

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
Congratulations.

78
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,086
The patient that has been in a
coma for two years and counting

79
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,587
is still in a coma.

80
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,047
This is not my signature.

81
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,632
I don't know
anything about this guy.

82
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,552
I'm supposed to introduce him?
Have lunch?

83
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,390
- The coma patient has a migraine?
- Oh, no, no, no.

84
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,642
No, I gave him medication
to prevent a migraine.

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,310
That's a migraine.

86
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,521
Increased flow velocity
in his cerebral arteries.

87
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,441
I did subsequently give him
nitroglycerin, which could possibly...

88
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,528
You induced a migraine
headache in a coma patient?

89
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,449
I gave him a little headache, similar
to the one you're giving me now.

90
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,993
Have you even read
an ethical guideline?

91
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,038
Well, it would be wrong to try out a
new migraine prevention medication

92
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,415
on someone
who can actually feel pain.

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,626
- Did you sign this?
- Yeah.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,381
We can talk later about
the appropriate discipline.

95
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,844
Because of the burn,

96
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,513
we can't perform any of our
normal tests to see what's wrong.

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,099
So we're going to try
a Galvanometer.

98
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,895
It picks up a pulse
in the wrists and the ankles.

99
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,565
Hopefully it'll tell us why
his heart rhythm is abnormal.

100
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,735
- What have I done to him? I...
- It was an accident.

101
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,112
All right? So...

102
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,448
He's got all these burns

103
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,533
and now there's something
wrong with his heart?

104
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,578
We're trying to figure out if
the two are somehow connected.

105
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,664
- Had he been sick lately?
- No, nothing.

106
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,291
Anything unusual
with his behavior?

107
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,001
- Had he been tired a lot?
- Nothing.

108
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,339
He was great, he was happy, he was
just having a great time, and then...

109
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,967
If he was experimenting with
amphetamines or cocaine...

110
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,135
No.

111
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,597
We gave him some pot
about a year ago, to try...

112
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,099
It was just once.

113
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,643
We thought if we took the mystery
out of drugs and alcohol,

114
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,144
the less he'd experiment.

115
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,647
We'll know more
after the tests.

116
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,443
It looks like
they're gonna electrocute him.

117
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,946
Plug it in.

118
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,990
You plug it in.

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,618
Fine. Give me the cord.

120
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,543
Works.

121
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,630
Prominent U waves.

122
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,591
No inverted T wave.
No ischemia.

123
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,385
Q wave normal.

124
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,804
That's not good.

125
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,852
Okay, turn it off. Turn it off!

126
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,854
- What's happening?
- What is that?

127
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,313
The seizure's getting...

128
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,107
Can't you stop that?

129
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,949
Who electrocuted my patient?

130
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,951
- He had a seizure.
- He wasn't electrocuted.

131
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,620
What does the seizure tell us?
Move.

132
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,997
What are you looking for?

133
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,792
Same as you are, love, acceptance,
solid return on an investment.

134
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,377
Differential diagnosis. Go.

135
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,337
Could be epilepsy
or seizure disorder.

136
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,883
Not with the tachycardia. It
could be a virus in his brain.

137
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,093
Your specificity's impressive.

138
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,845
Adrenoleukodystrophy.

139
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,054
Could be MS.

140
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,974
The seizures could be caused by
plaques and lesions on the brain.

141
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,602
Well, let's find out which.
Get him an MRI.

142
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,395
No nuclear imaging!

143
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,484
He wouldn't survive the move to Radiology.
MRI and CT scan are both out.

144
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,863
Okay, lumbar puncture will tell
us if his proteins are elevated,

145
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,114
at least we can exclude MS.

146
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,241
We can't do
a lumbar puncture either.

147
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,162
You're cramping my exits.

148
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,039
Don't tell me,
no skin on his spine.

149
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,125
We'd be inserting a needle into an
area that's teeming with bacteria.

150
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,091
If he doesn't have a brain infection
already, we'd give him one for sure.

151
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,756
There's no other way
to look at a brain.

152
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,926
Transcranial
Doppler Sonography.

153
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,221
She said "brain",
not "pregnant woman's uterus."

154
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,015
They do sound alike. I used one
to look at a brain this morning.

155
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,684
Why didn't you take the patient
to Radiology, get an MRA?

156
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,895
Obviously
I was doing something illegal.

157
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,314
Using nuclear imaging
would have raised questions.

158
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,150
You're not gonna get a diagnosis
of MS from a sonogram.

159
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,319
Not definitively,
but patients with MS

160
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,280
have more reactive neurons
in their occipital cortex.

161
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,452
Okay then.

162
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,500
Thank you for all coming
to today's lecture

163
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,669
by Dr. Phillip Weber,

164
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,755
who is our guest today
at our hospital

165
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,259
to talk about headaches.

166
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,347
Dr. Weber is at the Weber Center
for Pain, that makes sense.

167
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,350
Weber, Weber.
So please welcome Dr. Weber!

168
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,986
Thank you Dr. Cuddy.

169
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,908
I suppose I should tell you a
little bit more about myself.

170
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
I went to school in Virginia.

171
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,117
You've never been to one of
these things in your life.

172
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,500
- Who is this guy?
- No idea.

173
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,795
What's with the outfit?

174
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,090
Sudden chills
and light sensitivity.

175
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,925
Inexplicable.

176
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,221
I received my medical degree
at Johns Hopkins University,

177
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,683
where I studied under
Brightman and Gilmar...

178
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,560
Hmm. He must be good.

179
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,688
You went to Hopkins, and studied
under Brightman and Gilmar.

180
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,273
Shh.

181
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,609
Helped me win the Doyle
Internship at the Mayo Clinic.

182
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,696
You were supposed
to get the Doyle Internship.

183
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,827
This guy's Von Lieberman? The guy who
got you thrown out for cheating?

184
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,581
The dean threw me out. Von
Lieberman just ratted on me.

185
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,958
This guy's name is Weber,
not Von Lieberman.

186
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,295
I call Weber Von Lieberman,
way eviler.

187
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,713
Shh.

188
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,885
1D receptors have improved the
acute treatment of migraines,

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,429
to this point...

190
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,972
So what's the plan?

191
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,517
You gonna wait until he bends
over and make a fart sound?

192
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm not here about the past.
He's a bad scientist.

193
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,734
Well, you cheated off him,
how bad can he be?

194
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,279
He got the answer wrong.

195
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,580
Are they trying to wake him up?

196
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,957
They can't do that, right?
He'll be in too much pain.

197
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,418
Don't worry, he's still under.

198
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,588
But the brain never completely
sleeps, it's always working.

199
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,300
Controlling your heart rate,
breathing, temperature.

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,387
The eyes
respond to visual stimuli.

201
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,473
Blood flow increases
in certain areas of the brain

202
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,141
and we can track that
with a sonogram.

203
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,562
With MS, blood vessels are more
reactive, so flow is faster.

204
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,898
If Adam has an infection,

205
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,401
there'd be swelling, which
would constrict the arteries.

206
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,778
And the flow would be slower.

207
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,656
Chase.
Near the subarachnoid space.

208
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,083
Data from control subjects were
analyzed of a two-way ANOVA

209
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,294
with status and side
as within-subject factors.

210
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,299
You stalked this guy for 20 years
just for this shot to humiliate him?

211
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,343
I'm trying to learn.

212
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,846
Vessels without
significant rebound...

213
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,515
He doesn't even know
what that means.

214
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,183
You're gonna interrupt him,
aren't you?

215
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,810
If I have a question.

216
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,854
And what's that
gonna accomplish?

217
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,649
Why can't you just enjoy this? Why
can't you just be happy for me?

218
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:00,154
You have got to find less debilitating
outlets than humiliating people.

219
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,615
I hear bowling is more fun
than stalking.

220
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,742
But I'm better at this.

221
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,412
If "P" is less than
point-zero...

222
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,873
Blow a ton of money
on a plasma TV.

223
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,418
We found a subarachnoid bleed.

224
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,422
Bleed in the head
isn't causing seizures.

225
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,633
It could be. 10% with damage to
cerebral cortex have a seizure.

226
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,427
Or bacterial meningitis.

227
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,554
- Viral encephalitis?
- There's no way to tell without...

228
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,930
Shut up!

229
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,433
Excuse me.

230
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,102
Not you.

231
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,772
You know, if my lecture is
interrupting your meeting, I can wait.

232
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,778
As your people say in India.
Appreciate it.

233
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,574
We'll figure out why later.
Fix the bleed or he dies.

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,701
Talk to you in a couple hours.

235
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm in the subarachnoid space.

236
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,179
- Can you get it?
- Think so.

237
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,761
Put the probe back where it
was so I can see the wire!

238
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,851
We're looking for the bleed
in...

239
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:17,105
Look when I get there, I'm flying
blind without a contrast CT here!

240
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,619
And with a p-value
of less than 0.001,

241
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,249
we have strong statistical evidence that
this drug prevents migraine headaches

242
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,793
without daily administration.

243
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,045
Excuse me, Doctor.

244
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,713
He knows his field
better than you do.

245
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,759
It's always been my understanding that,
unless you follow a daily regimen,

246
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,886
no drug can prevent a migraine.

247
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,846
That's why they call it
a breakthrough.

248
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,182
That's why
you call it a breakthrough.

249
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,394
No, the pharmaceutical company
sponsoring my clinical trials

250
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,771
also hails it
as a breakthrough.

251
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,399
I'm sure your wife
and lawyer do, too.

252
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,152
Is there anybody who doesn't
stand to make a fortune from it

253
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,571
calling it a breakthrough?

254
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,863
Who are you?

255
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,324
Just a lunatic
who desperately needs a hobby.

256
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,410
How exactly
do these studies work?

257
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,412
Do you give this drug
to a bunch of people,

258
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,291
and if they don't get a migraine,
you go, "Voilà, my drug works"?

259
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,875
Excuse me, miss?

260
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,044
Do you have cancer?

261
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,465
Wow! Mango juice
prevents cancer.

262
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,303
Perhaps I should have taken my
medication before this lecture.

263
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,684
We had a very specific control
group, chronic migraine sufferers.

264
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,971
I don't have time to go through
all the math right now,

265
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,356
- but the incidence was dramatically...
- Sure, in India.

266
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,693
Two plus two
equals five there, right?

267
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,029
Do I know you?

268
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,616
I know your math skills.
They blow.

269
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,326
Touché.

270
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,286
You sound very familiar.

271
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,205
Why did you publish it in an
obscure journal in India?

272
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:02,002
Why not publish it in really, really
cool head cases of South Philly?

273
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,713
Neuroscience New Delhi
is a respected journal.

274
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,383
Yeah. The guy running Slurp N' Gulp
tells me it's one of the best.

275
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,385
Get a hooker, anything.

276
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,222
See, I'm thinking that publishing
studies is probably the easiest way

277
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,850
to get a pharmaceutical company
to give you a reach-around.

278
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,062
And choosing a journal that no one
can actually read, well, that's...

279
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,396
That's shrewd.

280
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,192
- I know I know you.
- Sure you do, Dick.

281
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,610
The name's Philip.

282
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,821
My bad. Something to do
with your face.

283
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,199
I always think
your name is Dick.

284
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,284
- House?
- Here.

285
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,998
Medical school was 20 years ago.
Give it a rest. Grow up.

286
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,795
Yeah. You were always the grown-up.
Do the responsible thing, tattletale!

287
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,382
- You cheated!
- I cheated then, you're cheating now!

288
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,429
Your drug doesn't work.

289
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,011
Oh, yes, you would like to believe that
because it plays right into your fantasy...

290
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,097
- I tested it.
- Oh, really?

291
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,433
What are your parameters?
Where's your study?

292
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,396
Room 2134.

293
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,148
- One patient?
- The coma patient?

294
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,276
You haven't changed a bit.

295
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:13,073
You took shortcuts in med school,
you're taking shortcuts now.

296
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,410
You cannot test this
on an abnormal brain.

297
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,539
That's so close-minded. He's
not abnormal, he's special.

298
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,167
Cerebral cortex
atrophies in coma patients.

299
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,630
You need live,
conscious people.

300
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,761
You don't know everything,
House!

301
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,476
Something
that disrupts brain function.

302
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,355
Plaques are perfect. Interrupt
neuronal communication.

303
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,607
- MS?
- No, MS is complicated.

304
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,486
I think this is more basic. It's
just tachycardia and seizures.

305
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,656
How much longer the Burn Unit guys
gonna keep him in that thing?

306
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,617
Lecture's over, let's go.
House wants to...

307
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,414
Adam's waking up.

308
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,416
Get the anesthesiologist
in here now.

309
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,876
He's in pain.

310
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,463
That's not pain.

311
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,048
Need some help in here!

312
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,695
Adam had an orgasm.

313
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,450
What? You mean,
while he was sedated...

314
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,458
What's wrong?

315
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,878
I'm having a migraine.

316
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,713
Are you okay?

317
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,216
Yes.

318
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,219
I was right.

319
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,316
I'm gonna knock you out
for a couple of hours.

320
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,402
No, I got work to do.

321
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,405
Just give me sumatriptan
for the pain

322
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,116
and verapamil
so it doesn't recur.

323
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,456
I heard the patient had fun
in the hyperbaric chamber.

324
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,457
Yeah.

325
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,294
Gotta schedule me
some time in there.

326
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,674
Weber's meds
aren't even legal in the U.S.

327
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,676
It's legal in India.

328
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,846
I was disoriented.

329
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,937
Moving around is a bad idea.

330
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,982
Hey, if you feel chest pain,
you need to let me know.

331
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,985
Verapamil can cause
congestive heart failure.

332
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,195
Nothing can hurt my heart.

333
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:46,494
Hey, you're gonna feel some dizziness.
Definitely gonna be constipated.

334
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,003
Differential diagnosis
for getting off.

335
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,588
Is he gonna be okay?

336
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,215
No. Something's seriously wrong
with him.

337
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:03,845
Differential diagnosis
for ejaculation.

338
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,849
Don't make me say it again.

339
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,143
We're not stalling,
we just don't know.

340
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,436
Then guess.

341
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,856
- Could pain medication cause an orgasm?
- I wish.

342
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,900
Maybe pain caused the orgasm.

343
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,278
You get a tattoo, the brain releases
endorphins which create pleasure.

344
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,073
Most people don't orgasm
from a needle prick.

345
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,991
Well, Chase has a point.

346
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,703
The brain is like a huge train
station, if the switches...

347
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,042
You're the neurologist,
talk for me.

348
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,254
If sensory information got misinterpreted
by the medial forebrain bundle,

349
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,257
it's possible for bad to feel
good, and good to feel bad.

350
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,928
He's a lucky kid. Let's not
fix him until the burns heal.

351
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,097
So what attacks
the medial forebrain bundle?

352
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,265
Infective neuropathies,
vasculitic neuropathies...

353
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,518
Krabbe's disease,
metachromatic leukodystrophy.

354
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,270
All very bad things.

355
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,148
No way to look for any of them
in his condition.

356
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,441
Could be an infection.

357
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,168
I said infection
about eight seconds ago.

358
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,237
You listed
some brain infections.

359
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:06,950
But what if it's just a regular old
infection festering in the burned skin?

360
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,452
Pus on his arm isn't causing
problems in the forebrain.

361
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,248
He's on 20 different medications
to manage his pain, his heart,

362
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,916
how often he urinates.

363
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,544
His brain is like a waiter
that's got too many...

364
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,296
Hey, hey. I do the metaphors.

365
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,092
The brain is stressed.

366
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,178
An infection elsewhere
could put it over the edge.

367
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,389
So we just wait for his burns
to heal to see if you're right?

368
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,809
If you're wrong, he doesn't
have that kind of time.

369
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,812
Dominic Larrey.

370
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,690
He another dead doctor?

371
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,359
He's Napoleon's
Surgeon in Chief.

372
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,153
Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

373
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,487
By amputating legs.

374
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,156
And with bugs.

375
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,122
Maggots are implanted
directly into Adam's burns.

376
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,168
Maggots, they eat dead people,
I...

377
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,588
Maggots eat dead flesh.
Only dead flesh.

378
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,258
So they're perfectly suited
to clean wounds.

379
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,304
They also kill the bacteria
that thrive in injured tissues.

380
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,384
Dr. Jekyll, I presume.

381
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:52,305
They found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.
The police wanna ask you a few questions.

382
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,890
I need something
to wash it down.

383
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,059
Coffee? Bad idea.

384
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,270
- You're better off with water!
- Coffee's closer.

385
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,191
Foolproof plan, by the way.

386
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,026
Either his meds would work,

387
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,656
and you'd be in psychic pain
because Von Evil is gonna be rich.

388
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,327
Or they wouldn't, and you
get to be in agony all day.

389
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,456
Perfect lose-lose situation.
Very you.

390
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,334
- I had to prove...
- You've proved nothing.

391
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,798
Right. This isn't a migraine.

392
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,717
Yeah. "Dear New England
Journal of Medicine",

393
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,428
I took this guy's drug
and still got a headache.

394
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,349
"Thus, scientifically proving
that my arch enemy is an idiot."

395
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,600
You just wanted the pain.

396
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,312
Meds are supposed
to prevent migraine.

397
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,939
You get distracted by pain.

398
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,733
Leaves less room for the things
you don't wanna think about.

399
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,195
Like the Flyers sucking,
or the price of gas,

400
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,615
or the fact that you pushed the
love of your life out of your life.

401
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,451
God, I wish the pain
would go away.

402
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,710
Next time you need to get your mind
off her, stick a needle in your eye.

403
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,584
It's less annoying to the rest
of us when you can still walk.

404
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,467
Did you sleep here?

405
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,347
Lower.

406
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,975
Do you want a pillow?

407
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,561
Not softer, lower.

408
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,814
Frequency of your voice
is grating.

409
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,566
You should've been better
by now.

410
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,318
I'm super.

411
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,944
Patient?

412
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,989
The maggots
did great for the burn.

413
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,283
But the brain waves
are still all over the map.

414
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,662
Which means your regular old infection
isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

415
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,581
Which means there's
an underlying condition,

416
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,334
which means we've gotta
get inside his head.

417
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,419
Do a lumbar puncture.

418
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,546
We've already established
that we can't get a lumbar...

419
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,632
C2, C3.

420
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,717
No. No. No way.

421
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,804
I only saw a cervical tap once,
and that guy got paralyzed.

422
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:01,434
Ask the parents if they prefer to have
their son in a wheelchair or dead.

423
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,733
Something's causing his brain
to lose control.

424
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,693
Eventually it'll shut off.

425
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,445
We need to do a lumbar puncture

426
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,198
to get some of the fluid in
his spine so we can test it.

427
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,242
You need us to sign a consent?

428
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,244
I have to warn you.

429
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,330
There's a serious risk
of paralysis or death.

430
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,999
Are you saying
we shouldn't do this?

431
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,876
You have to do this.

432
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,803
Then why are you telling us
what can go wrong?

433
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,082
- I just think you should know...
- Either you're cruel

434
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,966
or this clipboard is a way
for you to cover your ass,

435
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,759
- in case you cripple our son.
- This isn't his fault.

436
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,929
No, it's not. It's yours, that's
what you keep telling me.

437
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,555
My son is lying in there
half-dead,

438
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,934
I am just trying to find a way
to get through this.

439
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,186
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

440
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,249
Needle.

441
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,309
- It's not going in.
- Don't force it.

442
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,893
I'm going one space higher.

443
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,230
It's too close to his brain
stem, it'll herniate.

444
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,442
- You're gonna paralyze him.
- You're not helping.

445
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,193
His blood pressure's spiking,
stop.

446
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,361
I can get it.

447
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,989
He's 180 over 120,
he's gonna stroke.

448
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,201
I'm in the space.
Give me the vial.

449
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,221
He doesn't have MS
or an infection.

450
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,392
His proteins aren't elevated?

451
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,312
Wrong protein. IgM, not IgG.

452
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,273
Elevation was probably caused
by the bleed.

453
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,695
What if there was tingling in his
extremities prior to the crash?

454
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,824
- How can you still be on MS?
- I gotta be on something.

455
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,454
Something's interrupting his
neurons' chitchat, like lesions.

456
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,247
We can't scan for them.

457
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,292
The only test we can do, we
just did and it was negative.

458
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,461
He has no tingling,
no numbness.

459
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,130
And you read his history, parents
didn't say anything about...

460
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,715
What about Adam?

461
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:43,054
We can't look into his brain, but
you want us to read his mind?

462
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,473
Good point.

463
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,402
Yeah, you can finish
the sponge bath in a minute.

464
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,696
They're just re-doing his dressings.
He's out, he's fine.

465
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,659
I didn't page you to put him out.
I paged you to wake him up.

466
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,286
Why are these lights
so damn bright?

467
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,330
Thank you.

468
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,416
Come on, I need to talk to him.

469
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,127
House, you can't wake up a burn
victim to play twenty questions.

470
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,170
- It's torture.
- He won't remember.

471
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,840
- He's gonna be in extraordinary...
- God, you're good!

472
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,675
You're putting me to sleep.

473
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,220
I know he's gonna be in pain, I know
you disapprove. I'm his attending.

474
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,805
Wake him up.

475
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,784
Oh, my God!

476
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,287
- I'm Dr. House.
- It hurts!

477
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,414
It's gonna get a lot worse,
so answer fast.

478
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,377
Before the accident, did you experience
any numbness or tingling in your fingers?

479
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,838
You got burned, it's healing,
I need an answer.

480
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,173
It really hurts!

481
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,133
Any tingling
in your arms or legs?

482
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,843
You gotta do something,
I can't...

483
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,346
Adam, you gotta listen to me,
did you feel anything?

484
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:13,352
I pissed in my pants
and then I don't remember...

485
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,436
- Was he okay?
- Get everyone in my office.

486
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,356
Where you going?

487
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,527
Kid's screaming gave me a headache.
I gotta take an aspirin.

488
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,755
House, you okay?
We've been waiting for you.

489
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,220
I'm hallucinating.

490
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,685
Hallucinations with migraines
are pretty uncommon.

491
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,731
- What did you see?
- I saw music.

492
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,193
Sensory deception
makes no sense.

493
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,283
You took something.

494
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,411
The kid's
fighting for his life.

495
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,734
Hey, you find him?

496
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,944
He was hallucinating
in the locker room.

497
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,279
He okay?

498
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,114
He's feeling no pain,
he's high.

499
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,574
Vicodin high?

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,160
Past that. He's seeing sounds.

501
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,204
Took something.

502
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,626
Why is it so dark in here?
It's a beautiful day outside.

503
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,253
Open the shades,
let the sun shine in.

504
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,047
It's nighttime.

505
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,802
- It's still Tuesday, right?
- You look better.

506
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,805
- I took something.
- Mind if I ask what?

507
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,392
Little of this, little of that.

508
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,477
I know
what's wrong with our patient.

509
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,229
He's depressed.

510
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,939
- He told you that when you woke him up?
- Nope.

511
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,732
He told me he pissed his pants
and blacked out.

512
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,069
That's not diagnostic of depression.
Lack of appetite, isolating yourself.

513
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,322
Uncontrollable urination and blacking
out are good predictors of what?

514
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,281
Seizure.

515
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,867
Which means the seizure he had
when you tested his heart

516
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,911
- was at least his second seizure.
- So what?

517
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,677
Depression and seizures
aren't correlated.

518
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,332
No, but you know what is?

519
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,168
Depression
and anti-depression medicine.

520
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,712
Tox screen was clean.

521
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,047
Yeah, but you know how much
crap he's got in his system

522
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,340
for dealing with those burns.

523
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,227
The guy could have the Spanish Armada
floating through his bloodstream

524
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,971
and we wouldn't know about it,
till they started firing cannons.

525
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,558
Antidepressants have been known to cause
seizures in kids, but not orgasms.

526
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,765
This is a brain in trouble.

527
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,854
This is a brain
with too much serotonin.

528
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,691
Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it
doesn't cause the brain to shut down.

529
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,944
Antidepressants fake brains into
thinking they have more serotonin

530
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,195
than they actually do.

531
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,199
Every ten million or so cases
sets off a chain reaction.

532
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,827
Produces too much,
enough to fry itself.

533
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,371
If Adam has Serotonin Storm,
it's deadly.

534
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,498
But treatable. Cyproheptadine.

535
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,292
Unless he doesn't have
Serotonin Storm.

536
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,919
He could just as easily have too
much dopamine as serotonin,

537
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,465
but if it's dopamine, the
cyproheptadine will kill him.

538
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,424
Where are you going?

539
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,509
Gonna talk to the kid again,
he seems nice.

540
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,052
You can't.

541
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,929
Why? Did he say
he doesn't like me?

542
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,183
Anesthesiologist
told the parents what you did.

543
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,351
Everyone's a tattletale.

544
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,485
Is your son depressed?

545
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,530
- No. Who are you?
- I'm Dr. House.

546
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,017
Oh, you're the idiot
who thought...

547
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,784
I heard him screaming
all the way down the hallway.

548
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,710
If I didn't wake him up, I wouldn't
have learned what caused the crash.

549
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,330
He had a seizure.

550
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,585
This wasn't my fault?

551
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,714
Well, if he hadn't had the brain
problem, he wouldn't have the burns.

552
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,925
On the other hand, if you
hadn't put him on the ATV,

553
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,301
he also
wouldn't have the burns.

554
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,345
You can debate your personal
responsibility after I leave.

555
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,055
I need to wake him up again.

556
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,982
I need to know if
he's taking antidepressants.

557
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,099
He's not.

558
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,813
- He's the happiest kid I know.
- But you don't know, do you?

559
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,274
He's my son.

560
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,568
That's sort of my point.

561
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,155
At 16, they'll tell anyone
anything, except their parents.

562
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,865
Adam talks to us
about everything.

563
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,034
Yeah, I know
about the pot and the cocaine.

564
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,036
There was never... Cocaine.
What...

565
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,248
Are you sure?
Are you having him followed?

566
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,834
He told us
when he got drunk at a party.

567
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,710
He told us
when he started having sex.

568
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,420
At 16? Way to go.

569
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,187
He told us when he
cheated on a math test.

570
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,550
He told us when his
girlfriend cheated on him.

571
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,594
- He doesn't hide anything from us.
- But if he was depressed?

572
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,762
He'd tell us.

573
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,015
We don't judge, he's not
depressed, we're sure.

574
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,268
"Bet his life on it" sure?

575
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,855
Just hypothetically.

576
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,440
Yeah.

577
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:37,987
Okay.

578
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,324
Kid's happy.

579
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,286
Happy, happy, happy.

580
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,164
Then we're back to where we started.
Seizure disorders.

581
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,126
Seizure disorders
aren't causing orgasms.

582
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,752
Vascular malformations?

583
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,921
Would've seen it
on the sonogram.

584
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,090
Hepatic encephalopathy?

585
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,301
Liver enzyme tests were normal.

586
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,851
- Where are you going?
- Take a leak.

587
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,110
What are you doing?

588
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,195
You can't come in here,
you're not sterile.

589
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,530
Don't touch our son,
we told you...

590
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,116
Seriously, millions of
bacteria, microbes on you.

591
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,119
He'll die of sepsis.
If you go in there...

592
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,625
I think
he's gonna wake him up again.

593
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,168
I know he is.

594
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,880
House, you can't do this.

595
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,134
Oh, if I had a nickel for every
time I've heard that. Relax.

596
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,763
Are they gonna sue us?
If I'm right, I save his life.

597
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,807
If I'm wrong,
he's dead no matter what I do.

598
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,186
Either way, how much
have I really hurt them?

599
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,354
Leave him alone!

600
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,940
You're not sterile.
Do you wanna kill the kid?

601
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,983
- Give me the syringe.
- No pain, no gain.

602
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,069
Hey, you gotta stop this.

603
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,699
They're right.

604
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,203
- He's not depressed.
- Yeah, sure.

605
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,081
I'm not letting you go
till you give me that syringe.

606
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,166
What's that on his wrist?

607
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,293
A burn.

608
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,796
- Why on his wrist?
- Why not on his wrist?

609
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,758
His back, his torso, everything's a mess.
His forearms are clean.

610
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,094
- Except right there.
- So what?

611
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,846
It's a perfect circle.

612
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:32,059
So a drop of burning gasoline fell
on his wrist, a screw from the ATV.

613
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,186
Maybe.

614
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,157
- Why are you torturing him?
- Does your son smoke?

615
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,868
I'd kill him.

616
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:56,083
So, he can talk to you about sex,
crack, anything except cigarettes.

617
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,129
He has a cigarette burn
on his wrist.

618
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,966
Also a fading nicotine stain
between two fingers.

619
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,970
Bad news, your son has a
filthy, unhealthy habit.

620
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,264
Good news, he's trying to quit.

621
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,516
Bad news,
the quitting's killing him.

622
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,352
Good news,
I can cure him. Bad news...

623
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,316
- Nope, that's the end of it.
- Quitting smoking can kill?

624
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,444
No-smoke meds
are antidepressants.

625
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,612
The crappy ones
you get over the Internet

626
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,449
are loaded with whatever
antidepressants they can get cheap.

627
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:32,911
And since Mommy and Daddy obviously
didn't take him to a pediatrician...

628
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,333
Sorry, I was wrong
about him being depressed.

629
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,252
Treat him.

630
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,354
Hey!

631
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,691
Did you drop acid?

632
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,154
- Why would I do that?
- To annoy me.

633
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,782
Or maybe because
you're miserable,

634
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,243
or because
you want to self-destruct.

635
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,787
Pick one.

636
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,333
How about because LSD acts on
serotonin receptors in the brain,

637
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,169
which can stop
a migraine in its tracks.

638
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,172
I'm just saying
that's also a possibility.

639
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,550
- How did you know about it?
- Cameron is worried about you.

640
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,513
I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours,
if you were functional, she must be wrong.

641
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,390
Either that or I also took a
whole bunch of antidepressants,

642
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,601
which short-circuited the LSD.

643
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,478
I'm just saying
that would also explain it.

644
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,939
Thank you for ruining
my clinical trials.

645
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,024
Pharmaceutical company's
shutting me down.

646
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,401
- You're kidding. Really?
- How could that surprise you?

647
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,486
You sent them an email

648
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,280
complaining about my math,
telling them about your stunt.

649
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,366
I didn't know
people actually read emails.

650
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,053
Delete button's
so conveniently located.

651
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,912
So what's next?
You gonna follow me my whole life?

652
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,747
- Torture me?
- Why would I do that?

653
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,905
You waited 20 years to do this.
What's next?

654
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,960
Break up my marriage?

655
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:07,172
- No. We're even.
- Right.

656
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,301
Oh, thanks for setting me up.

657
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,392
Eye for an eye,
LSD and antidepressants.

658
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,186
Everything in balance.

659
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,356
Buddhists call it Karma. Christians
call it the Golden Rule.

660
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,941
Jews call it...

661
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,321
I don't know, Rabbi Hillel
said something poignant.

662
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,075
Universe
always settles the score.

663
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,328
- Does it?
- No.

664
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,623
But it should.

665
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,260
Do you think you'll ever be able
to look at him and not blame me?

666
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:57,181
Yeah. Will you?

667
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,400
I'm Paula.

668
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,237
- Hey, Paula.
- How you doing?

669
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,950
You work over at the college, or
are you full-time over at the...

670
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,369
I'm looking for a distraction.

671
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,956
You don't need to talk
to do that, do you?
