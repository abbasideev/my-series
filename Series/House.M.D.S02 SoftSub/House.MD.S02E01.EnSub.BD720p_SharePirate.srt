1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,671
Deep-fried shrimp. And lobster.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,342
I never had lobster. What, do
they boil them or grill them?

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,179
Which one's better?
Just get them both.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,056
And I know I need
a strawberry malt.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,768
And then there's those chocolate
donuts, they come in a box.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:23,481
We'll do our best to accommodate. Tomorrow
you'll be moved to a holding cell.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,234
That's where
you'll get your last meal.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,698
You also have a constitutional right
to a spiritual advisor of your choice.

9
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,741
No, I don't need none of that.

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,535
One last thing to think about.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,578
After I read
the execution warrant,

12
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,831
you'll be given an opportunity
to make a statement.

13
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,792
You might wanna take some time and
think about what you wanna say

14
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,669
as your final words.

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,050
Yo, Clarence! You hear that?

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,095
A spiritual advisor
of my choice.

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,723
Don't matter,
you're going to hell anyway.

18
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,767
- You think I'll get another stay?
- You should.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,936
Supreme Court said it ain't
right to kill retards.

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,730
Cut the chatter!

21
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,231
Exercise time.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,960
Be back in an hour. Enjoy.

23
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,904
Huh? What?

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,781
Why did you hit me
so many times, Clarence?

25
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,657
You know why!

26
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,144
- You could have stopped.
- You stabbed me in the back, man.

27
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,004
- Look, I never...
- You couldn't fight fair?

28
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,622
Like you did?

29
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,957
I had a wife and three kids.

30
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,795
You were a sick bastard!
Open the door! Open the door!

31
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,254
Clarence!

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,923
What'd I ever do to you, man?

33
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,966
You better stay in this place.

34
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,594
I was just minding
my own business.

35
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,837
You can't go in there.

36
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,924
Who are you?
And why are you wearing a tie?

37
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,553
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
Can I tell her what it's regarding?

38
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,557
Yes. I would like to know
why she gets a secretary and I don't.

39
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,603
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.

40
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,564
I didn't know
they had a secretarial school.

41
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,525
Well, I hope you took some classes
in sexual harassment law.

42
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,654
Does the word "ka-ching" mean
anything to you? I'm going in now.

43
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,291
Dr. House, we are
in the middle of a meeting.

44
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,244
What's with hiring a male secretary?
J-Date not working out?

45
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,038
He is cute, be careful.

46
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,332
She's not like you,
she can't just walk into a bar

47
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,833
and pick up her soul mate
in 20 minutes.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,502
I met Mark at a fundraiser
that happened to be held at a...

49
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,709
You met me at a strip club.

50
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,715
You were the worst $2 I've ever spent.
We'll catch up later.

51
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,176
Stacy, it's House.
I know you can handle it.

52
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,888
Nothing to handle.
He obviously wants to talk to you alone.

53
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,684
If you have a problem
working with Stacy,

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,186
you should have said so.

55
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,148
What was I supposed to do?
Ask her to leave? That's just rude.

56
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,568
Death row guy. I want the case.

57
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,070
How do you even know about him?

58
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,988
You don't have access
to the hospital's mainframe.

59
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,240
No, but Party-Pants does.

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,535
You stole my password?

61
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,538
Hardly counts as stealing,
it's a pretty obvious choice.

62
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,668
Well, I have already assigned
"death row guy" to Dr. Nolo.

63
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,711
Nolo? Well, I...

64
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,172
I don't wanna say anything bad
about another doctor,

65
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,299
especially a useless drunk.

66
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,884
You are addicted to pain pills.

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,595
Yeah, but I'm not useless.
Tell Nolo I'm taking over.

68
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,098
Dr. Nolo is a
board-certified cardiologist.

69
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,059
Well, good. I'm sure he'll explore
all the usual options

70
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:15,022
for why a guy's heart starts beating so
fast it pumps out air instead of blood.

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,942
Wait a second.
There are no usual options.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,988
How badly do you want this?

73
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,409
I will give you two more
clinic hours this week.

74
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,663
Don't bend over for the soap.

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,990
Just the heart, or the patient have
any other complaints?

76
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,212
Patient's not talking
to anybody.

77
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,547
Where are we going?

78
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,549
You are going
to the clinic for two hours.

79
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,883
Me? Why?

80
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,844
Talk to Cuddy.

81
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,347
She's got me going to Mercer State
Prison, Capital Sentences Unit.

82
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,182
Aren't there better ways
to spend our time?

83
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,519
Good question.
What makes a person deserving?

84
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,062
Is a man who cheats on his wife

85
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,982
more deserving than a man
who kills his wife?

86
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,151
Yeah, actually, he is.

87
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,652
What about a child molester?

88
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,405
Certainly not a good guy,
but he didn't kill anybody.

89
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,575
Maybe he can get
antibiotics, but no MRls.

90
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
What about you?

91
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,455
What medical care should you be
denied for being a car thief?

92
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,707
Tell you what.
Three of you work on a list

93
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,210
of what medical treatments a person loses
based on the crime they committed.

94
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,671
I'll review it when I get back.

95
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,177
Your patient shanked one inmate
his first month here.

96
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,555
Broke another one's neck.
Nearly decapitated one of my guards.

97
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,891
Relax. I got
a great bedside manner.

98
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,560
Too dangerous to house him
in the infirmary.

99
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,063
You don't have to worry,
we've taken every precaution.

100
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,567
I've had my men clear from the cell
all pens, paper clips, and staplers.

101
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,653
Any supplies that might
be used as a weapon.

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,574
Open her up!

103
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,168
For your visit, we've got
him cuffed and shackled.

104
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,670
And yet you're
staying out there.

105
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,676
You're gonna have to give me that.
Wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.

106
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,847
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,557
I'm Dr. Cameron.
How you feeling?

108
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,392
Little cough, no big deal.

109
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,478
Okay, then what you doing here?

110
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,439
I just got a job at the university,
they need a health clearance.

111
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,567
Apparently, I'm a little anemic, so
they made me get some more tests.

112
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,236
Any family history of anemia?

113
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,614
Not that I know of. My mom died
of cancer when I was a kid.

114
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,742
My dad's heart gave out
a couple of years ago.

115
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,661
Brothers and sisters?

116
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,039
I'm afraid it's a short
family history. That's it.

117
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,168
I had a husband once,
but it didn't stick.

118
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:46,090
My tests should be back,
probably in that file.

119
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,675
- Probably.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,681
Is everything okay?

121
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,351
- Did you redo the x-ray?
- Twice.

122
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,689
Well, you don't need a consult.

123
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,235
You know the diagnosis.

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,196
All she has is a cough.

125
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,707
Bluish tinge
to the fingernails. Lips.

126
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,251
- He's hypoxic.
- What's that mean?

127
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,170
It means he's not
getting enough oxygen.

128
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,590
You know how people say
you can't live without love?

129
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,217
Well,
oxygen's even more important.

130
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,183
He's got fluid in his lungs.
Breathing rate of 50.

131
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,109
He needs to be intubated,
put on a respirator.

132
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,561
Don't have a respirator.

133
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,564
Better get one in about an hour,
or you're gonna lose him.

134
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,276
I'll make out a requisition. State's
already sentenced this man to die.

135
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,571
I think the state was
a tad more specific about how.

136
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,737
This is Dr. Gregory House.

137
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,823
I need an ambulance pick-up
at Mercer State Prison.

138
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,161
Wasted call, my men will
stop them at the gate.

139
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,580
No way a death row inmate
leaves my prison.

140
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,416
At least,
not through the front doors.

141
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,717
- You work fast.
- So do you.

142
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,761
- Was that a shot?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,598
It was easy, once I convinced the
clerk to take it to Judge Markham.

144
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,558
She's a sucker for
Eighth Amendment arguments.

145
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,268
Stop, I'm getting turned on.

146
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,603
House!

147
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,022
It was just a consult!

148
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,566
You expect us to shut down
an entire floor for this guy?

149
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,776
Did you do
something to your hair?

150
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
Stacy!

151
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,308
You said
you cleared it with her!

152
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,683
Come on,
you've known me how long?

153
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,365
And you still can't tell
when I'm joshing you?

154
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,617
- Take him back to prison. Now.
- No, can't.

155
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,579
See, ironically, I'm bound by this court
order that your ace attorney got.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,137
I have to make him
all better before

157
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,905
shipping him back for
the state to kill him.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,001
Is it just me, or is that weird?

159
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,962
Anyway, we're walking.

160
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,390
Somebody left this on my chair.

161
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,519
It's clever, 'cause it forces me to either
deal with the file or never sit down again.

162
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,354
Cindy Kramer.
I told her you'd see her.

163
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,855
Well, you shouldn't
have told her that.

164
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,775
She's got metastatic squamous cell
lung cancer. Six months tops.

165
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,194
Have you even looked
at the x-ray?

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,696
No. Just guessing.

167
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,365
It's a new game. If I'm wrong,
she wins a stuffed bear.

168
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,119
A spot on an x-ray doesn't necessarily
mean that she's terminal.

169
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,329
I love children.
So filled with hope.

170
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,498
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcoidosis.

171
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,221
Could be. If she didn't
already have swollen

172
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,378
hilar lymph nodes
on the other lung.

173
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,506
Can we at least
brainstorm for other ideas?

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,057
Thank you.

175
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,395
I still think
pneumonia and sarcoidosis.

176
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,189
But, we should check
for tuberculosis

177
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,484
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

178
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,488
Five stages of dying.

179
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,866
Exactly.

180
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,368
Personally, I think
it's all just New Age crap,

181
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,829
but from your tear-filled,
puppy dog eyes,

182
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,372
I think I've made my point.

183
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,043
Now go tell Cindy whatever-her-name-is
that she's dying.

184
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,173
Tachycardia. Pulmonary edema.
Likely suspects?

185
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,383
The death row guy?

186
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,219
That's who you're working on
instead of Cindy?

187
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,430
God, I've got to learn
not to beat around the bush.

188
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,808
By "dying", I meant
no matter what we do.

189
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,355
Very, very soon she is going to be dead.
Is that still too subtle?

190
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,565
I took an oath to "do no harm".

191
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,776
Yeah, but it's not like they
make you sign it or anything.

192
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,320
We cure your patient,
he goes back to death row.

193
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,072
He goes back to death row,
they kill him.

194
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,823
He stays here and we don't
treat him, he dies.

195
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,700
And I still don't treat
"Cindy Lou Who".

196
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,369
Can we get on with this?

197
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,871
Yeah, I knew I could count
on your help for your homie.

198
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,041
Exactly. I'm black. I sympathize with
guys who grew up in the inner city,

199
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,542
kept down by The Man.

200
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,586
- Makes sense to me.
- It's a bunch of crap!

201
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,881
You can't blame society for the fact
that you chose to become a killer.

202
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,383
The guy's probably
a heroin addict.

203
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,344
That explains the tachycardia,
which caused the pulmonary edema.

204
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,972
How does an inmate on death
row get his hands on heroin?

205
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,393
- Are you serious?
- Man knows prisons.

206
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,812
When we got a yachting
question, we'll come to you.

207
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,565
Okay, drugs it is. Test his
hair, blood, urine, works.

208
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,076
Thanks for getting my back.

209
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,483
I thought you seminary boys
were against the death penalty.

210
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,788
I've left the seminary.

211
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,873
Over their stance
on capital punishment?

212
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,792
I'm against the death penalty
in principle.

213
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,628
In practice, however, watching
a murderer die causes me

214
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,630
a lot less grief
than annoying my boss.

215
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,508
We gotta check you out
before you go in.

216
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,679
Department of Justice
statistics show

217
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,765
that it's a racially motivated
form of punishment.

218
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,351
Black defendants are 10 times more likely
to get a death sentence than whites.

219
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,517
Doesn't mean we need to get
rid of the death penalty.

220
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,398
Just means we need
to kill more white people.

221
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,402
It's okay. You're in a hospital,
we're taking care of you.

222
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,697
Stay calm, you hear me?
Push two milligrams Ativan!

223
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,710
Water. Water.

224
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,846
What's the differential
for being thirsty?

225
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,850
He was just a little dehydrated.
And out of his mind.

226
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,685
We upped his saline drip.
He's fine now.

227
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,481
Blood and urine tests came back clean,
no sign of opiates in his system.

228
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,107
Don't do that.

229
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,735
What? You have some House
theory explaining heroin use

230
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,945
- despite a negative test?
- Nope.

231
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,407
Only I get to write
on the board.

232
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,827
So it's not drugs.

233
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,829
What else can cause a heart
to do wind sprints?

234
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,167
You got the blood work back,
anything out of the ordinary?

235
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,920
His bi-carb is low.

236
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,130
Yeah, but which column?

237
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,896
It could be the result of the
tachycardia, or it could be the cause.

238
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,926
- It's the cause.
- Why, because you want it to be?

239
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,845
Let's see how well that works
with your other patient.

240
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,138
We're just talking
semantics here.

241
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,766
We should put him on a bi-carb
drip and send him back.

242
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,811
Right. Buff his numbers, don't bother
trying to figure out the underlying cause.

243
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,772
I thought you cared
about patients.

244
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,316
Our job isn't to make sure he can
bounce his grandkids on his lap.

245
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,569
Our job is to get him healthy
enough to go back to death row.

246
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,239
Our job is to diagnose him.

247
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,954
What?

248
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,832
Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight,
doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.

249
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,584
Now, go outside and play.

250
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,004
Get Daddy some smokes, and
an arterial blood gas test.

251
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,523
That was impressive. Okay,
what number am I thinking of?

252
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,108
Are you trying to get me fired?

253
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,069
If you didn't want me working
here, why didn't you just say so?

254
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,822
I just don't want you working
right here, in my office.

255
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,824
- Anywhere else in the building is fine.
- Oh.

256
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,825
It's a really big hospital.

257
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,703
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk.
There's gonna be some overlap.

258
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,454
God, I hope
that was a euphemism.

259
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,789
Cuddy just reamed me!

260
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,374
I hope that one means
what I think it means.

261
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,584
For trusting you.

262
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,794
She figured when she hired me
she'd at least have someone

263
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,837
you couldn't walk all over.

264
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,214
The number was six, by the way.

265
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,010
I need to know, can I trust you?

266
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,600
If I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's
approval, my patient would be dead.

267
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,935
Great.

268
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,022
Now I know.

269
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,149
Now we can work together.

270
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,363
I'll be drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

271
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,158
- From my what?
- Runs through your groin.

272
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,194
You think you're gonna stick
me in the jewels with that?

273
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,832
It's really closer to your thigh.
Technically at this point, it seems like

274
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,959
your jewels are more
for display purposes anyway.

275
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,712
Hold up, hold up. Gimme some
painkillers or something.

276
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,966
- A tough guy like you don't need them.
- Forget that, numb me up, man.

277
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,977
You got some gang ink?
Let me see that.

278
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,939
It's a Native American symbol.
It means "the force of life".

279
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,825
That's what you tell all these white
dudes so they let you play doctor.

280
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,945
Yup, got them all fooled.

281
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,283
For real, how a brother like you go from
gang banging to wearing that white coat?

282
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,954
How's a brother like you go from loving
a woman to punching her skull in?

283
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,125
Bitch stepped out.

284
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,635
Sorry about that. Guess I
didn't use enough lidocaine.

285
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,391
Blood gas came back with a pH
of 7.28, and decreased HCO-3.

286
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,309
Which means two things.

287
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,813
Most importantly, Cameron was
wrong about the bi-carb.

288
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,941
And less significantly,
we have a new symptom.

289
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,653
Anion gap acidosis.

290
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,117
Who's chubby? Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

291
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,828
Pretend he's a human being.
What do you got?

292
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,414
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

293
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,333
- He already tested negative.
- That's why I said reconsider.

294
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,836
Back in juvie, I cut up
oregano and sold it as pot.

295
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,671
Is that how you put yourself
through med school?

296
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,424
What if Clarence thought he was taking
heroin, but it was something else?

297
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,844
What "something else" could
lead to anion gap acidosis?

298
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,387
Mudpiles.

299
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,640
Well, you don't have to ask, just
wash your hands before you come back.

300
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,642
Methanol, uremia, diabetes...

301
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,562
Oh, it's a mnemonic.
That makes sense, too.

302
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,565
- Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acid...
- Rewind.

303
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,984
- INH?
- Yahtzee.

304
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,277
Drugs for tuberculosis.

305
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,363
Nearly a quarter of the prison
population is infected with TB.

306
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,617
Clever entrepreneur like Foreman here chops
up his meds, passes it off as heroin.

307
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,162
INH poisoning would explain
all the symptoms.

308
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,624
Who wants to head over to the prison
and find Clarence's secret stash?

309
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,297
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Great! Chase it is.

310
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,052
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting
to make me completely miserable.

311
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,679
You got a prettier mouth.

312
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,599
Better chance the inmates
will open up to you.

313
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,059
Perhaps I'll come out
looking just as monstrous.

314
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,771
I mean,
isn't that what I deserve?

315
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,273
John,
it wasn't your fault.

316
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,944
If your father hadn't slipped you those
drugs, you would have never done...

317
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,950
The man's in a coma!

318
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,369
He didn't mind. I asked.

319
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,455
You're getting crumbs
all over him.

320
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,167
Why do you think they put TVs in
coma patients' rooms, anyway?

321
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,294
Some people think
they can still hear.

322
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,088
Well, so leave them a radio.

323
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,882
His eyes are closed.

324
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,051
Who thinks they can see?

325
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,597
Do you know why people
are nice to other people?

326
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,474
Oh, I know this one!

327
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,435
Because people are good,
decent and caring.

328
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,355
Either that,
or people are cowards.

329
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,859
If I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me.
Mutually-assured destruction.

330
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,737
Exactly.
Are you gonna eat these chips?

331
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,949
Are you gonna get to your point?

332
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,953
You need people to like you.

333
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,747
I don't care if people like me.

334
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,876
Yes, but you need people to like
you because you need people.

335
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,672
Unless you think you can get
the next court order yourself.

336
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,634
If Stacy can't trust you,
you can't use her.

337
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,559
And, that's not even dealing with
the greater agenda of getting her

338
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,478
to dump her husband and fall in
love with you all over again.

339
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,644
We were gonna be
with each other forever!

340
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,400
Look, I know you're friends
with her, but there is a code.

341
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,485
"Bros before hoes, man."

342
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,283
- Crap.
- What is it?

343
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,036
Death row guy is dying.

344
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,583
Bradycardia. His heart rate's
dropped to 30.

345
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,834
It's not gonna hold out
much longer.

346
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,920
You just waiting to call time of death,
or are you gonna give him atropine?

347
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,839
- Temporary fix.
- Right.

348
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,508
Don't know why those diabetics
are all hung up on insulin.

349
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,926
They're just gonna
have to take more.

350
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,012
Atropine's only gonna
buy you a few hours.

351
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,738
We don't even know
what's wrong with him.

352
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,515
Just get out of here.

353
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:37,861
This is Chase.

354
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,946
Did you beat any confessions
out of anybody?

355
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,656
I haven't spoken to any inmates.

356
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,867
Does anybody
do their jobs anymore?

357
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,953
I decided Clarence's life
isn't worth risking mine for.

358
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,747
Appreciate your candor.

359
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,393
Did you even go to the prison, or
are you just out playing polo?

360
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,209
I'm searching
both of Clarence's cells.

361
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,004
I figured if he's on something,
it's stashed somewhere.

362
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,839
Unless he finished it.

363
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,508
Yeah, that'd be a shame. He
could have shoved it anywhere.

364
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,845
There's envelopes stacked to the
ceiling, bottles of copier toner,

365
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,974
boxes of rubber bands,
paper, file folders.

366
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,351
Call it off.

367
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,977
Come on back.

368
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,041
What's going on?

369
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,002
You're dying.

370
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,260
A man deserves a last drink.

371
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,974
You're okay.

372
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,977
Thanks. That means a lot.

373
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,860
All the tests
have been inconclusive?

374
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,989
Diagnostics is more
of an art than a science.

375
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,992
Should I be worried right now?

376
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,080
I work for one of the top
diagnosticians in the country.

377
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,792
We're pouring all of our
energy into figuring this out.

378
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,213
I thought you convicts
knew how to drink.

379
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,966
You're at least
three shots behind.

380
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,348
Now you're four shots behind.

381
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,728
You better get me the next
one, or I'm gonna kill you.

382
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,362
House.

383
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,866
I was just waiting
for test results, I was...

384
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,994
Little busy right now.
Getting my drink on.

385
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,830
Unbelievable.

386
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,377
That's the finest piece
I've seen in 10 years.

387
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,047
I could've hit that.

388
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,840
And you didn't?

389
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,344
Man, you're the one
that should be locked up.

390
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,808
Tell me something. I've been
trying to figure this out.

391
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:18,063
Why does a guy
who's on death row

392
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,356
suddenly try to off himself?

393
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,864
I know you
drank that copier fluid.

394
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,452
It's not as visually dramatic as slitting
your wrists with a homemade shiv,

395
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,454
but it will do the trick.

396
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,379
It just hit me all of a sudden.

397
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,883
It was like, they tell me
when to eat, when to sleep,

398
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,677
when to walk,
when to talk, everything.

399
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,015
I had to take
control of something, right?

400
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,351
When to die.

401
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,064
I figured that was
as good as anything.

402
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,988
And that thought just came
to you, just like that?

403
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,452
Man, I told you, for 23 hours...

404
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,081
Look, here's the good news.

405
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,377
The copier fluid you drank

406
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,881
contains about 90% methanol,
which is very poisonous,

407
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,301
and you took more than enough
to kill yourself.

408
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,889
The bad news is,
the alcohol you just drank

409
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,685
contains so much ethanol that
it's going to bind with that

410
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,397
nasty formic acid
rampaging through your body,

411
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,024
hence you're just
gonna pee it out.

412
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,985
Harmlessly.

413
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,782
Man, you are drunk.

414
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:57,162
Yes, I am.
I also saved your life.

415
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,878
At least for now.

416
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,434
Morning! Your head hurts?

417
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,187
No, you just have
a very grating voice.

418
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,771
You always were a lightweight.

419
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,481
Why are you talking to me?

420
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,568
Can't it be enough that
I wanna cause you pain?

421
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,529
The patient's okay now,
you're gonna send him back?

422
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,906
Absolutely.

423
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,169
- Can I trust you?
- You used to.

424
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,009
I still think the patient's sick.
I'm keeping him here.

425
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,929
Yeah. Either you can do your job
and keep the hospital informed,

426
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,514
or you can help me make sure
the hospital is not informed

427
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,475
and buy me some time.

428
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,148
- Have you done a CT?
- Yeah, I have.

429
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,316
With contrast?

430
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:13,071
She's done everything she needs to do
except tell her patient that she's dying.

431
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,492
I told you, only I get to
play with the markers.

432
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,537
Our prisoner has a new symptom.

433
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:25,208
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying
until the diagnosis is confirmed.

434
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,210
I'm not buying that Clarence

435
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,546
was trying to take control
of his life by suicide.

436
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,799
Healthy people
don't kill themselves.

437
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,550
Healthy people
don't kill other people.

438
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,179
Guy just filed an appeal in a state
that hasn't actually killed anybody

439
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,889
in about 30 years.

440
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,892
What if it wasn't suicide?
What if it was an escape plan?

441
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,604
Drink enough methanol to get transferred
to a hospital, try to escape from here.

442
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,730
Excellent.

443
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:51,150
Explains everything except the
symptom that got him here.

444
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,570
His heart went nuts before he
got stuck in that storage cell

445
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,572
and chugged a toner martini.

446
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,117
I think there's something
going on in his head.

447
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,662
Check for intracranial lesions, brain
infections, autoimmune diseases,

448
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,666
do a CT, LP, full workup.
State's paying, so go nuts.

449
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,380
Where'd you get these scars?

450
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,676
I got shivved my first month in.
After I healed up, I got mines.

451
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,388
You guys still think I'm sick?

452
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,681
Obviously.

453
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,268
Why do you care?
Why don't you just let me die?

454
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,561
Well, I'm different than you.

455
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,439
Right. You love me
like your own mama.

456
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,401
That's why the nurse says you kicked
her out when my heart nearly stopped.

457
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,194
Take a deep breath.

458
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,326
Any family history
of mental illness?

459
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,745
I always heard my pop was
crazy, I never met the man.

460
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,039
With my mom, it was the drugs.

461
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,832
Any siblings?

462
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,627
I got a brother, pretty much
raised him on my own.

463
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:55,673
- Inspirational. He doing time, too?
- Hey...

464
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,678
He's a good kid. Don't go
judging what you don't know.

465
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,390
How's his health?

466
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,145
I haven't heard from him
since I went inside.

467
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,360
Spent 16 years with him,
changed his damn diapers.

468
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,821
Can you imagine your whole life

469
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,824
being all about
the worst thing you ever did?

470
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,583
You killed four people.

471
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,544
And somehow making mac and
cheese just the way he wants

472
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,797
kind of loses its significance.

473
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,141
Oh, no. Now you've left
your entire body in my chair.

474
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,559
What does that mean you want?

475
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,396
I need a segmental
bronchoalveolar lavage.

476
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,564
I take it the CT
with contrast came back?

477
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,692
- They're not definitive.
- Biopsy would be.

478
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,570
Biopsy would be
invasive and unnecessary.

479
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,696
And definitive.

480
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,533
But you don't want definitive, you
want to hang onto your delusions

481
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,659
as long as you can.

482
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,577
A lavage could prove
it's not cancer.

483
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,623
But you need me to approve the procedure.
Must be a bitch.

484
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,708
- The answer is no.
- Why?

485
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,628
Because it's me?

486
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,215
I'm over you!
I've jumped on the bandwagon.

487
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,592
And I hate you, okay?

488
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,553
Great. Let's treat her.

489
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,431
What is it?

490
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,601
You won't help Cindy, but you're
obsessed with this piece of dirt!

491
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,247
Are you just trying to prove that
who someone is doesn't matter,

492
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,232
or that all that matters
is your stupid puzzle?

493
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,363
Fine.

494
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,701
Treat them the same,
that's all I'm asking.

495
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,787
One test.

496
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,790
Wow.

497
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,667
That is remarkable.

498
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,588
According to those patchouli
oil-selling New Agers,

499
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,590
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient,

500
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,885
but you're going through
the five stages.

501
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,430
You just made a completely
seamless transition from anger

502
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,931
to bargaining.

503
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,602
Cover two more
of my clinic hours,

504
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,438
and you can have
your one procedure.

505
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,574
No lesions, no aneurysms.

506
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,953
Ironically, the mind of a
killer looks completely normal.

507
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,582
If someone asked you
to describe me to them,

508
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,502
what's the first thing
you'd tell them?

509
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,711
Insecure.

510
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,215
What are you asking?

511
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,592
Like if you were setting me up
on a blind date.

512
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:49,597
Would you describe me to the girl
as the black guy? A neurologist?

513
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,182
Car thief?

514
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,227
This guy's really
getting to you, isn't he?

515
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,800
There's no sign of infection.

516
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,304
You're gonna
have to do the biopsy.

517
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,600
Your death row guy's still here.

518
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,271
Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta
get him stabilized.

519
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,607
Probably keep him on fluids for a
few more hours, then off he goes.

520
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,695
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring
that you still think he's sick.

521
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:52,159
Figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.

522
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:57,248
Stacy just ratted me out, right? So
much for attorney-client privilege.

523
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,626
I'm the client, you moron. Stacy
has a duty to this hospital.

524
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,379
- Right.
- I'm sending him back to prison.

525
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,464
Can't. Court order.

526
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,592
Court order says he has to be
declared healthy.

527
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:11,596
Doesn't specify which doctor
needs to make that declaration.

528
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,391
What is it, Clarence? My gut!

529
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,977
Would you describe it
as a shooting pain?

530
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,604
A throbbing pain?

531
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,524
Or maybe an imaginary pain because
you don't want to go back to prison?

532
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,028
- Where does it hurt?
- My gut, like I'm getting stabbed!

533
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,655
Well, he'd know.
Let me take a look.

534
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,493
Oh, so everybody lies
except a convicted murderer?

535
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,715
I don't think
he's faking this stuff.

536
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,301
What do you think, Doctor?

537
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,945
I didn't have any choice.

538
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,492
No, you had to tell Cuddy.
She's your boss, I get it.

539
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,245
Hitler thought he was doing
the world a favor, too.

540
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,289
Yeah, pretty much
on that same level.

541
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,292
Gandhi didn't march to the sea
because his buddies asked him to.

542
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,295
Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers
because he wanted to make friends.

543
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,048
You're not
making friends right now.

544
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,385
- I trusted you.
- I know.

545
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,349
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.

546
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,604
I had to do
what I thought was right.

547
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,607
It's the only reason
anybody does anything.

548
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,905
Surgery went fine. They removed
almost a foot of necrotic bowel.

549
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,324
They're shackling him
and taking him into recovery.

550
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,742
I wonder.

551
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,331
I wonder why Clarence killed
that second inmate?

552
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,128
Fine, I'll bite. What the
hell are you talking about?

553
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,921
Everything we do

554
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,175
is dictated by motive. Why
did he kill his girlfriend?

555
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,137
- Because he's a maniac!
- Is that the reason he gave?

556
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,222
She was cheating on him.

557
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,435
Jealousy.
That gets him sent to prison.

558
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:26,605
Where he kills
inmate number one. Why?

559
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,607
Guy attacked him first.

560
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,359
Revenge.

561
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,404
- Who'd he kill after that?
- Prison guard.

562
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,490
Who had a file
full of abuse complaints.

563
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,034
Probably been kicking
Clarence's ass for months.

564
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,328
Clarence is just ridding
the world of bad seeds.

565
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,414
We'll call that one retribution.

566
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,251
Then he kills inmate number two.

567
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,254
Anybody know why?

568
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,006
Uh-uh.

569
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,716
It's not in there.

570
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,183
All of a sudden,
I gotta have a reason?

571
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,478
It's an anomaly.
Doctors love anomalies.

572
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:10,483
Dark spot on an x-ray,
bright spot on an MRI.

573
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,401
Killing that second inmate

574
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,697
was the homicidal equivalent of
blood in the urine. It doesn't fit.

575
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,534
I'm interested in things
that don't fit.

576
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,578
Tell me why you did it.

577
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,461
Your other victims you were
almost bragging about.

578
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,798
What was different
about this guy?

579
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,429
It happened
when I was in gen pop.

580
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,810
I was in the library,
just reading.

581
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:53,025
And I started feeling real nervous.
This guy was staring at me.

582
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,821
I could feel his eyes digging
holes in the back of my neck.

583
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,323
Made me feel crazy.

584
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,661
Sweat was pouring down my face.

585
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:08,958
I could hear my heartbeat
racing in my ears.

586
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,088
I just raged out on the dude.

587
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,179
So what's the differential
for raging out?

588
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,349
- Excess testosterone, steroids.
- Adrenalin?

589
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,310
- Prep Clarence for surgery.
- Care to share with the class?

590
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,898
Oh, come on, do I have to spell
it out for you? Pheochromocytoma.

591
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,817
Actually, I'm not sure
how you spell it.

592
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,443
But you said it yourself,
adrenalin.

593
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,154
Pheochromocytoma sits on top
of the adrenal gland,

594
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,532
randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.
It's perfect.

595
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,286
It explains everything, the tachycardia,
pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that

596
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,453
caused the necrotic bowel.

597
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,331
Even explains how he had the strength
to rip the rail off his bed.

598
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,501
- But pheo's extremely rare.
- I love rare.

599
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,337
Set up an MRI. Where's Cameron?

600
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,465
Like I don't know.

601
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,557
Dr. Cameron, could I
borrow you for a consult?

602
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,476
Bittersweet thing about being
head of the Oncology Department,

603
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,229
I get cc'd on all
the biopsy results.

604
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,564
Yeah, I know.

605
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,192
- She's terminal.
- Yeah.

606
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,821
So I take it you were
in there informing her?

607
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,575
Well, I hadn't exactly gotten
around to that, but I was just...

608
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,036
Doing what? Making friends?

609
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,331
Cindy's divorced.

610
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,334
She doesn't have any kids, no siblings,
both her parents are gone...

611
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,754
It's not your job to be her friend!
Do you understand?

612
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,672
And it's not worth it.

613
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,218
She feels better her final few days, and
you're not the same, maybe for years.

614
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:46,847
- You don't think it's worth it?
- I know it's not worth it.

615
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,395
My husband...

616
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,072
I met him just after he was diagnosed
with terminal brain cancer.

617
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:08,118
If I hadn't married him...
He was alone.

618
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,707
When a good person dies, there
should be an impact on the world.

619
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,460
Somebody should notice.

620
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,088
Somebody should be upset.

621
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,469
"Pheo" what?

622
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,263
I don't even remember.

623
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,476
It's just a fancy way of saying
"small, adrenalin-secreting tumor".

624
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,479
Yeah, that clarified it for you.

625
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,025
All you need to know is,
if I'm right, we can fix it.

626
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,361
Just gotta find it first.

627
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,321
We need an MRI.

628
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,532
It's completely painless
for most people.

629
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,325
But not for me?

630
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,412
I assume you got
those tattoos in prison.

631
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,290
Prison tats often contain
inks with heavy metals.

632
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,251
The MRI is basically
a giant magnet,

633
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,462
suck those metallic inks
right out of your skin.

634
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,697
Stop squirming.

635
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,991
Don't make us do this again.

636
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,453
Big baby.

637
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,205
Still don't see anything.

638
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,959
Turn it off!

639
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,211
There's Waldo.

640
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,214
Found it, Clarence.

641
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,758
Turn it off!

642
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,676
Turn this damn thing off!

643
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,804
Keep him in there
until you guys see it, too.

644
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,890
Son of a bitch.

645
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,818
Looks like they got
the pheo out successfully.

646
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,613
So, what now?

647
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,574
Clarence goes back to death row.

648
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,493
Just like that?

649
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,078
He's cured.

650
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,581
That tumor caused
random shots of adrenalin,

651
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:21,251
which obviously led to the rage attacks
that made him become a murderer

652
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,836
in the first place.

653
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,421
My God, you're right!

654
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,174
Let's call the surgeons,
we gotta save that tumor.

655
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,420
Put it on the witness stand.

656
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,345
We could testify
at Clarence's appeal.

657
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:35,891
You smell that? I think that
is the stink of hypocrisy.

658
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,894
You wouldn't even consider the notion
that Clarence's social upbringing

659
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,356
was responsible for what he became, but
now you're sprinting to the witness stand

660
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,066
to blame everything
on a little tumor.

661
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,819
A person's upbringing and their
biology are completely different.

662
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,278
Yeah.

663
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,948
Because you only
overcame one of them.

664
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,327
Well, let's just
give Clarence a free pass.

665
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,747
Which is probably gonna piss off
all those other pheo sufferers

666
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,707
who managed to control
their rage attacks

667
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,586
and become lawyers, race car
drivers, or even doctors.

668
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,258
Removing that tumor puts a stop to
those random shots of adrenalin.

669
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,635
It doesn't absolve him.

670
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,929
You want him to be executed?

671
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,349
That's not what I'm saying.

672
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,685
Got an opinion?

673
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,521
Everyone's got an opinion.

674
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:32,865
I... I think I'm gonna testify
at Clarence's appeal.

675
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,493
You'll do
what you think is right.

676
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,329
On your own time.

677
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,598
But it's just a cough.
