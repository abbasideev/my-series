1
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:25,316
Your weight is 113.9 pounds.

2
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,908
You gonna make me hurt you?

3
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,868
- No.
- I didn't think so.

4
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,365
Are you alright? Did I hurt you?

5
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,203
Bob!

6
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,957
Bob! What's wrong?
What happened? Talk to me.

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,211
Oh, my God! OK, honey,
hang on, hang on.

8
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,047
911, what is your emergency?

9
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,926
Yes, we need an ambulance
at 10600 Xavier, unit 4-B.

10
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,262
My husband can't breathe.

11
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:40,266
Oh, my God, he's turning blue.
You have to send someone now, please!

12
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,517
Hurry!

13
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,421
You blow-dry your hair?

14
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,549
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

15
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,384
You blow-dry your hair?

16
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,012
Excuse me for actually caring
what I look like.

17
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,807
I think the word you're looking for
is "obsessing."

18
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,351
You've been at it for almost an hour.

19
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,895
If you wanted in,
all you had to do was say so.

20
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,106
I don't want in. I want sleep!

21
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,276
It's about time you got up anyway.
It's almost 9:00.

22
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,488
This isn't gonna work.

23
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,325
- What?
- You staying here.

24
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,829
You're kicking me out? After one night?

25
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,499
Why, you think we should
try counseling first?

26
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,336
Why do you want to sleep
on a couch anyway?

27
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,756
You got money. At least
until the divorce is finalized.

28
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,388
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.
What's left of it.

29
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,904
It was three days ago.

30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,364
My throat got really dry
and then my tongue

31
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,575
felt like it was blowing up
like a balloon.

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,785
I assume somebody
checked for food allergies.

33
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,580
- The first two doctors both did.
- Next one said it was a panic attack.

34
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,832
The one after that wanted
to take his tonsils out.

35
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,627
The last one had no idea,
just referred us to Dr. House.

36
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,045
It says the attack was preceded

37
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,672
by some sort of
strenuous physical activity.

38
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,008
- Yeah.
- What were you doing?

39
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,933
Awesome.

40
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,769
A sex fiend with a swollen tongue.

41
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,688
Just think of all the places
I can make Foreman search.

42
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,317
He's not a sex fiend.
He's a happily married man.

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,693
No such thing.

44
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,991
What are you doing?

45
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,788
Testing a new caffeine delivery system.

46
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,082
He didn't get his beauty sleep.

47
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,919
Wilson's moved in and apparently
has unusually loud toenails.

48
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,629
If they're into rape fantasies,

49
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,506
S&M is on the menu as well.

50
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,842
Neck trauma could cause vocal cord
paroxysms, which could cause choking.

51
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,845
I didn't see any sign of
trauma, and they were remarkably open.

52
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,180
I asked about STDs

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,392
and they admitted participating
in a threesome a few months ago.

54
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,269
A hundred bucks says they're
as miserable as the next couple.

55
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,188
Another guy, or girl?

56
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,732
Girl. His wife's college roommate.

57
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,903
If he's not happily married,
I don't know who could be.

58
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,407
They're looking for something. If you're
happy, you've got nothing to look for.

59
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,450
His wife arranged it
for an anniversary present.

60
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,161
If you ask me, if two people
really trust each other,

61
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,790
a threesome once every seven years
might actually help a marriage.

62
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,170
OK, I say we stop the DDX
and discuss that comment.

63
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,548
I'll take the bet.

64
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,553
Maybe the first doctor was right.
Food allergy explains the anaphylaxis.

65
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,846
Could be neurological.

66
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,682
Progressive bulbar paralysis
would explain the symptoms.

67
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,685
No. ALS would affect his facial muscles
before his throat.

68
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,729
What if the problem's not in his throat?

69
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,232
That would be a little odd considering
that's where all his symptoms are.

70
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,026
- Says who?
- The patient.

71
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:03,863
And since most patients can't tell
their ulna from their anus,

72
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,282
I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know
the difference

73
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,117
between choking and suffocating.

74
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,786
His throat might be fine,
his lungs might be messed up.

75
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,290
Get more blood, a chest CT
and a body plethysmograph.

76
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,776
Unless, of course, you think
we should be asking the patient

77
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,044
where his anus is first.

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,549
It feels like I have to urinate
and then when I try to go...

79
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,594
Pull up your pants.

80
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,681
- It's my prostate, isn't it?
- Nope, not your prostate.

81
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,185
- Herpes.
- Herpes?

82
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,937
Herpes. Your turn.

83
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,858
If it makes you feel any better, half
the patients who come into this place

84
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,028
- have some sort of crotch rot.
- No, it doesn't.

85
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,656
Look, this is impossible.
I've been married for 20 years.

86
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,344
Have you had any sex in those 20 years?

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,369
- Yes, of course.
- Then that's how you got it.

88
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,164
The only person I've had sex with
is my wife.

89
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,583
Bummer.

90
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,504
Take this once a day.
Tell your wife to do the same.

91
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,880
It's not going to cure it,

92
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,591
but it will lessen the frequency
of the outbreaks.

93
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,051
But there must be some mistake.

94
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,552
You got any kids?

95
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,055
- Yeah.
- Any of them take guitar lessons?

96
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,974
- No.
- Tennis? Art? Acting?

97
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,560
My daughter does karate. Why?

98
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,063
Give this to her sensei.

99
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,400
- Oh, wait. Does your wife play tennis?
- No.

100
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,654
That's what I figured.
Never hurts to make sure.

101
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,198
For Miyagi.

102
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,286
I'm gonna close the shutter now.

103
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,248
I need you to pant, kind of like a dog.

104
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,544
That's good. Keep going.

105
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,298
Can I ask you a personal question?

106
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,885
Uh, I guess.

107
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,473
The threesome and the role-playing.

108
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,934
Is that because things get boring?

109
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,229
No.

110
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,775
We just enjoy our fantasies.

111
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,114
- Are you married?
- No.

112
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,162
You can go back to taking
the deep breaths now.

113
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,583
Marriages don't fail
because couples get bored.

114
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,878
They fail because while they're dating,

115
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,379
people pretend to be the person

116
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,673
they think their partner wants,
and then...

117
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,885
Well, there's only so long
you can keep that up.

118
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,222
Maybe they are that person while
they're dating, but then they change.

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,933
People thinking
their partner will change?

120
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,477
That's another reason marriages fail.

121
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,235
People don't change, at least
not in any way that really matters.

122
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,994
I think you've had enough caffeine.

123
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,331
You were right.
It's not his throat, it's his lungs.

124
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,583
The plethysmograph revealed
decreased lung capacity.

125
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,293
And the CT showed lung
scarring.

126
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,296
It's definitely interstitial
pulmonary fibrosis.

127
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,383
What's not definite is the cause.
There's no arthritis, no sarcoidosis.

128
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,678
He's not on any prescription meds.
And he's a wedding photographer.

129
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,223
So I doubt he got exposed to coal dust
or asbestos at work.

130
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,226
- Cause could be idiopathic.
- Can't be idiopathic.

131
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,144
Idiopathic means without a known cause.

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,312
What I meant was that...

133
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,606
What you meant was
you don't know what the cause is.

134
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,317
Just say that and we can avoid
this conversation.

135
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,070
No applause?

136
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,782
- What's his current condition?
- Stable.

137
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,575
- Well, then we can wait.
- Wait for what?

138
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,370
For whatever you can't figure out
to cause something else.

139
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,621
You know it's going to.

140
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,915
It's possible the IPF
could just continue to...

141
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,925
- There's something wrong with his skin.
- Do something.

142
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,178
- Stop scratching. Let me look at it.
- I can't. This is driving me crazy.

143
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,347
Stop scratching, so we can...
Make it stop!

144
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,724
- OK...
- Make it stop!

145
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,518
Make it stop!

146
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,237
Now we've got
something to discuss.

147
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,533
What causes both lung scarring
and the itchy, splotchy red blotchies?

148
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,160
It's obviously not a reaction
to medication.

149
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,870
We haven't given him any yet.

150
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,123
Right. But what besides
what it's obviously not,

151
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,125
can cause both lung scarring
and the splotches?

152
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,376
Where are you going?

153
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,629
To complete the second half
of the caffeine delivery system.

154
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,550
Either talk louder, or get in here.

155
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,270
Same color coming out as going in.
Do you think that's a marketing thing?

156
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,314
A lupus could cause lung scarring
and a rash.

157
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,733
Or could still be a food allergy.

158
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,444
- We've already ruled out allergies.
- Did we?

159
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,611
Where's Cameron?

160
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,322
We're in the men's room.

161
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,241
We need an allergy expert in here.

162
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,707
- This can wait two minutes.
- You don't know that.

163
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,501
Chase thinks that food allergy
should still be on the table.

164
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,670
No, it wouldn't explain
the lung scarring.

165
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,714
Some homeopathic studies
have found a connection

166
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,883
between food allergies
and autoimmune reactions,

167
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,551
which could cause lung inflammation.

168
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,803
Yeah. And some homeopathic studies
have also found

169
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,639
that ground-up spiders can cure cancer.
Can I go now?

170
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,932
No.

171
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,854
Lungs, skin, skin, lungs.

172
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,981
Sklungs?

173
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,443
Lungs, skin...

174
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,863
throat.

175
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,494
Heavy metal toxicity.

176
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,121
It explains the lungs, the itching,

177
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,957
the swelling in his tongue and throat.

178
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,336
I thought you didn't believe there was
anything wrong with his throat.

179
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,131
I never said I didn't believe it. I just
said I had good reason to doubt it.

180
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,466
And now?

181
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,193
I have good reason
to doubt those doubts.

182
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,970
The patient's a little old
to be chewing paint off the walls.

183
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,181
Nor does he drink well water,
eat fish every day,

184
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,059
or do anything else that could have
exposed him to heavy metals.

185
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,062
He and his wife worked a wedding
at Cabo San Lucas last month.

186
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,898
A lot of pottery in Mexico
is contaminated with lead-based paint.

187
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,734
Now aren't you glad you joined us?

188
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,113
Search their house, screen his blood
and hair for lead.

189
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,032
Test for mercury and arsenic
while you're at it.

190
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,035
And, Chase, find out
what the resort cooks with,

191
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,496
if they repainted recently
or did any plumbing repairs.

192
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,667
- But I don't speak Spanish.
- Then it'll be challenging.

193
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,390
Good Lord, what is that smell?

194
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,059
Stuffed pepper.

195
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,980
Stuffed with what? Vomit?

196
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,200
I thought you were going to a hotel.

197
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,911
I found an apartment.
I can move in on Monday.

198
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
- Is that fast enough for you?
- What's today?

199
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,170
- Where'd you get all that stuff?
- Not from your kitchen.

200
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:21,008
Don't you ever eat anything
besides canned soup and peanut butter?

201
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,094
Don't you ever eat anything
that doesn't look like

202
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,804
it's been rolled onto your plate
by a dung beetle?

203
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
Try it.

204
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,442
- It's good, isn't it?
- No.

205
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,361
Just better than it looks.

206
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,283
How much beans and rice
do you think you'd have to eat

207
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,994
from a ceramic pot
painted with lead-based paint

208
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,455
to get enough lead into your system
to damage your lungs?

209
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,249
- Are we talking a child, or an adult?
- Adult.

210
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,501
Then I would say a lot.

211
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,378
You'd have to eat beans
every day for months.

212
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,217
Now, why do you have a season pass
to the New Yankee workshop?

213
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,053
It's a complete moron
working with power tools.

214
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,388
How much more suspenseful
can you get?

215
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,599
I'm... I was watching something.

216
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,559
No, you were about to watch something.

217
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,479
I'm watching something.
See the difference?

218
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,858
If the water was contaminated,
wouldn't I be sick, too?

219
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,028
People can metabolize toxins
at different rates.

220
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,030
We'll test it to be sure.

221
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,534
- Have you done any recent renovations?
- No.

222
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,995
Have any problem with bugs or rodents?

223
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,413
Just the occasional ant.

224
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,708
Use bug spray?

225
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,627
No, I hate the smell.

226
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,631
Luckily both of us are pretty anal
about keeping things clean.

227
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,675
Yeah, I can tell.

228
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,564
You think ants are the problem?

229
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,191
Can you stop stuffing your mouth
with pancakes for one second?

230
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,319
These aren't pancakes.
These are macadamia nut pancakes.

231
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,321
Wilson made them and they're amazing.

232
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,407
She says she doesn't use bug spray.

233
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,784
Like little silver dollar
slices of heaven.

234
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,037
- Some ants are poisonous, maybe...
- Forget the 72 virgins.

235
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,331
If I blow myself up
in a crowded restaurant,

236
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,251
I'm going to be asking
for a plate of these babies.

237
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,587
Was the ant big and red
or small and black?

238
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,257
- Medium and brown.
- Halle Berry brown or Beyoncé brown?

239
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:29,720
Is there a difference?

240
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,975
Army ants could devour, dissolve
and eat a cow in a matter of hours.

241
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,186
Australian Bull ants, on the other hand,

242
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,398
nasty little bastards,
but more of a nuisance than a threat.

243
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,067
- No surprise there.
- Beyoncé.

244
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,570
Well, then that's not it.

245
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,864
How much clay did he eat at the resort?

246
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,242
It's a five-star, $400 a night place.
They don't cook with ceramic pots.

247
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,493
Tox screen?

248
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,579
No evidence of lead, mercury or arsenic.

249
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,583
Run them again. Call the resort, find
some disgruntled employee to talk to.

250
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,501
- Go back to the home...
- It's not heavy metals.

251
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,795
- The symptoms say it is.
- The tests say it's not.

252
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,964
Who you going to believe?
The symptoms or the test?

253
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,176
- It could also be a food allergy.
- Cameron says it's not.

254
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,345
If your test could be wrong,
why can't hers?

255
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,640
His diet hasn't changed since he was
a kid. His favorite food is cornflakes.

256
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,808
Which, I assume, he eats with milk,

257
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,935
one of the most common
adult onset food allergies.

258
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,314
Start treating him for lead poisoning.
It's the most likely heavy metal.

259
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,734
And, yeah, you can test him for
allergies for dairy, wheat and legume.

260
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,827
I am not having an affair
with my daughter's karate instructor

261
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,956
- and I did not give my husband herpes.
- Find out where House is.

262
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,837
If you're convinced it's allergies,

263
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,090
why are you giving him drugs
to treat lead poisoning?

264
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,656
We're not convinced of anything yet.

265
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,052
I think I need something else,
this cream isn't working.

266
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,720
We're doing everything we can.

267
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,432
Sorry.

268
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,309
No, no. It's not my back, it's my feet!

269
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,104
I think I stepped in something
when I went to the bathroom.

270
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,939
Oh, it's on my socks. It's burning.

271
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,860
I don't see anything.

272
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,406
Please, take my socks off!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

273
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,494
- Ow! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What did you just scratch him with?

274
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,456
If there was an allergic reaction, it
would be on his back, not on his feet.

275
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,333
Oh, it's burning,
please make it stop!

276
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,794
We need some gabapentin in here.

277
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,384
Excruciating pain
in the lower extremities.

278
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,971
- Not a sign of a food allergy.
- Means there's a neurological problem.

279
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,058
More significantly, it's yet another
classic sign of heavy metals.

280
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,186
And I just did yet another
hair and blood test for lead,

281
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,632
and everything else he could
have possibly been exposed to.

282
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,858
They're all negative.
It's gotta be something else.

283
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,317
- Lupus could cause...
- No.

284
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,987
Lupus progresses slower.
There'd be joint pain.

285
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,239
So it's not a typical case.

286
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,992
- We should get an ANA.
- It's not lupus.

287
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,578
The symptoms don't match.

288
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,747
And the tests don't match heavy metals.

289
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,842
It's happening again.
He's not breathing.

290
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,264
Tongue swelling, airway's closing.
He's not getting any air.

291
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,516
- His lungs are clear.
- We're gonna have to intubate.

292
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,894
Try to relax, Bob.
This is gonna help you breathe.

293
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,270
Oh, my God!

294
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,063
He's gonna aspirate! Need suction!

295
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,441
- What's happening?
- Suction.

296
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,127
There's too much vomit. We're never
going to be able to intubate.

297
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,363
- We're gonna have to trach him.
- He's not breathing!

298
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,932
His urine has elevated
proteins and red blood cells.

299
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,684
It's lupus-induced kidney failure.
If we don't start treatment...

300
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,812
Heavy metal toxicity
could cause vomiting.

301
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,523
So would lupus nephritis,
and it also causes tissue swelling.

302
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,983
He's choking on his tongue,
not his feet.

303
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,444
The corticosteroids we gave him
to control the inflammation

304
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,779
can cause facial swelling.

305
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,198
Still not his throat,
but you're getting closer.

306
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,617
I'm doing an ANA and a serum
compliment.

307
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,329
If you're so sure, why waste time
with tests? Just start treatment.

308
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,581
Oh, no wait. We can't do that
because we already have

309
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,124
and it's not working! Ergo...

310
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,211
Corticosteroids aren't the only
treatment for lupus nephritis.

311
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,881
We could also try cyclophosphamide
or immunosuppressants.

312
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,218
Only if we confirm the diagnosis
with an ANA serum compliment,

313
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,179
anti-DNA, IV pyelogram
and kidney biopsy.

314
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,516
- So, now you suddenly believe in tests?
- The symptoms...

315
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,102
The symptoms all point
to heavy metal poisoning.

316
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,854
Yeah, we all get it.

317
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,399
Unless you've got proof,
and can tell me which heavy metal it is,

318
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,651
I'm starting treatment for lupus.

319
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,285
Systemic lupus erythematosus

320
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,537
causes the immune system
to become hyperactive.

321
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,664
Attack normal tissue.

322
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,250
It could be what caused
the lung inflammation,

323
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,896
as well as the swelling in his throat.

324
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,130
And now what appears to be
damage to his kidneys.

325
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,882
The treatment's usually steroids.

326
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,925
But he's already on the steroids.

327
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,852
If the tests confirm
we're on the right track,

328
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,489
there are other medications we can try.

329
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,139
And if those don't work?

330
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,642
Well, lupus, it's a chronic condition,
but it's generally controllable.

331
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,478
What do you mean, "generally"?

332
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,441
In rare cases, it can cause
cardiovascular or renal failure.

333
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,902
Cardiovascular and renal.

334
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,404
That's the heart and the kidneys.

335
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,115
- Right?
- Yeah.

336
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,088
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

337
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,604
Enjoying the salad?

338
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,941
- There's no lettuce.
- I'm aware that there's no lettuce.

339
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,193
But do you know
when I obtained this knowledge?

340
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,655
Actually, I'm in the middle of
something. When I made it. For myself.

341
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,325
Well, how was I supposed to know?

342
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,120
Well, I was hoping
this might tip you off.

343
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,706
That's kind of selfish, don't you think?

344
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,042
I offered to make you some. You said no.

345
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,044
That was before I tasted the pancakes.

346
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,588
It's a compliment.
You should be flattered.

347
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,090
Here.

348
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,219
It's Mrs. Lambert's herpes test results.

349
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,720
Mrs. who?

350
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,472
You've told more than one patient

351
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,350
his wife is sleeping with
his daughter's karate teacher?

352
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,596
You wanna stir the pot,
you have to clean up the mess.

353
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,562
What would you do if you got herpes?

354
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,049
She's coming in at 5:00.
Don't make me come looking for you.

355
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,109
I'd know what you'd do.
But I mean, a normal guy?

356
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,737
And don't be calling in sick,
or saying that your team

357
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,031
needs you for some kind of
emergency consult.

358
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,702
He suspected that maybe his
wife had also been playing pickle games.

359
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,122
He could just keep it on the down low,
just wait till she got infected.

360
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,499
You'd give your own wife herpes,
just to shift the blame?

361
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,627
He'd give his own mother herpes
if it got him out of clinic duty.

362
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,923
Course, maybe it was the wife.
Maybe she was the one who...

363
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,931
Where's Mrs. Nympho?

364
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,182
She's waiting outside, why?

365
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,935
- Go search her.
- What, you mean her medical records?

366
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,855
If I meant that,
good chance I'd have said that.

367
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,942
You think she's poisoning him?

368
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,611
His symptoms should be getting better
the longer he's here.

369
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,030
Instead, they're getting worse.

370
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:48,950
So, either she's poisoning him,
or it's not heavy metals.

371
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,619
We've done over ten different
heavy metal tox screens.

372
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,039
Because there's no reason
to test for the other 30.

373
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,665
They don't get into the air or food.

374
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,711
They only get in you
if someone puts them in you.

375
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,171
And the only way we're going to find out
what she's sprinkling on his cornflakes

376
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,173
- is to search her.
- I am not going to accuse a woman

377
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,217
of trying to murder her own husband
based simply on some paranoid theory.

378
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,137
It's the only explanation. We've
eliminated every other possibility.

379
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,431
We have not eliminated
every other possibility!

380
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,118
Has he responded to the lupus
treatment?

381
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,642
He's only been on it a few hours.

382
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,561
He hasn't responded
because it's not lupus.

383
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,939
It's not allergies, ALS,
arthritis or sarcoidosis.

384
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,357
She's all that's left.

385
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,985
Do it!

386
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,658
Hi.

387
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,577
I'm Dr. House.

388
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,165
- Mind if I take a look in your purse?
- Why?

389
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,043
Because I'm going to need
to search it and you

390
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,837
for whatever you're using
to poison your husband.

391
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,257
Why would I want to hurt my husband?

392
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,928
Then you won't mind
if I search your things.

393
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,307
Go ahead.

394
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,319
You satisfied?

395
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,989
Absolutely not!

396
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,325
She agreed to let me search
everywhere else,

397
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,036
- but this she says no to.
- Doesn't that tell you something?

398
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,039
Yes, that she doesn't want
some lunatic doctor searching her vagina

399
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,041
- with a flashlight.
- Cameron can do that.

400
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,251
I am not going to...

401
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,128
The woman hasn't left
since they arrived.

402
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,130
Whatever she's using,
she's hiding somewhere.

403
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,757
- She's not poisoning him!
- It's the only explanation!

404
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,403
No, it's the only explanation
your twisted mind can come up with

405
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,509
because you're angry
that you can't find the answer,

406
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,876
and you're taking it out on her.

407
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,598
And you are protecting
a complete stranger

408
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,308
based on some
childishly romantic notion

409
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,354
that people are all so happily married
they don't want to kill each other.

410
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,564
- You're calling me childish?
- Grow up!

411
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,567
Shut up! Both of you.
And stay away from his wife.

412
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,653
Sorry, I'm not giving you permission
to assault someone.

413
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,344
Let's see.
I'm thinking, Colonel Mustard,

414
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,471
in the music room with a candlestick.

415
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,683
There's no music room.
It's the conservatory.

416
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,436
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

417
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,481
If we don't find out what she's using
and start treatment immediately,

418
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,442
- he'll be dead in a week.
- If you're right.

419
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,987
If Foreman's right, you'd have basically
raped an innocent woman.

420
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,828
My wife fired the maid.

421
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,707
Apparently she's getting rid of
everything that reminds her of me.

422
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,544
- You did your maid?
- I was nice to our maid,

423
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,464
which annoyed her, God knows why.

424
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,551
- Maybe she was doing her.
- No one was doing her, all right?

425
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,345
But you still feel responsible?

426
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,224
Even though nothing or no one was
done, it's still your fault.

427
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,436
I offered to keep paying her salary
until she found another job.

428
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,774
But she refused to take any money
without doing any work, so...

429
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,111
You want someone to clean
your apartment? It's on me.

430
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,656
You're supposed to be moving out,
not moving more people in.

431
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,492
She's not moving in, she's gonna clean.

432
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,658
Maybe I should move out,
and the two of you could...

433
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,912
Oh, God!

434
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,164
- Oh, God, no!
- Call a code!

435
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,833
Please!

436
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,921
Charging 360. Give him Epi.

437
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,174
Clear!

438
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,095
- Still no pulse.
- Charging! Clear!

439
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:39,931
I got a pulse.

440
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,727
Pupils are reactive. You still with us?

441
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,605
He was without oxygen for less than
a minute. It can't be hypoxia.

442
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,565
Could be a stroke.

443
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,276
Bob, can you hear me?

444
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:55,405
- Back up.
- Bob, talk to me. Bob! Honey, please!

445
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,158
Bob, can you hear me?

446
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,039
- He's awake.
- Can you hear me?

447
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:07,917
Honey?

448
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,046
Honey.

449
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,720
Yes, she is quite the little actress.

450
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,646
So, let's say she's not poisoning him.

451
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,691
There's nothing more to discuss.
We've got lung and kidney failure,

452
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,485
neurological symptoms
and now, cardiac arrest.

453
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,947
A systemic disease with multi-organ
involvement is the definition of lupus.

454
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,116
Auto-immunosuppressants
aren't helping.

455
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,161
We should start him on cyclophosphamide.
See if it makes a difference.

456
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,788
Yeah, and interferon.

457
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,958
Interferon isn't an approved treatment
for lupus.

458
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,251
You're not still thinking...

459
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,546
Interferon isn't an approved treatment
for heavy metal toxicity, either.

460
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,508
True. But it's pretty much the only
thing we can do for a viral infection.

461
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,763
- We didn't consider it because...
- Because it doesn't make sense.

462
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,724
- There's no fever.
- Because he's got no immune system.

463
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,643
Thanks to the immunosuppressants
you prescribed for lupus treatment.

464
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,562
He didn't present with a fever, either.

465
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,024
Because at that point, he was
a post-viral autoimmune reaction,

466
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,777
which again,
thanks to the immunosuppresants

467
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,612
you prescribed for lupus treatment.

468
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,282
His immune system basically rolled out
the red carpet for the dormant virus,

469
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,728
waking it up and turning it
into a present viral infection.

470
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,411
Give him interferon.

471
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,664
But if it is lupus,
interferon could make it worse,

472
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,311
- suppress his bone marrow even further.
- Which is more likely?

473
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,962
Rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus
in a patient already on steroids,

474
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,673
or a team of doctors
missing a post-viral reaction?

475
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,258
We didn't miss anything.

476
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:44,013
Well, then I'm wrong. And you
shouldn't... give him interferon!

477
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,268
Intravenous interferon has been shown
to be effective

478
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,895
against some viral infections.

479
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,649
But I thought you said it wasn't
an infection. You said it was lupus.

480
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,276
The increasingly rapid progression
of the symptoms

481
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,447
- has caused us to reconsider.
- And what if you're wrong here, too?

482
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,867
- What if it's not a virus?
- There are risks with interferon,

483
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,496
especially in a patient
who's already immunosupressed.

484
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:13,459
Look, at this point, your lungs,
kidneys and heart are all failing.

485
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,295
We really don't have any choice.

486
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,539
I cheated.

487
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,959
What?

488
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,671
Ninth grade, Earth Science.

489
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,756
Mr. Foley.

490
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,887
I sat behind you,
so I could cheat off of you.

491
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,394
And I let you cheat,
so you'd sit behind me.

492
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,774
I thought we were going
to grow old together.

493
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,489
- In ninth grade?
- No, tenth.

494
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,160
What, you had to make sure
I put out first?

495
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,874
No, I knew you'd put out
in the seventh grade.

496
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,382
I love you.

497
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,055
Yeah, I know.

498
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,350
Say you love me.

499
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,394
No.

500
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,854
Why not?

501
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,609
Because you're not dying.

502
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,029
Say it anyway.

503
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,077
You gonna make me hurt you?

504
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,169
I love you.

505
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,140
It's not working.

506
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,018
Both his lungs and kidneys
are continuing to deteriorate.

507
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,188
- Up the dose.
- We already have.

508
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,524
- Apparently not enough.
- I don't think it's a virus.

509
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,902
We've been running titers for everything
we can think of. They're all negative.

510
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,618
- Increase the interferon.
- House.

511
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,621
You got a better idea other than lupus?

512
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,498
No.

513
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,083
Then up the dose.

514
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,670
Mr. and Mrs. Lambert's appointment
was over an hour ago.

515
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,674
Sorry, I was sick. And my team
needed an emergency consult.

516
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,763
Your wife has herpes.

517
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,099
What?

518
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,685
That's impossible, I don't have any...

519
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,772
You haven't had an outbreak yet.
Don't worry, you will.

520
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,818
- You rutty jackass!
- Me?

521
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,321
I haven't been with anyone in 20 years.

522
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,087
You're the one with the blisters
on his...

523
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,949
Doesn't mean that he got it first.

524
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,327
You don't need to have an outbreak
to spread the virus.

525
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,246
Yeah, and you're the one always talking
about wanting more sex.

526
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,623
From you.

527
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:42,001
And maybe I'd get more if you weren't
getting it somewhere else.

528
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,807
You two obviously
have a lot to talk about.

529
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,517
Don't even think
of dumping this in my lap.

530
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,633
There's gotta be some way
to prove that it's him.

531
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,593
I'm sorry, there is no test.

532
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,888
Either of you two
ever sit on a public toilet?

533
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,183
- Well?
- Of course.

534
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,144
Herpes can live for short
periods of time outside the body.

535
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,188
Dr. House, you know
you can't get herpes...

536
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,024
Some politically correct doctors
will tell you that it's impossible

537
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,484
to get infected by a toilet seat.

538
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,851
But they'll also tell you
not to use the same bath towels

539
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,864
to dry your crotch and your face during
an outbreak. See the contradiction?

540
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,949
I always use a paper cover.

541
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,743
- Always?
- Yes, of course.

542
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,662
What about you?

543
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,873
No. I never knew.

544
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,293
Oh, please. This is ridiculous.

545
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,671
Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi.

546
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,172
What?

547
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,217
He could believe that you can get herpes
from a toilet seat,

548
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,011
or he could be cheating on you
and just be happy to have an out.

549
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,180
The toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?

550
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,224
Sure. But she'd only refused to believe

551
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,476
such a well presented lie
if she were innocent.

552
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,689
And since you both can't be innocent,
you rutty jackass!

553
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,232
You!

554
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,527
- Thanks a lot.
- My pleasure.

555
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,987
Honey, wait. Please!

556
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,656
Wow!

557
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,660
Not bad.

558
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,755
She has a family history of arthritis,
doesn't she?

559
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,924
Yeah, she does. What does...

560
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,342
Stop the interferon,

561
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,053
and do another heavy metal screen,
only this time test for gold.

562
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,888
You don't still think that she...

563
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,473
Don't let her go to the bathroom.

564
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,143
Why would you care if she...

565
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,310
Hello?

566
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,143
Oh!

567
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,771
Hi, I'm Lady.

568
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,901
- What did you do to my closet?
- I cleaned it.

569
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,628
Dr. Wilson said that I could go ahead...

570
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,572
It's not Dr. Wilson's closet.

571
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,785
- Where's the wood box?
- Wood box?

572
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,455
Yes, the wood box. It's made of wood,
and it's box shaped.

573
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,021
It's been in the back of this closet
since the day I moved in.

574
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,460
- I didn't see any kind of...
- You may not have seen it,

575
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,666
but you've obviously moved it.
The question is where.

576
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,714
Well, I did not move anything, I just...

577
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,216
It was in this closet.

578
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,676
Then you came,
now it's not in this closet.

579
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,638
OK. What type of box?

580
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,972
Wood! Wood!

581
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,642
A brown wood box.
It's got a metal handle on the top,

582
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,478
looks like a tackle or tool box.

583
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,481
Ah, you mean the chest.
The one that's under the bed?

584
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,960
Do you need to fix something?

585
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,721
Thanks.

586
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,812
Well, fine, then I'll go to one
on another floor.

587
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,898
Actually, they're not working there
either.

588
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,443
Every bathroom in the whole hospital
is out of order?

589
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,947
Well, the water...

590
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,991
I'm going to the bathroom.

591
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,206
- Where is she?
- Had to go to the bathroom.

592
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,541
I told you not to let her.

593
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,543
What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?

594
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,253
Why not? She likes that.

595
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,934
What are you doing?

596
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,563
Your hand is wet.

597
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,816
Sorry, must be nervous.
I've got some bad news.

598
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,153
What?

599
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,990
The damage to your husband's lungs
is permanent.

600
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,619
The kidney damage is reversible,
and with the right therapy,

601
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,163
he should regain full
neurological function.

602
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,999
Other than the fact that he's not going
to be running any marathons,

603
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,918
he should be fine.

604
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,712
But that's good news, isn't it?

605
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,547
Not finished.

606
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,092
When I was a kid,

607
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,346
my dad was stationed
at a Marine base in Egypt.

608
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,556
We were in the middle of nowhere

609
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,602
and there was absolutely nothing
for a kid to do,

610
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,602
except look for a mummy's tomb.

611
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,481
You didn't want me to go to the
bathroom because you wanted to tell me

612
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,777
my husband is going to be fine
and that you used to live in Egypt?

613
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,821
I didn't have a problem
with you going to the bathroom.

614
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,866
I just didn't want you
to wash your hands.

615
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,496
I never actually found a mummy,

616
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,707
but I did learn a fair amount
about the ancient Egyptians.

617
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,460
For example, they discovered
that stannous chloride

618
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,506
is not only great for toughening
ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold,

619
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,633
it turns bright purple.

620
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,769
Now, either your fingers actually
are worth their weight in gold...

621
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,398
or you've been sprinkling
your husband's cereal

622
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,733
with gold sodium thiomalate.

623
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,528
It's an arthritis remedy.
It's rarely used here in the U.S.,

624
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,699
but it's still popular in Mexico.
Gotta give you props.

625
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,203
Never heard of anyone using gold before.

626
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,375
It's almost poetic.

627
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,254
That's ridiculous.

628
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,507
Heavy metal tox screen for gold
was off the chart.

629
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,180
- Why would I...
- Because you were trying to kill him.

630
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,059
I'd love to know the why
behind that why.

631
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,563
But you're not gonna tell me, are you?

632
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,524
You're wrong.

633
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,236
I love Bob.

634
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,906
I never said you didn't love him.

635
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,624
How could somebody do that?
Sit by someone's bedside day and night

636
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,003
helping them, comforting them
and at the same time killing them?

637
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,047
Maybe he was having an affair.

638
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,965
Maybe she was having an affair.

639
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,594
Or maybe she just gets her kicks out
of slowly sucking the life out of a guy,

640
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,513
- watching him suffer.
- He must have done something to her.

641
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,974
- Yeah, he had it coming.
- I didn't say he deserved it.

642
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,727
The only thing he did wrong
was marry a sociopath.

643
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,605
Or maybe she just got tired
of being married.

644
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,858
Didn't want to admit
to family and friends

645
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,070
that the marriage
everyone thought was perfect, wasn't.

646
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,448
Shouldn't one of us stay with her?
What if she tries to run?

647
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,575
Yeah, Cameron, go back there.

648
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,037
It'd be weird if we were
all in the ladies' room.

649
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,611
We started chelation therapy
with dimercaprol.

650
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,573
Thrilled to hear it.

651
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,701
His kidney function hasn't improved.

652
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,620
It will.

653
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,956
He's gonna need a lung transplant.

654
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,961
He's becoming more attractive
by the minute, isn't he?

655
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,381
You're pleased.

656
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:11,468
You think you've proved
that every marriage is a mistake.

657
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,387
Do I look pleased?

658
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,368
Ignorance is bliss.

659
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,181
You have one new message.

660
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,434
Hi, this is Blake Hanson
calling for Dr. Wilson.

661
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,478
I got a better offer for the apartment.

662
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,188
I know I offered it to you already,

663
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,475
so if you match the offer
you can still have the place.

664
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,068
Make sure you call me first thing
in the morning and let me know.

665
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,528
Otherwise, well, you've got my number.

666
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,707
Message deleted.
