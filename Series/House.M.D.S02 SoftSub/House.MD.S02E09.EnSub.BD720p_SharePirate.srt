1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,668
Blue Calamari is
still in the lead,

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:04,379
but Ample Parking is making strides,
and is now in fourth, third,

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,465
and holding second place, while
Blue Calamari is at a steady speed.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,550
And down the stretch they come!

5
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:13,805
Ample Parking comes from behind.
And it's Ample Parking by a nose.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:20,019
This is the last call for the third race.
You may still wager if you hurry.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,813
Here's your information
on the race...

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,815
Out of the way.
Cripple coming through.

9
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,276
Sixth race at Golden Downs.

10
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:32,156
I'll take the two and the four.
Hey, that's my birthday.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,660
February 4, 1963. Do you
think that's a good bet?

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,453
What's your birthday?

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,082
Take your time. Don't worry.
There's only 30 seconds to post.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,293
Is there any way I can bet
on the six and the three also?

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,296
You know, for the year? All four horses.
Can I do that?

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:52,051
He wants a $2 exacta box, two,
four, six, three. Give him $24.

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,892
Your turn.

18
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,146
The ninth at Gulf stream Park.
$500 on the three horse,

19
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,564
Seminole Uprising to win.

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,524
Might as well burn your money.

21
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,402
I'll burn my winnings.
Bigger flame.

22
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,197
Same race, Termigator to win.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,826
Sorry, race just closed.

24
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,202
Damn it.

25
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,580
She was 14-to-1, too.

26
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,291
Then fatass over there
just saved you money.

27
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,667
No way Seminole Uprising's...

28
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,878
I don't bet on the horses.
I bet on the jocks.

29
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,173
My rider's bulimic,
purges after his weigh-ins.

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,747
Leave a two-pound pile
at the starting gate,

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,886
shaves valuable time
off that final eighth.

32
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,138
Nice to have
inside information.

33
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,806
By a length.

34
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,099
The Burning Bush
and on the level is Candy,

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,435
right up on the inside
is Bowfinger...

36
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,777
And Termigator
pulling up against the rail.

37
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,904
Is anybody here a doctor?

38
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,952
Trying to cop a feel?

39
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
I took a CPR class at the Y.

40
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,707
That would be useful if she was having
a heart attack instead of a seizure.

41
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,417
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?

42
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,212
If you wanna get a finger bitten off.
Call an ambulance.

43
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,922
Methodist's three blocks down.

44
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,007
- I could drive her.
- Just make the call.

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,309
- What the hell is that?
- How should I know?

46
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,354
Tell the paramedics to take
her to Princeton-Plainsboro.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,022
Her doctor's name is House.

48
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,858
And it's Termigator,
winning by two lengths.

49
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,062
Since when does House
hang out at OTB?

50
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,313
The man's an addict.

51
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,023
Right, addicted to pills,
not gambling.

52
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,527
It's the same thing.
Drug abuse, drinking, gambling.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,154
They all fire up the same
pleasure centers in the brain.

54
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,698
An addict is an addict is an...

55
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,491
Gambling doesn't take away
his pain.

56
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,159
It does when I win.

57
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,122
Hot OTB babe has grand mal

58
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,708
and inexplicable bruising.

59
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,334
What up with that?

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,628
You were just standing there,
and she started to seize?

61
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,172
Spend as much time
around the real people as I do,

62
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,299
someone gets sick.

63
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,593
Her platelets are 89,
she's anemic.

64
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,762
And she has
a blood alcohol level of 0.13.

65
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,681
Hot OTB babe?

66
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,101
Obviously a working girl.
Probably an STD infection.

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,811
No fever. No infection.

68
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,605
Alcohol abuse explains it all.

69
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,649
Causes seizures and affects
her blood's ability to clot,

70
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,817
which causes bruising.

71
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,823
Start her on heparin,
she'll be fine by morning.

72
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,738
Except for the fact that the
bruises are not petechial,

73
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,197
which means it's not DIC.

74
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,241
So the bruises were caused
by trauma.

75
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,077
She probably got beat up
by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

76
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,581
What's that called when you judge
someone before ever meeting them?

77
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,583
She's a regular at OTB.

78
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,629
Somehow, I don't see her holding down
a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.

79
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,173
I was there.
I have a 9-to-3 job.

80
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,552
It could be SLE, familial
telangiectasias, or even Cushing's.

81
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,930
- Good. Start with those.
- Which one?

82
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,557
Cushing's. It explains
the seizure and the bruising.

83
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,683
Not the anemia.

84
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,893
So she doesn't eat
a lot of meat.

85
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,896
DIC brought on by alcohol
abuse is far more likely.

86
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,400
Do a full workup, H and P.
And lab her up, LP, MRI.

87
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:43,157
Did you just ever so subtly order
me to get her medical history?

88
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,620
Cuddy put me in charge
last week, so, yeah.

89
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,962
It was a pretend in charge, a formality
to get past the suits in legal.

90
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,256
Right, those licensing-board folk
love to play dress up and pretend.

91
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,051
Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep
your parking space.

92
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,429
You can have it. You'll also need
my handicap placard.

93
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,597
Bend over.

94
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,203
You make
a pretty convincing argument.

95
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,810
Chase killed that woman.
Now Foreman's in charge?

96
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,645
Yeah, we have
a pecking order here.

97
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,522
If Cameron kills somebody,
Chase takes over.

98
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,065
There's a flow chart
in the lobby.

99
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,734
For the next three weeks, you
answer directly to Dr. Foreman.

100
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,529
And I expect you here
for grand rounds at 9:00.

101
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,823
By the way,
I like sugar in my coffee.

102
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,494
If there's a screw up,
it's your screw up.

103
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,623
You won't have Dr. House
to fall back on.

104
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,548
"Do you wear a seat belt?" Is that
really relevant to a seizure?

105
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,716
Skip it.

106
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,218
How about,
"Were you vaccinated for polio?"

107
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,054
I think you gave me
the form intended for FDR.

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,015
You really like
Teeny Tiny Mo in the fifth?

109
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,100
I went 4-for-6 yesterday.

110
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,103
You want winners?
Cure me first.

111
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,690
"Are you generally satisfied
with your life?"

112
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,734
It does not ask that.

113
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,282
You know, I was gonna ask

114
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,577
what a respectable doctor
was doing at an OTB parlor.

115
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,872
Somehow that question
doesn't seem relevant anymore.

116
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,374
- What's your excuse?
- It turns me on.

117
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,127
Yeah? What else
turns you on? Drugs?

118
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,755
Casual sex? Rough sex?

119
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,424
Casual rough sex?

120
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,178
- I'm a doctor. I need to know.
- No sex.

121
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,638
Just moved here.
Haven't even found a job yet.

122
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,931
Don't know anybody.

123
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,600
Came here without a job.

124
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,772
That means you didn't move here, you
moved away from somewhere else.

125
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,068
Does that hurt? No.

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,946
Are you on any prescription meds?
Hormones? Prednisone?

127
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,325
I already answered that one. I think it
was question number 20-something.

128
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,077
Well, yeah. And I could
reach down and get it.

129
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,123
But that would kind of spoil
the whole cool move.

130
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm not on any medications.

131
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,708
- Are you a vegetarian?
- No. Why?

132
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,836
Because you might have something
called Cushing's syndrome,

133
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,004
which basically means...

134
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,716
My pituitary
is overproducing ACTH,

135
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,638
which is causing my adrenal glands to push
too much cortisol into my bloodstream.

136
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,015
What a coincidence.
I'm a doctor, too.

137
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,725
Yeah, I had it last year.

138
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:19,063
They did brain surgery, removed
an adenoma from my pituitary.

139
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,910
What did you just say?

140
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,622
"You were right, House. Her pituitary
tumor regrew. It is Cushing's.

141
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,415
Uncanny how you do that."

142
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,376
Actually,
it was Cameron's idea.

143
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,169
No, Cameron had three ideas.

144
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,839
I chose one to encourage,
to nurture...

145
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,757
Yeah, you're all about
the nurturing.

146
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,634
Do you need a hug?

147
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,013
I don't see any regrowth.

148
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,826
You get her medical records
faxed over?

149
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,685
Work smart, not hard.
That's my philosophy, boss.

150
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,728
I'll take that as a no.

151
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,899
Anica, I need you
to stay completely still.

152
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,526
Sorry.

153
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,614
Still don't see anything.

154
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,701
Okay, so it's a microadenoma.
Too small to see.

155
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,161
So small, it's not even there.

156
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,205
Right. It's just a coincidence
that I predicted a rare condition

157
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,771
that she happened to have
a year ago.

158
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,000
Results from her LP back yet?

159
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,836
Didn't do an LP.
I knew what she had.

160
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,756
Go do the LP.

161
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,850
Okay, I need you to roll over on
your side, kiss your kneecaps.

162
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,727
Party time.

163
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,563
I thought it only took
one doctor to do this.

164
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,772
I'm observing.

165
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,108
She's here to make sure
I don't paralyze you.

166
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,319
You've done this before, right?

167
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,570
Successfully?

168
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,447
He's kidding.
He's an excellent doctor.

169
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm going to numb
the area with some lidocaine,

170
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,701
and then we're off
to the races.

171
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,286
See what I did there?

172
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,873
I used horse-racing jargon to make
the patient feel more comfortable.

173
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,542
Okay, here we go.

174
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,254
Felt like bone. Does that hurt?

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,006
A little bit.
What are you doing?

176
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,884
Try rounding your back
a bit more.

177
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,677
You're perfect
just the way you are.

178
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,388
Oops, that was all me.

179
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,016
Might want to move down
one vertebra.

180
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,602
This is actually much harder
than I remember.

181
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,314
My chest feels a little tight.

182
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,815
Try taking a deep breath.

183
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,662
Dr. House, maybe I should
take it from here.

184
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,860
Eighth time's the charm.

185
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,571
You trying to piss off Foreman?

186
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,365
Just let...

187
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,950
BP's 240 over 140.

188
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,493
Turn that thing off, will you?

189
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,744
Take the needle out.

190
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,621
- Take the needle out!
- Okay.

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,294
It's a hypertensive crisis. Start
her on an IV lopressor drip.

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,172
Titrate to systolic less than 140.
She'll be fine.

193
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,758
Cameron. Meet me in my office.

194
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,721
At the risk of sounding
redundant and right, again,

195
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,766
she has Cushing's. Cushing's.

196
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,478
Right, the fact that you mangled
her LP has nothing to do with it.

197
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,605
Actually, it has
everything to do with it.

198
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,484
Cushing's plus stress
equals hypertensive crisis.

199
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,569
Smart move, sending the rookie.

200
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,948
Her initial symptoms could have
been caused by alcohol-induced DIC.

201
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,783
She had a hypertensive crisis

202
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,827
because it's been at least six hours
since she had her last drink.

203
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,995
She's detoxing.

204
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,956
The exact same moment that I'm
futilely trying to give her an LP?

205
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,918
Right. An invisible tumor on her
pituitary is much more likely.

206
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
What if the tumor
is somewhere else?

207
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,424
There could be an ACTH-secreting
tumor on her lung or pancreas.

208
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,508
It's awfully rare.

209
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,051
Not as rare
as an invisible tumor.

210
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,679
Why didn't they put you
in charge instead of Foreman?

211
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,765
Oh, yeah, you're the guy
that killed that woman.

212
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,185
Get a pan-man scan
before she dies a cortisol OD.

213
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,400
Fine. Do it.

214
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,512
But when you don't find anything,
put her on a Librium taper

215
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,489
for the withdrawal and get
her a bed in a rehab clinic.

216
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,753
Lungs look clean.

217
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,756
Her lymph nodes
are not enlarged.

218
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,926
Cuddy tapped Foreman
to run the department.

219
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,846
- I didn't even get asked.
- Neither did I.

220
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,806
- You were suspended.
- I was kidding.

221
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,894
It's the irony of women in charge.
They don't like other women in charge.

222
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,564
What? You think
it's something else?

223
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,443
You sabotaged yourself.
You went on a date with House.

224
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,446
You slept with me. Putting you
in charge of this department

225
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,240
is like a sexual harassment
suit waiting to happen.

226
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,867
Yeah, they're really worried

227
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,203
that I'm gonna create
a hostile work environment.

228
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,330
Maybe that's the problem.

229
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,875
Being in charge means
having to say no to House.

230
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,419
Would you hire you for that?

231
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,967
Anderson coming out strong.
What is he thinking?

232
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,553
He watched
what Tom Mants just did.

233
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,641
You ordered MRis
for the entire maternity ward?

234
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,976
I was in a crazy mood.

235
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,062
Good thing I got
a new boss to back me up.

236
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,272
Although, I think one of
those is actually necessary.

237
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,858
Better comb through
before you cancel them all.

238
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,615
What do you expect me to do,
House? Quit? Cry?

239
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,701
Actually, I expect you
to act like what you are.

240
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,329
My employee. My subordinate.

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,665
My bitch.

242
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,750
Well, since you asked nicely...

243
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,918
My God.

244
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,255
I can't believe I got more than a year
behind on my discharge summaries.

245
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,716
Got to get caught up.
Oh, no, wait.

246
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,845
I'm not authorized to sign
these anymore. Only you are.

247
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,681
Keep it coming.
I'm not gonna break.

248
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,852
Scan showed a mass
on her pancreas.

249
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,980
Looks malignant.
Probably inoperable.

250
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,733
I'd give her two months.

251
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,532
On the bright side,
it still means I was right.

252
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,042
Where's Dr. House?

253
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,378
Dr. Foreman's
overseeing your case.

254
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,140
He thought it'd be best
if I spoke with you.

255
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:21,508
We found a mass
in your pancreas.

256
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,886
It looks like cancer.

257
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,265
So something in my pancreas
caused me to have a seizure?

258
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,978
Probably.
But the bigger point is...

259
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,568
A one-year survival rate for
pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.

260
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,236
So what's the treatment?

261
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:47,117
We need to biopsy the mass to
see what we're dealing with,

262
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,662
and then we can

263
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,081
recommend options from there.

264
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,625
Sounds good.

265
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,382
I need your consent
to do the biopsy.

266
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,348
Thanks.

267
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,099
Wish me luck.

268
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,519
Good luck.

269
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,607
It was weird.
She barely reacted at all.

270
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,277
I've had people hug me
and people take a swing at me.

271
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,738
This was more like
she didn't even hear me.

272
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,907
Magnify three times.

273
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,497
House assisting.

274
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,707
That is funny.

275
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,628
Too bad Foreman's gonna die.

276
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,268
Good afternoon, I'm Dr. House.
I'm gonna be looking at your...

277
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,272
Perfect.

278
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,316
Excuse me.

279
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,782
Need Dr. Foreman in exam
room one for a consult.

280
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,660
So, when did this start?

281
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,579
Couple weeks ago.

282
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,458
I didn't want to get pregnant. Jake's not
into rubbers, so I got on the jelly.

283
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,902
You think I'm allergic
or something?

284
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,463
You have an infection.

285
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,548
I'm gonna need a sample.

286
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,091
I brought the jar.

287
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,468
No, I meant a sample of your...

288
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,312
Okay. We have
a neurological problem here.

289
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,938
There's something wrong
with my brain?

290
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,482
Oh, yeah.

291
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,527
Cover yourself up.
Got what I need.

292
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,448
What's up?

293
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,407
Smell this.

294
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,288
Smells like vaginosis,
but it's not really my call.

295
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:00,167
Great. I'll be sure to put a gold
star by your name on the board.

296
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,171
Anica's biopsy for pancreatic
cancer was negative.

297
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,429
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some antibiotics

298
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,514
and you probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

299
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,474
How long?

300
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,644
On an evolutionary basis,
I'd recommend forever.

301
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,066
The mass in the pancreas is benign.
It's probably just scar tissue.

302
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,361
Good news. She's not sick at all.
Other than being an alcoholic.

303
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:32,240
The labs you sent yesterday put her
ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter.

304
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,493
She's got Cushing's.
Something set it off.

305
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,372
It's gotta be in her brain. Set
her up for a venous sampling.

306
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,706
There is another possibility.

307
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,916
Chase, hold on.

308
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,503
How'd you get him trained
so fast? Electronic collar?

309
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,837
Got treats in your pocket?

310
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,715
She didn't even read the consent
form for the pancreatic biopsy.

311
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,883
Who reads those things?

312
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,303
Maybe she didn't read it because she knew
that there was nothing wrong with her.

313
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,097
There is another explanation
for the Cushing's.

314
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,434
Maybe she injected herself with the ACTH.
Her behavior suggests Munchausen's.

315
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,270
She's had four hospitalizations
in the last four months.

316
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,441
Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly
points to nothing being wrong with you.

317
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,444
She's had zero symptoms
since she got here.

318
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,691
The scarring on her pancreas

319
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,489
could be caused from injecting
herself with the benzene

320
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,907
and setting off the seizures.

321
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,450
She's had brain surgery.

322
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,412
You can fake a stomachache.
You can't fake a brain tumor.

323
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,539
You can fake an invisible one.

324
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,377
We should check her apartment.
Look for medications, syringes...

325
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,546
- Venous sampling's easier.
- And more dangerous.

326
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,591
- Not if you get caught breaking in.
- So don't get caught, House.

327
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,554
Why do you think Cuddy
picked Foreman over me?

328
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,806
Have I done something wrong
or is there...

329
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,183
Will it make you shut up if I told you
she wanted someone black?

330
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,561
How would you describe
my leadership skills?

331
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,147
Nonexistent.
Otherwise excellent.

332
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,941
There's more to being a leader
than being a jerk.

333
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,152
The world will never know.

334
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,908
No. No way. It just snowed.

335
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,535
Yesterday.
The streets are clear.

336
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,913
My car is right there.

337
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,625
There's construction on Elm.
Bike will be faster.

338
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,232
There's even books
in the bathroom.

339
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,570
Well, either she's very smart or
she has a severe fiber deficiency.

340
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,704
She's got an appointment with
her ophthalmologist on Tuesday

341
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,457
and an appointment with her
gynecologist on Thursday.

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,543
Multiple appointments
with multiple doctors.

343
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,253
Symptom of Munchausen's.

344
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,673
Or, just thinking
outside the box here,

345
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,551
she has a vagina
and trouble reading.

346
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,889
There's three pairs of reading glasses,
each with different prescriptions.

347
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,767
Which would be explained by a tumor
pressing on the optic nerve.

348
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,519
Because you're looking
for her to have a tumor.

349
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,521
And you're looking for...

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,066
A person with Munchausen's
syndrome drinks battery acid.

351
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,693
But they don't go to an ophthalmologist
to get their pupils dilated.

352
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,113
An ophthalmologist is a doctor.
Attention is attention.

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,784
How many hospitals have you contacted?
Has one doctor said she's crazy?

354
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,620
- It's not Munchausen's.
- It's not your call.

355
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,999
If you think
she's got Munchausen's,

356
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,045
then obviously you got
something to show the man.

357
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,587
A syringe in her apartment.
A bottle of ACTH.

358
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,914
Munchausen's patients are good
at covering their tracks.

359
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,607
Right. So, the fact that we found
nothing proves there's something.

360
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,387
Look at the pathology reports from
the surgery she had in Chicago.

361
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,306
They removed 30% of her pituitary.
They found no tumor.

362
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,308
It's possible
the surgeons just missed it.

363
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,675
In that kind of surgery, you're
just cutting and hoping...

364
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,396
Of course, we're both right.

365
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,982
Excellent solution,
everybody's happy.

366
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,525
Come on, step up, Foreman.

367
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,403
If you think I'm right, order me
to stick a needle in her brain.

368
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,697
If you think Cameron's right,
send the patient home.

369
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,533
Either she'll be fine,
or she'll die.

370
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,703
Do the venous sampling.
Get her consent.

371
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,461
Nice move, boss.
Way to cover your ass.

372
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,422
I just agreed with you.

373
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,173
Not because
you think I'm right,

374
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,510
you're just taking
the safe route. You're a wuss.

375
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,889
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

376
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,561
Hey, Wilson,
guess what Foreman just did!

377
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,111
Hi.

378
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,116
This is a consent form to
stick a wire into your brain.

379
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,452
It's important for hospitals to
get these signed for procedures

380
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,954
that are
completely unnecessary.

381
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,875
- Then why are you doing it?
- Because you're mentally ill.

382
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:57,380
You injected yourself with ACTH to induce
Cushing's to get attention from doctors.

383
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,632
And so far, it's worked.

384
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,134
I'd like to see another doctor.

385
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,096
- I'm not giving you what you want?
- I don't want a bitch.

386
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,515
Just sign the forms, okay?
And I'll get out of here.

387
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,685
Hopefully for you, whatever you
injected yourself with won't wear off

388
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,773
before you get the fun of a caring and
concerned doctor cutting into your head.

389
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,540
You chose me to make House
miserable, didn't you?

390
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:36,503
Apparently, he's making you miserable.
That's impressive.

391
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,879
Find someone else.

392
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,005
No.

393
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,132
For the first time
in six years,

394
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,260
I'm getting copied on all
experimental tests and procedures.

395
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,472
Clinic hours have been
logged and completed.

396
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,808
You've given me four months
of House's dictations

397
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,977
so I can finally bill
insurance companies.

398
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:55,230
I only did that stuff to prove
he couldn't make me miserable.

399
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,856
Well, way to go.

400
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,567
Now everybody's getting
what they need, even House.

401
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:04,072
He gets to play mad scientist, and
this department runs smoothly.

402
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,992
So I'm stuck with this
for the next three weeks.

403
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,244
Maybe longer.

404
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,998
Would you be interested
if this wasn't just pretend?

405
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,961
What did Mommy say? I don't
get any candy in my stocking?

406
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,629
Patient being prepped
for the venous sampling?

407
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,216
Yeah, a mentally ill patient is right
on track for a pointless procedure.

408
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,260
Yeah, we get your objection.

409
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,519
Foreman. Are you sure?

410
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,314
That doesn't make any sense.
Check it again.

411
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,151
We gotta delay
the venous sampling.

412
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,236
Why? Her urine turning orange?

413
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,615
How would you know that?

414
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,367
Because
that's what rifampin does.

415
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,202
She's not on antibiotics.

416
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,914
But if a Munchausen's patient
thinks she's about to get busted,

417
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,542
she sees pills labeled "Dangerous,
might cause seizures",

418
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,085
she might grab a couple.

419
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,547
And if that label were accidentally
on a bottle of antibiotics,

420
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,966
and if that bottle were
accidentally left in her room...

421
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,136
- You set her up?
- Might have. It's Munchausen's.

422
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,347
All this, she did to herself.

423
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,036
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

424
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,414
I had a seizure. I'm sick.
I need your help.

425
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,166
Not from this department.

426
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,126
The half-life
of rifampin is three hours.

427
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,338
After that, you'll get your psych
referral and your discharge papers.

428
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,673
You know, just because you stick
your fingers down your throat

429
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,426
doesn't mean
the rest of us are screwed up.

430
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,347
I guess when cooperation fails,
you move on to hostility.

431
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,557
I didn't do this to myself.

432
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,739
100% commitment.
Sign of a good liar.

433
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,075
Also the sign of a sociopath.

434
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,160
What are you doing?

435
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,954
Correcting your last note.

436
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,790
We can't discharge her
if she's sick.

437
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,042
Anybody ever tell you,
you write like a girl?

438
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,420
What? You got some other explanation
for orange urine?

439
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,965
- It's Munchausen's.
- Correct, but not complete.

440
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,217
You just don't want to admit
that she skunked you.

441
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:33,346
At the end of The Boy Who Cried
Wolf, the wolf really does come.

442
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,391
Then he eats the sheep,
and the boy, and his parents.

443
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,476
- The wolf doesn't eat the parents.
- He does when I tell it.

444
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,187
You're not telling
the story now. I am.

445
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,107
Look, I checked her records.

446
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,484
All her hospitalizations
were for different things.

447
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,279
Brain tumor, fainting spells,
skin rashes, seizures.

448
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,989
She's had every
blood test known to man

449
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,198
and the results
are all over the map.

450
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,076
There's only one constant,
low HCT.

451
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,620
- The anemia's real.
- There's a million things

452
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
she could have taken
to have done that.

453
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,790
True, it could just be her MO.

454
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,127
She self-induces two illnesses. One
always changes, one never does.

455
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,297
Or maybe she has Munchausen's
and aplastic anemia,

456
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,257
which would mean,
without proper treatment,

457
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,863
she'll continue
to get sicker, weaker,

458
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,344
eventually she'll start
bleeding internally and die.

459
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,388
- She's not getting sicker.
- She will.

460
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,850
If her bone marrow was dying, the
entire blood panel would be affected.

461
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,643
- Her white count's normal.
- So far.

462
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,146
- We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
- No. No more tests.

463
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,274
Look, you kick her to the curb
with a Munchausen's diagnosis

464
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
you're guaranteeing that no doctor
will ever listen to her again.

465
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,696
We do more tests, we'll only
be feeding her psychosis.

466
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,282
The more attention we give
her, the more she'll want.

467
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,161
What if she doesn't know
we're testing her?

468
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,705
House, you were wrong.
Live with it.

469
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,374
There's probably some blood
left over from previous tests.

470
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,960
Blood tests alone
can't confirm aplastic anemia.

471
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,214
Yes, I know. That's why I want
to do a bone marrow biopsy.

472
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,174
But blood tests could show
a systemic disease.

473
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,551
- A virus or a toxin could be the cause.
- Fine.

474
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,762
You want to test the extra blood?
Knock yourself out.

475
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,388
But the patient is off-limits.

476
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,808
And if the results
are positive, I get my biopsy?

477
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,146
It's the safe way to go.

478
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:26,084
I need all of these tests
and a PCR done on this sample.

479
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,378
You're gonna need more blood.

480
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,171
Patient's empty.

481
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,965
Then I can't do it.

482
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,342
You can try.

483
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:38,972
I can try to look like Salma Hayek,
that's not gonna make it happen.

484
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:47,480
You may not have Salma's ass,
but she doesn't have your eyes.

485
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,233
Yeah, right.

486
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,699
How soon you need it?

487
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,311
Dr. Wilson, can I talk to you
about something in confidence?

488
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,246
- Of course.
- It's about House.

489
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,956
Oh, then no.

490
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,458
Fine. I won't say anything.

491
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,882
Do you think there's any way House
would take me seriously as his boss?

492
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,304
Where is this coming from?
Did Cuddy say something?

493
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,472
We talked. She intimated.

494
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,143
And you want my advice
on how to usurp him?

495
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,980
It's very ancient Rome, you'll
need a toga, of course, a sword.

496
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:33,067
It's not a coup. I just want to figure
out some way we can work together.

497
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,195
I mean, I keep the team running from
an administrative point of view,

498
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,415
House doesn't have to
deal with the red tape.

499
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:38,531
It's a win-win.

500
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,325
I'm sure he'll see it that way.

501
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,536
Do you have any advice
on how to approach him?

502
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,164
- How to deal the guy?
- No.

503
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,407
But you won't tell him
we talked?

504
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,504
No.

505
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,259
There is no way
this is going to happen.

506
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,153
Epstein-Barr titers
are through the roof,

507
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,156
the most common viral cause
of aplastic anemia.

508
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,326
So what I'm saying is...

509
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,878
- Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.
- Just a wee bit.

510
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:34,962
Could indicate...

511
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,422
You see that in sickle cell.

512
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,674
Not all sickle cell
patients are black.

513
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,928
None of her other blood panels showed
any sign of sickle cell, which means

514
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:46,641
either something's changed drastically
since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.

515
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,226
Of course it is.

516
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,062
Metaphorically.

517
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,690
Look, I couldn't do the tests.

518
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,693
I tried, but there wasn't
enough blood left over.

519
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,321
If you'd just let me
do the biopsy.

520
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,157
No way.

521
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,700
I just got back
from a suspension.

522
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,620
And if it wasn't for me,
you would've been fired.

523
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,914
Why don't you just
get the sample yourself?

524
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,582
Since when have you cared
what your boss said?

525
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,960
I don't care what anybody
says, I care what they do.

526
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,171
Right now Blackpoleon Blackaparte
has got the nurses on red alert.

527
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,257
I can't get into
the patient's room.

528
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,260
So, come on, I'll draw the
enemy fire, you outflank them

529
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,987
get in there,
get the bone marrow sample.

530
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:24,971
Can't.

531
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,683
Who you more afraid of?

532
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,010
I'm not afraid of Foreman,
I agree with him.

533
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,940
All the tests back him up.

534
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,276
All the tests
have not been done.

535
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,363
You do realize that Blackaparte's
reign is only temporary.

536
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,492
I also realize that no matter what I do,
you're still gonna treat me like crap.

537
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,995
"Crap" is a relative term.

538
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,755
I never even made it
to the room.

539
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,967
Nurses called the attending as
soon as a trocar was ordered.

540
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,011
You used her real name?

541
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,222
I just processed your
patient's discharge papers.

542
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,683
She's on her way out right now.

543
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,355
Wait up.

544
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,733
It's all right,
she's gonna stay.

545
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,818
- Wonderful.
- Oh, bite me.

546
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,905
I don't need to hear
the riot act again.

547
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,449
How'd you like
another medical test?

548
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,201
- What?
- Sit.

549
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,453
Why?

550
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,332
So you don't crack your skull
when you pass out.

551
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,334
Just do it.

552
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,129
You know what colchicine is?

553
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,297
No.

554
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,466
Well, don't feel bad.
It's for gout.

555
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,385
It's got nothing to do with anything
you've ever pretended to have.

556
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,096
- I'm not pretending to...
- Shut up.

557
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,433
Colchicine decimates
your white blood cells.

558
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,060
Leaves almost no trace.

559
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,987
It's great for faking
your way into hospitals.

560
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,189
- I didn't fake my way...
- Shut up.

561
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,776
You've been
doing this for years.

562
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,071
Don't worry,
it's probably not your fault.

563
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,490
When you were a kid,
you had a close relative

564
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,284
who had a chronic disease,
probably your sister.

565
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,957
And you saw all the attention she got
while you were left alone, ignored.

566
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,793
And it really,
seriously screwed you up.

567
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,921
- I do not have a relative...
- Shut up!

568
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,507
I'm trying to give you
what you want.

569
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,095
And save your life.

570
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,057
You have aplastic anemia.

571
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,269
What, are you trying
to scare me now?

572
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,939
It means you're not
just sick in the head.

573
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,066
Problem is,
the rest of you appears well.

574
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,443
So I gotta make you seem as
sick as you're supposed to be

575
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,112
by injecting you with a drug

576
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,864
that simulates the symptoms
that you actually have.

577
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,706
All you need to know is, you've
hit the Munchausen's jackpot.

578
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,544
I'm gonna give you a cocktail of
insulin for seizure and colchicine

579
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,212
to kill your white count.

580
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,008
This will absolutely confirm my
diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

581
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,885
There is one small catch.

582
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,973
If you've actually done something
to yourself to cause the anemia,

583
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,474
then I'm wrong.

584
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,144
And if I do what I plan to do,

585
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,606
then the treatment will kill
you instead of saving you.

586
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,066
So I need to know.

587
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:28,112
Have you been taking anything
besides the insulin, the ACTH,

588
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,032
and the pills
Cameron left in your room?

589
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,080
No.

590
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,460
Good. Give me your arm.

591
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,306
It was my mom.

592
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,516
She had MS.

593
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,020
She was in and out
of hospitals all the time.

594
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,607
People were always trying
to do things for her.

595
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,654
Bring her food, or brush her
hair, or make her happy.

596
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,823
People cared.

597
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,663
She died when I was 16.

598
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,710
Then there was no one.

599
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,507
Boo-hoo.

600
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,136
Where are you going?

601
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,182
I obviously can't be around
when it happens.

602
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,434
Well, what are you gonna do,
you're just gonna...

603
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,561
Relax, you know the drill.

604
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,690
People walk by here
all the time, you'll be fine.

605
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,218
So, barely out the door
and she has another seizure.

606
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,470
She must have somehow grabbed
insulin on the way out.

607
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,723
Once she's stable,
we need to get her out of here

608
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,391
before she does more damage
to herself.

609
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,892
We can't.

610
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,311
Her white count's down.

611
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,064
Sorry, I missed that.

612
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,692
Hearing's been off since
the Ricky Martin concert,

613
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,027
some cholo
kicked me in the head.

614
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:35,072
White count, hematocrit,
and platelets are all off.

615
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,950
Her bone marrow's shutting down.
She actually has aplastic anemia.

616
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,160
Say what?

617
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,495
All her other labs
show nothing that would...

618
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,624
Labs, shmabs. A good diagnostician
reads between the labs.

619
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,585
You were right.

620
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,629
Hey, we're not here
to play the blame game.

621
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,339
These things happen.

622
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,593
Sometimes doctors send people
out on the street to die

623
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,553
after other doctors
have warned them

624
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,805
that they're sending people
out on the street to die.

625
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,266
There's no way you could know.

626
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,810
I'll go give her the news.

627
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,903
Who are you?

628
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:17,281
I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm in charge of your case.

629
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,410
You have aplastic anemia,

630
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,330
which means your bone
marrow has shut down.

631
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,082
Your body can't make
new blood anymore.

632
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,335
Are you sure?

633
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,880
I went back and checked your old records.
It makes sense.

634
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,384
The aplastic anemia's apparently
been developing for months.

635
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,013
I'm sorry, we should
have caught it earlier.

636
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,306
So.

637
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,811
It's not just the latest white count
that's leading you to feel this...

638
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,732
I know this is scary.

639
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,944
But a bone marrow transplant
could cure you.

640
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,363
A marrow transplant
could kill me.

641
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,616
The other option
is weekly blood transfusions,

642
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,993
injections of GCSF.

643
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,248
- It's a lifelong regimen.
- Yeah, I don't want that.

644
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,791
You sure?

645
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,087
I don't want to be cruel here,

646
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:17,258
but you've jumped through a lot of
hoops to get this sort of attention.

647
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,219
I just want to be healthy.

648
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,932
It's not so much fun
when you're actually sick.

649
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,310
No.

650
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,193
We'll check the registry.
See if there's a donor match.

651
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,657
Thank you.

652
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,417
We have to kill all the old bone marrow
before we give you the new stuff.

653
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,127
You'll have no immune system.

654
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,337
We'll keep you in a sterile
room for two weeks

655
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,424
to make sure everything's dead, then
we'll give you the donor marrow.

656
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,719
It'll take another couple
weeks until it takes hold.

657
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,304
You won't feel a thing.

658
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,682
If you get uncomfortable for any
reason and need to talk, don't yell.

659
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,310
Walls are
four inches thick, lead.

660
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,771
Use the microphone.
Are you ready?

661
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,274
Okay.

662
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,946
Where's Dr. House?

663
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,457
Turn it off!

664
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,877
- Now what?
- How long has she been in there?

665
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,337
Three minutes. What's going on?

666
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,673
She doesn't have
aplastic anemia.

667
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,008
- She has an infection.
- No.

668
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,095
Her white count would be through the roof.
Hers is on the floor.

669
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,972
Well, body does crazy things.

670
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,933
"Body does crazy things."
That explains everything!

671
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,142
She had no fever.

672
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,479
'Cause her self-inflicted Cushing's
suppressed her immune system.

673
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,524
Stopped her from having a
fever, hid the infection.

674
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,070
Clostridium perfringens
could cause the bruises,

675
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,196
the schistocytes, the anemia.

676
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,824
Explains everything
except the white count.

677
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:50,786
Augmentin is a lot safer than
destroying her immune system.

678
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,246
Why don't we try that?

679
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,711
You're taking the safe course?
What's going on?

680
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,756
There's lots of explanations
for a low white count.

681
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,217
Name one that fits her case.

682
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,347
Colchicine.

683
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,148
I figure that she'd gotten her
hands on it and self-medicated.

684
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,817
That's brilliant of her.

685
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,947
Take the exact medication that
would confirm your diagnosis.

686
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,200
People do crazy things.

687
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,287
You injected her against her
will just so you could be right?

688
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,622
- She consented.
- She's mentally ill!

689
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,833
But she smells oh-so-sweet.

690
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,338
She would've gotten sicker when
I said she was gonna get sicker

691
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,105
except Cameron
dosed her with antibiotics.

692
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,134
- Just hold this.
- Is everything okay?

693
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,719
Pull my finger.

694
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,349
Grapey.

695
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,144
You have a bacterium.
It's on all of us.

696
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,939
But the bruises you gave yourself with
the Cushing's made a lovely home.

697
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,276
Bacteria moved in,
parked their cars on the lawn.

698
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,903
There goes the neighborhood.

699
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,530
By neighborhood, I mean,
your internal organs.

700
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,992
So, should we put her
on the Augmentin, boss?

701
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,203
Or do you think she injected
herself with grapes?

702
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,166
I love the smell of pus
in the morning.

703
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,252
Smells like... victory.

704
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,428
If you were serious about the
offer, I'm serious about accepting.

705
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,142
I'd like to run the department. And you
said it yourself, things run smooth.

706
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,395
Except for the part where
House went behind your back

707
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,774
and KO'd the patient
with insulin and colchicine.

708
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,276
There was no reason
to suspect an infection.

709
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,821
Even House didn't think
it was an infection.

710
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,840
You would have done
the same thing I did.

711
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,825
And I'd be just as wrong.

712
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,453
What House did was insane.
But he saved her life.

713
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,412
He got lucky.

714
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,414
He got her to admit
she's got a problem.

715
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,168
She's agreed to outpatient treatment.
He gets lucky a lot.

716
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,759
Did you ever really intend
to give me this job,

717
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,470
or were you just trying to
stop me from stepping down?

718
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,223
Well, you've got
two more weeks in charge.

719
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,434
Hopefully the next case
will go better.

720
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,695
She should've died.
House is not a hero.

721
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,532
A person who has the guts
to break a bad rule,

722
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,492
they're a hero.

723
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,203
House doesn't break rules,
he ignores them.

724
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,166
He's not Rosa Parks,
he's an anarchist.

725
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:46,378
All he stands for is the right for
everyone to grab whatever they want

726
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,172
whenever they want.

727
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,465
You tell doctors that's okay,

728
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,386
your mortality rate
is gonna go through the roof.

729
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,476
Kind of digging this whole
Foreman-in-charge thing.

730
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,770
Give me those.

731
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,691
Frees me up to watch my soaps,

732
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,153
catch a movie in the afternoon,
have lunch with you.

733
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,280
Yeah, that's
a big change for you.

734
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,450
Now Cuddy's
on Foreman's ass, not mine.

735
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,251
You couldn't live with Foreman
as your boss.

736
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,711
Why not?

737
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,631
People can change, you know.

738
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,311
Your white count is way down.

739
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,730
We're going to need to admit you,
just to run a few more tests.

740
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,941
Whatever you think is best.

741
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,287
Last race at Belmont.
Put it all on the five

742
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,622
to win.
