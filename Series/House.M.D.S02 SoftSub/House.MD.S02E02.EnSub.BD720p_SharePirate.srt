1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:10,843
To all your friends,
you're delirious.

2
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:16,057
So consumed in all your doom.

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,980
Trying hard
to fill your emptiness.

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,651
The piece is gone.

5
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,403
Ten-minute warning. I'm fine.

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,030
- What about your meds?
- Got it, Mom.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,703
You are beautiful
no matter what they say.

8
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,485
House!

9
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,781
- Need you.
- Forget it. I'm going home.

10
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,326
- Hay fever?
- You must be a doctor and everything.

11
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,660
- Two minutes.
- No.

12
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,706
The purple thingie on the file means
that whoever is one of yours

13
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,292
which means cancer,
which means no way it's two minutes.

14
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,503
Fine, I'm lying. 30 minutes.

15
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,095
- Mystery of life.
- Benadryl might help.

16
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:22,266
- Already did 1,000 milligrams.
- Steam room?

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,395
Why, Jimmy. We'll talk about this
in the morning.

18
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,358
I got a 9-year-old with cancer.
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

19
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,820
- Terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose.
- Not yet.

20
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,655
She's hallucinating.

21
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,574
So the rhabdo's in her brain.

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,576
Make her comfortable.
She's got about a week.

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,163
Yeah, except there is
no cancer in her brain.

24
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,375
Pristine CT scan, blood tests,
protein markers, all negative.

25
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,502
The cancer's in remission.

26
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,381
Which means the hallucinations
are unconnected.

27
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,383
Fascinating, huh?

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,386
And not that it matters, but if you
fix whatever's going on in her head,

29
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,515
you give her maybe another year.
Long time for a 9-year-old.

30
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,353
No. It'll just fly by.

31
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,524
Five major surgeries,
a bone marrow transplant,

32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,568
fourteen rounds of chemo
and blast radiation.

33
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,487
If it was me, I'd just stay home
and watch TV or something,

34
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,364
not lie here
under a microscope.

35
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,996
Don't worry. Anything happens to you,
nobody's gonna lift a finger.

36
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,291
Differential diagnosis.

37
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,377
- On your marks, get set...
- Hallucinations could be caused by...

38
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,505
Whoa! Wait for it.

39
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,258
And go.

40
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,511
Latent neurotoxicity
from the chemo treatments.

41
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,972
No, patient's last round
of chemo was two months ago.

42
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,899
We would've seen it by now.
Genetic component?

43
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,394
Nothing on mom. Dad split
when she was pregnant.

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,647
- His medical history's also clean.
- What a guy.

45
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,359
What about graft versus host disease
from the bone marrow transplant?

46
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,362
Infection travels to her brain,
she has hallucinations.

47
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,648
Blood work and LP were clean.

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,950
But where there's infection,
there's meningeal swelling.

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,370
- CT shows no meningeal involvement.
- True.

50
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,372
Get a tox screen and an MRI.

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,875
We can do that, if you wanna ignore
what we just discussed.

52
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,043
Sounds good.

53
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,337
Toxic exposure doesn't make
any chronological sense.

54
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,631
I guess there is a third option.
She's making it all up

55
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,383
because she doesn't wanna get in
trouble for breaking a mirror.

56
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,846
Unfortunately we can't test
for that, so tox screen, MRI,

57
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,849
- and you stay away from the patient.
- What'd I do?

58
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,978
Oh, well, you'll just get all warm
and cuddly around the dying girl,

59
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,815
and insinuate yourself. Probably
end up in a custody battle.

60
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,192
Chase, you handle the mom.

61
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,569
Tell her that you'd just sit home
and watch TV and die,

62
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,256
but you've got
to go through the motions

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,491
and try to save her daughter's life.
It's a doctor thing.

64
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,497
- What the hell is this?
- Black walnut and ginger.

65
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
It's nice.

66
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,379
I'll just lay you down and I'll
attach this thingamajiggy.

67
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,424
- Sat monitor.
- A pro. Don't have to explain anything.

68
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,635
I like it.

69
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,394
- Central line for the chemo.
- Yeah. Doesn't hurt, does it?

70
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,395
No, it's awesome.

71
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,482
Instead of an IV, it saves me a lot
of time and a bunch of needle sticks.

72
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,820
Oh, I don't think I've ever heard anyone
say they like their central line before.

73
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,991
All right, can I interest you
in a walk in the park?

74
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,160
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

75
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,706
Don't want
any butterflies, either.

76
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,543
Doesn't matter what the walls look
like, you're still looking for cancer.

77
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,505
Not today. We're looking for an infection.
But I get your point.

78
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,132
- You comfortable?
- Yup.

79
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:46,345
- All right. Let's get this over with.
- A pro. I like it.

80
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,308
Whoa! Look at the time.

81
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,155
I should've been out of here
20 minutes ago.

82
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,314
- You've only been here 20 minutes.
- I can't slip anything by you, can I?

83
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,734
- There's a patient in One.
- Nah, I'm taking a sick day.

84
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,237
- Take some Claritin.
- Everyone's a doctor suddenly.

85
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,698
Patient in One
requested a male doctor.

86
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,117
- Balls are in your court, doctor.
- Union rules.

87
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,537
I can't check out this guy's seeping
gonorrhea this close to lunch.

88
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,830
Exam Room One.

89
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,709
Well, it's sexist, and
a very dangerous precedent.

90
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,544
If people could choose
the sex of their doctors,

91
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,255
- you gals would be out of business.
- Exam Room One!

92
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,886
Sore throat?

93
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,478
Well, it's not lupus. Well, not
everyone can operate a zipper.

94
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,481
You know, the up, down,
what comes next?

95
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,901
My new girlfriend
never been with a guy

96
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,445
who wasn't circumcised.

97
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,531
- So she freaked, and...
- Ah-ha.

98
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,702
And you wanted Rivkah to feel
all gemutlicht. I get it.

99
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,537
It's a shandah.

100
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,131
- I got some box cutters and...
- Just like Abraham did it.

101
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,843
I sterilized them,
which I was told...

102
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,261
Stop talking.

103
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get
the Twinkie back in the wrapper.

104
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,111
House. Hey, House.

105
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,574
Andie's MRI and tox screen were clean.
No infection, no neurotoxins.

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,797
Oxygen saturation is 94%.
Check her heart.

107
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,674
Her oxygen saturation
is normal.

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,802
It's off by one percentage point.
It's within range, it's normal.

109
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,889
If her DNA was off by one percentage
point, she'd be a dolphin.

110
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,559
We've got a patient who for no
obvious reason is hallucinating.

111
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,145
Since it's not obvious,
I thought we'd go with subtle.

112
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,522
It doesn't matter.
If her sat percentage is off,

113
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,399
that means her blood
isn't getting enough oxygen.

114
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,151
That's a problem
with her lungs, not her heart.

115
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,944
And a lung problem
isn't causing hallucinations.

116
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,946
But the lungs could
lead us somewhere that is.

117
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,739
Welcome to the end
of the thought process.

118
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,533
Primary pulmonary hypertension?

119
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,535
Maybe PE or pulmonary fibrosis.

120
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,663
Could be some bizarre case
of kyphoscoliosis.

121
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,874
I'm going home.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,877
While I'm resting, you guys
get some arterial blood gases,

123
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,838
once you confirm that she is
hypoxic, I want a plethysmography,

124
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,007
chest x-ray, CT and V-Q.

125
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,511
But if all that comes back negative,
then snake a catheter into her lungs.

126
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,807
Don't worry, if I don't
sleep in, I'll get bagels.

127
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,020
- You ever had this test before?
- What's it for?

128
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,275
This goes all the way up the vein
by your hip, into your lung.

129
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,570
If I find something up there blocking
anything, I pull it out. Simple.

130
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,408
It's gonna be easy. The doctor at
Sloan told me I had a great aorta.

131
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,871
- Oh, you have had this test before.
- Sorry. I just like hearing you talk.

132
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,963
I've never kissed a boy.

133
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,259
There's time yet for that.

134
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,679
There was a boy last summer.

135
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,227
I was at one of those cancer camps. I
just never had the guts to ask him.

136
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:29,151
You know, there's a good chance I'm
not gonna walk out of this hospital.

137
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,111
Even if I do, I'm nine.

138
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,031
Not a lot of kissing going on
in the third grade.

139
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,952
You will walk out of here, all right?
And you will kiss a boy.

140
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,665
There you go. A smile.

141
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,461
Will you kiss me?

142
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,676
- No.
- No one will ever know.

143
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,139
I'm sorry. I can't.

144
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,685
- I won't tell anyone.
- Listen, you're nine years old.

145
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,812
I'm 30.

146
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,275
I just wanna know
what it feels like. Once.

147
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,778
This isn't
your last chance for that.

148
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,614
What if it is?

149
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,078
Please kiss me?

150
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,989
- Bagels.
- You didn't sleep in.

151
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,326
Didn't sleep, didn't breathe.
I'm dying.

152
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,579
Pulmonary angiogram
of Andie's lungs was clean.

153
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,999
Arterial blood gases
and CT scan were also normal.

154
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,418
Her heart and lungs are fine.

155
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,713
Which gives us no explanation for
the diminished sat percentage.

156
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,923
Yeah, oddly enough,
sometimes normal is normal.

157
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,552
Sometimes we can't see
why normal isn't normal.

158
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,805
Get her symptoms on the board.
You're letting me touch the markers?

159
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,183
It's written out in my advanced
health care directive.

160
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,727
Should I be incapacitated in
any way, you run the board.

161
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,356
Then Foreman. Chase,
you're just not ready yet.

162
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,942
- What else?
- I know we sort of ruled out infection,

163
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,737
but if we forget the labs
for a minute,

164
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,698
there is one infection we didn't
test for because of her age.

165
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,700
- Neurosyphilis.
- There's no way.

166
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,746
If the infection dipped into
her cerebral cortex,

167
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,629
all peripheral functions
could be compromised.

168
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,040
No. She hasn't had sex.
She's nine.

169
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,419
Maybe it wasn't her idea. I mean,
she's been around a lot of adults.

170
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,381
All the hospital visits, the
counselors at the cancer camps.

171
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,715
You think she's been molested?

172
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,842
And hiding it pretty well if
there's any of that going on.

173
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,137
Yeah. All girls who've been
molested wanna talk about it.

174
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,224
- Break out the rape kit.
- She hasn't had sex.

175
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,520
- Why are you so sure?
- She told me she'd never kissed a boy.

176
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,857
- You read her diary, too?
- She asked me to kiss her.

177
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,901
I rest my case.

178
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,737
A regular 9-year-old girl does
not have sex on the brain,

179
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,198
not when a doctor's threading
a catheter through her vein.

180
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,826
But she's not a regular 9-year-old.
She's got terminal cancer.

181
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,286
Cancer doesn't
make you special.

182
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,290
- Molestation on the other hand...
- She wanted one kiss, before she dies.

183
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,253
If she's never kissed a boy, it's
a fair bet she's never had sex.

184
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,923
Tell that to all the hookers who
won't kiss me on the mouth.

185
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,717
Hey, here's a theory.
She has been molested,

186
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,847
seeks refuge in romantic fantasies
with older men with great hair,

187
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,142
and I think
you left out the punchline.

188
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:52,020
Victims of molestation learn to
work the angles, manipulate people.

189
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,068
You did it, didn't you?
You kissed her.

190
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,658
It wasn't sick. It was one
kiss for a dying girl.

191
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,245
One small... One small
kiss before she dies.

192
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,413
Thank you. Thanks.

193
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,708
This is exactly why
you can't touch my markers.

194
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,085
- Go see if she's had sex.
- Okay.

195
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,216
- No one's ever touched me.
- We just need to be sure.

196
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,679
I like your hair.

197
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:31,518
I used to have really curly hair. I
always wanted it to be like yours is.

198
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,023
Thank you.

199
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,068
All right, that's it.
You're fine.

200
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,855
- With a patient.
- She dying?

201
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,858
- No.
- Then she can wait.

202
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,738
Will you excuse me
just two minutes?

203
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,286
If only she'd been molested. Then
we'd have something to go on.

204
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,872
- No forced entry.
- One hallucination.

205
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,417
Maybe it was just bad pork,
maybe there's nothing...

206
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,002
She's not fine.

207
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,756
Her sat percentage
dropped another point.

208
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,300
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.

209
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,177
Lung wouldn't explain
the hallucination.

210
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,930
CT scans showed
both lungs were clean.

211
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,850
- So there's a tumor in her heart.
- Not a chance! Give me that.

212
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,813
- I loosened it.
- I opened it.

213
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,275
We've got an MRI and an echo of her heart.
There's nothing there.

214
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,654
Give me one other explanation
for low oxygen saturation.

215
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,740
I can't. There's only one condition
that simultaneously affects

216
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,702
- the heart and brain, but she...
- Perfect, let's go with that.

217
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,747
Tuberous sclerosis in a kid that
also has alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma?

218
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,751
Two different unrelated cancers at the
same time is a statistical no-no.

219
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,504
What's the rate of cancer
in the general population?

220
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,591
- One in 10,000?
- Don't. Don't start with the numbers.

221
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:29,761
Way I figure it, one in 10,000 of
them should have another cancer.

222
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,139
Little girl
won the lottery twice.

223
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,726
- It happens.
- So you're gonna cut her open?

224
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,937
Exploratory surgery.
I gotta find this thing.

225
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,482
You're just gonna grope around inside
an immunocompromised 9-year-old?

226
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,152
- She could die on the table.
- I know it's somewhere near the heart.

227
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,031
House... you've got to do
better than that.

228
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,301
Why are we here?

229
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,433
Better acoustics.
Now listen to this.

230
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,858
- It's a mitral heart valve.
- No. Get the wax out of your ears.

231
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,152
This is the patient's
aortic valve.

232
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,155
I downloaded the audio
of her echocardiogram.

233
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,574
- What are we trying to hear?
- Tumor.

234
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,661
They tend to keep quiet on account
of them not having any mouths.

235
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,455
But we could hear an abnormality
in the sound of the valve,

236
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,832
which would indicate
the presence of something.

237
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,295
The tumor, for example. If we could
tell the surgeon where to look,

238
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,674
this is no longer an exploratory
surgery, it's a precision strike.

239
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,677
- Her aortic valve sounds normal.
- Too bad.

240
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,514
Now listen to the dulcet tones
of Andie's tricuspid valve.

241
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,687
- Normal.
- And this is her mitral valve.

242
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,776
I don't hear anything weird.

243
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,322
You guys make me sad.
Listen again.

244
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,784
She's had one hallucination.
Why are we operating on her?

245
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,160
Why are we risking her life?

246
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,663
Because Wilson thinks it'd be
nice to give the girl a year

247
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,124
to say goodbye to her mommy.

248
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,752
Guess maybe she stutters or something.
Now shut up and listen.

249
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,254
Tricuspid.

250
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,925
Mitral.

251
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,513
- Again.
- Wait.

252
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,474
There.

253
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,686
There's an extra flap.

254
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,899
I'm gonna ask the surgeon to
look at the mitral valve first.

255
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,109
Chase, I want you there.

256
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,862
I don't like reading surgeon's
reports, they're boring.

257
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,656
I'm not really sure I should be
spending more time with her.

258
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,367
She'll be unconscious.
You'll be safe.

259
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,471
- I'll be there when you wake up.
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

260
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,688
Brave kid. She even gave
her mom a pep talk.

261
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,733
Mature, brave. She's a wonder.

262
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,360
What's your problem?

263
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,697
These cancer kids, you can't
put them all on a pedestal.

264
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,659
It's basic statistics. Some of them have
got to be whiny little fraidy-cats.

265
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,744
You're unbelievable.

266
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,870
If there's not one yellow-belly
in the whole group,

267
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,373
then being brave
doesn't have any meaning.

268
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,168
Andie handles an impossible
situation with grace.

269
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,377
That's not to be admired?

270
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,837
You see grace
because you wanna see grace.

271
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,283
You don't see grace because you
won't go anywhere near her.

272
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,675
Idolizing is
pathological with you people.

273
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,886
You see things to admire
where there's nothing.

274
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,554
Yeah, well, we're evil.

275
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,057
You find things to admire where
you shouldn't be sniffing at all.

276
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,560
- Like Debbie in Accounting.
- She's nice.

277
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,247
You shouldn't know that.
You're married.

278
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,232
So, the little kid dying of
cancer, I shouldn't like her?

279
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,692
If you're dying,
suddenly everybody loves you.

280
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,380
You have a cane, nobody even likes you.

281
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,239
I'm not terminal, merely pathetic.

282
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,158
You wouldn't believe the crap
people let me get away with.

283
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,590
They found a tumor. It's in her
lung, extending into her heart.

284
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,468
It wasn't visible on the MRI because
it's growing along the heart wall.

285
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,220
Now, because of the placement,

286
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,682
the surgeon has to temporarily
remove Andie's heart.

287
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,227
It's called an explant.
They cut out the tumor,

288
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,731
replace any damaged heart
muscle with bovine patches.

289
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,651
That's a patch made
from the cow's pericardium.

290
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,070
It's a sac
that encloses the heart.

291
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,697
What are her chances?

292
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,451
The problem is, there might
not be enough heart left

293
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,703
once they remove
all of the tumor.

294
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,541
And if the tumor's metastasized,
there's nothing we can do.

295
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,981
- Dr. Murphy.
- Just let me tie this off.

296
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,691
- Doctor!
- What?

297
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
She's got a bleed in her eye.

298
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,370
They got the tumor, repaired her
heart, but she bled out of her eye.

299
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,496
She didn't bleed out of her
eye from a heart tumor.

300
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,291
- True. The cardiac tumor was benign.
- That's impossible!

301
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,293
- Statistically...
- Oh, shut up.

302
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,964
If the tumor's benign, that means
it didn't cause her hallucinations.

303
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,842
- That's why I'm mentioning it.
- So, the tumor's a coincidence?

304
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,054
This is bad. You're starting
to state the obvious.

305
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,961
No, you said it would be
there and it was there.

306
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,766
It can't be a coincidence.

307
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,102
A 9-year-old
with terminal cancer

308
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,729
gets an unrelated benign tumor
growing in her heart.

309
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,273
- Why?
- It's benign? That's impossible.

310
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,601
- Talk to Wilson.
- The retinal bleed, also coincidence?

311
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,195
A clot could create pressure behind
the eye, cause the bleeding.

312
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,823
A clot could explain the eye, but
doesn't explain the hallucinations.

313
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,229
A clot could cause
mini seizures.

314
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,284
Great. Another thing that's not
causing the hallucinations.

315
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,411
Post-seizure psychosis.

316
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,288
The brain sort of corrects itself
after the seizure by hallucinating.

317
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,332
The clot could explain the
eye and the hallucinations,

318
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,500
but what about the tumor?

319
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,294
Tumors the size of an octopus wrapped
around a little girl's heart

320
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,504
are not just a coincidence.

321
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,350
She's not healthy,
she's never been healthy.

322
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,633
What's the theory here?
This girl's body's a lemon?

323
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,428
Faulty manufacturing,
everything's falling apart?

324
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,392
The tumor is Afghanistan,
the clot is Buffalo.

325
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,147
Does that need
more explanation? Okay.

326
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,233
The tumor is Al-Qaeda,
the big bad guy, the brains.

327
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,278
We went in, wiped it out, but it had
already sent out a splinter cell.

328
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:47,532
A small team of low-level terrorists
quietly living in some suburb of Buffalo,

329
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,742
waiting to kill us all.

330
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,912
Are you trying to say the tumor
threw a clot before we removed it?

331
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,373
It was an excellent metaphor.

332
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,794
Angio her brain before this clot
straps on an explosive vest.

333
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,067
Angio was clean.

334
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,696
- There's no clot?
- There is, we just can't find it.

335
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,449
You can't do exploratory
surgery on her brain.

336
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,202
Are you sure
you're not a neurologist?

337
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,414
Okay.

338
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,628
- She's gonna die.
- The clot's not gonna go away quietly.

339
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,380
It could blow at any time.

340
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,427
- Are you gonna let them know?
- I guess so.

341
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,765
- Can I come with?
- To tell Andie she's gonna die?

342
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,644
- That's very un-you.
- She's such a brave girl.

343
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,106
I wanna see how brave she is when
you tell her she's gonna die.

344
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,401
Go to hell.

345
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,891
What would you do if you were
told you were gonna die?

346
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,312
- I don't know, I'd be devastated.
- You'd cry like a baby.

347
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,314
Everybody would.

348
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,067
She's not doing anything.
She's a rock.

349
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,277
She's brave.

350
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,903
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?

351
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,310
She's gone through more than
most people do in a lifetime.

352
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,409
So what? Does that mean
she's ready to die?

353
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,370
What if her bravery
is a symptom?

354
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,373
The clot is causing hallucinations
and messing with her emotions.

355
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,750
You think her bravery
is chemically based?

356
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,303
It would tell us where
to look for the clot.

357
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:05,753
Where's the fear center?

358
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,841
The amygdala, near the hippocampus.
It's a big area and a busy one.

359
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,886
You blindly cut in there,
you'll kill her.

360
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,972
Only time you're gonna
see this clot is at autopsy.

361
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,728
Then let's do that.

362
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,901
Is it still illegal to perform
an autopsy on a living person?

363
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,279
- Are you high?
- If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted.

364
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,822
It's Wednesday.

365
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,491
I want to induce
a hypothermic cardiac arrest.

366
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,786
Once the patient's on bypass, we
siphon off two liters of blood,

367
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,538
perfuse the brain
while she's in an MRI.

368
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,304
You're actually
talking about killing her.

369
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,374
Just for a little while.
I'll bring her right back.

370
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,295
Oh, well, in that case, go ahead.
Why are we even talking?

371
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,506
If we do nothing, she's dead
in a day, maybe a week.

372
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,425
The kind that lasts.

373
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,096
We need FDA approval
for any surgical technique

374
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,263
- that's used for diagnostic purposes.
- Absolutely.

375
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,435
If we were doing anything invasive.
But there's nothing invasive...

376
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,160
You know, I'm not cutting into her head.
I'm just looking for a clot.

377
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,527
Not invasive?
You're killing her.

378
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,447
Don't split hairs.
If it works, she lives.

379
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:25,375
Make sure the mom understands that
this is a million-to-one shot.

380
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,296
I'll see that Wilson
passes that along.

381
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,465
The plan is

382
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,261
basically
to reboot your daughter.

383
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,765
Like a computer. We shut her down.
Then restart her.

384
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,352
How do you restart
a 9-year-old girl?

385
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,814
We cool her core body temperature
to 21 degree Celsius.

386
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,318
- Use blankets, ice.
- Sort of like hibernation?

387
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,947
Not quite. In hibernation, a bear's
heartbeat is just very slow.

388
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,950
In cardiac arrest,
there is no heartbeat.

389
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,410
So she's dead.

390
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,412
Temporarily, yes.

391
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:07,625
By cooling her, we limit the risk
of damage when we remove her blood.

392
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,421
- Not all of it, two to three liters.
- Half her blood?

393
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,426
Then we put it back. It's
called perfusing the circuit.

394
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,303
In this case, her brain.

395
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,180
And using an MRI,
we'd have a very brief window

396
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,058
to hopefully see
the outline of the clot.

397
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,148
If it's there, and it's
operable, we go get it.

398
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,651
And Andie walks out of here.

399
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:52,170
- Signed consent forms.
- Great, thanks.

400
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,797
You sound better.

401
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,551
I stacked a combo
of Mentholatum, a few Vicodin,

402
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,596
and something else
which I can't remember.

403
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,432
Should be able to ride the
high for a couple hours.

404
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,979
- What did Andie say?
- About what?

405
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,441
- About this?
- I didn't talk to her.

406
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,278
She doesn't need to know the
specifics of this procedure.

407
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,074
What if you're right about her?

408
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,328
What if she just is that brave?

409
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,456
That doesn't mean she's mature enough
to handle this kind of decision.

410
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:32,377
Either she understands, or she's not brave.
You can't have it both ways.

411
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,671
If she does understand,

412
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,675
then she deserves to know
what's going on.

413
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,791
- I'm Dr. House.
- I've seen you around.

414
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,419
Your mom tell you
what we're gonna try?

415
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,670
Sort of.

416
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,846
Tomorrow's test
could take 10 hours.

417
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:30,184
Given your present condition, you
might not even make it through.

418
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,648
- My mom's done a lot of research.
- How do you feel about it?

419
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,486
If we figured maturity came from
how much time you've got left

420
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,656
instead of how long you've been
here, this would be your call.

421
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,993
I don't have a choice, right?

422
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,455
I could give you one.

423
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,168
I wanna get better.

424
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,753
You've got cancer.

425
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,882
- If I fix this...
- I have a year.

426
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,885
A year of this.

427
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,389
A lot of people
wouldn't want that.

428
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,852
A lot of people
would just want it to be over.

429
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,690
Are you asking if I wanna die?

430
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,525
Nobody wants to die.

431
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,779
But you're going to.

432
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,036
The question is, how? How
much you're gonna suffer, and

433
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,456
how long.

434
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,709
I'm asking
if you want this to be over.

435
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,427
What would you tell my mom?

436
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,182
I would give her
10 excellent medical reasons

437
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,476
why we can't do this procedure.

438
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,438
I can't just leave her
'cause I'm tired.

439
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,403
But you can't stay for her,
either.

440
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,281
But she needs me here.

441
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,286
This is your life.

442
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,705
You can't do this just for her.

443
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,794
I love her.

444
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,723
Thank you for joining me
for tonight's dress rehearsal.

445
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,476
Playing the part of Andie
is Morty Randolph.

446
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,354
For his donation to science,
we give our thanks.

447
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,856
Once Andie is cooled
and goes off bypass,

448
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:44,610
we have 60 seconds to get two
liters of blood out of her body,

449
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,822
back into her for the pictures
to find the clot in her head.

450
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,825
If our star is bumped tomorrow,

451
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:56,080
while my MRI is on,
these red lights will go off.

452
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,124
Which will mean we have
no usable test results.

453
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,710
No test results,
it's goodbye Broadway.

454
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,504
You guys'll be wearing
bad cat suits in Des Moines.

455
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,911
We'll have neurosurgeons here
with a view of the monitors,

456
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,046
cardiac surgeon there in
case we need to open her up.

457
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,095
Anesthesiologists, one by
the cardiac bypass machine,

458
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,431
one by the cooling apparatus.

459
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,058
Girls in the chorus, if you're
over 5'10", stick with me.

460
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,853
Okay, give me 60 seconds
on the clock.

461
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,732
Show time.
A five, six, seven, eight!

462
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,860
Siphon off the blood
through the arterial line.

463
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,737
Whoosh.

464
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,489
Sound of blood draining.
More whoosh.

465
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:36,704
And we kill her.

466
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,955
Again.

467
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,710
Sorry, my hand slipped.
How hard can this be?

468
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,046
- It's a little busy down here.
- Again!

469
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
If we didn't have to lavage
her gastrointestinal...

470
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:52,678
Again!

471
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,557
We could bolt it to the table.

472
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,562
Gruesome and low-tech.
Kiss me, I love it.

473
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,523
A five, six, seven, eight!

474
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,028
Here you go, Doctor.

475
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,199
This'll make you sleep.

476
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,371
- A lot of people.
- Big musical number, kiddo.

477
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,832
A lot of people here
to make you look good.

478
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,709
You're kind of freaking me out.

479
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,836
He gets that sometimes.

480
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,006
Deep breath, honey.

481
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,806
Okay, go!

482
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,933
Intubate her.

483
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,561
Is that one okay?

484
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,576
Charge.

485
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,832
Here.

486
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,427
Body temperature
37 degrees Celsius.

487
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,178
Start the cooling.

488
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,267
You, go.

489
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,316
She's shivering.
200 milligrams of Vecuronium.

490
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,198
24 degrees Celsius.

491
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,875
We have afib.

492
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,757
What? She's dead,
that's the whole idea.

493
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:53,966
Go!

494
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,680
One liter out.

495
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,354
Two liters.

496
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,982
Okay, put the blood back in.
Reperfuse the circuit.

497
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,404
Anything, people,
anything at all.

498
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,323
Internal carotid artery in
cavernous sinus is fine.

499
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,742
- Ten seconds!
- Vestibulocochlear nerve intact.

500
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,411
- Middle meningeal artery clear.
- Five seconds!

501
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,871
Nothing.

502
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,710
We're over the limit. We've
got to start rewarming her

503
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,753
or there'll be
permanent damage.

504
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,379
Keep looking!

505
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,132
There!

506
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,219
- I didn't see anything.
- It was there.

507
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,386
You sure?

508
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,722
Four millimeters lateral to
the hippocampus, I saw it.

509
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,183
House, she's out of time,
she's gonna be a vegetable.

510
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,684
I saw it!

511
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,104
That's good enough for me.

512
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,956
They were able to restart her heart.
She's doing as well as could be hoped.

513
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,334
- So they found the clot?
- We think so.

514
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,587
The neurosurgeons are attempting
to remove it right now.

515
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,798
And when will we know
if there was any damage?

516
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,424
A few hours.

517
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,715
Four millimeters
lateral to the hippocampus.

518
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,885
That's where I am.
There's nothing there.

519
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,432
- You're not there yet, keep going.
- I'm there.

520
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,145
Are you sure you saw...
There it is.

521
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,356
I think I can get it.

522
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,296
Hi, Mom.

523
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,674
Oh, hi.

524
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,904
You're treating
your stuffy nose with cocaine.

525
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,952
Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine.

526
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,332
New delivery system. It's a
blood-brain barrier thing.

527
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,962
It's all about speed, isn't it? One
thing to another, never standing still.

528
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,510
- You're pretty good at that.
- I know my way around a razor blade.

529
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,888
It's time.

530
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,893
- Just a couple more rocks.
- Andie's going home.

531
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,771
Right.

532
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,899
The parade of the small
bald circus freaks.

533
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:44,947
- Sorry, I've got a thing.
- I read her surgeon's report.

534
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,866
The clot was nowhere near her amygdala.

535
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:52,287
Means her fear emotions
were working perfectly.

536
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,457
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

537
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,629
So her bravery
was not a symptom.

538
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,884
Yeah. I was wrong.

539
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:11,473
She genuinely is
a self-sacrificing saint,

540
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,726
whose life will bring her
nothing but pain.

541
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,562
Which she will
stoically withstand

542
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,231
just so that her mom doesn't
have to cry quite so soon.

543
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,483
I'm beside myself with joy.

544
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,492
- She enjoys life more than you do.
- Right.

545
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,704
She stole that kiss from Chase.
What have you done lately?

546
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,332
I'm pacing myself. Unlike her,
I have the luxury of time.

547
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,378
She could outlive you.

548
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,743
In case you wanna see
real butterflies.

549
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,732
I'm not gonna kiss you.
No matter what you say.

550
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,174
It's sunny outside.
You should go for a walk.

551
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,889
Not much for the long walks
in the park.

552
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,182
Now get.

553
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,606
0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds.

554
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,650
Four-stroke, four cylinder,
liquid cooled.

555
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,904
You gain a lot of torque
according to...

556
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,574
Right leg?

557
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,786
Your right leg?
You can still ride.

558
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,790
We got excellent financing right now.
It lists for ten-eight.

559
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,793
I'll let you steal it
out the door for ten-three.

560
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,212
No, thanks.

561
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,553
Could I test drive
one of these things?
