1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,293
The human heart is a giant muscle

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,713
squeezing or contracting
over 60 times each minute.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,423
That's 3,600...

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,677
At this point,
your blood is a deep purple

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,680
because it's just finished
dropping off oxygen

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,306
for all the parts of your body.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,394
Come on, follow me.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,189
Come on.

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,902
Ian.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,279
I have a question
and I need to go to the bathroom.

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,989
Which would you like to do first?

12
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:33,658
The question.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,077
- Okay.
- Where's the bathroom?

14
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,830
Who knows where the bathroom is?

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,956
I do.

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,624
Go with Ian to the bathroom.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,750
I don't have to go.

18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,378
We're not at school,
nobody goes anywhere by themselves.

19
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,296
- Why?
- In case you get lost.

20
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,006
Or in case somebody kidnaps us.

21
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,509
If somebody kidnaps Ian,
they'll kidnap me, too.

22
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,835
I want to stay with the class.

23
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,262
Michael, go with Ian...

24
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,556
Do you need help?

25
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,882
I need you to find a grown-up.

26
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,933
Is the baby coming?

27
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,228
- Who should I take with me?
- You're fine.

28
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,064
Go to the front desk
or find a security guard.

29
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,941
I really have to pee.

30
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,319
Oh, God.

31
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,823
Is the baby coming?
I don't know how to do this.

32
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,783
Are you okay, Ian?

33
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah. Sure.

34
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,789
I don't think you are.

35
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,335
You're bleeding.

36
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,548
Help!

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,216
Help!

38
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,942
- $20.
- Call.

39
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,277
You'll call anything.

40
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,571
My stack is bigger than your stack.

41
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,824
You in or out?

42
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,784
You know that relative to their size,

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,829
gorillas have smaller testicles
than humans.

44
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,916
Well, then you'd probably have an edge
over a gorilla, but not over me.

45
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,794
Reason is, primate testes' size

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,005
inversely corresponds to the fidelity
of our females.

47
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,301
You think there might be a better time
to annoy me about my wife?

48
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,788
- I'm talking about poker.
- Right.

49
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,972
Women are evil,
you're right to drive them away.

50
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,307
Call, fold or raise.
Story time can wait.

51
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,977
We're smaller and better than chimps,

52
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,563
bigger and worse than gorillas.

53
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,022
For all our rationality,

54
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,401
our supposed trust and fealty
to a higher power,

55
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,280
our ability to create a system of rules
and laws,

56
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,741
our baser drives are more powerful
than any of that.

57
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,870
We want to control our emotions,
but we can't.

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,123
If we're happy, things don't annoy us.

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,918
If, on the other hand,
we're sitting on crappy hole cards,

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,046
little tiny things annoy us
a whole lot more.

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,760
I raise.

62
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,367
So, are you gonna tell me
an annoying story every time I raise?

63
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,599
God, that would be annoying.

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,475
I call.

65
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,145
Dr. Cuddy, I got one of your patients
in the ER.

66
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,938
Ian Alston, six-years-old.

67
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,816
Oh, I know him. What's the problem?
I'm all in.

68
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,735
Bloody diarrhea. Hemodynamically
stable,

69
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,945
but he's been developing some
coordination problems.

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,031
It sounds like gastroenteritis
and dehydration.

71
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,283
Order fluids and I'll take it
on my service.

72
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,534
Bet's to you, House.

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,620
- They scan his head?
- No, why would they scan...

74
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
Don't play games. You gonna call?

75
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,624
- How's the heart rate?
- Stable.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,170
I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis.
I'm not going anywhere.

77
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,379
Put the order in,

78
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,008
and have someone tell Alan and Sarah
that I'll be up when I'm done.

79
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,260
You in or out?

80
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,557
I'm out.

81
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,355
Stone cold bluff.

82
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,233
You might want to spend a little more
time paying attention to your cards

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,111
and a little less time staring
at my breasts.

84
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,863
They don't match either.

85
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,949
I'm gonna take some air.

86
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,929
Follow my finger with your eyes.

87
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,396
How much longer will Dr. Cuddy be?

88
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,440
Well, given the number of Mojitos
she's knocking back at the party,

89
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,569
I'd say it's gonna be at least
three hours before she's even conscious.

90
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,363
Weren't you at the same party?

91
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,823
I don't drink.

92
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,120
I want you to reach out
and grab my cane.

93
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,710
What's wrong?

94
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,046
Your son's brain is losing control
of his muscles.

95
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,550
Dr. Cuddy's message said it was just
dehydration from diarrhea.

96
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,176
She's wrong.

97
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,680
Is he gonna be all right?

98
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,101
I don't know.

99
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,424
So, were you in one of those cages?

100
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,220
No. No, no, no, no.
No, those are for tourists.

101
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,848
You were in the water
with the great white?

102
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,935
Sure, it's no big deal. You just have to
keep an eye on them.

103
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,064
If they get too close,
punch them in the nose.

104
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,191
Send them on their way.

105
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,027
I had you going.

106
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,195
You are mean.

107
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,156
Hey. How's that anal fissure?

108
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,117
Did it heal yet?
Or is it still draining?

109
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,577
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,463
I didn't realize you'd come back
for seconds.

111
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,497
I figured that after that girl in the
stairwell you'd be done for the night.

112
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,541
He's joking.

113
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,460
No Adam's apple, small hands.

114
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,462
It's no surprises this time.

115
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,173
I'll see you later.

116
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,010
Got a case.

117
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,497
Well, you could've just said that.

118
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,917
You didn't have to screw with me.

119
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,053
If I didn't screw with you,

120
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,300
you'd spent the whole night thinking
you might get laid,

121
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,894
which means you'd be useless.
Better to extinguish all hope.

122
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,147
Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me
upstairs. Stat.

123
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,654
What's so urgent?

124
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,907
Two cases, same symptoms.

125
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,285
What do six-year-olds and 70-year-olds
have in common?

126
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,995
Their immune systems don't work as
well.

127
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,123
- Could be listeria.
- I already checked for that.

128
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,959
Leukemia has a higher prevalence
in both young and old.

129
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,461
- So does asthma.
- No, no, no.

130
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,004
They can both get diabetes.

131
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,297
No!

132
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,927
The nearly dead and the newly bred

133
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,222
have more in common with each other
than with people in the middle.

134
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,600
It's weird.
It's kind of a circle of life thing.

135
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,270
- This kid doesn't have kidney failure.
- He will.

136
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,148
Based on this file,
the kid just ate some bad food.

137
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,315
Was the old man...

138
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,403
They were nowhere near each other
in any of the four dimensions.

139
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,572
- This case is 12 years old.
- Yep.

140
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,657
And this case is Cuddy's.

141
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,033
She assigned it to me.

142
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,871
She agrees with you that this is
something more than gastroenteritis?

143
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,707
She wouldn't have assigned it to me
if she didn't, would she?

144
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,258
What were we talking about?

145
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,635
Two patients with two symptoms
in common.

146
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,096
And five symptoms not in common.

147
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,016
While you were all wearing your
"Frankie Says Relax" t-shirts,

148
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,185
I was treating a 73-year-old woman

149
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,395
who went through this progression
of symptoms.

150
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,522
The last of which was...

151
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,111
And in case any of you missed that class
in med school,

152
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,946
that one's untreatable.

153
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,489
Kid's got the first two.

154
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,202
It took Ester an hour and 20 minutes to
go from two to three.

155
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,495
And less than a day to make it
all the way to the rear exit.

156
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,333
This is all because a child
has some blood in his diarrhea?

157
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,459
He's got a tummy ache.

158
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,746
If there was any reason to think it was
anything worse,

159
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,046
Cuddy would be all over it.

160
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,547
Great. Do a colonoscopy.

161
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,753
On a six-year-old kid who probably has
nothing worse than some food poisoning?

162
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,969
And if you happen to find any purple
papules,

163
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,638
do me a favor and grab a slice.

164
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,765
I wanna check for Erdheim-Chester.

165
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:22,311
A disease that there have been, what,
maybe 200 reported cases of ever?

166
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,815
If Ester's family had let me do
an autopsy, there'd be 201.

167
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,247
See anything?

168
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,415
No, and I don't expect to.

169
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,585
House usually avoids cases.

170
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,005
If he's actually stealing a case
from Cuddy, there's gotta be a reason.

171
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,050
It's not the first time I've seen
this file.

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,427
About a month before Cameron was
hired,

173
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,554
some trucker came in here
with these symptoms.

174
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,431
House decided he was dying.

175
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,267
Two days and a spinal tap,

176
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,602
bone marrow extraction,
and three colonoscopies later,

177
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,938
we send the guy home
with a bunch of painkillers

178
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,816
and a diagnosis
of a bad cheese sandwich.

179
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,210
One of the guys who worked here
before me

180
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,863
said House tried to cure Ester
at least three other times.

181
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,410
You know how people see
the Virgin Mary in danishes and stuff?

182
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,330
Someone died 12 years ago
and House doesn't know why.

183
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,709
House sees that case now
in paint peeling,

184
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,212
in clouds, and now in this poor kid.

185
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,841
Erdheim-Chester is an abnormal growth of
some of the cells that fight infection.

186
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,260
Is that cancer?
Cos he seems okay now.

187
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,679
The other doctor kind of scared us
about that.

188
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,557
He shouldn't have. We're just testing.
It'll probably be negative.

189
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,558
I don't understand.

190
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,764
You don't think that's what it is but
you want to do this thing to him anyway?

191
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,147
- We need to be sure.
- Isn't there any other way?

192
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,149
It shouldn't take long.

193
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,026
All right.

194
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,112
Those ridges look a lot like purple
papules.

195
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,657
They're not purple. They're red.
Probably just blood blisters.

196
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,661
Give me the biopsy needle.

197
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,215
- How long is this gonna take?
- Forget it, Chase.

198
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,428
Your punching out the shark story's
good, but she's not waiting for you.

199
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,596
So?

200
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,563
We couldn't confirm the source of
the bleeding,

201
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,891
but we did biopsy some...

202
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,643
- Blood blisters.
- You mean papules.

203
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,645
Come on, Cameron. Who's right?

204
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,192
Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.

205
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,777
Let me see.

206
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,119
If it's not Erdheim-Chester...

207
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,873
It's exactly what we said before,
a garden-variety viral gastroenteritis.

208
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,208
Can we go back to the party?

209
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,251
Do a kidney biopsy.

210
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,962
Ester's shut down in exactly...

211
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,381
This kid is not Ester.

212
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,216
You screwed up. She died. I'm sorry.

213
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,468
But that does not mean this kid is dying
as well.

214
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,764
Jeez, you're testy when you don't get
any fuzz. Come on.

215
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,530
What'd the test say?

216
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,031
Colonoscopy was clean.

217
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,700
And the biopsy was negative for
Erdheim-Chester.

218
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,204
So Ian's going to be all right?
It was just some sort of virus.

219
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,789
What's that?

220
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,624
Urine.

221
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,459
Yeah, but it's brown.

222
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,504
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.

223
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,048
Still think it's not the same case?

224
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,984
So, what can cause
bloody diarrhea,

225
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,862
ataxia and kidney failure?

226
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,114
- I'll go do a biopsy.
- Forget it!

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,699
That battle's over.

228
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,076
His rising creatinine is his kidneys'
way of saying,

229
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,911
"Go on without me."

230
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,914
What explains everything?

231
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,919
E. Coli HO-157 causes bloody diarrhea

232
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
and leads to Hemolytic-uremic
Syndrome.

233
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,757
Toxins from the bacteria
cause his kidneys to shut down.

234
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,426
We should start him on plasmapheresis.

235
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,804
Clear, concise
and completely plausible.

236
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,099
And exactly what I did last time.
Didn't work.

237
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,477
- What else?
- Goodpasture's Syndrome.

238
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,896
Circulating antibodies cause kidney
failure and bleeding.

239
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,856
But not the purple papules.

240
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,691
If you throw in Ester's next symptom,

241
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,610
brain, makes me think
heavy metal toxicity.

242
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,154
His hematocrit would have to be low.
It's at 44,

243
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,697
and Ester's never dropped below...

244
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,741
- 42.
- You have the file memorized?

245
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,534
It's my lucky number.

246
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,744
What about lymphoma?

247
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,499
Causes kidney failure, GI bleed, and can
infiltrate the base of the brain.

248
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,001
You check Ester for that?

249
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,545
She never showed any signs of...

250
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,798
If he has lymphoma this far advanced,

251
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,051
we should be able to see it in his blood
and brain.

252
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,803
Chase, run a blood smear
and immunochemistries.

253
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,889
Foreman, get an MRI.

254
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,683
- I'll page Cuddy.
- No, you won't.

255
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,289
She thinks the kid has a stomachache.

256
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,395
Then she'll come right up here and do
one of two things.

257
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,315
If she agrees with me, I don't need her.
If she disagrees, I don't want her.

258
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,108
Can't handle people
disagreeing with you?

259
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,836
She might have a different take on this.

260
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,197
Subordinates can disagree with me
all they want. It's healthy.

261
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,950
People who can shut me down
on the other hand...

262
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,744
Forget Cuddy.
I'll have Wilson keep her busy.

263
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,880
Keep your answers short and discreet.
Is Cuddy still playing?

264
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,884
The chicken is still
in Piccadilly Square.

265
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,887
Brilliant. She'll never suspect that
Normandy is our target.

266
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,389
Is that House?

267
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,809
Tell him that the blinds just went to
20-40 and he's running out of chips.

268
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,186
- How's she doing?
- What's going on?

269
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,113
The way you took off,
something's obviously...

270
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,191
Love to chat but got a game to play.
How's she doing?

271
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,009
The patient is on life support.
We're about to pull the plug.

272
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,028
Are you talking about me?

273
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,613
What've you got?

274
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,700
Those sounds like high-dose cardio
meds.

275
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,577
Two hearts.

276
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,661
You got the flush?

277
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,162
Still waiting on the final labs.

278
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,081
Is she drinking her seltzer?

279
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,126
No, hydration is not a problem.

280
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,712
She's bluffing. Push her all in.

281
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,465
Call.

282
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,885
Two pair. Show me your hearts.

283
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
Seven of clubs.

284
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,186
Oh, dear. Sounds like I messed up.

285
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,814
You're gonna be stuck with her
for a while.

286
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,149
Talk to you soon.

287
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,360
Oh, yes!

288
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,044
Why are you taking a picture
of his head?

289
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,046
We're looking for lymphoma, but...

290
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,799
So, it's not Erdheim-something
and it's not his kidneys,

291
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,551
but his kidneys are failing.

292
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,844
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

293
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,304
Dr. House mentioned another case.

294
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,973
Is there another patient
with the same thing that Ian has?

295
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,309
- Not exactly.
- What does that mean?

296
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,561
Dr. House had a patient a while back

297
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,855
who exhibited the same symptoms
as your son.

298
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,067
- Then you know what's wrong?
- No.

299
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,610
So what do you know?

300
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,446
We know the likely course
the disease will take.

301
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,572
Which is?

302
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,574
She had multiple system failures
affecting...

303
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,159
What happened to her?

304
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,083
She died 24 hours after her admission.

305
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,343
Mr. or Mrs. Alston,
would you mind giving me a hand?

306
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,722
He's having trouble
sitting still.

307
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,933
It's impossible to get the detail
we need.

308
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,145
So I figured he might feel
more comfortable hearing your voices.

309
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,318
Ian, honey.

310
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,199
Just sit still. They'll be done
in a moment. We're here with you.

311
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,784
I'm scared.

312
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,037
It's okay, honey. It's...

313
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,083
It's only a big camera. It's gonna take
a picture of your head.

314
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,837
You love it when I take your picture
at home, don't you?

315
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,088
Yeah.

316
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,175
And you have to hold still for that,
too, right?

317
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,469
But this isn't like that.

318
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,183
I know it's scary, Ian,
but you can do it.

319
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,979
You're getting to be so grown-up.

320
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:51,194
So just hold perfectly still,
just for a little bit.

321
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,197
Mommy, are you crying?

322
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,994
No. No, honey, I'm just tired.

323
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,664
Okay. I'll try.

324
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,988
The base of his brain's been infiltrated
by a small mass. We think...

325
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,907
- Pituitary?
- Looks that way.

326
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,201
Explains the low blood pressure.

327
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,663
And pretty much confirms the lymphoma.

328
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,629
If we'd started Ester on prednisone...

329
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,173
Did anyone see the lymphoma?

330
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,967
No, we saw a mass.
The location is consistent with...

331
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,011
Didn't see any in the blood either.

332
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,223
White blood cells show no spindling
or abnormal nuclei.

333
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,768
Nothing on immunochemistries either.
It's not lymphoma.

334
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,552
House!

335
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,638
It's a train.

336
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,975
- We don't know what kind of train...
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

337
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,143
- I'm thirsty.
- It's closed.

338
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,649
It's not now.

339
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,325
We got one advantage.
We know where the tracks are going.

340
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,162
The fact that the end of the line
is death is an advantage?

341
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,623
The fact that we know is an advantage.

342
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,084
It means maybe we can get ahead of it.

343
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,128
Next station is the liver.

344
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,755
We got about 90 minutes
before it gets there.

345
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,175
Maybe we can cut down a tree
across the line just outside of town.

346
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,302
I'll do an ultrasound.

347
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,220
No, treatment will tell us more, faster.

348
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,181
How can we start treatment if we have
no idea what we're treating for?

349
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,183
Treat him for everything.

350
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,186
Give him acetylcysteine, and interferon,
and silymarin,

351
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,565
and whatever else you can think of
to protect the liver.

352
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,288
What's going on?

353
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,917
Oh, just catching up on some TV.
How're you doing?

354
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,253
Well, thanks to your last consult,
the patient has improved dramatically.

355
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,923
Tell House the patient is about
to kill the doctor.

356
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,549
- She says the patient...
- I heard.

357
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,469
- What've you got?
- Well, Cuddy just raised and...

358
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,720
- You're paired.
- What?

359
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,055
Nines.

360
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,516
How do you know?

361
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,186
Anything lower,
you wouldn't sound so excited.

362
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,812
Jacks or higher,

363
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,191
your voice sounds like Debbie from
accounting is sitting in your lap.

364
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,443
Ask Cuddy if she can beat
a pair of threes.

365
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,370
What's going on?
If you're gonna mess with me,

366
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,988
wouldn't it be more fun to do it
in person?

367
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,698
Yes, it would.

368
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,577
Can you beat a pair of threes?

369
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,745
What'd she do?

370
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,997
I left orders for PO fluids, Doctor.

371
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,375
Enough with the codes.
She obviously knows it's me.

372
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,627
She's drinking her seltzer.

373
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,462
Did she stop?

374
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,172
- Yes.
- Go all in.

375
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
- But...
- Just do it.

376
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,302
You couldn't care less about
this charity event.

377
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,388
You claim not to be messing with me.

378
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,875
You're either trying to keep me...

379
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,224
Shut up.

380
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,811
Look, last time I wanted the game
to go on. I still do.

381
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,146
It means that this time you get to win.

382
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,314
Hold on.

383
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,406
I fold.

384
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,375
House, are you sure you're okay?

385
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,160
Meds seem to be working.
Liver's holding its own.

386
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:51,828
Good.

387
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,372
- But the platelets are dropping.
- Even better.

388
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,957
Why? It means he's getting sicker.

389
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,418
It's new. New is good.

390
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,504
Because old ended in death.

391
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,217
I can't breathe.

392
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,553
Chase!

393
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,682
What's happening?

394
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,688
Ian, come on.

395
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,232
Honey, just relax.

396
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,527
Ian, breathe. Come on, honey. Please.

397
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,446
Please, honey.

398
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,334
We had to put him
on a ventilator.

399
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,503
He's back on Ester's path

400
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,756
and we managed to make the train skip
a few stations.

401
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,844
Which means that instead of 12 hours,
he's probably got less than two.

402
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,680
Which begs the question, why?
What did we do?

403
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,473
Acetylcysteine could mess
with the lungs.

404
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,309
Mess with them, not shut them down
in 20 minutes.

405
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,478
Interferon modulates the immune
system.

406
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,523
It could affect a cancer of the blood,
like one of the leukemias.

407
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,525
It doesn't speed them up.
It slows them down.

408
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,277
It slows down all 500 of them?

409
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,947
Anybody know where we can find
an oncologist at this hour?

410
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,830
What effects would interferon have
on leukemia?

411
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,791
Depends on what type. Could make
it better. Could make it worse.

412
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,793
A four-year fellowship to learn that.

413
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,545
Tell House if he wants
to play cards,

414
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,547
he can get his ass back down here
and play.

415
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,592
You hear that.
She wants me off the phone.

416
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,260
Means she's vulnerable.
Go all in.

417
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:16,139
But the party's over
in less than three hours.

418
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,600
It's over in less than two hours,

419
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,894
which means you either have

420
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,022
three of a kind or just threes.

421
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,691
I'm guessing threes.

422
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,861
I bet $500.

423
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,115
- Go all in.
- You obviously want to bust me.

424
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,241
Why would you...

425
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,409
Either you go all in,

426
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,954
or I tell everybody in the building
that you wear toenail polish.

427
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,582
I'm all in.

428
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,835
I'll call.

429
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,005
I'm betting you have a pair of threes,

430
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,799
but even if you have three,

431
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,720
it's not gonna beat trip nines.

432
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,557
Oh! Oh! Oh, no!

433
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,686
Oh, no! Oh! Oh, that's gotta hurt.

434
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,771
What happened?

435
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,537
I just killed two birds
with one straight.

436
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,732
Goodbye.

437
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,236
Fine, keep playing. But I need you
to recommend a good oncologist

438
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,488
because if I don't get one up here
in the next few minutes,

439
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,657
I got a dead six-year-old.

440
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,663
If you need help, ask.
These games are insane.

441
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,207
The games have a higher success rate.

442
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,626
Well, I don't see anything that looks
like leukemia.

443
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,045
- You do a bone marrow biopsy?
- No time.

444
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,339
Even if there is an occult blood cancer,

445
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,508
you wouldn't expect interferon
to make it worse.

446
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,134
Certainly not this fast.

447
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,845
- What would move this fast?
- Autoimmune diseases.

448
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,732
If his body's own defenses
are attacking him,

449
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,848
beefing them up is just gonna put
fuel on the fire.

450
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,977
Sarcoidosis could be in his brain and
lungs.

451
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,646
No. No enlarged hilar lymph nodes on his
chest x-ray.

452
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,774
The systemic nature suggests Juvenile
Rheumatoid Arthritis.

453
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,150
Or Kawasaki's Disease.

454
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,610
Can't be Kawasaki's.

455
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,654
That doesn't affect the elderly.

456
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,573
This is a kid's x-ray?

457
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,742
House had another patient.

458
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,579
Who may or may not have had
Kawasaki's.

459
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:04,872
This kid on the other hand,

460
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,543
he makes antibodies that are eating
the inside of his arteries,

461
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,629
choking off blood to his major organs,
one by one.

462
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,633
First the GI tract, then the kidneys,
then the brain, now the lungs.

463
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,264
Can anyone think of a reason why
Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly,

464
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,436
other than that it doesn't? Nice.

465
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,521
We can confirm with blood work.

466
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,481
We need an ANA, sed rate...

467
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,233
Labs will take two hours.

468
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,277
What was the old lady's sed rate?

469
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,778
Elevated, 98.

470
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,699
You can't use another patient's labs
to diagnosis Kawasaki's disease.

471
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,146
Is that like a dare or something?

472
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,660
You don't have time to be wrong.

473
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,788
Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he
lives,

474
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,874
Ian's coronary arteries.

475
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,882
This other patient,

476
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,803
the old lady, Ester?

477
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,017
Have you read Moby Dick?

478
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,435
It was a book?

479
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,104
- It was ten years ago.
- Twelve.

480
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,981
Obsession is dangerous.

481
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,776
Only if you're on a wooden ship,
and your obsession is a whale.

482
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,194
I think I'm in the clear.

483
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,570
You do realize it's a metaphor.

484
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,865
You realize the point of metaphors
is to scare people from doing things

485
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,368
by telling them that something much
scarier is gonna happen

486
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,787
than what will really happen.

487
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,165
God, I wish I had a metaphor
to explain that better.

488
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,127
Go back to the game. Don't worry,
I'm not gonna get eaten by witches.

489
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,802
Coronary arteries clear.
No aneurysms.

490
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,513
Flip the mode. Let's see the flow.

491
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,185
How did that other woman die?

492
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,772
She went into respiratory distress.

493
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,942
- Her heart and liver were already...
- No.

494
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,569
Did she suffer?

495
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,656
Was she in pain?

496
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,199
I don't know.

497
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,373
Laminar flow. No blood clots,
no ragged edges.

498
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,668
Damn. Shut it down.
We're just wasting time.

499
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,384
Look at the right atrium.

500
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,636
- That's not Kawasaki's.
- No.

501
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,264
It's small, but it's there.

502
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,808
Ester didn't have a mass in her heart.

503
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,269
Ian's younger.
He can take more of a pounding.

504
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,438
Ester died before the disease
reached her heart.

505
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,565
The disease made a mass
and made it fast.

506
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,275
- Could be bacteria.
- Muscle.

507
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,317
Connective tissue.

508
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,403
The kid can't take
any more theories.

509
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,449
Only thing we know is that
whatever that mass is,

510
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,948
that's what he's got.

511
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,410
We need a piece of it.
I'm doing a biopsy.

512
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,384
I'll shut the blinds.

513
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,760
No, let them watch.

514
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,513
I do my best work on the big stage.

515
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,809
Passing through the superior vena cava.

516
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,020
You're in the atrium. Pull back.

517
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,483
You've hit the wall of the heart.

518
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,276
These procedures would be
so much simpler

519
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,945
if you could do them on healthy people.

520
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,406
And out again.

521
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,702
- V-fib.
- Cardiac arrest.

522
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,412
Call a code.

523
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,748
Come on, paddles!

524
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,251
- Come on.
- Charge.

525
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,586
Clear!

526
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,756
Code blue, ISO room.

527
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,008
Code blue, ISO room.

528
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,011
And again.

529
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,266
- Nothing.
- Again.

530
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,950
You got a clock on this?

531
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,577
How much longer
you gonna keep doing this?

532
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,912
Clear.

533
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,709
Wait. I've got something.

534
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,297
He's back.

535
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,599
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what we came here to do.

536
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,935
- It almost killed him.
- I know. I was right here.

537
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,186
I need a Vacutainer.

538
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,314
His brain's been oxygen deprived
for over eight minutes.

539
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,041
There might be nothing left. He might...

540
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,486
Tell the parents.
Where the hell is that Vacutainer?

541
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,543
- So, what's he got?
- Brain damage.

542
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,962
Good chance.
I was talking about before that.

543
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,648
- You're not worried about...
- Things I can't do anything about?

544
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,425
- I try not to.
- Yeah.

545
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,802
Things just roll off you
like water off a duck.

546
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
Histiocytosis.

547
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,306
Very unlikely in a 73-year-old.

548
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,933
Whatever this is, it's very unlikely.

549
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,935
Come on. More ideas. Let's go, people.

550
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,480
Genetic disorders could cause
masses everywhere. Tuberous sclerosis.

551
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,566
If it's genetic,
he's had it all his life.

552
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,026
- Why now?
- I don't know.

553
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,611
It sure fits nice enough.

554
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,529
We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.

555
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,407
Or sarcoma. He could have multiple soft
tissue tumors.

556
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,533
Or sarcoidosis.

557
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,201
Multiple neurofibromatosis.

558
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,953
Chondrocytomas.

559
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,665
How's it going? You win?

560
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,835
I got called away by the angry parents
of a patient.

561
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,337
There are three of you here.

562
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,922
None of you had the sense to stop him,
to pick up a phone and call me.

563
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,424
I told them you'd signed off.

564
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,760
The parents are mad
because their kid is dying.

565
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,094
It's understandable.

566
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,180
But if he doesn't die,
they won't be mad anymore.

567
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,641
If he's brain damaged,
they might still be a little ticked.

568
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:57,808
Had to do it to save him.

569
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,519
You had to do it to diagnose Ester.

570
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,521
You may have killed a six-year-old

571
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,025
because you're obsessed with a woman
who's been dead for 12 years.

572
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,361
Sometimes you lose, House!
You're not God!

573
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,445
He's not dead yet.

574
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,731
No, but you're done with him.

575
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,990
It's my case now. Go home.
Go ride your motorcycle.

576
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,661
Go brood in a dark room.
Just don't go near Ian again.

577
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,046
So, anything else
or is it just these seven?

578
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,506
Drop it, House. She's right.

579
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,132
No, she's not!

580
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,386
- You know she's not.
- We should have called her.

581
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,845
I'm surprised you didn't.

582
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,681
You're gonna have to find a way
to let this go.

583
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,307
We can't go near Ian.

584
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,267
We don't need to go near him.

585
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,269
We have his tumor.

586
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,272
Well, Cuddy may be right
that we screwed up the protocol.

587
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,025
She may be right
about my screwed up obsession.

588
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,653
But I'm right about the medicine.

589
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,114
How many tests can we do with that?

590
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,658
Look, we cure the kid,
we solve everybody's problems.

591
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,118
How many?

592
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,455
Maybe two good pieces.

593
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,332
How many okay pieces?

594
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,168
Three would be pushing it.

595
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,131
Three tests, seven choices.

596
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,342
Okay, what's first?

597
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,970
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.

598
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,557
Yeah. So likely that Cuddy's gonna think
of that all on her own.

599
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,977
She's got the kid's whole body
to play with. Let her do that test.

600
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,478
What's next?

601
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,084
It's moving too fast to be spreading.

602
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,430
It has to be growing from something
that's already there.

603
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,401
Genetic disorder. Tuberous sclerosis.

604
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,529
Or it's his immune system.
Histiocytosis.

605
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,408
Well, there are more documented cases
of Histio amongst older people

606
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,161
than tuberous sclerosis.
Let's start with that.

607
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,752
Wing or drumstick?

608
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,630
Gonna need a little more than that.

609
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,007
A little more is more than a third.

610
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:57,219
If we have to repeat this test
because you didn't cut us enough...

611
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,686
I'm adding one micro liter
of the immunoperoxidase.

612
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,938
Make it two. I don't want House
biting off our heads

613
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,192
because we weren't sure
if it turned red or not.

614
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,741
That's definitely not red.

615
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,582
The problem could still be an abnormal
cell growth

616
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,792
but a different cell line.

617
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,085
Sarcoma?
Muscle cells are throughout his body.

618
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:31,462
It would explain the geography.

619
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,799
Genetic disorder is far more likely
in a six-year-old. Tuberous sclerosis.

620
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,801
Pretty unlikely to cause a GI bleed.

621
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,010
The time course fits.

622
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,638
Mr. Foreman, you agree with
both of them? Thanks for playing.

623
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,349
If we have enough tissue for two tests,
why not do both?

624
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,915
Then we don't have to think as hard.

625
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,976
Taking the pressure off the choice makes
us less likely to think critically.

626
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,898
Sarcoma is more likely to hit a six
and 70-year-old.

627
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,691
Tuberous sclerosis, it is.

628
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,151
You think sarcoma is less likely?

629
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,402
It's more likely.

630
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,864
The test for it, on the other hand,
is less reliable.

631
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,295
Test is negative. Well, that's
okay.

632
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,967
If the tumor cells hadn't matured, the
Ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

633
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,221
- What happens if we don't solve this?
- Kid dies.

634
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,598
I mean for the next 12 years.

635
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,018
Ki-67's negative.

636
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,816
And PCH antigen is negative.

637
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,872
Mighty Casey's down to his last strike.

638
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,957
Mighty Casey struck out.

639
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,543
Thanks a lot. I was gonna read that this
weekend.

640
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,046
Chondrocytoma. Connective tissue's been
in all the places we've been looking.

641
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,813
The kid is too sick for that.
We're better off testing for sarcoma.

642
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,594
We would've seen signs of that
when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

643
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,929
The tumor cells looked like muscle
under the microscope.

644
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,891
No, they didn't. They looked like fat.

645
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,019
I vote for neurofibromatosis.

646
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,981
- Why?
- Because the other choices suck worse.

647
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,116
Give me a minute.

648
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,689
You want me out of here?

649
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,985
You come up with anything?

650
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,238
No.

651
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,977
Hey. We can talk about it tomorrow.

652
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,069
I...

653
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,031
I won the poker tournament.

654
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,911
I totally played this guy, Berman,
from business affairs.

655
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,999
I got great cards. But I don't bet.
Just call, no raises.

656
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,376
Berman pairs his king on the flop.

657
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,920
I keep calling, the river turns,

658
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,756
I check. He can't stand it.

659
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,010
He goes all in. He's sure he's won.

660
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,888
I call, I flip them.

661
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,766
Pocket aces.

662
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,685
I nailed his ass.

663
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,030
The aces were hiding all along.

664
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,957
Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.

665
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,460
Erdheim-Chester?
That's not even on the list.

666
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,254
Because we already did it.
He tested negative.

667
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,548
- So did Ester.
- The disease lied.

668
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,676
Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you.
Diseases don't lie.

669
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,970
Fine, it didn't lie. It slow played us.

670
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,682
We biopsied the colon,
it hadn't reached the GI tract yet.

671
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,643
It's there now.
It's in his liver, his lungs.

672
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,687
You want it to be there.

673
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,856
Because then you didn't screw up
12 years ago.

674
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,818
We can't waste our one test
on the one disease we know it's not.

675
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,323
Run the test.

676
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,586
You sure about this?

677
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,506
Wait. Let me think about that.
Don't pressure me.

678
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,508
Just run the damn test.

679
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,471
Cells look like macrophages.

680
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,306
That's a good start.

681
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,731
Take your time, and say it loud.

682
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,201
CD 68 positive.

683
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,465
Start the treatment.

684
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,360
So, Ester can rest peaceful now, huh?

685
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,154
Yeah.

686
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,870
$40.

687
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,877
You got lucky.

688
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,296
You gonna call?

689
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,881
What I do

690
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,635
is not just based on the flip of a card.

691
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,346
You guessed. You got lucky.

692
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,472
It fit.

693
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,683
It could just as easily have been
sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

694
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,061
No, not just as easily.

695
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,855
Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible.

696
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,985
Are you gonna call?

697
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,989
You know, relative to its size,

698
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,743
the barnacle has the largest penis
of any animal.
