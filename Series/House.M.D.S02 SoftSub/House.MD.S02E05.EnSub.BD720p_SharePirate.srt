1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,923
I ought to have this framed.

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,884
My last bill from Princeton.

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,470
And I thought
we were celebrating

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,263
the fact
that I actually graduated.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,951
I always knew
you'd be able to graduate.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,269
What I didn't know was whether
I would be able to pay for it.

7
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:23,898
Your mom,
she'd be so proud of you.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,901
You always say that.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,029
I'm so proud of you.
Always was.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,451
Come on, Dad, you're gonna cry.

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,163
You wanna be embarrassed?
You got it!

12
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,466
Look, don't party
too hard tonight.

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,885
Your grandmother wants a picture
of you getting that sheepskin,

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,252
and it'd be nice if you didn't
look completely hung over.

15
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,639
Oh, no, don't worry,

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,391
I've had enough alcohol
in the past week

17
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,019
- to last me another four years.
- Good, I think.

18
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,906
Drink! Drink! Drink!

19
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,326
More! More!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

20
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,834
12:55!

21
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,671
Man!

22
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,050
- You are the man!
- Tell me something I don't know!

23
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,889
- Hey, that's not funny, man.
- What?

24
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,017
- Yeah, right, you shocked me.
- With what? I got nothing.

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,775
Well, hey, whoever's
doing that better cut it out!

26
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,283
What the hell's going on?

27
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,889
Maybe there's a short somewhere,
the floor's covered with beer.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,953
No way, no,
the outlets are GFI,

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,663
plus he's got
rubber-soled shoes on.

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,043
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody call 911!

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,464
Patient experiences
shock-like sensations

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,718
as well as headaches, nausea,
and drowsiness.

33
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,136
Shocks?

34
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,138
Excruciatingly painful shocks.

35
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,140
ER docs referred him
to a neurologist,

36
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,707
who referred him to five other
doctors in the last seven days.

37
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,354
Shocks could be Lhermitte's sign.
Early symptom of MS.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,648
No. MRI showed
no white matter lesions,

39
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,150
and the shocks aren't
accompanied by neck flexing.

40
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,319
- Good morning!
- It's almost noon.

41
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,613
Really? That must be
why I'm so hungry.

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,781
Who's up for lunch?

43
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,199
What's with the jacket?

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,870
It keeps me warm and cool.
How does it know?

45
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,317
We're discussing
your new patient.

46
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,214
Must be a boring discussion, seeing
as I haven't accepted a new patient.

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,419
You accepted him the moment
I loaned you 5 grand.

48
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,045
Oh, wait, wait.

49
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,715
When I said I'd do anything for the
money, obviously I didn't mean it.

50
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,551
You're gonna like this. The kid's
getting shocked every few minutes.

51
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,136
Why would you need $5,000?

52
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,139
Bad night at poker,
or great night with a hooker?

53
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,640
Thank you for saving me
the trouble

54
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,227
of deflecting that personal
question with a joke.

55
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,146
College student?

56
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,148
Nitrous oxide's fun at parties.

57
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,483
Caused the shocks, and drinking
till we puke every night

58
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,693
can cause everything else.

59
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,236
- Give him some B12.
- Been there, done that.

60
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,364
Also ruled out cancer,
MS, pyridoxine toxicity,

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,617
and all the popular
neuropathies.

62
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,162
- Cervical spondylosis.
- Doesn't explain the low white count.

63
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,622
He's black.

64
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm assuming he's not just really
dirty, but is of African descent,

65
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,209
which means he'd have
a lower white count.

66
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,545
- Not this low.
- He's a wrestler.

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,839
Probably uses diuretics
to cut weight.

68
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,965
That can also cause
low white count.

69
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,884
Not this low. "Not this low."

70
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,510
Behcet's. No skin lesions.

71
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,931
- Cervical herpes zoster, myelitis...
- No external outbreak.

72
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,103
Something's missing.
Find out what it is.

73
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,190
- I don't even know what that means.
- Well, figure it out.

74
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,234
Find it out, and then find me.
I'll be at lunch.

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,821
- No ideas?
- Lots of ideas.

76
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,282
Too many ideas,
that's why so many tests.

77
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
Have you used
any recreational drugs?

78
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,042
What? I'm gonna get
mad at you for getting stoned?

79
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,877
Not today, not here.

80
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,133
At Christmas, one of the
guys had some ecstasy,

81
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,139
I mean, I... It was...

82
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,933
Son of a bitch!

83
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,941
ANA is negative for lupus,
again.

84
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,695
House wants more information, not the
same information done over again.

85
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,862
"Find what's missing."

86
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,448
For all we know, the kid is dying
and he's giving us riddles?

87
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,993
Did a more detailed history,
went back three generations.

88
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,703
- And?
- His mom died in a car accident,

89
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,871
his mom's mom had arthritis,
and his mom's mom's dad

90
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,374
served in an all-black
tank battalion under Patton.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,085
Fascinating. If it's not a
tumor, it has to be MS.

92
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,128
Wilson already ruled out...

93
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,588
MRI can't rule out
MS 100% of the time.

94
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,842
- Doesn't explain the low white count.
- Alcoholism does.

95
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,387
On admission, his BAC was 2.0,
liver enzymes off the chart.

96
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,390
It was graduation weekend. He barely
drank in the weeks before that,

97
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,892
and he didn't drink at all
during his wrestling season.

98
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,936
- If you believe him.
- I did a tox screen...

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,902
It doesn't matter if she believes him
or not, it's already in the chart.

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,400
We're supposed to find out
what's missing.

101
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,702
Well, this... This is perfect.

102
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,121
Invite me to dinner
on Thursday night.

103
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,124
Come on, we haven't had
a nice meal together since...

104
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,836
Yesterday, when I loaned you
$5,000 to buy a new car.

105
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,254
My treat.

106
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,134
Two-wheeled vehicles
that travel 150 miles an hour

107
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,387
don't really go well with crippled,
irresponsible drug addicts.

108
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,349
Actually, two-wheeled vehicles that go
180 miles an hour do not go well

109
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,435
with healthy,
responsible architects

110
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,645
who don't know how to
separate braking and turning.

111
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:39,148
Good news is, it brings
the price right down.

112
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,942
- You're taking it back.
- Mom!

113
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,487
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

114
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,614
Forget dinner,
you're gonna kill yourself!

115
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,283
- Nice bike!
- Thank you.

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,496
See, that's how you do it.
Compliments, dinner.

117
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,498
What do you do with your cane?

118
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,458
If he buys me dinner,
he'll find out.

119
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,131
Evel Knievel
had the same setup.

120
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,966
And he broke every bone
in his body.

121
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,386
We went through all the imaging
studies and redid the blood cultures.

122
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,139
I don't want hand-me-downs,
I want brand-new stuff.

123
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,476
Well, there's nothing...
There's nothing missing!

124
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,270
Sorry, I didn't
catch that last part!

125
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,816
There's... There's...

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,156
There's nothing else we can do.

127
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,242
- Did you check the police report?
- On what?

128
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,827
On his mom's car accident.

129
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,162
That was 15 years ago. The
kid wasn't even in the car.

130
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,873
She veered off a straight,
dry road in broad daylight.

131
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,159
That doesn't seem odd to you?

132
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,727
She probably got distracted changing
radio stations or something.

133
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,077
That's what the police thought.

134
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,131
Of course, they didn't know
that she has a family member

135
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,134
who is frequently incapacitated
by shock-like sensations.

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,345
- A genetic component seems unlikely.
- But it's interesting.

137
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,848
Type II neurofibromatosis
could cause the shocks.

138
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,266
You knew this was missing?

139
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,144
I knew something was missing,
maybe this, maybe something else.

140
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,438
Get a DNA analysis of the
long arm of chromosome 22.

141
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,028
You'd rather have dinner with your wife?

142
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,740
Yes, I would.
If she were speaking to me.

143
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,536
Unlike her, I could make
it worth your while.

144
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,497
Fine.

145
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,749
Shall I drive?

146
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,169
No.

147
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,547
And I'm not letting you in my
car until I see your wallet.

148
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,594
NF2. It's an inherited disease.

149
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,139
It could cause abnormal growths
on the cranial nerves.

150
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,106
It would explain the shocks
and other symptoms.

151
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,059
DNA analysis will show
whether your son

152
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,936
has the specific
chromosome mutation

153
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,146
which causes the disease.

154
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,315
But if it's inherited, that means someone
else in our family would have it.

155
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,942
We think your wife
may have had it.

156
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,445
No. She never had
any sort of health problems.

157
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,031
No odd-looking freckles,
nodules in the iris?

158
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,241
Nothing. I mean, why would
you think she was sick?

159
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,494
We think it may have been
what caused her car accident.

160
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,247
Wait, what do you mean? My mom's
car was hit by a drunk driver.

161
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,125
That's not what
the police report indicated.

162
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,254
Well, you must have gotten
the wrong report.

163
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,715
No. They didn't.

164
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,225
When you started driving...

165
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,351
I...

166
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,938
You lied about how Mom died?

167
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,345
I figured if her death could
somehow mean something, it...

168
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,235
How does lying about it
mean something?

169
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,820
How could you use her
like that, Dad? Her death?

170
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,032
- I was just trying to protect you.
- What else isn't true?

171
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,243
She wasn't a teacher,
you just wanted me to read?

172
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,744
What's that smell?

173
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,372
I don't smell...

174
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,127
We're gonna need a nurse.

175
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,589
- What the hell?
- It's okay. We'll take care of it.

176
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,258
You didn't feel anything?

177
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,384
No.

178
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,055
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

179
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,890
But you didn't feel
any of this?

180
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,016
No.

181
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,364
Sphincter paralysis plus shocks
equals Miller Fisher Syndrome.

182
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,865
Not if you add
the stool sample,

183
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,242
which is negative
for C. Jejuni.

184
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,495
He lied to his son
about how his mom died?

185
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,247
He was just protecting him.

186
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,707
Manipulating him.

187
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,418
- That's what parents do.
- They lie to us because they love us.

188
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,752
Who's getting teary?

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,254
Mom's death is irrelevant.

190
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,089
DNA revealed no NF2 markers

191
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,632
or any other inherited disease.

192
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,343
Apparently, she really did
fall asleep at the wheel.

193
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,138
So, what exactly
are we talking about here?

194
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,100
A little peeker, or did the prairie
dog actually come out to play?

195
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,561
- Excuse me?
- Are we talking explosive?

196
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,856
The hemoccult
was negative for blood,

197
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,861
and I wouldn't say he actually exploded.
More like gushed?

198
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,071
Good, then we're
getting somewhere.

199
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,239
Yeah? Where?

200
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,241
I have no idea.

201
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,367
- Of course.
- Hello?

202
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,828
- Love the riddles.
- Hi, Mom.

203
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,902
Look, I have a business
dinner on Thursday night.

204
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,874
I can't get out of it.

205
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,377
I know, I really
wanted to see you, too.

206
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,257
Actually, can I call you back?
I'm in a meeting right now.

207
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,759
Okay, thanks.

208
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,720
Who was that?

209
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,263
Angelina Jolie.

210
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,558
I call her "Mom".
Who thinks that's sexy?

211
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,685
So, explosive or gushing...

212
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,021
She never calls here,
is everything okay?

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,274
Great, yeah.

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
My dad's taking her to Europe.

215
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,904
They got a nine-hour layover
in Newark on Thursday.

216
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,282
- If it's gastrointestinal...
- You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.

217
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,660
Are you kidding?
I can't lie to my mom.

218
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,162
Seriously, I can't.

219
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,497
Wilson's invited me to dinner.

220
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,166
It'd be rude to stand up a guy
who just loaned me 5 grand.

221
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,085
Transverse myelitis.

222
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,420
Could cause numbness,
anal sphincter dysfunction,

223
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,546
and the shocks.

224
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,299
Thank you for taking
no interest in my mother.

225
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,801
But that begs the question,

226
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,178
what caused
the transverse myelitis?

227
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,555
Well, we've ruled out
cancer and MS.

228
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,848
Leaves infection.

229
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,350
If there was infection,
there'd be a fever.

230
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,356
And his blood and CSF cultures
are all negative.

231
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,688
Maybe the infection's gone
but the memory remains.

232
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,274
Molecular mimicry.

233
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,776
Nice.

234
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,405
Okay, get an immunoglobulin
level and electrophoresis.

235
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,870
You're good, my friend.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

236
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,249
Do you really think
that was his mom on the phone?

237
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,168
Probably, don't know
why he'd lie about that.

238
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,253
Who cares?

239
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,880
You're not the least bit curious
what his parents are like?

240
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,367
I'm sure his mom's
a piece of work.

241
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,134
Only a mother
could do that much damage.

242
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,885
My bet's he was born
the way he is.

243
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,263
Probably tormented his parents,
not the other way around.

244
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,765
Yeah, he was either a fast
runner or one hell of a fighter.

245
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,809
Where are you going?

246
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,270
You guys can handle
the tests, right?

247
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,654
Is there something important that you
and House need to discuss over dinner?

248
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,573
Other than the skyrocketing

249
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,491
interest rates
on personal loans?

250
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,286
You know, this is the fourth
time I've loaned him money.

251
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,496
Not lunch money, money-money.

252
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,706
House's parents.

253
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,876
They have a layover
in Newark Thursday evening.

254
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
- I'm canceling dinner.
- No.

255
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,719
I thought maybe you could just
invite a few more people.

256
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,180
An infectious agent's
molecular structure

257
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,848
can resemble the spinal cord's.

258
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,894
And when the immune system
attacks the infection,

259
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,519
it ends up attacking
the spinal cord's as well.

260
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,271
So he has an infection?

261
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,355
They just said I don't.

262
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,275
Even after the infection is gone,
it goes right on attacking

263
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,526
because the spinal cord
is still there.

264
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,652
Is there a treatment?

265
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,946
Depends on what
the original infection was.

266
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,993
All right, you're done.

267
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,451
You need to lay flat after a
lumbar puncture for about an hour.

268
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,495
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

269
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,080
Hey, Dad, can you get me
a Coke, please?

270
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,208
Yeah, that usually helps.

271
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,127
You're done.

272
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,463
If you're nauseous...

273
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,257
No, I'm not nauseous.
I just want him out of here.

274
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,093
He's your dad.
He's gonna be around.

275
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,428
Yeah, I know.

276
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,389
It's not that, it's...

277
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,976
Are these people
completely incapable

278
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,269
of telling the truth
to each other?

279
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,855
He went to Jamaica
with his friends.

280
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,273
No wonder he lied.

281
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,442
Children aren't supposed
to have good times.

282
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,319
One of his friends
flew them down.

283
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,572
Carnell's dad has this thing about him
accepting stuff from rich friends.

284
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,742
He wants him to remember who
he is, where he came from.

285
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,993
Where have you been?

286
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,538
Making dinner plans. What's up?

287
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,831
The boys have uncovered
the shocking fact

288
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,918
that the patient has a crappy
relationship with his dad.

289
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,128
- They seem to actually care.
- Well, I don't.

290
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,655
There's only one reason any kid
with a plane flies to Jamaica.

291
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,092
It wasn't for marijuana. He
doesn't do anything but drink.

292
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,458
He said that to you
or his pops?

293
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,554
Tox screen was negative
for THC.

294
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,139
Spring break was over
a month ago.

295
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,391
Even pot would have
washed out by now.

296
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,934
Even if he'd smoked,

297
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,395
no way marijuana
causes transverse myelitis.

298
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,606
True. But the stuff
they put on it does.

299
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,816
Pesticides.

300
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,027
Well, why would he come clean about
the trip but lie about smoking pot?

301
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,713
He wouldn't necessarily have to
smoke to get pesticide poisoning.

302
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,657
He could have eaten fruit
that'd been sprayed,

303
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,826
or been exposed
through his skin on a hike.

304
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,453
Or he could have smoked it.
A lot of it.

305
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,248
Then lied about it because
that's what this family does.

306
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,584
Start him on IV pralidoxime.
Two grams per liter,

307
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,420
and then one gram every eight hours
until you see some improvement.

308
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,298
You have no evidence to support
a poisoning diagnosis.

309
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,010
Which is why it's gonna be so
cool when I turn out to be right.

310
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,930
Cameron.

311
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,100
Who are you making
dinner plans with?

312
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,310
No one.

313
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,816
You bastard.

314
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,404
You invited my parents
to dinner.

315
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,365
Cameron's got a big mouth.

316
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,533
Not as big as yours.

317
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,745
Hey! You used me
to avoid seeing your parents.

318
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,079
- Well, what do you care?
- I don't.

319
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,325
I just thought it might be
interesting to find out why.

320
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,876
- You could've just asked.
- You would've lied.

321
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,544
And you would've believed me.

322
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,379
Which would've kept us
both happy.

323
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,258
You want your money back?
Is that what this is about?

324
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,426
No!

325
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,305
Wait, have you got the money?

326
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,562
If you have the money, then
why did you need the loan?

327
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,148
I didn't. I just wanted to
see if you'd give it to me.

328
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,067
I've been borrowing
increasing amounts

329
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,527
ever since you lent me
$40 a year ago.

330
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,737
A little experiment,

331
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,781
to see where you draw the line.

332
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,952
You're trying
to objectively measure

333
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,205
how much
I value our friendship?

334
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,957
Hey, it's 5 grand. You've got
nothing to be ashamed of.

335
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,170
So, what do you say? One little
phone call, one big check?

336
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,590
Fine.

337
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,426
Thanks.

338
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,095
Now, be a grownup

339
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,263
and either tell Mommy and Daddy
you don't wanna see them,

340
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,058
or I'm picking you up
at 7:00 for dinner.

341
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,143
What do you mean?
You just said that...

342
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,645
I lied.

343
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,855
I've been lying to you
in increasing amounts

344
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,983
ever since I told you you looked
good unshaved a year ago.

345
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,652
It's a little experiment,
you know,

346
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,529
to see where you draw the line.

347
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,993
How's the patient?

348
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,620
Haven't been in yet, today.

349
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,123
As long as he hasn't gotten
any worse.

350
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,000
We're treating him
for pesticide poisoning

351
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,961
without any proof
of pesticides.

352
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,129
I'm gonna have a hell of a time

353
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,755
explaining that to our lawyer.

354
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,924
I told House not to...

355
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,595
Wow.

356
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,390
Lawyer's not gonna
believe this.

357
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,017
He's got his appetite back.

358
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,301
Whatever you did, it's working.

359
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,398
He's healthy,
so all is forgiven.

360
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,983
Now I'm feeling nauseous.

361
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,735
He is not healthy.

362
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,987
Nausea and diarrhea
were not his only symptoms.

363
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,447
The shocks have also decreased.

364
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,990
But not disappeared.

365
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,197
And he's out of the diaper,

366
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,492
which is good news
for everyone.

367
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,286
What about his low white count?

368
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,539
Well, the little buggers
need time to grow.

369
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,667
Don't worry, our wrestling
Rastafarian will be back on his feet

370
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,795
and sneaking around behind
Pop's back again in no time.

371
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,256
Yeah.

372
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,135
Check it again.

373
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,430
I'll be right there.

374
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,931
What happened?

375
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,183
Apparently I can save money

376
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,019
by switching to another
long-distance carrier.

377
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,312
Oh, I was right, wasn't I?

378
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,148
Oh, yeah, it's always
about you, isn't it?

379
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,030
He has the chills
and his temperature's spiking.

380
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,028
- It's nearly 106.
- What's that mean?

381
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,613
I mean, what's happening?

382
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,906
You want the truth,

383
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,032
or you want me to make
something up to protect you?

384
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,993
We think a drunk driver
broke into his room...

385
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,953
What's happening to my son?

386
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,750
The truth is I have no idea.

387
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,179
There's the fever
that Cameron was looking for.

388
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,515
We knew if it was myelitis,
there had to be an "-itis".

389
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,433
This must be the infection
that set it off.

390
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,645
Yeah. Except in this universe,
effect follows cause.

391
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,011
I've complained about it,
but...

392
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,145
Maybe the tests were wrong.

393
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,317
No. The tests were right. Yesterday
he had no fever, no infection.

394
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,736
So he just happened to catch
a bug while he was here?

395
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,862
That's all this is?

396
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,863
Yeah.

397
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,282
Because his white blood cell count
was down, he was vulnerable.

398
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,064
Because it's really down,
it might kill him.

399
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,744
That's all this is.

400
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,538
Is he still pooping his pants?

401
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,039
It just started again.

402
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,123
Again?

403
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,125
It stopped
when he was getting better.

404
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,213
When he was feeling better.
He was never getting better.

405
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,758
So, all we have to answer is,
what causes a 22-year-old kid

406
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,218
to become immunocompromised

407
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,011
with GI involvement and shocks?

408
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,930
Just stop and start
for no apparent reason.

409
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,014
And we need to find an answer

410
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,391
before this infection
kills him.

411
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,393
That would be the ideal.

412
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,812
You. Intravenous
broad spectrum antibiotics.

413
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,691
You get a cervical, thoracic, and
lumbar T2-weighted fast spin-echo MRI.

414
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,861
And you, track down all those
Richie Rich's who went to Jamaica,

415
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:59,322
see if any of them have got the
shocks, the trots or the hots.

416
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,200
The hots, it's the fever.

417
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,955
You guys gonna join us
for dinner Thursday?

418
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,623
Gotta do my laundry.

419
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,417
You're not curious?

420
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,712
I'm curious about crocs, but I don't
stick my head in their mouths.

421
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,464
I'm out, too.
Look, House is a freak!

422
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,259
There's no virus that causes
that, no DNA mutation.

423
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,011
You're gonna have
one dinner with two people.

424
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,097
Sixty minutes, most of it spent
chewing or talking about the weather.

425
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,682
Unless they say something like,

426
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,684
"Do you prefer the
chardonnay or the merlot?"

427
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,437
and, "Oh, we kept Greg locked
in a closet for 17 years".

428
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,105
You're not gonna
learn anything.

429
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,648
Okay.

430
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,692
We'd like to talk
to some of your friends,

431
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,402
see if they have
any similar symptoms.

432
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,988
The doctors in the ER
already asked me that.

433
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,031
We understand,

434
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,438
but they didn't have all the
information that we have now.

435
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,160
What kind of information?

436
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,999
Would you mind if I spoke with
Carnell alone for a minute?

437
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,043
Is this bad news?

438
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,128
No. It's just confidential.

439
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,506
Why is something
suddenly confidential?

440
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,550
I mean, if you know
something about my son,

441
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,010
I need to know what's going on.

442
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,512
I'm sorry, I have to insist.

443
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm his father,

444
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,620
and if I'm going to take care of
him, I need to know the truth.

445
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,851
Dad.

446
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,397
She wants to know
who I went to Jamaica with.

447
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,024
You've never been to Jamaica.

448
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,152
Taddy's dad flew a bunch of
us down over spring break.

449
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,200
You told me you had two papers
to write over the break.

450
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,037
'Cause I didn't want to come
home and work my ass off.

451
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,374
I wanted an actual break
during a break for once.

452
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,045
I shouldn't have lied to you.

453
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,464
No, what you should have done
is come home

454
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,008
instead of partying
with your rich friends.

455
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,302
I'm sorry, we need those names.

456
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,393
What do you want?

457
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,478
To apologize.

458
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,399
I realize that my attention to the
clinic has been somewhat lax of late,

459
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,651
and I wanna make amends.

460
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,028
How about tomorrow night?
I take the night shift.

461
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,738
The clinic's closed at night.

462
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,366
Yeah, but I'm sure there's
plenty of things to be done,

463
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,035
there's charts to be reviewed,
supplies inventoried...

464
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,037
Dinners avoided.

465
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,038
You're going, too?

466
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,748
I love their Cobb Salad.

467
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,110
Give me a reason
to get out of this,

468
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,878
and I'll tell you
who started the rumor

469
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,339
about you being a transsexual.

470
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,383
- There is no such rumor.
- There will be,

471
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,093
unless you get me
out of this dinner.

472
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,761
No one's making you
do this, House.

473
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,263
Just do what
everybody else does.

474
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,514
Lie to them.

475
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,765
You lie to your mother?

476
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,142
Only since I was 12!

477
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,436
My mom's a human polygraph.

478
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,938
My dad should be taking her
to Vegas, not the Louvre.

479
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,441
Trust me, your mom
would much rather think

480
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,318
you have a business meeting
than you hate her.

481
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,238
I don't hate her. I hate him.

482
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,618
We all had headaches,
nausea, vomiting.

483
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,185
You know,
we figured it was connected

484
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,039
to the massive amounts
of drinking.

485
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,041
What, you think
what happened to Carnell

486
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,042
has something
to do with the trip?

487
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,293
Don't know.

488
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,045
You haven't had
any unexplained pain

489
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,546
or strange feelings
since you got back?

490
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,632
No, except for a little
athlete's foot, I'm fine.

491
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,176
Can I see it?

492
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,428
- See what?
- Your feet.

493
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,057
There's a common parasite
in Jamaica

494
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,476
that can resemble foot fungus.

495
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,687
It's not really my feet.

496
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,899
You know,
I figured fungus is fungus.

497
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,985
It's my groin.

498
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,031
I'm going to need
to take a look at that.

499
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,032
Now?

500
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,158
Unless you wanna come down
to the hospital with me.

501
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,036
No, no, I can't. I mean,
I just started two days ago.

502
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,882
We're right in the middle
of a big merger...

503
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,372
Then drop your pants.

504
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,849
Reilly, I need the...
What the hell's going on here?

505
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,975
She's a doctor.

506
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,182
I'm a doctor, he has a rash,
and a friend of his is...

507
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,897
Right. Well, as soon as
she's done treating your rash,

508
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,273
I need the numbers
on D-Port Technology.

509
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,566
Yes, sir.

510
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,195
And, Doctor, why don't you
leave a card on your way out?

511
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,038
Except for one guy with a rash,

512
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,124
no one else on the trip
has any health issues.

513
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,250
What kind of rash?

514
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,001
I don't know,
I took some scrapings,

515
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,586
it doesn't
appear to be ringworm.

516
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,464
What did it look like,
aside from "not ringworm"?

517
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,049
Basically like diaper rash.

518
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,342
He's been working
around the clock,

519
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,508
he said he hasn't changed
his clothes in three days.

520
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,346
Kaposi's Sarcoma
can look like diaper rash.

521
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,056
Any discoloration
around the edges?

522
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,058
Get him in here.
We all wanna take a look.

523
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,185
Even if it is Kaposi's,
it's not related.

524
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,812
Our patient doesn't
have any skin symptoms

525
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,313
and we've already
ruled out cancer.

526
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,065
What are the odds
of two friends

527
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,111
who just returned from a
trip outside the country

528
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,611
coming down with unexplained
but unrelated illnesses?

529
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,098
- Get him in here.
- He won't come.

530
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,573
Just started a new job
after graduation,

531
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,060
they're working
on some big merger.

532
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,039
Tell him his friend's life
hangs in the balance.

533
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,870
That's what I told him
the first time.

534
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,539
Still wound up
driving into Manhattan.

535
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,916
Tell him his life
hangs in the balance.

536
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,668
Tell him the rash
is flesh-eating,

537
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,963
and the next course on the
menu is his frank and beans.

538
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,260
Where's Stacy?

539
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,971
Speaking at a conference in Baltimore.
Why, what do you need?

540
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,097
Can I subpoena a patient?

541
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,474
House wants me to lie to the
kid to get him in here.

542
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,602
Well, then you'll be the one
getting the subpoena.

543
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,062
Well, we do need him
to diagnose his friend.

544
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,355
Take the test to the kid.

545
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,066
There is no test, House
just wants to look at it.

546
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,693
Then take House to it.

547
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,403
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

548
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,032
Tell House his parents called.

549
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,742
Said they were coming in early.

550
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,161
He'll go anywhere
just to avoid them.

551
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,666
So, it's okay to lie to House
but not to a patient?

552
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,918
Yup.

553
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,591
- What's wrong?
- His stomach's getting a lot worse.

554
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,384
It's rigid!

555
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,891
He's bleeding into his abdomen!

556
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:00,975
What's going on?

557
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,978
- We need a surgeon and an OR, stat!
- On it.

558
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,106
Try to hang in there, Carnell.

559
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,952
The infection caused a perforation
in his sigmoid colon.

560
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,119
It's repairable.

561
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,121
But it means the antibiotics
aren't working.

562
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,624
Double the dose,
and add Tygacil to the list.

563
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,042
Soon as he's out of surgery.

564
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,418
Where's Richie Rich?

565
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,379
He said he can't leave work.

566
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,339
Yeah, you told me that
two hours ago.

567
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,924
I'm not gonna lie.

568
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,969
Why, 'cause it's wrong?
Or because you're a coward?

569
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,178
Tough choice.

570
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,098
You'd be wasting two hours
of the kid's time.

571
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,142
Is that deeply and unforgivably
morally wrong? No.

572
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,688
Because it's not a waste of his time.
Unless we're wrong.

573
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,275
Unless his condition's got
nothing to do with his friend's.

574
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,944
You're just afraid
of being wrong.

575
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,366
Your parents called.

576
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,704
- They had to catch an earlier...
- You don't have to lie to him.

577
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,830
Kid's on his way here.

578
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,956
He got off work?

579
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,085
Yeah, by vomiting blood.
Ambulance is 10 minutes out.

580
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,136
- You Taddy?
- Why?

581
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,055
Love the name.
If I ever had a dog.

582
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,307
Take off his pants.

583
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,433
Hey.

584
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,976
Don't talk to her,
listen to me.

585
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,978
He's vomited in excess
of three units of blood.

586
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,147
- He needs to be admitted before...
- If you wanted to be a doctor,

587
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,793
maybe you should have buckled down
a little more in high school.

588
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,140
- Bite me.
- What are you doing?

589
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,986
Exactly how close
were you and Carnell?

590
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:35,987
Not so close.

591
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,864
Spend a lot of time together
in Jamaica?

592
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,990
Share a room?

593
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,993
Wait, you don't think...
Look, we're not gay.

594
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,246
- I'm not saying you're gay.
- I'm saying you had sex.

595
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,290
Look, we're not gay.
We hardly even hung out.

596
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,083
Right. Guess you just
flew him down to Jamaica

597
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,209
'cause he won a contest.

598
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,753
No, he's in my frat.

599
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,171
All right,
between school and wrestling

600
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,965
and going home every break to
work in his father's junkyard,

601
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,217
Carnell didn't have any time
to hang out with anybody.

602
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,552
It's not fungus.

603
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,970
I already told you that.

604
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,681
There's no pustules,
it's not staph.

605
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,393
His dad's what?

606
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,937
His dad owns a scrap metal
salvage yard.

607
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,106
Carnell worked there
during breaks.

608
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,655
You lied.

609
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:20,990
What are you talking about?

610
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,242
Oh, yeah, of course,
in this family,

611
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,453
you probably
need more specifics.

612
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,748
You told us you owned a construction
company, not a salvage yard.

613
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,166
I know the way things work.

614
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,794
The better my job, the
better my son gets treated.

615
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,462
Right, that's why I'm mad,

616
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,964
we wasted all that
filet mignon on you.

617
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,801
Did your kid find anything unusual
the last time he worked for you?

618
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:40,927
No.

619
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:41,969
Braided wire?

620
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,555
Metal weights on each end, a
lead canister, maybe just a lid.

621
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,641
Probably used it as a doorstop
or a paperweight.

622
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,309
Why would he wanna...

623
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,146
Okay, here it comes.

624
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,981
I gave him
an early graduation gift,

625
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,401
an old plumb I found,
looks like a fishing weight.

626
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,987
Put it on a keychain, so he'd
always remember where he came from.

627
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,989
So he could lie about it later?

628
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,867
- Where's the keychain?
- I don't know, he never used it.

629
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,327
Just kept it
as a good luck charm.

630
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,038
- Kept it where?
- I don't know.

631
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,999
Why? Why does it matter?

632
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,248
Where are the kid's clothes?

633
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,129
In the bureau
back in his regular room.

634
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,714
- You two, get it to radiology.
- His clothes?

635
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,800
The bureau. Don't open it.

636
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,510
You, come with me.

637
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,892
Set it down there.

638
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,565
Now get out of here,
this thing's radioactive.

639
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,985
The chances of radiation
causing CNS symptoms?

640
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,074
Whoa.

641
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,582
Call the boys
in the lead pajamas.

642
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,638
The radiation measurements
weren't high enough

643
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,057
to cause central
nervous system damage.

644
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,624
It mightn't have caused
nerve damage,

645
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,769
but it definitely destroyed
his immune system.

646
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,229
And caused tumors.

647
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,733
We don't know that. None of
the MRis showed anything.

648
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:23,446
Do a PET scan.
Check his cervical spine.

649
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,991
It's not gonna be good news.

650
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,747
Mr. Hall, it's not good news.

651
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,708
The piece of metal
you gave Carnell

652
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,920
was from an industrial device
used to test wells.

653
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,631
People aren't supposed to just
dump radioactive material.

654
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,007
But they do.

655
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,640
So, what now?
I mean, what do you do?

656
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,767
Anyone who's had
contact with the source

657
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,062
will have to immediately get
treatment for radiation sickness.

658
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,105
Taddy carried it
on his lap on the flight.

659
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,982
So there is a treatment?

660
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,318
Transfusions.

661
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,446
And we try to get the fluids
and electrolytes balanced.

662
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,739
Carnell,

663
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,243
he's had much more exposure.

664
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,496
The equivalent of about
70,000 chest X rays.

665
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,917
His ability to create white blood
cells has been completely destroyed.

666
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,587
And that's why he can't
fight off this infection?

667
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,674
Yeah. He's gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

668
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,720
And we did another PET scan.

669
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,975
There's a cavernous angioma within
his spinal cord, it's a tumor.

670
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:38,020
That's what's been causing
the shocks and CNS symptoms.

671
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,607
He has a tumor
inside of his spinal cord?

672
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,487
The cord is made of strands

673
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,365
put together,
sort of like a kite string.

674
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:54,036
The surgeon should be able to pull the
strands apart and excise the tumor.

675
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,749
But surgery on someone who's as
hemopoetically compromised as your son

676
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,669
is extremely risky.

677
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,763
And,

678
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,643
if you don't do the surgery?
I mean...

679
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,771
The tumor could cause
his breathing to stop.

680
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,232
Possibly his heart as well.

681
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,739
There's no way
you could have known.

682
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,502
Now, you're gonna
have to come with us.

683
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,712
You need to start
treatment yourself.

684
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,505
No. No, no.

685
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,634
I can start my treatment later.

686
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,052
But he can't.

687
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,848
He needs to be in a sterile isolation
room to prevent further infections.

688
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,774
- Mom.
- We're early.

689
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,402
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, Greg, don't lie.

690
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,366
We came at a bad time,
didn't we?

691
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:17,370
Actually, yeah, I think
I have to take a rain check.

692
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,373
Oh, plans have been made.
Wilson made them.

693
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,458
I asked him to cancel.

694
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,752
I'm dealing with a kind of a
complicated case right now so...

695
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,587
Well, we'll just come back

696
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,756
when things aren't
so out of control.

697
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,175
My team is busy.

698
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,468
You don't wanna see us.

699
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,053
Mom, don't make me feel guilty.

700
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,055
No, no, of course not. Sorry.

701
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,266
I've got a patient who's probably
gonna die of radiation poisoning.

702
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,560
So that means you can't eat?

703
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,690
Come on, let's grab a
bite in the cafeteria.

704
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,566
I'll buy you a Reuben.

705
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
Well, I guess
I got time for a sandwich.

706
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,781
Good.

707
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,661
Yeah?

708
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,121
I just wanted to let you know

709
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,622
that Carnell's prepped
for surgery.

710
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,124
Thank you.

711
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:09,171
Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.
I work with your son.

712
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,840
Greg's told us all about you.

713
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:11,966
Really?

714
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,635
New, huh?

715
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,220
Nope, just gullible.

716
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm sorry, I was just
making fun of my son,

717
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,641
not of you.

718
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,852
We were just about to go
to get something to eat,

719
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,645
would you care to join us?

720
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,651
You don't have
a lot of time with your son.

721
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,778
Maybe another time.

722
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,040
- Do you like the Beatles?
- They're all right.

723
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,295
My 12-year-old just turned
me back on to them.

724
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,717
McCartney's gotta have
more money than God.

725
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,929
I think that's all of it.
Reverse him.

726
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,724
How's he doing?

727
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,353
- Looks pretty good down here.
- Do I rock, or what?

728
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,939
His pressure's dropping!

729
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,941
- Give him another two units.
- I did already!

730
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,818
His heart rate's falling.

731
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,779
He's hemorrhaging.

732
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,831
They're talking about Mom's
last trip to the dentist.

733
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,667
Grown children
talking to their parents,

734
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,377
nothing gets talked about.

735
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,797
Trust me,
you're not missing anything.

736
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,884
So, besides work,
what you been up to?

737
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,052
Not much.

738
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,679
You always say that,
"Not much".

739
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,681
It's always the answer.

740
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,309
Any new babes
you might wanna tell me about?

741
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,311
Leave him alone, John.

742
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,772
Got a new motorcycle.

743
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,400
Might have seen it out front,

744
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,694
it's orange
with a gigantic scrape.

745
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,030
Is it the one
in the handicapped parking?

746
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,240
Yeah.

747
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,700
Looks like crap,
but it drives great.

748
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,036
Well, you'll be careful, right?

749
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,664
Last I checked,
you still have two legs.

750
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,040
Actually, three.

751
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,960
You know what
your problem is, Greg?

752
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,461
Shifting gears?

753
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,130
You just don't know
how lucky you are.

754
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,678
Where's the head?

755
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,770
Well, good thing
we got that cleared up.

756
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,897
Oh, he was just trying to help.

757
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,566
I don't need help.

758
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,942
I know.

759
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,153
You're absolutely perfect
just the way you are.

760
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,755
Thank you.

761
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,806
So, how much longer do you
think he'll be in surgery?

762
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,641
It's hard to say.

763
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,655
You know, he just
started school when Ann died.

764
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,699
I was a mess.

765
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,623
Still adjusting to being a parent,
much less a single parent.

766
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:36,378
You know, I used to put cold
pancakes in his lunch box.

767
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,632
I mean, that was the only thing

768
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,592
I could make that he would eat.

769
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,429
- You did okay, he's a good kid.
- Yeah.

770
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,312
Hey. So, how is he?

771
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,316
Well, the surgeon
has removed the tumor

772
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,485
without damaging
the spinal cord.

773
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,154
But, the infection has caused

774
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,490
another intestinal perforation.

775
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:06,619
We stopped the bleeding,

776
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,744
but his white count
keeps falling.

777
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,037
Okay.

778
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,502
So what now? Another drug,
antibiotics, what?

779
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,631
I'm sorry.

780
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,968
The reality is,
no matter what we give him,

781
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,888
it's unlikely he's gonna be able
to fight off the infections.

782
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,415
Okay, okay.

783
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,091
The father and the friend are
responding well to treatment.

784
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,011
Things aren't looking
so good for Carnell.

785
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,680
Thank you,

786
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,974
for not eating.

787
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,687
It was none of my business.

788
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,983
They seem perfectly pleasant,
don't they?

789
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,693
They are.

790
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,780
He was a marine pilot.
She was a housewife.

791
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,201
Married 47 years,
they had one child.

792
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,663
Mom is just like everyone else,

793
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,249
she's nice enough,

794
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,335
no great sense of humor,
hates confrontation.

795
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,672
My dad's just like you.

796
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,342
Not the caring till
your eyes pop out part,

797
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,054
just the insane moral compass

798
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,556
that won't let you lie
to anybody about anything.

799
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,558
It's a great quality
for Boy Scouts

800
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,143
and police witnesses.

801
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,147
Crappy quality for a dad.

802
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,413
Hey.

803
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,665
How you doing?

804
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,709
I'm hanging in there.

805
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,675
I'm sorry
I lied to you about Mom.

806
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,805
I'm sorry I lied to you, too.

807
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,560
There was nothing good
that came out of her dying.

808
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,020
I'm not mad.

809
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,649
I know why you did it.

810
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,902
It worked.

811
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,697
I never drink and drive.

812
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,705
I'm scared, Dad.

813
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,670
Come on.

814
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,674
There's nothing
to be scared of.

815
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,176
You're gonna be just fine.

816
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,469
Don't play me.

817
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,140
I wanna know the truth.

818
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm telling you the truth.

819
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,689
You're gonna be fine, I swear.

820
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,322
I love you, Dad.

821
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,410
I love you, too.

822
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,928
Why does he hate
seeing his parents?

823
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,724
So his dad tells the truth,
he can't handle that?

824
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,351
He hates
being a disappointment.

825
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,854
He's a doctor, world famous.

826
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,274
How disappointed can they be?

827
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,068
You know what I figure is worse

828
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,446
than watching your son
become crippled?

829
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,532
Watching him be miserable.
