1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:07,924
So there I am, on my 25th birthday,
driving from Wheeling, West Virginia,

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,010
to Bensonhurst,
in a Dodge Dart with no radio

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,596
and a gunrunner
named Barrelhead,

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,767
who insisted we sing every Jimmy
Buffett song he could recall.

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,770
What could I say?
The man was heavily armed.

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:25,400
So, 500 renditions of Margaritaville
later... My first cover.

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,945
Eight thousand words on how Barrelhead and
his friends were transporting handguns

8
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,030
for sale to New York City.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,242
The day the magazine hit the stands,
the DA hit me with a subpoena.

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,828
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,956
And Greta had been managing
editor for three whole days.

12
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,667
So she invited me across the
street to the fancy bar

13
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,919
where they use real glasses.

14
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,089
And after about
the sixth vodka and tonic,

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,342
she said, "Fletch, I want you to
know the magazine is behind you."

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,136
Well, I was impressed.

17
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,096
I said, "You think you can get
the DA off my back?"

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,726
And she said, "No, but when you get out
of jail, you'll still have a job."

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,940
I'm 45. I've given up a lot. I've
given up the road, that life...

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,944
Thanks, Elizabeth. No regrets.
My lovely wife.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,864
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

22
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,199
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

23
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,828
One's rock and roll. The other's a source.
Greta Sims.

24
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,748
- Great memories, Greta.
- We'll miss you, Greta.

25
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,460
I only hope you can adjust to
the lack of stress in your...

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,881
Fletch? Fletch?

27
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,340
Fletcher?

28
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,885
Fletch?

29
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,721
Fletcher?

30
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,973
Honey? Sweetie? Are you okay?

31
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,021
Are you okay?

32
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,233
I flung the investment.

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,820
What did you say?

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,995
I flung the investment.

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,606
Why consign?

36
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,965
I'll call 911.

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,219
It's proficient.

38
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,349
Why disqualify the rush?
I'm tabled.

39
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,769
I'm tabled.

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,108
Need your advice.

41
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,987
What's the best diagnostics
department within 60 miles of here?

42
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,071
We are.

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,322
Yeah. "We" aren't here.

44
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,950
House is in Baltimore lying to Medicaid
about his billings.

45
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,827
So? I'm board certified.

46
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,412
You are not House.

47
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,623
Why'd you put me in charge
if you think I can't handle it?

48
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,918
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,046
What are the symptoms?

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,339
Oh, come on.

51
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,967
You're gonna diagnose him
without meeting him?

52
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,720
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

53
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,016
I need to know the symptoms to know
which hospital to recommend.

54
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:49,437
EMT's report: Patient struck his head
and is suffering from aphasia.

55
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,064
A neurological problem.

56
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,859
You know, I know a lot of
good people in that field,

57
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,111
seeing as I happen to be
a neurologist.

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,280
- You're pouting.
- Not at all.

59
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,657
Taylor's pretty good.

60
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,827
House was ready to hire him
till he got my resume.

61
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,329
It's Fletcher Stone.

62
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,498
Wrote 12 books,
exposed three administrations.

63
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,959
- Before he exposes us...
- I get it.

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,420
Famous patient needs
famous doctor.

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,464
- I'll call Taylor.
- Thank you.

66
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,966
Or maybe you should call him.

67
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,761
What if I say something stupid?

68
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,016
God. House is easier.

69
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,859
You taking any drugs?

70
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,779
I displaced my function.
Accolade.

71
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,031
He used to drink regularly,

72
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,909
but he's been clean and sober
for nearly a year.

73
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,703
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,

74
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,956
but your speech is impaired.

75
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,917
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he reaches for a word,

76
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,627
he finds something else.

77
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,879
I grapple average.

78
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,257
Tanzer glisten?

79
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,344
He doesn't know
that he's saying it wrong?

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,513
It all sounds right to him.

81
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,475
I want you to write your name
and draw a face.

82
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,743
It's called agraphia.
Loss of ability to write.

83
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,912
Most often, it's temporary.

84
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,831
How hard did he hit his head?

85
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,749
It was a pretty good crack.

86
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,002
It made a really ugly sound.

87
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,046
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Of golf.

88
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,299
Don't give me a sentence.
Just say "yes" or "no".

89
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,135
Do you understand me?

90
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,138
Yes.

91
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,434
Elizabeth. Fletch. Is he okay?

92
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,395
We don't know.
This is Fletch's editor.

93
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,105
Greta Sims.

94
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,066
I wanted to make sure
that the EMTs told you the right story.

95
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,609
How many stories are there?

96
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,113
He didn't trip. He just fell.
Out of the blue.

97
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,826
His foot jerked a little bit, first.
That's what made it look like a trip.

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,459
Don't say anything.

99
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,169
Don't attempt to defend
your billing practices.

100
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,087
Your billing practices
are indefensible.

101
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,338
We've been over this.

102
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,883
If I thought you were capable
of listening, I'd shut up.

103
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,010
That makes no sense at all.

104
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,769
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

105
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,904
Every case you have rates a
five on the complexity scale?

106
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,907
Dr. House has
a rather specialized practice.

107
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,076
Ah.

108
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,996
Okay.
Then let's go through these.

109
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,165
All of these?

110
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,251
If you have lunch
reservations, cancel them.

111
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,129
All right. Patient...

112
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,177
If he didn't trip, something made him fall.
Stroke, seizure?

113
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,138
Thirty people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,264
Who are we gonna believe?

115
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,470
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

116
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,520
It causes a contusion or a seizure.
That causes the aphasia.

117
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,729
We should get an EEG.

118
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,439
If it was a stroke,
could be a clotting issue.

119
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,409
Even if he fell, drug
use is far more likely.

120
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:24,276
I'm ordering a tox screen.

121
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,238
Chase. We're not done
with the differential.

122
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,115
You're not my boss.

123
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,160
I'm House's boss. House is your boss.
The math is pretty simple.

124
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,205
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring and firing?

125
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,581
This is not about that.

126
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,209
The only thing you've been asked
to do is supervise House,

127
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,128
in case
he does something insane.

128
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,588
Which might,
you know, save a life.

129
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
- Somebody's gotta be in charge.
- Why?

130
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,324
What, do you think we should all
just do whatever we wanna do?

131
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,804
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,015
I think it should be
a discussion among peers.

133
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,353
I think we're grown-up enough
to reach a consensus.

134
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,610
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

135
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,114
I look in vain for the words
"erectile dysfunction"

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,825
in the notes for Dolores Smith.

137
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,536
She had a heart condition.

138
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,329
And you
ran out of nitroglycerin?

139
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,500
She also had low blood pressure,
so nitro would be dangerous.

140
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,880
The little blue pills improve blood flow.
They're vasodilators.

141
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,965
That's why
you sometimes get headaches.

142
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,967
I think
Dr. House understands...

143
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,693
Of course I do. The woman has a
heart condition, she's on her own.

144
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,682
A man can't nail his office
assistant, it's national crisis time.

145
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,769
Are you seriously expecting us to foot the
bill for off-label use of medication?

146
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,771
Fine. I'll pay for it.

147
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,858
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

148
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,776
Put the money away.

149
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,029
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- No.

150
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,324
I could.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

151
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,159
My client's an idiot.

152
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,954
But is he wrong
about the pills?

153
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,374
Off-label use
is not sanctioned...

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,627
You're retiring in three weeks.

155
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,587
You've been doing this job
nearly 20 years.

156
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,299
Aren't you tired of administering
policy that you disagree with?

157
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,094
- I never said I disagree...
- What can they do to you?

158
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,348
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

159
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,391
Absolutely.

160
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,275
You do background
checks on Medicaid personnel?

161
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,154
I do what's necessary for my client.
Wow. New personal record.

162
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,156
Yeah.
Timing's good for me, too.

163
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,493
Got a reservation at a little
place in the Inner Harbor.

164
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,036
You booked us
dinner reservations?

165
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,914
Best Maryland crab in Maryland.

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,125
- Don't you have a plane to catch?
- Not for hours.

167
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,294
Your flight leaves at 7:00.

168
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,880
You did
a background check on me?

169
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,217
And mine doesn't leave till 9:00 p.m.
It looks like you'll be dining alone.

170
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,721
You checked on my flight so you could
be sure to be on a different one.

171
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,516
I thought we were
past the avoidance stage.

172
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,352
I didn't think
we'd be finished this soon.

173
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,981
Where's your crucifix?

174
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,484
I left it at the jeweler's
to be cleaned.

175
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,195
Right.

176
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,618
This will show us if there's a
problem with your carotid artery

177
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,370
that might cause a blood clot.

178
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,830
If it went to his brain,

179
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,874
it could explain the aphasia
and the falling down.

180
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,502
And you're giving him an EEG.
Is that for the same thing?

181
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,839
It's just a precaution. I think
the trauma caused some swelling

182
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,050
and we need to keep him stable until
the body can repair the damage.

183
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,177
And you think
they're both wrong?

184
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,389
We're just covering all the bases.
We're being safe.

185
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,227
His O2 stats are going down.

186
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,236
- Fluid in his lungs.
- I'll push 40 IV Lasix.

187
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,281
We need to intubate. He's
losing his respiratory drive.

188
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,665
Put him down. Put him down.

189
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,394
And then there were two.

190
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,023
Aphasia and fluid in the lungs.
Seizure can't cause both.

191
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,107
Neither can a stroke.

192
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,026
Unless he had
an abnormal heart rhythm.

193
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,405
And then there was one. Urine test
was positive for amphetamines.

194
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,491
Amphetamines don't cause
pulmonary edema.

195
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,576
They do if you smoke them.

196
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,662
Well, in one of his books, he talked
about giving up drugs and alcohol.

197
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,414
How it changed his life.

198
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,166
Everybody lies.

199
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,048
When he started wanting to
hear every minute of my day,

200
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,926
it should have been a clue
he was the jealous type.

201
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,970
But you know, in that first
stage of a relationship,

202
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,640
where it's like your body's
full of these chemicals that

203
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,976
make you think everything
they do is charming.

204
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,523
Excuse me.

205
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,358
Hello.

206
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,569
Hey, honey. How are the kids?
Do they miss me?

207
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,738
This may take a minute.

208
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,158
So, what's new
with Mr. Aphasia?

209
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,785
Cuddy called you?

210
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,246
Everybody covers their ass.

211
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:31,375
Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen.
It came back positive for amphetamines.

212
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,668
He did the dance of victory.

213
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,837
I'm betting
there's another shoe.

214
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,464
I thought
the kids didn't call you.

215
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,886
I know
the way you tell stories.

216
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,557
Foreman went to talk to Stone about his
drug test, found him running a temperature.

217
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:50,269
So it's not the drugs. They've
just got such a bad rep.

218
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,983
Honey, you shouldn't do that.

219
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,986
Okay, I gotta hang up. They're
probably trying to reach me.

220
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,432
- You don't have call waiting?
- I'm hanging up on you now.

221
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,323
It's $5 a month.

222
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,749
Drugs don't cause fever.

223
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,502
Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.

224
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,795
Start him on antibiotics.

225
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,132
It could be an autoimmune
disease. Lupus, Behcet's...

226
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,800
We could start him
on a high dose of steroids.

227
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,472
Except if he does have encephalitis,
steroids could weaken his immune system.

228
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,598
Foreman.

229
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,266
How high a fever?

230
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,853
Put me on speakerphone.
And why haven't you called me?

231
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,397
101. How'd you know?

232
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,734
What? You think you guys can have a
party as soon as the parents are gone,

233
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,360
and I won't hear about it?

234
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,239
Start with broad-spectrum antibiotics
for possible bacterial meningitis,

235
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,534
and an antiviral in case we luck
out and it's herpes encephalitis.

236
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,994
What if it's autoimmune?

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,664
Well, then we're screwed, which
is why we need more information.

238
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,917
Any genetic issue
with the family?

239
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,544
The man can't talk. His
medical records are sketchy.

240
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,588
And the wife's only known him
a couple of years.

241
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,716
- MRI show anything?
- The CTscan was negative.

242
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,303
"CT." That's like
short for "MRI", right?

243
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,722
Excellent. That's going to
save us a lot of time.

244
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,935
We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes.
Earliest Foreman could get the machine.

245
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,813
I teach you to lie and cheat and steal,
and as soon as my back is turned,

246
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,440
you wait in line?

247
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
Get an MRI and get
a better medical history.

248
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,570
The man can't talk!

249
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,656
Who cares? He's probably
gonna lie anyway.

250
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,492
My flight's a little late,
I'll be back in a few hours.

251
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,622
So, you're in charge of us
because you're in charge of him?

252
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,091
Any family history
of neurological problems?

253
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,217
No.

254
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,346
Have you been out of the country
in the last five years?

255
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,597
Yes.

256
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,474
Three years?

257
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,560
Yes.

258
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,311
Two years?

259
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,566
He stopped traveling for work two
years ago, after we got serious.

260
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,150
Any vacations?

261
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,528
His last one
was six months ago.

262
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,531
This golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

263
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,741
No way it was a golf resort.

264
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,162
Knowing Fletch, I assumed he was working
his way through every bar in the Keyes,

265
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,623
a last hurrah
before settling down.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,667
- Alcohol?
- No.

267
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,627
Amphetamines?

268
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,797
- No.
- You tested positive.

269
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,634
He doesn't use drugs.
I told you.

270
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,765
When we got engaged, we decided we
wanted a different kind of life.

271
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,687
And he dropped the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

272
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,981
That includes his health.

273
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,817
He asked me
not to tell Elizabeth.

274
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,784
So he's been lying to her
about his drug habit?

275
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,613
Well, yes and no.

276
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,367
BE, before Elizabeth,
he used drugs recreationally.

277
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,996
I wasn't crazy about it, but that
thrill-seeking behavior is what made him

278
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,748
the kind of journalist
that he was.

279
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,666
And now? AE?

280
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,963
Man's twisted himself into knots for her.
Completely cleaned up his act.

281
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,383
- But the drugs?
- They're medicinal. Sort of.

282
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,761
He was having trouble sleeping.

283
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,890
This new suburban lifestyle. Lack
of excitement was throwing him off.

284
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,100
So he started
with sleeping pills.

285
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,826
When they knocked him out, he needed
something to perk him back up

286
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,104
during the day.

287
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,856
Every day?

288
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,526
No slippery slope there.

289
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,492
Keep the stain!
Knife can't force.

290
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,954
We're not gonna tell
your wife. We're not cops.

291
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,721
There's a little edema, brain
swelling, and an area of scarring.

292
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,391
Is that
what's causing the aphasia?

293
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,017
Actually, that's what's odd.

294
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,812
The scarring's not in the area
of the brain normally associated

295
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,439
with conduction aphasia.
And it's old.

296
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,805
Happened before
he hit his head.

297
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,694
Maybe a small stroke or some
other underlying condition that

298
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,700
could be causing this.

299
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,739
Or it might have
nothing to do with it at all.

300
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,535
Have you ever had head trauma
before? An accident?

301
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,664
Ever had any numbness
on one side before? Dizziness?

302
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,624
What is the durable?

303
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,712
No.

304
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,137
All departing passengers
for Flight Number 870,

305
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,305
the plane will be delayed
by one half-hour.

306
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,766
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

307
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,924
I got you some coffee.

308
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,068
So, what do you
want to talk about?

309
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,664
The scarring on the MRI
could be anything.

310
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,251
MS, toxins, any one
of 100 demyelinating diseases.

311
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,296
If it's meningitis,
we have to ID the bug fast.

312
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,464
We need to do
a lumbar puncture.

313
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,634
I'm not doing an LP with this
edema. We could paralyze him.

314
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,593
What does House say?

315
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,638
"The person you are trying to reach is out
of the area or has turned off their phone."

316
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,473
So, what are your orders?

317
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,768
- We need more information.
- There is no more information.

318
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,978
We'll break into his place.

319
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,359
Have fun.

320
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,696
- How's the patient?
- Fine.

321
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,532
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

322
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,408
Oh, well, I'll join you, and
you can bring me up to speed.

323
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,869
Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.

324
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,085
When people give themselves
away, it's by little things.

325
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,257
That woman over there... She's
not sneering at her coffee.

326
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,843
She's recovering
from Bell's palsy.

327
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,347
And the cashier
at the coffee place...

328
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,851
She doesn't want anyone to
know, but she's dying of ALS.

329
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:50,272
There's a particular sort of twitchy,
stiff arm that's characteristic.

330
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,441
And then there's you.

331
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,361
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

332
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,572
I told you I left it at...

333
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:03,577
You keep jewelry cleaner under the sink
so you won't have to go a day without it.

334
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,872
True, you forgot it that
morning that our pipes burst,

335
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,877
but then you went back and waded
through the flood to retrieve it.

336
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,546
So, why no wading today?

337
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,383
Didn't you bring a book
to read, or something?

338
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,434
Nothing.

339
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,608
Caffeine pills
and amphetamines.

340
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,485
Same stuff
he told us he was taking.

341
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,613
And Topamax.

342
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,617
An anticonvulsant? But he said there
was no history of prior seizure.

343
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,452
It's not even
prescribed to him.

344
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,995
Still doesn't explain
his fever.

345
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,413
He's probably just using it
for weight loss.

346
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:53,084
Just gives us another lie.
He must really be devoted.

347
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,461
Should we check the home?

348
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,046
If he wanted to hide something
from his wife,

349
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,652
why wouldn't he
hide it in the office?

350
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,133
Or maybe
she's hiding something.

351
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,186
Nothing but aspirin
and flu meds in the bathroom.

352
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,608
Looks like this stuff's been
sitting here for weeks.

353
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,734
Home improvement.

354
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,780
He probably thought
he could take the project on,

355
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,614
then realized it was a little
more than he could handle.

356
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,325
You got a point to make, or did
you just feel like giving a long,

357
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,953
unnecessary explanation for
something medically irrelevant?

358
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,199
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

359
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,332
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

360
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,417
"I'm as good as House,
but I'm nicer."

361
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,543
I never said that.

362
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,922
I guess it's safe to be confident
when House is there to overrule you.

363
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,132
Now that it's all on you...

364
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,344
It's different. Yeah.

365
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,894
Either you left it behind
on purpose, or by mistake.

366
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,188
The only reason you'd
leave it behind intentionally

367
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,273
is if it no longer
meant anything to you.

368
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,150
But since it was
a gift from your mom,

369
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,610
that would mean
you had a fight with her.

370
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,113
But since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

371
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,447
Leave it alone, Greg.

372
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,994
Yeah, I'm good at that. So that
leaves forgetting it unintentionally.

373
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,658
But then we have to explain why you didn't
go back for it when you realized...

374
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,385
I didn't realize
until I got to the airport.

375
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,502
Nope. You were wearing makeup
when you got to the airport.

376
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,713
You can't put on makeup
without looking at yourself.

377
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,798
You can't look at yourself
without touching that thing.

378
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,050
Why does this matter to you?

379
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,637
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

380
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,100
Then you're gonna suffer.

381
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,491
I think it's his stomach.

382
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,201
I teal indigent.

383
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,287
Was it something you ate?

384
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,539
He keeps doing that.

385
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,458
I teal indigent.

386
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,084
- Are you hungry?
- No.

387
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,377
No, he's in pain.
Is it a sharp pain?

388
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,339
No. Teal indigent!

389
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,133
- Taste?
- Yes.

390
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,511
- A metallic taste?
- Yes!

391
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,598
I'll be right back.

392
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,563
I suppose it's also
possible that the clasp broke,

393
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,524
but then you'd be carrying the
thing around in your purse...

394
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,109
We had a fight.

395
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,570
We had a fight, and I was angry
and not thinking straight,

396
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,897
and I walked out without my
makeup and without my cross.

397
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,671
I stopped at the drugstore to buy
makeup, but I couldn't buy a cross,

398
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,370
because they don't have an
aisle for personal talismans!

399
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,335
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'll blow over.

400
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,545
- It was about nothing.
- Of course it was.

401
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,299
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

402
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,676
It's normal to blow up
over little things.

403
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,428
I don't mind fighting
over little things.

404
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,474
I didn't mind fighting over big things.
That I could understand.

405
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,434
We fight over nothing.

406
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,854
You know, a mailbox with a sign
that says, "Last pickup 5:00 p. m".

407
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,857
Does that mean last pickup
to go to the post office,

408
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,611
or last pickup to leave the post
office and be sent out of town?

409
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,947
You fought over mail delivery?

410
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,449
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

411
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,160
I told him he was right. He thought
I was being condescending.

412
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,578
You were.

413
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,498
He's pushing me
out of his life.

414
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,417
Maybe you're misinterpreting.

415
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,505
Did I misinterpret with you?

416
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,424
At least,
this time I recognize it.

417
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,302
That's the benefit of convincing
the only two men you've ever loved

418
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,513
they're better off without you.

419
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,101
Yeah, it's all your fault.

420
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,647
You know, "Stacy" in the original
Greek means "relationship killer."

421
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,494
I'm going to go wash my face,
so I look like a grownup again.

422
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,335
Hello.

423
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,424
It's for you.

424
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,427
- House.
- Do you know your phone's dead?

425
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,953
Do you ever
recharge your batteries?

426
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,013
They recharge?

427
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,723
I just keep buying new phones.

428
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,143
I thought you should know your
aphasia guy is tasting metal.

429
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,352
Where's his creatinine?

430
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,396
6.8. He's got kidney failure.

431
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,608
Cameron's got him on dialysis,
and he's stable for the moment.

432
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,943
Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

433
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:33,281
It's either meningitis or encephalitis.
Or maybe autoimmune.

434
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,407
That's perfect.

435
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,827
Seems like you really
narrowed it down over dinner.

436
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,330
Here's the plan.
We talk to House.

437
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,165
We've been trying.
He's not answering his cell.

438
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,958
It's obvious we have to do
the lumbar puncture.

439
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,085
There's no choice anymore.

440
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,923
You have to do it just right.

441
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,341
What are you talking about?

442
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,886
Either you've decided to do a lumbar
puncture, or you have to fire me

443
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,932
so that I can't fire all of you
as soon as I get back in charge.

444
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,516
Is Cuddy there, ranting?

445
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,435
If I'd known
you'd be out of contact...

446
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,354
- They can handle it.
- Right.

447
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,773
So far, only three
organ systems have failed.

448
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,733
Okay, they can't.
Doesn't matter.

449
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,485
The guy's not stable enough
to move.

450
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,487
So go rant in your own office.

451
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,697
Fine. Call me when you're done.

452
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,038
What do you mean
by doing the LP just right?

453
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,373
We're not gonna screw it up.

454
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,379
The odds are, this guy knows
something we don't.

455
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:29,504
He could know the answer to the meaning
of life, the man can't communicate!

456
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,005
Have you had any indication

457
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,216
that he's tried to communicate
something important?

458
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,509
No.

459
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,594
Well, that's because you guys
haven't scared him enough.

460
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,347
I'm sure you've been all, "Oh,
we'll take real good care of you".

461
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,848
Why should he say anything?

462
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:43,893
When you prep him,
tell him he's gonna die.

463
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,938
Crush all hope.
Don't let Cameron do it.

464
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,359
Cuddy, you got a problem
with any of that?

465
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,991
You're scheduled
for a lumbar puncture,

466
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,827
but you shouldn't count
on that having the answers.

467
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,621
If your husband
continues to decline...

468
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,082
You'll die.

469
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,548
If there's anything
you haven't told us...

470
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,484
How you holding up?

471
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,450
I know what you just heard
is scary as hell, but...

472
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:47,790
Couldn't tackle the bear.

473
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,751
They took my stain.

474
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,589
Attention, please.

475
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:59,218
Due to weather conditions, all flights
are grounded till further notice.

476
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,305
Cots are being provided
on the lower level.

477
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,390
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

478
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,100
I don't believe it.

479
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,355
You want me to run down and
reserve you a cot with a view?

480
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,482
Where's your knapsack?

481
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,233
Checked it through.

482
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,528
That's right. I forgot. It's
hard for you to carry and walk.

483
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,740
I booked a room at the airport hotel
when I saw how bad the weather was.

484
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,492
It's the last one available.

485
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,455
Your leg can't handle
a night on a cot.

486
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,415
Thanks.

487
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,459
I'm ready.

488
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,336
Right.

489
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,048
The hotel's upstairs.

490
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,552
Does Mark know about this?

491
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,637
Mark knows that
when things are bad,

492
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,723
I always like to have
an escape route planned.

493
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,418
I have to know
what's going on here.

494
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,340
Because when you have a fight with
Mark and you try to avoid me,

495
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,255
then I have to think that...

496
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,741
That I'm feeling vulnerable, and
I don't want to be around you,

497
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,305
because it might lead
to something.

498
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,390
Right.

499
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,476
But then, a hotel room...

500
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,729
Might also lead to something.

501
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,233
So, which is it?

502
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,489
Our relationship's
like an addiction.

503
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,576
It's like...

504
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,828
Really good drugs?

505
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,665
No, it's like Vindaloo curry.

506
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,126
Okay, sure.

507
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,212
Really, really hot Indian curry
they make with red chili peppers.

508
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,881
I know what it is.

509
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,425
Didn't think it was addictive.

510
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,470
You're abrasive and annoying,
and you come on way too strong.

511
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,347
Like Vindaloo curry.

512
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,183
And when you're crazy
about curry, that's fine.

513
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,351
But no matter
how much you love curry,

514
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,521
you have too much of it, it takes
the roof of your mouth off.

515
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,816
And then you never want to see curry
for a really, really long time.

516
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,652
But you wake up one day
and you think,

517
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,657
"God, I really miss curry."

518
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,759
You're a jerk.

519
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,260
I know.

520
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,747
If you hadn't just had
a fight with Mark...

521
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,500
For once in your life,
will you shut up?

522
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,810
House.

523
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,937
You're on speakerphone.

524
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,605
How did the LP go?

525
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,567
Give me the Reader's Digest
condensed version.

526
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:46,195
Preliminary results are
some kind of infection which

527
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,823
narrows it down...

528
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,908
From infinity, yeah.

529
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:55,788
At the rate his organs are deteriorating,
he's got maybe a day or two.

530
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,250
Okay. Well, call me back
when you have something.

531
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,711
He was trying
to tell us something.

532
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,011
What did he say?

533
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,681
You were wrong. It wasn't the fear.
He opened up to me when I...

534
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,642
A sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

535
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,646
Classic interrogation
technique. What did he say?

536
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,189
You knew that I'd...

537
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,693
Act the way you always do?
Yeah, I did. What did he say?

538
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,613
He couldn't tackle the bear.

539
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:32,074
Now all we need is the
English-Aphasic dictionary.

540
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,619
A fluent aphasic retrieves
words that are stored

541
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,145
somewhere close
to the one he wants.

542
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,081
They could be filed by sound
or by meanings.

543
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,916
So if he wants to say "table",

544
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,045
he could say "label"
or he could say "chair."

545
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,673
Or he could just say "jabberwocky".
There's no way to tell.

546
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,551
He also said,
"They took my stain."

547
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,929
Hold on.

548
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:01,270
I'm gonna take this phone downstairs,
so I don't disturb you. Is that okay?

549
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,605
Sure.

550
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,108
Keep him talking.
Write down everything he says.

551
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,696
Stacy.

552
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,911
That new makeup you bought,
do you mind if I borrow it?

553
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:26,629
What did you mean by "stain"?
Dirty, soiled...

554
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,631
No, no.

555
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,218
What about rhymes? Pain? Brain?

556
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,844
Thane?

557
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:39,308
He is dying from some kind of infection,
and you all are playing word games?

558
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,061
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

559
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,322
Let's start this again.

560
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,785
"Bear." Is it "bare"
as in "naked"?

561
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,243
Crimson Desire
shows up well on Sheetrock.

562
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,412
That's why I chose it.

563
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,596
You must have gotten one new
phrase out of him. Something.

564
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,641
We've been talking to him for hours.
Maybe he's just given up.

565
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,519
You sure you've told me everything
you found at his home and office?

566
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,229
No, we're hiding something.

567
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,814
Maybe it's not
a rhyme or a synonym.

568
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,274
What else is there?

569
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,610
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

570
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,445
Maybe House is wrong.

571
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,323
Hope that's not
the end of the thought.

572
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,659
He mentioned "stain" once before,
when Chase was giving him the MRI.

573
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,745
- Before we scared him.
- He did?

574
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,789
It's in your notes.

575
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,959
So he only talks during
MRis and lumbar punctures?

576
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,213
Your theory is he can only talk
with a needle in his back or...

577
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,757
When his wife's
not in the room.

578
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,138
The more devoted,
the more reason to lie.

579
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,016
That's cynical.

580
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,518
You disagree?

581
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,896
No, I'm just kvelling.
Our little girl is growing up.

582
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,192
Okay, what's the best way to rip a woman
from the side of her dying husband?

583
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,278
You woke me up
to lie to a patient's wife?

584
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,204
Tell her there's been a miscommunication
over their insurance coverage.

585
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,699
Not a big deal.

586
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,078
Tell me.
If it is your aim to sell me

587
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,707
the same crazy ideas that House does,
how are you an improvement on House?

588
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,709
I brought you a coffee.

589
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,300
Your flight's been
boarding for 20 minutes.

590
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,552
I'll take a later one.

591
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,845
Greg, they can't leave
without you.

592
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,138
You checked your knapsack.

593
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,641
- Are we in?
- Yeah.

594
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,853
Hi. I'm Gregory House.
I'm your attending physician.

595
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,814
Your wife's not there.
Start talking.

596
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,652
They took my stain.
I couldn't tackle the bear.

597
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,279
They took my stain.

598
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,657
Okay, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron.
Give him the list again.

599
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,617
Let us know when
something sounds right.

600
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:48,706
Dirty, soiled, pain, brain...

601
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,874
Yes.

602
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,084
Where does that get us?

603
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,461
We're already paying plenty of
attention to his brain.

604
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,255
We've got an MRI, got a CT...

605
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,592
Are we sure he wasn't reacting to "pain"?
He's been on painkillers.

606
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,093
Oh, come on, Chase.

607
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,263
Drugs didn't do this to him,
even if he is an addict.

608
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,348
I dissuade the tonal category.

609
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,852
Oh, please, Mr. Sleeping
Pills, Amphetamines,

610
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,688
Bring Me Up, Bring Me Down...

611
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,233
Will passenger Gregory House
please report to Gate 7.

612
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,485
Gregory House to Gate 7.

613
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,866
Ever hear this one?

614
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,661
You build a house. Each wall
has a southern exposure.

615
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,832
A big bear comes wandering by.
What color is the bear?

616
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,003
White. It's a polar bear. You built
your house in the North Pole.

617
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:40,382
Polar. Whatever your name is.
Patient! Are you bipolar?

618
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,470
What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?

619
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,679
Yes.

620
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,213
Topamax isn't just
off-label for weight loss.

621
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,560
It's off-label for
mood disorders.

622
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,688
Plenty of bipolars are manic in
the daytime, depressive at night.

623
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,442
He's been medicating for years with
alcohol, sleeping through the bad hours.

624
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,889
It explains
the danger journalism.

625
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,863
Explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.

626
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,782
Okay, technically, it's
the kitchen cabinets.

627
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,742
He starts a project,
then he stops.

628
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,120
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

629
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,748
And it doesn't shut down your kidneys.
But what it does do...

630
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:13,999
Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?

631
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,709
I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.

632
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,919
Now, please.

633
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,420
House? What is it?

634
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,673
I'm a doctor.
This is an emergency call.

635
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,549
You have to come with me, sir.

636
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,927
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Do you think you're gonna take me on?

637
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,679
I kick and I bite.

638
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,766
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

639
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,108
House?

640
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,234
Are you still there?

641
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,153
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

642
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,156
You seek excitement,
you make up stories.

643
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,659
I dime value tale lever!

644
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,955
Fine, maybe your stories are legit.
But people would start to wonder.

645
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,834
Annoyed politicians, entire
governments would be on your ass.

646
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,887
So you couldn't tell
anybody you were bipolar.

647
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,838
Which was fine.

648
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,799
Until you fell in love.

649
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,886
And you wanted that life.

650
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,307
And you hear
that there's a surgical cure.

651
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,645
You can give the woman you
love the life she wants.

652
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,440
All you have to do is change.

653
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,738
Bilateral cingulotomy.

654
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,950
An experimental surgery that some
people claim helps mood disorders.

655
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,828
And if it's done by Gamma Knife,
there's no trace of cutting.

656
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,830
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

657
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,916
Which explained nothing, because
it wasn't even in the right area.

658
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,669
It's not the surgery,
it's the secrecy.

659
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,297
What causes recurring fever,

660
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,465
neurological problems,

661
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,509
lethargy that you fight with
caffeine pills and amphetamines?

662
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,678
It wasn't
your secret psych disorder.

663
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,930
It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.

664
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,433
It was your secret trip
for your secret surgery

665
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,685
in Caracas or Buenos Aires.

666
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,980
Which, by the way, didn't work, given
the state of your kitchen cabinets.

667
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,399
House. Shut up.

668
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,278
What's going on?

669
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,367
Is he right?

670
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,624
Your doctors know you
better than I do.

671
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,252
That man on the speakerphone,
he never even met you,

672
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,838
and he knows you
better than I do.

673
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,968
You love me?

674
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,475
Yes. Yes.

675
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,685
You just don't trust me.

676
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,234
Get some blood on a slide.

677
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,277
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

678
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,487
Yeah.

679
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,711
Cerebral malaria.

680
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,050
I'll get him started
on intravenous quinidine.

681
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,013
If a human being had actually looked
at his blood anywhere along the way,

682
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,392
instead of just running tests
through the computer,

683
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,812
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

684
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,398
Price of the electronic age.

685
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,622
Fletch.

686
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,333
She'll be back.

687
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,216
Give her time to miss you.

688
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,935
Final boarding call
for Flight Number 7...

689
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,021
I'm counting on you
to get me off the no-fly list.

690
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,731
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

691
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,859
- Physically, his chances are good.
- Physically?

692
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,737
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

693
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,948
Maybe they'll get a happy ending just
because they both want it so much.

694
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,992
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

695
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,746
He loved her enough to convince
himself he could change.

696
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,416
But he couldn't, could he?

697
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,339
Thank you.

698
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,426
You know what Woody Allen said
about relationships.

699
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,845
Irrational and crazy, but we
go through it all because...

700
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,555
We need the curry.
