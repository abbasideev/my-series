1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,836
Hi, kids.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,088
Mommy, look what I made.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,964
Oh, wow.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,969
It's a farmer and a cow
and some horses.

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,471
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,889
It's for Ted's office.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,892
Oh, he's gonna love it. And it'd
be nice if you called him Dad.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
Give me a big hug.

9
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:24,774
Secret is the Haas avocados. I can
e-mail you the recipe if you want.

10
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,532
It's the third time they've
changed plans since Friday.

11
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,285
These idiots think you can just add a
14th floor and the mayor won't notice.

12
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,372
And I thought turning the garage
into a nursery was complicated.

13
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,873
Any luck on your end yet?

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,000
Not for lack of trying.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,169
Ted.

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,465
Come on. Come on, Margo!

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,051
I have to go tell a client
he's an idiot.

18
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,469
Go kick some ass.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:58,266
I have to take Stella to karate by 3:00
and a birthday party at Julia's after.

20
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,940
You okay?

21
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,028
Yeah. I'll be back.
Just make sure she's dressed.

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,613
Honey! Honey!

23
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,199
He's actually on time.

24
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,117
He's six minutes early.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,870
- Something's happened.
- I'm on it.

26
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,001
Good morning, Jimmy.

27
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,462
Anybody die while I was gone?

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,507
Did you iron your shirt?

29
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,718
I thought about shaving.
Couldn't find a razor.

30
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,554
What the hell happened
in Baltimore?

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,139
Sorry, chief.
Never kiss and tell.

32
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,391
I think you just did.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,144
There's no such thing
as "just a kiss".

34
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,148
Did you iron your shirt?
Everybody's flash today.

35
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,693
Has she left Mark?
Is she going to?

36
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,571
I think I can hear
cancer kids calling.

37
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,948
Are you planning on asking her
to leave Mark?

38
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,284
Not sure.
Cameron keeps my calendar.

39
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,161
Hey. This is a big deal.
This is an affair.

40
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,164
Have you even talked to Stacy
about what the hell this means?

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,167
Didn't have a lot of time for talking,
if you know what I mean.

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,170
Great. Breaking up a marriage.
Fertile ground for high comedy.

43
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,381
We need to talk about this.

44
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:40,094
Gosh, wish I could. How did
the HIV test go? You study up?

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,471
I rescheduled for this afternoon.
We have a new patient.

46
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,974
Thirty-four-year-old female,
movement disorder.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,226
Movement disorder? Fascinating.

48
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,607
This isn't just gonna go away.

49
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,650
No. But maybe you will.

50
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,362
Probably suffered head trauma
in the car accident.

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,947
Trauma leads to the dyskinesia.

52
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,115
According to her husband,

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
the flailing started
before she got anywhere near that car.

54
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,161
What does
the flailing look like?

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,914
Her arms spasm uncontrollably
and there's a mild facial twitch.

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,373
Demonstration?

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,209
You wanna know what it looks
like, go see the patient.

58
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,172
Oh, snarky. Was he like this
the whole time I was gone?

59
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,425
The patient's been on a fertility
regimen for the last 13 months.

60
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,469
Excess estrogen
in the system could explain...

61
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,220
Who finished
the animal crackers?

62
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,707
Sudden movement disorder could
be a symptom of Huntington's.

63
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:30,353
If you finish something, don't just
put back the empty box, throw it out.

64
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,589
Huntington's
takes a day to confirm.

65
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,734
We should put her on tamoxifen in
case it is the fertility meds,

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,069
counteract the estrogen.

67
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,238
That's a great idea
if you wanna kill her baby.

68
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,618
Movement disorder can present
in the first trimester.

69
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,827
She's not pregnant.

70
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,748
Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate.
Get a real pregnancy test.

71
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,293
You know, the one with the blood
and the hormones and the rabbit.

72
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,338
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's still your limo.

73
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,382
What do you say, Miss Daisy?

74
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,384
Whatever you want.

75
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,593
Lame duck's done quacking.

76
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,387
You quack, people shoot at you.

77
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,273
Cuddy just put me here
to make you miserable.

78
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,266
Another two days, you can go back
to making yourself miserable.

79
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,813
Okay, get an MRI. See if it's
in her head or in her uterus.

80
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,191
You're gonna want
to paralyze her.

81
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,655
You run tests on a flailer,
somebody's gonna lose an eye.

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,284
Sorry. You think I'm pregnant?

83
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,036
We need to find out for sure.

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,288
Would all this go away
once she delivered?

85
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,791
It could also be neurological.
We need to get an MRI.

86
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,418
Can she do that
if she's pregnant?

87
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,378
The risk to the fetus
is extremely low.

88
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,963
But there is a risk.

89
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,967
I don't think we should do it
until we're sure.

90
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,221
Ted, I think
you should take Stella home.

91
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,348
I wanna stay here.
We should be with you.

92
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,599
You should take her
out of the room.

93
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,977
We're gonna temporarily stop
Margo's spasms.

94
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,687
- You can do that?
- Vecuronium.

95
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,858
It's a paralytic. Essentially cuts
off the brain from the muscles.

96
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,404
Don't worry.
Your mom will be just fine.

97
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,930
It'll make
running the tests easier,

98
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,352
and it won't be dangerous for
the baby if you are pregnant.

99
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,492
Let's go, Stella.

100
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,910
I want to go with Mommy.

101
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,955
We'll be just outside, okay? We gotta
let the doctors get her better.

102
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,874
- All right?
- It's okay, sweetie.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,917
- Love you.
- Love you.

104
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,966
Your vitals
will be watched closely.

105
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,476
I'm gonna close your lids
so your eyes don't dry out.

106
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,104
Just try to relax.

107
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,945
What the hell did you do?
Were you just cold and lonely?

108
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,365
Of course he told you.
He's an eight-year-old boy.

109
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,284
Hey, you're the one
who kissed him.

110
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,203
Why are you so worked up
over this?

111
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,705
- Because you're married.
- Not to you.

112
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,332
This is none of your business.

113
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,460
The last time you left, I was the
one stuck picking up the pieces.

114
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,284
Oh, right. He cried himself
to sleep every night.

115
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,005
That so sounds like him.

116
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,633
He's been pining
for five years.

117
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,884
You're being dramatic.

118
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,097
No. Actually, I'm underplaying.
This is me being restrained.

119
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,391
- It was one kiss.
- Are you being intentionally thick?

120
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,608
This was not
just a one-night stand.

121
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,986
You can't toy with him.

122
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,071
I'm not.

123
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,788
He's probably toying with me.
I don't know what I'm doing.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,752
Oh, boy.

125
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,470
Welcome back to the world.
You're off the vecuronium.

126
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,306
Could you wiggle your toes
for me?

127
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,354
The MRI was clear. Whatever
this is, isn't in your brain.

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,732
MRI. So I'm not pregnant?

129
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,736
So what do we do next?

131
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:12,366
Well, it could be a variety of things,
some treatable, others more serious.

132
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,534
Open up.

133
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm gonna run a genetic test
for Huntington's.

134
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,414
- That one of the more serious ones?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,834
It's also possible that this is just a
symptom of the fertility treatments.

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,545
And now that we know you're not pregnant,
we're gonna start you on tamoxifen

137
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,130
to counteract the estrogen.

138
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,632
Will that undo
all the fertility treatments?

139
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,552
For the time being, yeah.
But it could cure you.

140
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,930
You can start trying again
once we get you healthy.

141
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,933
Damn it!

142
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,770
The spasms are gonna get worse now
that the vecuronium is wearing off.

143
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,441
What are you so scared of?

144
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,402
I'm still your mother.
I'm just a little sick.

145
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,531
Why did you even bring her here?
I told you to leave her at home.

146
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,496
Hypervigilance,
sudden irritability.

147
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,374
Symptomatic
of lunch with Cuddy?

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,418
The patient
now defines Huntington's.

149
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,588
Then what do you need me for?
Start her on Huntington's meds.

150
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,340
Before we get
her test results back?

151
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,967
We start her on valproic acid,
it could destroy her liver.

152
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,385
- Could stroke.
- If we wait,

153
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,429
she could progress
to full-blown psychosis,

154
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,265
and then her kid will never get
the chance to say goodbye.

155
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,351
Wanna tell the class
how that feels?

156
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,189
Huntington's patients don't
progress to psychosis in a day.

157
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,316
She went from zero to 60
in world record time.

158
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,319
Indicating it might be something
other than Huntington's.

159
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,363
We got a problem.

160
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
Stay away from me!
Where's my daughter?

161
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,994
- What's happening?
- She's having a psychotic break.

162
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,789
No! She is not yours!
What do you want with her?

163
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,957
- Calm down!
- Honey.

164
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,166
Margo,
you're gonna hurt someone.

165
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,209
No.

166
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,837
Push two milligrams of Ativan.

167
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,339
I want my daughter!

168
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,135
She's not yours! I want my daughter!
No more experiments!

169
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,720
No!

170
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,480
How can her Huntington's
test be negative?

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,608
All the signs are there.
Movement disorder, psychosis.

172
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,151
It should be Huntington's.

173
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,238
Yeah. It would certainly
make your job easier.

174
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,617
Well, good news for Margo, it's not
Huntington's. Bad news for us,

175
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,204
her psychotic break
eliminates fertility meds.

176
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,581
Which means we have no idea
what's wrong with her.

177
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,209
We give you so much,
and you give us so little.

178
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,546
You know, the patient is prime age to
develop spontaneous schizophrenia.

179
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,674
Almost impossible. No family
history of mental illness.

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,551
How about toxins?

181
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,555
None of her family members are sick.
Nobody at her office, her volunteer group,

182
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,849
kid's classes,
and PTA members, all fine.

183
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:47,396
So she raises a daughter, runs a
business, she does charity work,

184
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,358
she volunteers at school,
attends PTA.

185
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,402
What makes Mommy run?

186
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,404
- You're thinking drugs?
- Cocaine.

187
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,615
Explains the psychosis
and the flailing.

188
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,619
And the uncanny ability to bring
home the bacon, fry it up in a pan,

189
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,456
and never ever let Teddy
forget that he's a man.

190
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,042
- I'll go look for her stash.
- Take Foreman.

191
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,421
There's gotta be a reason
for the stereotype.

192
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,433
I know you're in there.

193
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,393
I can hear you caring.

194
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,200
The door was locked.

195
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,660
It means
I didn't wanna see anyone.

196
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,125
High school reunion?

197
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,920
It's for a patient.
She can't roll.

198
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,172
Hey, I locked that door, too.

199
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,008
Paranoia.
Must be the good stuff.

200
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,637
Times like these,
I wish I had cancer.

201
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,597
So what did she say?

202
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,713
It depends. What did you do,
and who are we talking about?

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,186
We both know that as soon as
we talked, you ran to Stacy

204
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,552
so you could gossip and giggle.

205
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,980
I need to know what she said.

206
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,691
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't you go talk to her?

207
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,736
Because my bestest buddy says
that could lead to trouble.

208
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,912
She sounds confused,
but I don't think she is.

209
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:32,042
I think she's waiting for you to do
something, show her you're serious.

210
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
Wow.

211
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,923
It's a big jump from "infidelity
is morally wrong" to "do her".

212
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,592
I didn't say "do her".
I said do something.

213
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,678
What exactly did she say?

214
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,139
She didn't say
it was a mistake.

215
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,310
She's not gonna leave Mark
in the middle of his rehab.

216
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,854
Too much guilt.

217
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,564
She left you.

218
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,734
Harsh toke, dude.

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,032
House.

220
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,000
Killjoy.

221
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,928
I could've covered this. You
need to get that test today.

222
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,681
I wish you guys would remember my
birthday instead of my HIV test.

223
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,477
Forgive us for being concerned.
I got a bet with House.

224
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,606
He says you're too scared to get it.
I say you're too anal not to.

225
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,692
I'll cut you in.

226
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,696
That was a colossal waste.

227
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,780
Who would've known?

228
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,251
Searching a high-end
family home for illicit

229
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,619
narcotics was such
an obvious choice.

230
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,580
Working moms practically
live in their cars.

231
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,501
- Little bump on the run.
- You were a car thief, right?

232
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,386
Mama's little helper.

233
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,597
House, Ritalin.

234
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,101
Cocaine with a PG rating.

235
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,728
Prescribed to her daughter.

236
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,690
Mommy does everything for her family
these days, even swallows their pills.

237
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,193
It's possible the kid's meds
are the kid's meds.

238
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,278
Pop enough Ritalin,
it can explain everything.

239
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,781
Well, Ritalin maybe explains
some tics, some involuntary...

240
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,325
No, case reports
have referred to chorea.

241
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,786
She's been cut off from her stash,
so the flailing's tapered off,

242
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,913
the psychosis hasn't returned.
It's perfect.

243
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,748
Tox screen will confirm that.

244
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,459
Half-life's 12 hours. Drugs
will be out of her system.

245
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,545
- We're done. Get rid of her.
- We're not done.

246
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,632
We have to confirm the diagnosis before we
send her home to die of something else.

247
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:48,470
Oh, yes. The power tastes so sweet.
You just can't resist.

248
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,476
You're like a diabetic
at the ice cream counter.

249
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,350
You wanna say no, but you
need that chocolaty goodness.

250
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,727
Yeah, well,
I'm still signing the charts.

251
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,273
So until tomorrow, you're
not allowed to kill anyone.

252
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,732
Wuss.

253
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,027
We've asked her three times
if she's on any meds.

254
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,821
So we don't ask her.

255
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,832
Candy striper.

256
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,130
So, you like dogs?

257
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,688
That's not a dog.

258
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,773
Smart kid.

259
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,067
Are you always
such a good little girl,

260
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,073
or does Mommy sometimes say you're the
reason she needs a double martini?

261
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:47,988
Who are you?

262
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,907
Over here, kiddo.
I'm talking to you. Focus.

263
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,328
Must be because
you're off your meds.

264
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,621
Who are you?

265
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,498
- Doctor and candy striper.
- She's not on any medication.

266
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,791
Well, that's strange.

267
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,795
'Cause this bottle has her name on it. And
I think these are medical pills inside.

268
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,839
What's he talking about?

269
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,218
The doctor prescribed Stella...

270
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,511
A few months ago.

271
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,098
I never told you about it,
because I never gave her any.

272
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,894
That's funny, 'cause the
bottle's almost empty.

273
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,563
You missed a couple of days.
Take five.

274
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,483
- Stop.
- Why? Unless they're not hers.

275
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,061
You need some water, sweetie?

276
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,569
I'm not taking Ritalin.

277
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,489
Come on. All the cool moms
are doing it.

278
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,909
And tox screen
says you're cool, too.

279
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,915
You were on drugs
while taking care of Stella?

280
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,923
I'm sorry, Ted.

281
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,807
It's a cafeteria menu.

282
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,934
It should take a couple hours
to process her.

283
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,895
Then you can take her home
and divorce her.

284
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,787
Working late?

285
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,706
Or are you just avoiding Mark?

286
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,582
It was one kiss, Greg.

287
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,669
So far. I'm planning
on keeping a chart.

288
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,047
I'm moving back to Short Hills.
I think it's time.

289
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,924
You're leaving?

290
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,177
It was never meant to be permanent,
and now that Mark's getting better...

291
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,054
Yeah, much better.

292
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,223
Except for the whole
walking thing.

293
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,559
He needs to get back to work.

294
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,602
Right.

295
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,357
Saving the next generation from
making bad choices about acne cream.

296
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,737
You're running away because
the kiss meant something.

297
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,406
I'm not running away.
I'm going home.

298
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,657
With Mark.

299
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,535
I love Mark.

300
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,079
You love me more.

301
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
I don't want you to leave.

302
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,480
Are we okay?

303
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,776
Let's just get you home.

305
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,611
That's a good idea.

306
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,830
- Mommy!
- Hey!

307
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,624
- Call a code!
- What's wrong, Mommy?

308
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,459
What's going on?

309
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,050
This better be important.

310
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,885
- You've gotta come back in.
- No, I don't.

311
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,887
- Margo's stable, but...
- Oh, my God.

312
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,432
- Well, I'll be right there.
- She had a stroke.

313
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,643
Perfect.

314
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,692
Gotta go back to work.

315
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,612
Right now?

316
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,822
Well...

317
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,576
Patient's stable.
Could maybe wait a half-hour.

318
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,754
He should have been here
20 minutes ago.

319
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,674
Doubt if he makes it at all.
I saw him leave with Stacy.

320
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,300
He was probably
just walking her to her car.

321
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,427
Oh, yeah.
That sounds like House.

322
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,222
He's not an idiot. He's not gonna
hook up with a married woman.

323
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,100
I hope he is getting some.
Maybe he'll mellow out.

324
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,862
- What took you so long? It's midnight.
- Traffic. Cinco de Mayo.

325
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,947
You owe me $100.

326
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,783
You didn't take the test?

327
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,035
Fear trumps anal every time.

328
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,455
It's not a big deal. I had the
viral load and antibody test.

329
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,166
It's 99.9%
that I don't have HIV.

330
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,753
And if you have the test, and it's
negative, you gain a tenth of a point.

331
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,132
But if it's positive you lose
nearly 100, right?

332
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,511
No arrhythmia, so Ritalin
isn't the big problem.

333
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,054
Something else is going on.

334
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,682
Fine, let's play doctors.

335
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,767
I removed the clot
which caused the stroke.

336
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,185
Problem is, we don't
know where it came from.

337
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,771
Did ultrasounds of her heart,
arms and legs. All clear.

338
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,565
Could be
a protein C deficiency.

339
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,609
Wouldn't explain
the movement disorder.

340
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,861
Nothing explains everything.

341
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,989
What if it's a crime syndicate?

342
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,910
Let's say Ritalin and the
fertility meds plotted a caper.

343
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,913
Ritalin takes care of the
psychosis, the flailing.

344
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,289
I still don't think Ritalin...

345
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,791
Fertility meds
are competitive by nature.

346
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,961
They had to do something bigger,
something really unexpected.

347
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,839
Fertility treatments have been
known to cause endometrial cancer.

348
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,051
Which could cause clots, which
could have caused her to stroke.

349
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,136
So ultrasound her uterus
this time.

350
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,807
See if there's something growing in there
that doesn't look adorable in a onesie.

351
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,938
Cameron. I love you.

352
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,859
You'll get your test results
tomorrow.

353
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,960
The prescription
for my heart condition.

354
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,879
A bit on the cheesy side.

355
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,006
I was trying for romantic.

356
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,640
Still fits.

357
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,393
Did you tell Mark?

358
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,648
I told him I had to work late.

359
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,571
You gonna tell him?

360
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,867
How am I gonna tell him?

361
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,997
Still working on that phrasing.
How about,

362
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,916
"You know all the stuff you were worried
about when we first came here, honey?"

363
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,084
"You were right."

364
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,377
Pithy.

365
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,744
Everything's easy when you
don't care if you hurt anyone.

366
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,089
You already
did the hurting part.

367
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,926
- He just doesn't know it yet.
- If I never tell him, it'll never hurt.

368
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,059
I want not to love Mark.
I wanna hate you.

369
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,229
I want all of this to be
simple, but it's not.

370
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,945
You can either
have a life with me,

371
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,656
or you can have
a life with him.

372
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,700
It can't be both.

373
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:54,080
It's not easy,
but it is simple.

374
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,764
No endometrial thickening.
No masses.

375
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,931
No cancer.

376
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,310
She's on fertility treatments. She
had a blood clot. It's there.

377
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,521
Millions of women are on fertility
treatments and they don't get cancer.

378
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,440
Right. They get babies.

379
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,525
She had a blood clot
and a stroke.

380
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,332
She'll get another one and probably
die, if we don't find that tumor.

381
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,780
Do an endometrial biopsy.

382
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,742
Biopsy's painful and unnecessary.
We just did an ultrasound.

383
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,162
What?

384
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,208
If you have a personal issue
that's interfering with...

385
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,754
What are we waiting for?

386
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,927
Your four weeks just expired.
Your reign of terror is over.

387
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,637
Mine has just begun.

388
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,557
Now go stick a needle up her
hoo-hoo and find that cancer.

389
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,059
"Hoo-hoo"?

390
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,394
He went to Hopkins.

391
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:04,109
Pergasaurus has got 1,500 horsepower
blown and injected with alcohol.

392
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,777
Yeah, that baby really moves.

393
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,738
Oh, yeah, and the transmission,
two-speed Powerglide. Suspension...

394
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,698
What are you watching?

395
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,743
TV.

396
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,704
What are you doing here?

397
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,791
Ted's with my mom. He asked
the nurse to watch me.

398
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,042
What nurse?

399
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,378
She's not really watching me.

400
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,547
I got that.

401
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,882
Do you still have the balloons?

402
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,008
No.

403
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,804
- Do you wanna play something?
- Nope.

404
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,774
When can Mommy come home?

405
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,192
Don't know.

406
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,028
- What's wrong with your foot?
- War wound.

407
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,573
- Does it hurt?
- Every day.

408
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,117
Is that why you're so sad?

409
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,453
Oh, aren't you adorable?

410
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,624
I'm not sad, I'm complicated.
Chicks dig that.

411
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,793
One day you'll understand.

412
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,463
That's what my parents say when they
don't want me to know something.

413
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,840
They say that a lot?

414
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,343
Only when they're talking
about making babies and stuff.

415
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,846
When you catch them fighting?

416
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,848
- They don't fight.
- Not ever?

417
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,976
People who love each other
don't fight.

418
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,604
Right. Forgot that.

419
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,900
What floor was that nurse on
who was watching you?

420
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,109
Two.

421
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,945
Good talk.

422
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:38,077
At your age, the type of uterine cancer
that develops is not likely to metastasize.

423
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,245
It's very treatable.

424
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,289
Okay, hold still, Margo.

425
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,793
I'm feeling a little bit dizzy.

426
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,420
Oh, my God.

427
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,882
BP's dropping.

428
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,175
What's going on?

429
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,760
Get him out of here.

430
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,886
What's going on?

431
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,679
Heart rate's 98 and rising.

432
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,097
We've gotta find that bleed.

433
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,641
What'd you do, hit an artery?

434
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,228
With what? I hadn't even
started the procedure.

435
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,943
I need some advice.

436
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,446
- Whatever it is, can it wait?
- Yeah.

437
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,868
What was Greg like
after I left?

438
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,039
An egomaniacal
narcissistic pain in the ass.

439
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,749
Same as before you left.

440
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,076
Do you think he's capable
of having a real relationship?

441
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,379
- What happened in Baltimore?
- Nothing.

442
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,005
- Right.
- Maybe something.

443
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,298
Right.

444
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,301
Technically, most of the something
happened after Baltimore.

445
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,387
Oh, God, Stacy.

446
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,305
I don't know what to do.

447
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,933
Are you seriously thinking
about leaving Mark?

448
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,935
No. I don't know.

449
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,770
I can't.

450
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,398
And you want me
to tell you it's okay?

451
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,234
It wasn't all bad with Greg.
I was with him for a reason.

452
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,902
You left him for a reason.

453
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,613
I could swear
I remember him being fun.

454
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,452
Sorry for the scare.

455
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,996
Just tell me she's okay.

456
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,791
Ultrasound showed the bleed
was coming from her liver.

457
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,544
It's rare, but the blood
got into her fallopian tubes.

458
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,131
In a way, it was lucky. Let us know
we were looking in the wrong place.

459
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,674
The tumor's in her liver.

460
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,426
Is it cancer?

461
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,012
We're running some more tests.

462
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,157
There it is.

463
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,535
It's a liver tumor.

464
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,382
Well, if it's malignant,
at least she's only

465
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:48,875
gonna leave one child
without a mother.

466
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,918
Do a biopsy.

467
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,046
We can't. It's vascular.

468
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,714
House.

469
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,474
- What?
- I'm here about Stacy.

470
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,976
What about her?

471
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,229
I think I'm losing her.

472
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,982
Your wife, your problem.

473
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,817
She won't talk to me.

474
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,612
So what? You gonna talk to me instead?
Talk to your shrink.

475
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,946
She keeps saying
everything's fine.

476
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,823
Find a bar. Talk to a stranger.

477
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,826
You're the only one
who's been through this.

478
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,456
I'm shutting her out.

479
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,876
I'm saying things and then
hating myself for saying them.

480
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,046
- How did you get past that?
- Didn't.

481
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,675
Can you please be a human being
for one minute and talk to me?

482
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,893
Sorry. Gotta go. People dying.

483
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,438
You're not gonna outrun me.

484
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,819
House!

485
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,537
You're not ready for this.

486
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,211
I've seen the way you and
Stacy talk to each other.

487
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,589
You're an idiot.

488
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,008
You probably just set your
rehab back three months.

489
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,261
Let go. Get off of me!

490
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,445
Liver tumor doesn't make sense.

491
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,864
You saying the CT was wrong?

492
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,535
I'm saying the symptoms don't add up.
A plus B does not equal liver tumor.

493
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,787
We gotta solve for X.

494
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,916
We gotta look at this
differently.

495
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,461
What do we know about her?

496
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,713
The side effects
of the Ritalin caused the...

497
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,467
No. We've examined the file up and down.
Come on, give me that.

498
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,803
Why do you people always
overlook the human element?

499
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,015
What do we know about her?
Margo...

500
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,519
Dalton. The woman.

501
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,064
She's a people-pleaser. She
doesn't like to let people down.

502
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,733
Never fights with her husband.

503
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,069
She turned to drugs instead of
asking for help to manage her life.

504
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,280
So if she can't manage now,

505
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,742
why does she want another kid?

506
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,083
Foreman, I need your help here.

507
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,212
You wanna pull a bank job,
would you go it alone?

508
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,923
If you gonna rob a home, sure,
that's a one or two man crew.

509
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,510
But a bank, you need a
lookout, a getaway driver.

510
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,472
I'm not saying anything until
the metaphor plays itself out.

511
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,390
So here's the caper.

512
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,560
Fertility meds
create a distraction.

513
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,855
Mommy had three refills on
Ritalin in the last three weeks.

514
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,066
That team goes straight
for the top floor.

515
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:04,779
No trouble taking out communications, but
they need the specialist, a safecracker.

516
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,574
All he does is stroke,
blood clot, liver tumor.

517
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,287
Foreman was right. This
badass even does flailing.

518
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:15,915
Come on.

519
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,793
There's only one guy I know
who does that kind of work.

520
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,628
Birth control pills?

521
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,848
While the surgeons are cutting
out a chunk of your liver,

522
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,725
should I have them do
a hysterectomy, too?

523
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,477
A hysterectomy?

524
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,479
I'm trying to get pregnant.

525
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,649
You don't have to lie to me.
We're not married.

526
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,109
You're Supermom.

527
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,402
You can do anything.

528
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:48,114
You work seven days a week, you
volunteer, you raise a kid.

529
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,784
Yet you still somehow find the
time to lie to hubby number two

530
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,913
that you really, really wanna give him a
child with his chin and pretty brown eyes.

531
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,582
What makes you think
that I would...

532
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,791
Because it fits.

533
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,545
Birth control pills caused
a hepatocellular adenoma.

534
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,716
Explains all your symptoms that
aren't explained by your other lies.

535
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,345
That's it?

536
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,557
Also...

537
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,184
I'll have the tuna on rye.

538
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,356
Would you like
to leave my room now?

539
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,026
Your tumor is benign.

540
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,987
Stop taking the pill, and
it will go away on its own.

541
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,363
I'm canceling the surgery.

542
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,865
What are you
gonna tell my husband?

543
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,034
That I'm canceling the surgery.

544
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,161
You can do the explaining.

545
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,039
It's tricky, huh?

546
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,885
It's one thing to say
you can't have a baby.

547
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,418
It's another to say
you don't want one.

548
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,046
Personally, I'd make up
some other lie.

549
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,589
Could...

550
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,675
Could I die on the table?

551
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,095
Could you die
if you tell him the truth?

552
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,144
I need this surgery.

553
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,397
I'm not on the pill.

554
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,610
You can't cancel the surgery.

555
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,488
If she goes off the pill, the
tumor goes away on its own.

556
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,740
You have no proof the birth
control pills caused this.

557
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,075
You have no proof
she's even taking them.

558
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,661
If we do the surgery maybe
we'll kill her on the table.

559
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,454
Then I can prove
I'm right at the autopsy.

560
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,041
Or we can forget the surgery, let
the tumor grow, and kill her.

561
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,337
Why don't you take it up with Stacy,
see which option minimizes your risk?

562
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,382
Here's what I think she's
gonna say, "Oh, I love Greg."

563
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,269
But if you go against the patient's
wishes, you're calling her a liar.

564
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,595
And if something goes wrong,
I end up in court

565
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,140
having to defend the big mean
doctor, albeit with dreamy eyes,

566
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,226
who wouldn't believe
the nice suburban mom.

567
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,063
"And even though his cane makes
me melt, do the damn surgery."

568
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,013
Shocking.

569
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,390
It's benign.

570
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,393
People do
crazy things for love.

571
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,398
No, crazy is hanging out in the
park all day talking to pigeons.

572
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,817
Margo knows what she's doing.

573
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,611
She gave up half her liver
to save her marriage.

574
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:37,241
No, she surgically removed her
fingerprints to cover her pathetic lie.

575
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:41,954
It's twisted and manipulative.
I get that. But it's also

576
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,498
romantic.

577
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,547
I'm barely willing to put
the seat down after I pee.

578
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,090
Do we need to talk?

579
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,675
Nope. I'm fine.

580
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,769
So the surgeon got the whole
tumor, and it was benign.

581
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,936
That's good, right?

582
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,104
Yeah, benign is good.

583
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,483
How could a benign tumor
have caused all the symptoms?

584
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,447
We believe all your wife's
symptoms will go away now.

585
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,949
Oh, thank God.

586
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,243
Look, I'm gonna pick up Stella.

587
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,166
I'll call you
after I get the babysitter.

588
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,505
Dr. Foreman,

589
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,882
you can help me.

590
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,220
You could tell my husband that

591
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,806
because of all this,

592
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,268
I can't take
any more fertility treatments.

593
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,485
Confidentiality rules stop me from
telling your husband the truth.

594
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,155
But my obligation to lie
ends there.

595
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,994
Are there...

596
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:09,500
Is there a birth control method,
something that won't make me sick?

597
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,545
Margo, you're gonna have
risks with everything,

598
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,339
especially if you're not
telling your fertility doctor.

599
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,593
If you keep doing this, it's gonna
kill your marriage and kill you.

600
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,012
You don't know.

601
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,349
In a few years,

602
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,227
we'll give up.

603
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,729
Stop trying to get pregnant.

604
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,023
We'll hug, cry.

605
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:40,489
Eventually Ted will stop thinking about it,
and he'll appreciate Stella even more.

606
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:46,078
And we'll live happily together
for the next 50 years.

607
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,096
Something you need to see.

608
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,981
Knowing is always better
than not knowing.

609
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,039
It's a referral request.

610
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,123
Right.

611
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,251
The HIV thing came in earlier.

612
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,253
You're fine.

613
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,965
You won't read your mail,
but you'll open mine?

614
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,885
It said "confidential",
and I wanted to know.

615
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,222
The most important letter of my
life, and you're still an ass.

616
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,391
Comforting, isn't it?

617
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,678
Hey.

618
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,137
Hi.

619
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,821
I'm gonna talk to Mark tonight,
and I'm gonna stay here with you.

620
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,282
Don't do it.

621
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,244
This isn't funny, Greg.

622
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,578
I know.

623
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,918
You

624
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,964
spent all these months
chasing me.

625
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,926
Now I'm here and you start running?
What the hell changed?

626
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,845
Nothing.

627
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,723
Nothing changes.

628
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,643
- I'm not gonna change.
- Who asked you to?

629
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,355
Mark is willing to do
whatever it takes.

630
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,233
I'm not.

631
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,610
Never was.

632
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,157
Now you're introspective? Weren't
so analytical the other night.

633
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,285
You were happy with Mark.
You'll be happy again.

634
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,620
Shut up about Mark. What the
hell is wrong with you?

635
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,582
- I can't make you happy!
- What?

636
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,712
How do you think
this is gonna end?

637
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,967
We'll be happy, for what?
A few weeks? A few months?

638
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,637
And then I'll...

639
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:53,515
I'll say something insensitive
or I'll

640
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,144
start ignoring you.
And at first it'll be okay.

641
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,272
It's just House being House.
And then,

642
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,152
at some point,
you will need something more.

643
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,572
You'll need someone who can
give you something I can't.

644
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,159
You know I'm right.
I've been there before.

645
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,163
Oh.

646
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,127
It doesn't have to be.

647
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:23,882
It does.

648
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,556
I don't wanna go there again.

649
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,731
I'm sorry, Stacy.

650
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:10,050
$50 says they're
divorced in a year.

651
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,385
Six months, tops.

652
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,596
I'll take that bet.
It's the perfect marriage.

653
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,642
There's nothing to fight over if
you never talk about anything.

654
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,675
What did you tell her?

655
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,805
I told her
she's better off without me.

656
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,266
That's probably true.

657
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,817
You're an idiot.

658
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,487
You don't think she'd be
better off without you.

659
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,073
Right.
I sent her off on a whim.

660
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,076
You have no idea
why you sent her off!

661
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,079
- Don't do this.
- This was no great sacrifice!

662
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,457
You sent her away because
you've got to be miserable!

663
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,002
This kind of psycho-crap help get your
patients through the long nights?

664
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,545
Or is it just for you?

665
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,466
Tough love make you feel good?
Helping people feel their pain?

666
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,848
You don't like yourself.

667
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,309
But you do admire yourself.

668
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,603
It's all you've got,
so you cling to it.

669
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:49,107
You're so afraid if you change,
you'll lose what makes you special.

670
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:57,950
Being miserable doesn't make you
better than anybody else, House.

671
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,160
It just makes you miserable.
