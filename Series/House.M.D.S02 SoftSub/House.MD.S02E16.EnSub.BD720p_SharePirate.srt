1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,344
- It's almost 11:00.
- She needs a lot of sleep these days.

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,890
Please, Mrs. Bardach,
I haven't seen her for a week.

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,644
- I'll see how she's feeling.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,729
You know what to do.

5
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,494
- All done?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,373
I scrubbed for 45 seconds,

7
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,252
did the nails, all the way down
to the elbows, the whole deal.

8
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,880
- Are you sick?
- No. No, no.

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,881
- Cough?
- No.

10
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,647
- Sore throat?
- No, no. I just, I just...

11
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,970
Sometimes I sneeze when I look
at lights. I always have.

12
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,349
- I'm sorry, you better...
- I would never get her sick. Please.

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,150
A mask.

14
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,610
- Got me by the bouncer.
- She's crazy.

15
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,946
She's let me out like six times
in the last two months.

16
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,782
Every time's just to go to the hospital.
I'm a prisoner.

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,075
It's okay.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,709
- It's ugly.
- No.

19
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,215
I wasn't looking at the scar anyways.

20
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,181
Take off your mask.

21
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,186
If your mom comes in here, she...

22
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,314
Hey. Give me a kiss or I'll kill you.

23
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,784
Your skin... Are you okay?

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,962
Melinda, can you...

25
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,882
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Can you breathe?

26
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,885
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Is it your heart?

27
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,554
What's wrong? Mrs. Bardach!

28
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,778
Melinda, Melinda,
I don't know how to use this.

29
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,106
I've never used one of these before.

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,833
What did you do to her?

31
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,771
Cuddy called.

32
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,149
I know. I saw the caller ID.

33
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,068
Young girl, anaphylactic shock.

34
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,361
You answered?

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,323
Turns out,
that's what stops the ringing.

36
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,825
It's a weird case.

37
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,497
I thought you did the dishes last night?
It was your day.

38
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:12,043
I did. Those are new. Midnight snack.

39
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,755
For a midnight snack,
you made a pot roast,

40
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,798
the same pot roast I made last night.

41
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,342
Yeah.

42
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,054
Actually, it was after midnight.
Today's your day, right?

43
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,723
You want me out of here. I get it.

44
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,101
- No, it's fine if you stay.
- The place I was gonna move,

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,312
the guy never called.
Otherwise I'd already be there.

46
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,314
- I said it's fine if you stay.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,024
That's why you're making me miserable.

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,611
Maybe I just wanna make sure
you do your fair share around here.

49
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,821
- That...
- What's weird about it?

50
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,618
The girl with the allergies.

51
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,869
Yeah.

52
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,622
- She's immunocompromised.
- What are you doing?

53
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,583
- What? You asked me...
- You knew that I was interested.

54
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,419
That gives you
a valuable bargaining chip.

55
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,464
You could've had me doing dishes
for a week.

56
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,176
Okay.

57
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,643
The allergic reaction happened
while she was in a clean room.

58
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,611
Why does she have a clean room
in her home?

59
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,947
Heart transplant.
Immune system's in the toilet.

60
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,659
So Mommy builds her little angel
a John Travolta-quality bubble.

61
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,327
Six months after the transplant.

62
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,413
She doesn't need to be confined
to a clean room.

63
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,831
Six months without putting out,

64
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,626
Dr. Cuddy doesn't need to wear
thong panties, but it's not our call.

65
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,254
I was wondering when you'd get
around to my panties.

66
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,672
She's had four days of workups.

67
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,049
They've tested everyone who came
anywhere near that room,

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,384
everything in the room.

69
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,302
It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.

70
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,805
Maybe it's not what was there,
it's what she was doing.

71
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,516
Exercise allergy. Love it.

72
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,602
What sort of exercise
could a strapping young man

73
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,647
and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly...

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,566
Mom was in the room within seconds.

75
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,194
So the boyfriend brought in an allergen
and is lying about it.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,280
Or the girl snuck out,
and she's lying about that.

77
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,699
Or the parents are lying about the
room being clean.

78
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,827
These are your big ideas?
Somebody's lying?

79
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,787
Hasn't let me down yet.

80
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,583
Recheck Mom, Dad, the girl, the boy,
the room and the home.

81
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,257
Any of you have a new soap, a detergent,
perfume?

82
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,052
No, no. Barbara's really careful
about that stuff.

83
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,137
And you haven't been outside recently?

84
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,139
How could I? I'm trapped up there.

85
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,785
You're not trapped. It's just safer...

86
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,436
They won't even tell me the alarm code.
Just tell her I can go back to school.

87
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,021
Until we clear this up...

88
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,983
Fine. Find out what I'm allergic to,
and I'll stay away from it.

89
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,153
Then I can go back to school, right?

90
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,742
It's up to your parents,
but, medically, there's no reason...

91
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,327
Told you.

92
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,705
Could I speak to you outside
for a second, please?

93
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,670
You know, this is hard enough
without you in there...

94
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,132
- She asked me my opinion.
- She is 16 years old. Lie to her.

95
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,926
When I was eight, my mom, she hated...

96
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,845
I know. I need to loosen up.
I'm overprotective.

97
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,473
I saw Finding Nemo. I get it.
I don't need another story.

98
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,225
But you're not
just being overprotective.

99
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,769
You're one of the most overprotective
parents I've ever seen.

100
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,730
She has the best private tutors.
I let her friends visit.

101
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,690
I'm not going to apologize.

102
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,651
Just giving you my thoughts.

103
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,445
She almost died
three times during her childhood.

104
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,365
- Penicillin, bee stings, peanuts.
- I've seen her file.

105
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,785
Six months ago, we leave her home alone
for the first time on a weekend.

106
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,872
She goes out, buys one chocolate chip
cookie. Peanut butter in the dough.

107
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,667
She's forgotten her EpiPen.
She drives to the hospital,

108
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,838
passes out, has an accident.
Steering wheel crushed her chest.

109
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,173
She ended up losing her heart.

110
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,385
So when you say to me that

111
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,764
I'm one of the most overprotective
parents you've seen, please,

112
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,435
please introduce me to the ones
who were more protective

113
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,730
so that I can find out
what they're doing right.

114
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,323
She's allergic to having
a sucky social life.

115
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,285
Give the parents a break.
They're just trying to keep her healthy.

116
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,328
Everything in here's
labeled "Hypoallergenic."

117
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,955
Check it anyway.

118
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,710
Cameron.

119
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,965
This place is cleaner
than her hospital room.

120
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,051
No alarm on this window.

121
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,261
That's a 20-foot drop.

122
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,947
You can get to the tree from here.
There's some bark scraped off.

123
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,100
Sure, heart-transplant girl swung down
there on a vine.

124
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,387
Maybe she was hooking up with Tarzan and
Cheetah down by the elephant graveyard.

125
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,566
Or Jane stayed in the tree house,
and Tarzan came up.

126
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,699
Okay, I spent most of the night, Friday.

127
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,911
But if her mom finds out about that,
she will totally freak.

128
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,662
You guys had sex?

129
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,414
Yeah, but, you know,

130
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,375
I did everything I could
to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

131
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,460
Latex allergy?

132
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,754
What do you mean, like a condom?
We didn't...

133
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,882
You had unsafe sex? The whole "unsafe"
thing didn't tell you something?

134
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,844
Yeah, but, I mean, look. We didn't,
like, plan on it, you know? It just...

135
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,430
I don't know. We're in love.
We've been dating for two years.

136
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,934
Practically a lifetime.
How about a semen allergy?

137
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,436
We're gonna need a semen sample.

138
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,689
You can use the bathroom over there.

139
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,026
- Right. How do I...
- Aim and shoot.

140
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,157
And no thinking about Dr. Cameron.
We'll know.

141
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,661
- We should tell her parents.
- Why stop there? Call the cops.

142
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,703
Melinda's a minor.

143
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,415
And if we nip it in the bud here,
teenagers will never again have sex.

144
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,742
The parents will find out
when they get the bill anyway.

145
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,545
So you're fine with them finding out as
long as you don't have to tell them?

146
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,130
Pretty much.

147
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,763
Too bad it's not you giving the sample.
We'd be done by now.

148
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,643
Test was negative. No semen allergy.

149
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,605
Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on
the night before the anaphylaxis.

150
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,691
- I don't buy that it's unrelated.
- He loves her.

151
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,485
He did everything he could to make
sure she wouldn't get sick.

152
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,028
What does that mean?

153
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,657
Love is an emotion certain people
experience, similar to happiness.

154
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,285
No. Maybe I should give
a more relatable example.

155
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,203
Oh, snap.

156
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,999
What did he do to protect her,
Brillo Pad his privates?

157
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,334
- I assumed he washed and he...
- Oh, good work.

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,671
Assumptions are so much faster
than actual questions.

159
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,724
You the boyfriend?

160
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,561
- I need to borrow you.
- What is going on?

161
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,315
Don't worry. I'll return him
in roughly the same condition.

162
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,366
Did you take anything to stay healthy?
Something stronger than an apple a day?

163
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,701
Is he okay?

164
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,872
He's just tired from being in a coma
so long. What'd you take?

165
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,625
- Don't worry. He can keep a secret.
- Right...

166
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,006
Antibiotics? Penicillin?

167
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,759
Any of those names ring a bell?

168
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:21,221
Yeah. My friend Elliot, his dad had,
like, a whole bottle that

169
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:26,727
he hadn't finished, so I swiped it
and took a bunch for, like, a week.

170
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,356
I mean, there's no way I was gonna risk
breathing germs on Melinda.

171
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,818
This is the one downside of teenage sex.
You're idiots.

172
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,947
You almost killed your girlfriend.
She's allergic to penicillin.

173
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,411
What, do you think there was still some
on my lips? I brushed my teeth.

174
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,538
Think lower and more fun.

175
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:55,172
- I mean, it can go through your stuff?
- Totally, dude.

176
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,673
There's this administrator here,

177
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,761
whenever she gets sick,
she just gives me the prescription.

178
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,889
But, you know, they tested Melinda.

179
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,767
They said she wasn't allergic
to my stuff.

180
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,560
Yeah, four days later.

181
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:13,190
By that time the penicillin was crusting
up a sock at the bottom of your hamper.

182
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,984
Do you have to tell her it was my fault?

183
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,945
No.

184
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,364
Great part of being a grownup,

185
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,825
you never have to do anything.

186
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,918
You're releasing her? What happened?
What did you find out?

187
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,546
Tests on your house ruled out
any environmental allergens.

188
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah, but what caused this?

189
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,446
We believe it's highly unlikely
that this set of circumstances

190
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,678
- will repeat itself.
- What set of circumstances?

191
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,932
It's good news. She's healthy.
But you might wanna talk to...

192
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,976
Cameron!

193
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,103
I can't breathe.

194
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,771
Getting the epi.

195
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,233
Give her the shot!

196
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,694
No murmurs, no friction rubs...

197
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,779
- What are you waiting for?
- Quiet.

198
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,574
She's coughing up white sputum.

199
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,118
Crackling two-thirds of the way up.

200
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,246
Look at her neck.

201
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,498
Please, she is vomiting.
Would you give her the shot?

202
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,042
It's not an allergy. It's her heart.

203
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,676
What's the good news?
What's the bad news?

204
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,636
Congestive heart failure.

205
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,762
Is which?

206
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,598
- Good news.
- Why?

207
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,934
I don't know. It just sounded like you.

208
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,855
New puzzle piece, always good news.
What's the bad news?

209
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,192
We've got two puzzle pieces
from two different puzzles.

210
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,651
Seems that way.

211
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,529
What if her anaphylaxis
wasn't anaphylaxis?

212
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,157
Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds
could cause a seizure

213
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,742
and then heart failure.

214
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,704
And get cured by a mommy-wielded
EpiPen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?

215
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,664
What if they really are two puzzles?

216
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,210
You think she had two unrelated
rare conditions in one week?

217
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,713
- We explained the anaphylaxis.
- What do you mean "we"? I did.

218
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,675
At least I thought I did.
Maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me.

219
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,846
And heart problems aren't so rare for
someone who's had a heart transplant.

220
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,724
I say we assume House was
right about the anaphylaxis.

221
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,601
It is tempting.

222
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:17,314
Heart failure could be either infection,
coronary disease, or rejection.

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,732
Sorry.

224
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,528
There's a reason they call it
the whiteboard. It's not my rule.

225
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,656
What ties
both these conditions together?

226
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,418
Okay, we can all stare at each other,
or we can investigate

227
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,838
what caused the heart failure.
Just the heart failure.

228
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,259
You wanna give me that black marker?

229
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,686
There's no fever,
so it's probably not infection.

230
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,936
Or no fever because she's been
on immunosuppressants

231
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,187
for the last six months.

232
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,816
Let's do a CT,
get a heart biopsy, and then redo...

233
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,362
- Anything?
- Not yet.

234
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,407
So I hear you don't want
teenagers having sex.

235
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,826
Teen suicide rate
isn't high enough for you already?

236
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,162
I think those two are brats. The girl
undercuts her mom any chance she gets.

237
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,749
Yeah, it's the daughter's fault. Nothing
to do with Mom infantilizing her.

238
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,168
Good point. Explains why parents
who don't pay attention

239
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,087
get such nice, well-adjusted children.

240
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,797
What's this?

241
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,550
- You think it's vegetation?
- Yeah.

242
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,428
The kind made of muscle
that opens your heart valves.

243
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,764
It's nothing. She's clean.

244
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,809
It's good news.

245
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,104
You don't show any signs
of coronary artery disease.

246
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,397
So what's next?

247
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,484
Well, blood work to rule out infection,
and then a heart surgical biopsy

248
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,986
to rule out rejection.

249
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,531
But you don't think you're gonna
rule out both things, do you?

250
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,699
No.

251
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,454
I'm gonna lose this heart, right?

252
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,998
Hopefully we'll find the problem
and fix it.

253
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,043
- You'll keep your heart a long time.
- How long?

254
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,672
There could be drug breakthroughs that
allow you to keep it for decades more.

255
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,593
Yeah. That's the answer
my cardiologist always gives me.

256
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,639
I looked it up on the web.
It's like five or 10 years, right?

257
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
That's about the average.

258
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,979
That's why I need to have a life.

259
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,900
Why can't you convince my mom
to let me go back to school?

260
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:29,446
Melinda, you've got bigger worries right
now than missing school.

261
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,657
Until we figure out what's wrong
with your heart,

262
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,493
the safest place for you to be
is right here.

263
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,417
Where's...

264
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,629
the hooker, I assume?

265
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,506
Right up here, buddy.

266
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,930
You said you'd hang the stethoscope
if you were having sex.

267
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,391
I didn't say it had to be
with another person.

268
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,312
Can you think of anything that would tie
together anaphylaxis and heart failure?

269
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,399
No. I was waiting out there for hours!

270
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,401
Yeah, well, I need a lot of foreplay.

271
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,820
And then there's
the cuddling afterwards.

272
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,450
Any way that anaphylaxis isn't
anaphylaxis even if it responds to epi?

273
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,494
No. Oh, no wonder you were in the mood.

274
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,163
This month's New Jersey
Journal of Cardiology.

275
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,250
Have you seen the centerfold?
There's no way those valves are real.

276
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,753
Any chance that the heart failure
could be unrelated to...

277
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,466
No. If you need time alone to work,
you just have to say so.

278
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,672
- You don't have to lie about it.
- Lying's more fun.

279
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,262
Being lied to... Not as much fun.

280
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,808
Please have an answer to this question.
What's for dinner?

281
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,477
You still haven't done the dishes?

282
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,271
You want one of these?
I think I got a couple of blueberries.

283
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,274
Oh, nope. Sorry, just one.

284
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,321
Well, don't look all weepy.

285
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,867
You got a problem with me, deal with it.
Short my sheets or something.

286
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,501
Biopsy was negative
for rejection.

287
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,544
Thank God.

288
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,296
- And what about the blood tests?
- Showed no infection.

289
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,508
So we still don't know what caused
her heart failure.

290
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,554
Let's just be happy
she doesn't need a new heart.

291
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,221
Mrs. Bardach, it could have just been
a one-time thing.

292
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,431
So she has an allergic reaction
and heart failure,

293
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,268
and neither of them can be explained.

294
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,228
- Are they doing any more tests on her?
- No.

295
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,771
She's not here.

296
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,902
Notify local hospitals, cab companies,
the state troopers, and local cops.

297
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,321
Any security officers off duty
are back on duty.

298
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,489
We're on it.

299
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,450
And I'm gonna need some pictures.
And go through those drawers.

300
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,912
And I want at least two people
going over the surveillance tapes.

301
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,873
Will that work?

302
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,458
- Are those all her clothes?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,405
She's obviously still in the building.
So where did she go?

304
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,798
- What does she want?
- See her boyfriend?

305
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,967
She didn't take her phone.

306
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,344
She wants to be outside.

307
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,402
If you're trying to scare your parents,
great job.

308
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,031
Can we go back now?

309
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,491
I hate her.

310
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:49,164
When I was eight years old, I was sick.

311
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,292
Not really sick, but the point is,
my mom, she could...

312
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,337
She was like this before.
Home by 9:00 every night.

313
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,381
Can't go out on the weekends.
Can't do sports.

314
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,467
Transplant just gave her
what she always wanted.

315
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,762
Melinda, you had heart failure.

316
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,807
This is kind of an insane time
to be criticizing your mom

317
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,267
about being overprotective.

318
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,979
I know. I mean,
this is what makes it even worse.

319
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,274
All of her craziness,
it just...

320
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,403
It makes sense now.

321
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,031
Everything's gonna be all right.

322
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,034
I didn't even try to get outside.

323
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,704
- I was too scared.
- Come on.

324
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,511
Whoa, whoa, Melinda.
Please walk back towards me.

325
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,471
Why?

326
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,348
Please.

327
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,730
It feels kind of weird.

328
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,151
It's called steppage gait.

329
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,529
- Is it serious?
- Not necessarily.

330
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,116
All right. Stick your leg out.
Hold it up.

331
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,996
She was under anesthesia for the biopsy.
If she lost oxygen...

332
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,123
CT ruled out brain damage.

333
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,376
Put your leg down. Relax.

334
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,923
Why is her leg twitching like that?

335
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,802
- Fasciculation.
- Is that serious?

336
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,555
It's paralysis, and it's ascending.

337
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,516
She's gonna lose the use of her legs?

338
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,813
To start with.

339
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,113
It's ascending fast.
She can hardly extend her leg now.

340
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,992
At this rate, it'll be up to her lungs
in a matter of days.

341
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:53,496
So, anaphylaxis, heart failure,
paralysis.

342
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,183
We couldn't put the first two together.

343
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,083
I'm guessing we can't put
all three together.

344
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,545
Tick paralysis? Could also explain
the anaphylaxis, maybe even the...

345
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,214
Penicillin allergy explains
the allergic reaction much better.

346
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,260
Particularly because tick paralysis is
usually accompanied by a tick.

347
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,305
We did two comprehensive physicals
looking for insect bites.

348
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,849
Can we put any two of those together?

349
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,350
How about we stipulate?

350
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,353
You argued that there must be
something to connect all three symptoms,

351
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,147
you mocked us for not figuring it out,

352
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,434
and finally you let us discuss
the paralysis on its own

353
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,401
because it's what's gonna kill her.

354
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,155
Now, it's ascending. Her MRis are clean,
so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

355
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,032
- ALS, MS?
- Too quick.

356
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,159
- Spinal lesion from leukemia?
- Too slow.

357
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,995
- It's most likely Guillain Barré.
- She's immunosuppressed.

358
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,038
What about botulism?

359
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,665
Not unless she's been walking
on her hands the last couple of days.

360
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,751
Botulism paralysis is descending,
not ascending.

361
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,004
Could be a virus. West Nile,
even polio with her immune system shot.

362
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,341
Get an LP and do PCRs for the viruses.

363
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,676
And get an EMG
to check for Guillain Barré.

364
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,347
Foreman's right.
We gotta find out why she's paralyzed.

365
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,560
But not before staring at me dumbly
for a few seconds.

366
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,031
We ran more tests
on your daughter.

367
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,409
We took a lumbar puncture,
got some spinal fluid.

368
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,578
Then we brought it to the lab
to look for infections

369
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,956
that could be affecting her brain.

370
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,377
We also did an EMG to check
how her muscles and nerves

371
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,255
are responding to electrical impulses.

372
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:29,008
Unfortunately, her muscles are showing
increased weakness above the knee.

373
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,969
You mean she's getting worse?

374
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,097
The LP and PCRs ruled out
polio and West Nile.

375
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,182
We think it's Guillain Barré.

376
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,976
The body's immune response goes
haywire

377
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,103
and starts attacking
the peripheral nerves.

378
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,439
It causes muscle weakness and
paralysis.

379
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,607
How bad is it?

380
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:49,237
It's serious, but Guillain Barré usually
responds very well to plasmapheresis.

381
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,038
You see, the plasma,
the clear liquid

382
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,624
contains most of the antibodies
which are overreacting

383
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,835
and attacking her nervous system.

384
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,879
The machine spins her blood
in a centrifuge

385
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,840
and separates parts of the blood
based on weight.

386
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,301
White blood cells are the heaviest,
then the red cells,

387
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,219
then platelets and plasma.

388
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,597
We discard the stuff
that's causing all the trouble

389
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,225
and return the good blood cells back
to her body in a replacement fluid.

390
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,645
If it works,
we'll see results in a couple of days.

391
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,281
You didn't get any messages for me
last week, did you?

392
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,741
Nope.

393
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,035
That's funny.
The guy finally called back.

394
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,205
The place I lost,
he said he left three voicemails.

395
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,164
Gotta pee.

396
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,168
Which I never got, if that wasn't clear.

397
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,922
He must be lying.
You wouldn't want to live with a liar.

398
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,090
- You erased my messages?
- Yep.

399
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,719
Decided I wanted you to stay.
Told you that, didn't I?

400
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,848
You're miserable, and you're lonely,
and you're gonna trap me here

401
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,934
to keep me every bit
as miserable and lonely, too.

402
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,645
Yeah, and you're happy, happy, happy.

403
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,315
Okay. Hey, I'm obviously going through
a rough patch here.

404
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,068
Wife leaves, tends to bum somebody out.

405
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,529
Do you know where my pee went?

406
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,617
You're missing some?

407
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:22,121
No. Came out of me and went right
into the toilet. Now, why would that be?

408
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,959
You're William Tell. You could pick
an apple off someone's head?

409
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,170
No, it's because there was
no clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

410
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,297
The stuff's in the kitchen.
You had plenty of time.

411
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,175
- All that was missing was the will.
- This isn't a college dorm.

412
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,262
- It could be.
- We're not 18!

413
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:41,683
So what? What did I do to you?
I scammed you into doing the dishes,

414
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,228
I made you sit on the steps.
I didn't kill your puppy.

415
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,399
- I did not make you miserable.
- Oh, so this is therapy?

416
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,652
No, it just makes me smile.

417
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,072
All right.
I'm finding a new place tomorrow.

418
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,074
Right. But not tonight.

419
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,536
Well, I figure you wanna shave
my eyebrows while I'm asleep.

420
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,997
I wouldn't wanna deprive you
of that last smile.

421
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,373
You're not going anywhere.

422
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,501
You're gonna sit on my couch
and depress us both

423
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,947
because you just can't admit
that it's over with your wife.

424
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,007
- That's right. I'm here on vacation.
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?

425
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,137
- That... That's not...
- Have you even called one?

426
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,475
As long as you're here,
it's just a fight.

427
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,354
But as soon as you get a place,
then it's a divorce.

428
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,069
Everything sucks.

429
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,324
Might as well find something
to smile about.

430
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,253
Reflexes are marginally weaker.

431
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,921
The paralysis is getting worse?

432
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,258
Sometimes it takes a few treatments
for the plasmapheresis to work.

433
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,219
Why do these things keep
happening to me?

434
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,432
Dan's back.

435
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,226
Hey, baby, did you hear that?
Dan's here.

436
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,646
I don't wanna see him.

437
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,070
- I'll tell him to come back later.
- No.

438
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,822
Mommy, stay here, please.

439
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,201
Of course.

440
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,695
- Is she doing okay?
- She's sleeping.

441
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,656
I'm sure she's exhausted.

442
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,325
Mood swings are common
with the anti-rejection meds.

443
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,744
No. She's had mood swings.
This isn't it.

444
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,832
This is... She's given up.

445
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,044
I know you think I'm...

446
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,215
This isn't what I wanted.

447
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,970
She's always fought with me.

448
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,141
Ever since she was a baby,
she was so damn stubborn.

449
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,477
But I never wanted her like this.

450
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,440
I just wanted her safe.

451
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,526
Doctor!

452
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,907
She can't breathe.
She can't even get a whole sentence out.

453
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,953
She's using the accessory muscles.

454
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,955
- O2 sat's down to 90. Lungs clear?
- Yeah.

455
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,957
Does your tongue feel swollen?
Is it itchy?

456
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,460
- No hives.
- It's not an allergy.

457
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,628
Lips are cyanotic.
We've got to intubate.

458
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,255
What are you doing?

459
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,965
Pushing lorazepam.

460
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,386
She's not getting enough oxygen.
We've gotta assist her breathing.

461
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,273
What was that?
Was that a reaction to the treatment?

462
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,318
It's the paralysis.
It's reached her lungs.

463
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,870
Melinda's dying.

464
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,582
We're all dying. How fast?

465
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,292
Too fast for Guillain Barré.

466
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,337
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI
to rule out a spinal lesion.

467
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,923
Cuddy? What's she doing on this?

468
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,926
The family lost confidence in us.

469
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,054
I don't blame them. I'll be right in.

470
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,862
It's like she got poisoned
with a nerve agent.

471
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,281
Glue inhalation. Would explain
why she hasn't admitted it.

472
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,866
Tox screen was clear for pot.

473
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,286
Middle-class heart transplant patient's
gonna huff glue?

474
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,747
- Pesticides?
- They're not spraying.

475
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,251
This girl's tough.
She gets what she wants.

476
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,755
She's deprived of human contact.
She gets herself a backdoor man.

477
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,967
Or in her case, a side-window boy.
What else has she been deprived of?

478
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,302
She's on a special diet
because of her allergies.

479
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,807
The boyfriend brings the hot beef.
He also brings a side dish, botulism.

480
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,142
This paralysis is ascending, remember?

481
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,562
Not if the heart problem's
really a paralytic problem.

482
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,605
Why would she admit the sex
and not the food?

483
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,941
She didn't admit anything.

484
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,652
He admitted the sex,
and we didn't ask him about food.

485
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,946
- Get me a rat.
- You have a rat.

486
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,824
What? I'm not gonna kill Steve.

487
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,661
Only way to confirm this,
inject a rat with her blood

488
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,664
and wait for it to get all botulistic
on your ass.

489
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,835
In the meantime, I'm going downstairs
to browbeat a scared dying teenage girl

490
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:05,089
until she breaks down
like a scared dying teenage girl.

491
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,929
- You're up early.
- Cuddy needed a consult.

492
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,682
We're checking for spinal lesions
from leukemia.

493
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,184
Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly.

494
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,438
Unless this is the patient
with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure,

495
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,898
and the paralysis, in which case,
you're wasting your time.

496
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,191
We wanted a second opinion.

497
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,277
Second?
We must have given you at least eight.

498
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:30,948
Okay, well, here's nine. Botulism.

499
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,784
Listen to me,
have you eaten anything abnormal?

500
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,828
- Any canned foods?
- No.

501
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,954
You sure?

502
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,373
Lying to your parents is
usually the right thing to do,

503
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,584
but there is
an impending death exception.

504
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,835
Don't talk to her like that.

505
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,713
You're right. She never lies.
I was being rude.

506
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,634
When your boyfriend snuck in
on Friday night... Surprise.

507
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,261
Perhaps he got you
some sexy little treats, huh?

508
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:57,224
Some honey or some edible underwear,
some massage oils. Come on, anything.

509
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,687
- We didn't...
- Yeah, yeah. We know about the sex.

510
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,190
Turns out that Danny's little Danny is
full of penicillin.

511
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,108
That's what caused
your anaphylactic shock.

512
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,195
You didn't tell us that was what...

513
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,199
No. It was...
He took clindamycin, what I use...

514
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,329
He said he was on penicillin.

515
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,916
- I saw the bottle.
- That's a non-penicillin antibiotic.

516
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,377
If the antibiotics didn't cause
the anaphylaxis...

517
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,337
It's still on the table.

518
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,880
Everything is connected.

519
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,924
What did we discuss?
What was the differential?

520
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,509
Cameron said...

521
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,807
When Dan came to your house that night,
he go through any tall grass?

522
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,433
Climbed a fence.

523
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,524
What are you doing?

524
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,693
Your daughter had two visitors
on Friday night.

525
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:53,364
One of them is still in the room.
She has tick paralysis.

526
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,536
Dan tracked a tick onto his jeans,
which wouldn't be a problem.

527
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,039
But being a teenager,
Dan couldn't keep his tick in his pants.

528
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,041
We already checked her.

529
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,835
Now I'm checking her.

530
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,546
Tick bites don't ordinarily cause
anaphylactic shock.

531
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,673
This girl's allergies are not ordinary.

532
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,009
House, get out of here. We have to
re-intubate her, get her into the MRI.

533
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,886
The time course is perfect.

534
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,888
The bite itself sets off
an allergic reaction.

535
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,182
Venom takes four days to kick in.

536
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,934
Heart's vulnerable, hits that first,

537
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,020
then a day later sets off
the ascending paralysis.

538
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,105
Except that ticks aren't
usually invisible.

539
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,023
They are until you find them.

540
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,318
Oh, no. That's dandruff.

541
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,738
Okay, well, that wasn't
nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped.

542
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,824
It just means the next time will be
even better.

543
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,746
- What's happening?
- That's the tick venom ascending.

544
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,291
Either that or you stressed her
into heart failure. BP's dropping.

545
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,085
- Heart rate, 47.
- I'm administering atropine.

546
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,337
She's gonna need
a transvenous pacing wire.

547
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:54,467
Okay, magical tick hunt is over.
Only real doctor stuff now.

548
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,177
This is just gonna get worse.

549
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,263
Ticks produce more toxins
the longer they feed.

550
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,808
She's gonna be dead in an hour even
if you pump her heart full of jet fuel,

551
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,227
- unless you let me find the tick.
- Could he be right?

552
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,153
The only thing I know for sure is
that your daughter's heart won't last

553
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,899
another 20 minutes without treatment.

554
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,277
Okay, I just need one final instruction.
When I find the tick on the autopsy,

555
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,947
do you want to know? I'm thinking not,
probably make the coping easier.

556
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,574
Stop talking to them!

557
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,035
Page Borsisky in cardiology.
Get her team down here stat.

558
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,787
Get them out of here.
Get House out, too.

559
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,414
Dr. Wilson, I could use your help.

560
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,169
Well, I don't know if the dopamine's
enough. She may need inamrinone lactate.

561
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,712
Why? What's that? She doesn't...

562
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,632
She might need stronger pressors.
They don't have any in radiology.

563
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,968
Inamrinone can cause arrhythmia
and thrombocytopenia.

564
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,096
Not inamrinone could cause death.
Death's worse.

565
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,016
We have to get her up to the ICU.

566
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:54,777
Cardiac team
to ICU stat. Cardiac team to ICU stat.

567
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,742
- Sorry, a little crowded here.
- House, get out of the elevator.

568
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,702
You're welcome to wait for the next one.

569
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,579
- You got her?
- Got her.

570
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,302
As long as we're stuck here, this might
be a good time to look for that tick.

571
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,931
- Turn the elevator back on.
- Just be a minute, honey.

572
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,567
- Atropine's wearing off.
- So inject her again.

573
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,652
- That's just temporary.
- Temporary's fine.

574
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,987
We're not hanging wallpaper.

575
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,489
We've gotta get her upstairs
and put her on norepinephrine.

576
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,409
It wasn't penicillin. You still think
the symptoms are unconnected?

577
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,255
We've gotta take care
of her heart before...

578
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,290
You wake up in the morning,
your paint's peeling,

579
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,290
your curtains are gone,
and the water's boiling.

580
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,333
- Which problem do you deal with first?
- House.

581
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,545
None of them. The building's on fire!
We treat her symptoms, she dies.

582
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,840
We find the cause, she lives.
That tick is an IV drip of poison.

583
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,050
We unhook it, she'll be fine.

584
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,771
This is my last atropine.
Last us about three minutes.

585
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,982
Let's get her gown up.

586
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,244
Her heart rate falls below 35,
we're getting her to the ICU.

587
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,205
I'm not gonna let her die
in this elevator.

588
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,462
Where are they?

589
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,006
Get maintenance up here, right away.

590
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,635
- Ear canal's clean.
- Left foot's clean.

591
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,680
If it's not here, we've only got...
Heart rate's 46.

592
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,601
It's here. Looks like a mole
or a freckle, something we missed.

593
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,311
Check the armpits.

594
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,215
Dr. Foreman's an excellent doctor.
He'll be able to handle it.

595
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,321
Yeah? You know that from experience?
You lose a lot of patients on elevators?

596
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,648
The maintenance guy said
it didn't just stop on its own,

597
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:07,117
that they hit the emergency stop button.

598
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,870
Well, I'm sure he must be mistaken.

599
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,166
- Perineum.
- We checked it.

600
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,172
- If we get her upstairs, we still...
- Maxilla.

601
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,461
Checked.

602
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,091
Down to 38. We don't have a lot of time.
We can still...

603
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,802
Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair.

604
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:28,722
Checked, checked, checked.
We checked everywhere! It's not...

605
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,809
Thirty-five.

606
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,478
- We gotta get her to the ICU.
- We haven't found the tick yet.

607
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,772
We already kidnapped her!
You wanna add murder?

608
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:41,026
We've looked over every inch of skin
on her body, House! It's over.

609
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,996
Hey, is that the first time you had sex?

610
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,960
With all the other stuff going on down
there, she might not have realized.

611
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,768
- You sick, miserable...
- What are you doing?

612
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,228
Oh, my God!

613
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,734
See? Told you it'd be
even more dramatic.

614
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,782
Push norepinephrine.
Get her heart back to normal.

615
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,785
She'll be completely cured by tomorrow.

616
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,748
Foreman, let's get her into the ICU.

617
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,682
Inamrinone was a stupid idea

618
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,060
unless you wanted me
to get that girl in the elevator.

619
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,897
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.
- Wouldn't respect you if you did.

620
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:12,326
Wow, looks like somebody filed
halfway through your cane

621
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,495
while you were sleeping.

622
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,314
Reflexes back to normal.

623
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,982
Heart's looking good, too.

624
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,819
I'll send in the nurse,
we'll get you transferred out of ICU.

625
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,571
You'll be discharged in the morning.

626
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,949
Thank God. I just wanna get home.

627
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,952
And back to school on Monday.

628
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,247
I'm not ready.

629
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,666
You're ready.

630
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,920
- I'm sick, Mom.
- You're not sick.

631
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,714
You're gonna go to class,

632
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:11,051
and you're gonna see
your friends and your boyfriend.

633
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,852
What's this doohickey?

634
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,315
A brassiere.
You know about those things.

635
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,401
You're a big boy now.

636
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,778
Well, I've never run across
one like that.

637
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,906
It's brand new.
Revolutionary uplift.

638
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,326
- It's explained to you.
- I know. I know.

639
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:42,040
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo and I get dizzy.

640
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,625
What a moment to find out I had it.

641
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,210
Well, you've got it.

642
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,754
There's no one to blame.
Why quit?

643
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,716
You mean and sit behind a desk?
Chair-borne.

644
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,011
- It's where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

645
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,555
I called a divorce lawyer today.

646
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,225
Does that mean you're leaving?

647
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,853
At some point.

648
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,611
You might not want to sit exactly there.
