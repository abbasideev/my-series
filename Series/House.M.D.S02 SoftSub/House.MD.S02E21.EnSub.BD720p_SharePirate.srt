1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,626
Previously on House.

2
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:02,752
You high, popo?

3
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,587
A cop with a sense of humor.

4
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,714
You check the cop car.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,384
Also check his personal car, work, home.

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,594
Foreman, get out!

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,281
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

8
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:15,098
You stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.

9
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,266
We're not friends. We're colleagues.

10
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,060
Son of a bitch!

11
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,646
- Now we're both exposed.
- In ten minutes' time...

12
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,107
You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.

13
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,110
Time of death. 12:26 p.m.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,281
I need a bone saw.

15
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:34,488
- I'm sorry. I wish I could.
- They said you won't...

16
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,911
I just want a little tiny slice
of this guy's brain.

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,838
Just enough to tell me
what's killing Foreman.

18
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,750
A thin slice of Joe's brain
could also cause a public health crisis.

19
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,756
It's not a good idea to scream "fire"
every time somebody lights a match.

20
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,338
Don't downplay this, House.

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,716
You put both of them in isolation
for a reason.

22
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,594
Joe's death elevates this situation
to a Biosafety Level 3.

23
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,181
- Level 3. Did you call Jack Bauer?
- I called the CDC.

24
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,183
Well, tell them
I'll be really, really careful.

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,149
We don't have the proper equipment
for you to be really, really careful.

26
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,314
You can do whatever you want to Foreman,
but the CDC will do this autopsy.

27
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,151
Whatever. The point is, we'll be lucky
to get results in three days.

28
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,478
- I told them how urgent this is.
- And they told you...

29
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,238
"We'll have the results in three days."

30
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,408
Oh, that's a shame. Because Foreman
will never get to know what it was.

31
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,827
He'll be dead in 36 hours.

32
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,371
Maybe this is a toxin.
Maybe it's not contagious at all.

33
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,623
You're killing Foreman
because of a "maybe."

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,043
Well, you have 36 hours
to figure out which one it is.

35
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,595
Foreman. Come here, fast.

36
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,431
What's going on?
When are they doing the autopsy?

37
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,057
You're doing it, now.

38
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,425
You ever studied how they used
to do ice pick lobotomies?

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,353
I read about it in med school.
Why would I...

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,190
Shove an ice pick into the eye socket
just above the tear duct,

41
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,317
bang it a couple times with a hammer,
get a sample.

42
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,523
- What's going on, House?
- Foreman, you can't do it!

43
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,031
- You'd be in violation of...
- Can't do the time if you're not alive.

44
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,033
You! I need you to suit up.

45
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,910
Get that equipment away
from Dr. Foreman.

46
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,954
Take your time, guys.
Just tell them to go slow.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
It won't be your fault.

48
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,767
Foreman, we don't know what kind
of contagion we're dealing with.

49
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,796
Which is why we need
to chop into the guy's head!

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,253
- It's dangerous.
- Not to you!

51
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,172
There are other ways to diagnose you.

52
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,090
Yeah? You have the answer?

53
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,303
- Foreman, do it now!
- I am warning you! Do not...

54
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,477
- What are you doing?
- That didn't feel right.

55
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,438
He's blind.

56
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,940
But he thinks he can see.

57
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,484
Same as the cop.

58
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,050
We need something to bag the sample.

59
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,112
Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.

60
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,283
No, no, no. I'm fine. House,
there's the sample. Get it, test it!

61
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,410
You got to test that sample!

62
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,205
Apparently I was optimistic
about the 36 hours.

63
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,584
Intractable, unbearable pain is up next.

64
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,129
Sure you don't wanna reconsider
that whole autopsy thing?

65
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,965
Physically, his eyes are fine.
The problem's isolated to his brain.

66
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,051
Damage to the occipital lobe extends
from the primary visual cortex...

67
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,429
We should retest him
for bacterial meningitis.

68
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,347
If it was meningitis, we'd all be sick.

69
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,807
His CSF might show signs...

70
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,727
LP's pointless.
We already did a brain biopsy.

71
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,437
It was negative.

72
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,150
- Toxic mold.
- If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.

73
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,486
- How do we know you're not sick?
- Do I seem happy to you?

74
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,947
Never.

75
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,490
It was funny.

76
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,534
Well, let's assume it's not blood-borne.

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,329
If you start cracking jokes,
we can reassess.

78
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,707
In the meantime, stay away from
people and animals that you care about.

79
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,964
Guillain Barré.

80
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,175
Neither of them had
any sort of paralysis.

81
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,861
Joe could have died before
the paralysis had a chance to present.

82
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,972
- What about arbovirus?
- Start treatment.

83
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,517
For arbovirus? You think our Jersey beat
cop has been spending a lot of time

84
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,977
exploring deep, dark Africa?

85
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,396
Treatment for everything,
likely or unlikely.

86
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,273
If you can think of it, treat for it.

87
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,276
Mixing that many meds will create
all sorts of toxic interactions.

88
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,237
We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys.
There's got to be a better way.

89
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,198
Of course there's a better way!

90
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:46,369
It's that body sitting in the room
with him that Cuddy won't let us touch!

91
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:52,166
Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals,
parasites, it's got to be one of them.

92
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
Where are you going?

93
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,587
See if I can find another brain
to biopsy.

94
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,300
They're gonna lock Joe up downstairs
until the CDC gets here.

95
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,429
Foreman, you can't see.

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,556
Right.

97
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,309
House wants to start you on some meds.
They're in the air lock.

98
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,187
- For what?
- Leading candidate is toxic mold.

99
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,024
- Is Cameron sick?
- I'm fine, thanks for asking.

100
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,070
You're casting your net a little wider
than toxic mold, aren't you?

101
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,197
Guillain Barré is also on the table.

102
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,784
This is an oval shape.
That's either an "L" or a "7."

103
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm guessing an "L." Levofloxacin,
because you can't rule out bacteria.

104
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,334
8-0-0. That's the dosage for acyclovir
in case it's viral.

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,337
Square. No, more like a rhombus.

106
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,632
That's fluconazole for fungus.
There's about eight others here.

107
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,427
You're treating me for everything.
You have no idea what I've got.

108
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,394
House thinks this is
the best course of action.

109
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,639
House is desperate.
House is never desperate.

110
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,433
Something we give you will work.

111
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,977
Yeah, we should start treating
all patients this way.

112
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,271
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

113
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,897
It's better than doing nothing.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,057
- Hello?
- I'm at the cop's place.

115
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,808
I need to retrace your steps.

116
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,686
You don't think the "treat him
for everything" approach is enough?

117
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,147
- Where did you start your search?
- The kitchen.

118
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,775
OK, well, tell me everything you did,
everything you touched.

119
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,235
If you went to the john,
I want to know when and why.

120
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,155
It started with samples
from the mold in his sink.

121
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,837
- What next?
- That's it. Then I left.

122
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,672
What do we do now?

123
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,508
Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.

124
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,301
Excellent plan.

125
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,613
Hey, Dad, it's Eric.

126
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,075
I'm not doing too good.

127
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,413
How's Foreman?

128
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,961
- You're accessing a webcam?
- Cuddy's shower.

129
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,964
Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I...

130
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,799
Is that your kitchen?

131
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,592
Well, obviously
I couldn't bring him here.

132
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,553
He's been exposed
to whatever Foreman's got.

133
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,014
You infected Steve? Why didn't you
just get a rat from the pet store?

134
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,560
Because I needed one
with a clean medical history.

135
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,021
Who knows what kind of antibiotics
they gave those rats?

136
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,525
So this is your plan, just sit here
and watch your rat all day?

137
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,402
It shouldn't take long.

138
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,239
I've got the AC blasting,
I soaked the floor of his cage.

139
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,616
As soon as he gets sick,
I do an autopsy.

140
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,909
As soon as he's dead.

141
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,915
Right after he gets sick, there's a good
chance he'll get hit in the head

142
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,665
with a cane-shaped object.

143
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,793
Normally you just use your patients
as lab rats.

144
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,838
It's a nice change.

145
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,469
First symptom is euphoria.

146
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,763
Well, how do you know
if a rat's euphoric?

147
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,309
He doesn't usually climb on
his water bottle like that, does he?

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,526
The seizures only seem to happen
when she's in her car seat.

149
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,529
She starts to rock and grunt.

150
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,699
- Is she responsive?
- No, no. It's like she's in a zone

151
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,286
and her abdominal muscles
become dystonic.

152
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,123
Big word.
Someone's been on the Interweb.

153
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,417
I looked up a few articles on epilepsy.

154
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,836
There's actually
some really great youth soccer leagues

155
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,464
that would cater
specifically to her special needs,

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,884
and I think it might explain why she's
been having a hard time in preschool.

157
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,554
Well, let's confirm your diagnosis
before you have her held back.

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,767
Strobing lights and high-pitched sounds
can provoke a seizure.

159
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,359
- You're a goof.
- Takes one to know one, loser.

160
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,320
Wait, that means I'm a loser.
Scratch that.

161
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,782
These episodes,
she gets sweaty afterwards?

162
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,367
Soaking wet.

163
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,787
And does she seem upset by them
or just tired?

164
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,872
No. She kind of thinks it's funny.

165
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:46,710
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating
and dystonia with concerned parents

166
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,713
and you get an amateur diagnosis
of epilepsy.

167
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,883
In actuality,
all your little girl is doing

168
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,594
is saying "yoo-hoo to the hoo-hoo."

169
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,555
- She's what?
- Marching the penguin.

170
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,517
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

171
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,894
Finding Nemo.

172
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,356
That was funny.

173
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,442
It's called "gratification disorder."
Sort of a misnomer.

174
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,362
If one was unable to gratify oneself,
that would be a disorder.

175
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,364
Are you saying she's masturbating?

176
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,242
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

177
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,328
- This is horrifying.
- Epilepsy is horrifying.

178
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,081
Teach your girl about privacy
and she'll be fine.

179
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

180
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,338
One afternoon,
and you're on pace to set the record

181
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,340
for most patients seen in a month.

182
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,067
You're upset that I'm doing
clinic hours?

183
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,977
Wow, that is so like rain
on your wedding day.

184
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,180
For the past three hours, I have been on
the phone with the CDC while you are...

185
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,747
- How's that going, by the way?
- They promised to expedite...

186
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,127
Tough to do an autopsy when
they haven't picked up the body.

187
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,855
It's tough to treat your patient
when you're not even on the same floor.

188
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,482
- Go. Clinic is covered.
- I watch the meds drip into his IV,

189
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,169
that'll make the treatment work faster?

190
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,838
Go to your office, play with your ball,

191
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,946
write on your white board,
insult your team.

192
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,490
Do whatever it is that you do
to figure things out.

193
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,535
Feeling guilty?
It's not too late to change your mind.

194
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,581
Go call the CDC,
tell them you were just joshing.

195
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,290
Keep avoiding Foreman's case
until he dies.

196
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,083
Then I'll drown in guilt.

197
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,836
Feeling any better?

198
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,631
- How are you doing?
- I'm not the patient.

199
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,759
Is your sed rate elevated?

200
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,137
No. So far, it looks like I lucked out.

201
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,642
Cameron, it looks like you left
the tourniquet on the bed.

202
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,398
- You can see again?
- The treatment's working.

203
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,735
The question is, which treatment?

204
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,614
We'll start weaning him off one at
a time. Which one do we start with?

205
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,366
I don't care if you do it
alphabetically.

206
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,732
Just stay on top of his vision.

207
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,386
First sign of regression means
we've taken him off the wrong one.

208
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,874
Latest blood work. Foreman's amylase and
lipase levels are three times normal.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,252
- The pancreas is failing.
- A toxic side effect of his meds.

210
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,825
Philosophical question:
How do you wanna die?

211
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,993
Old age.

212
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,289
Your choice is currently between 4 hours
from now and 14 hours from now.

213
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,257
So I'm assuming that means
you want the latter.

214
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,170
The cocktail's working.
My vision's almost completely restored.

215
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,507
The meds are curing what's in your head,
but they're trashing your pancreas.

216
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,301
That's why you're puking and you
can't stand up without screaming.

217
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,137
So lower the dosages.

218
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,806
Less stress on my pancreas,
still battle the infection.

219
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,725
- Lower dosages will still be toxic.
- I don't care!

220
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,812
I can handle the pain
of the pancreatitis.

221
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,606
I don't think you can handle life
without a pancreas.

222
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,529
If we keep you on these meds,

223
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,366
you'll spend the last four hours
of your life being able to see.

224
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,952
We take you off, you'll go blind again.

225
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,290
But it'll give us time to figure out
what's eating your brain.

226
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,422
Fine. What do we do next?

227
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,174
Eric?

228
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,304
Dad?

229
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,687
Yeah, you two can get caught up later.
Sir, I need you to come with me.

230
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,068
House, what is this?

231
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,031
He's not a "what," he's a "who."
They even have the right to vote now.

232
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,326
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

233
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,746
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
This is Foreman's dad.

234
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,164
Yeah, I got that.

235
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,500
And Dr. Cuddy here
is the Dean of Medicine.

236
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,752
Remember that cool autopsy
I was telling you about,

237
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,837
the one that would save your son's life?

238
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,964
She's the one who can give us
the green light to do it.

239
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,301
I understand you don't want them
to do it.

240
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,221
Dr. House didn't seem to know why.

241
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,061
Mr. Foreman, I am doing everything I can
to get the CDC...

242
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,855
Won't be soon enough.
...and my decision to follow

243
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,857
public health safety protocols...

244
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:23,153
Oh, don't blame the rules.
Don't hang this on policy and protocol.

245
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm well aware that
it may cost your son his life,

246
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,284
just as I am well aware that my decision
has a devastating effect

247
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,038
on family and friends, without
having them paraded in front of me.

248
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,416
Your son has an unknown,

249
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,086
contagious, deadly infection.

250
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,882
If we don't contain it here,
even more people could be at risk.

251
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,427
And I am capable of empathizing
with those people too,

252
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,763
without having them
paraded in front of me.

253
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,819
I understand.

254
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,879
What's wrong with your hand?

255
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,340
It's called a muscle contracture.

256
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,926
I thought this thing was in your brain.

257
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,929
It is. It just means
the infection's moved

258
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,765
to the primary motor cortex,
which controls the muscles.

259
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,894
Aren't you glad you sent me
to med school?

260
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,731
- Does it hurt?
- No.

261
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,066
Is it gonna?

262
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,529
The other guy...

263
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,325
he didn't seem to suffer too much.

264
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,118
He just went in his sleep.

265
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,341
Steve's still acting normal.
No sign of contractures.

266
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,720
They got the cop's body
in a locked, airtight bag.

267
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:16,058
And a guard on the door.
Those feds are seriously paranoid.

268
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,644
He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours.
He's due.

269
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,355
You haven't sprinkled
Senokot granules on his donut?

270
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,231
His bowels would open up
like the Red Sea.

271
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,524
He wouldn't eat the donut.

272
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,362
Have you seriously
been down here for hours?

273
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,571
No.

274
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,115
I had to pee a couple times.

275
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,326
You've got to stop
blaming Cuddy for this.

276
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,452
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

277
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
That part is her fault.

278
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,374
The part where somebody
wasted his time in the basement

279
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,210
plotting the overthrow of a government
agency, that one's on you.

280
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,838
Only thing I can do is think.
You can pretty much do that anywhere.

281
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,757
As long as no one's bugging me.

282
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,887
Did you call your brother?

283
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,597
No.

284
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,643
- Did you?
- No.

285
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,438
It's not a big deal.

286
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
I sure would have liked to see Mom,
though.

287
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,407
You know she can't travel anymore.

288
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,576
You tell her?

289
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,204
Why?

290
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,749
Just upset her for a while.

291
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,255
Then she wouldn't remember for a while.

292
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,053
She should know.

293
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,558
She's lost a lot of who she was.

294
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,898
She can't deal with something like this.

295
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,444
And you can?

296
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:58,410
I still know you're going
to a better place.

297
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,417
It's easy for you, isn't it?

298
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:11,757
As long as you believe I'm going
to a better place, dying ain't so bad.

299
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,219
I don't want you to be afraid.

300
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,808
If I'm not afraid of dying, what
the hell should I be afraid of, Dad?

301
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,897
I thought you believed.

302
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,816
I did.

303
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm not so sure anymore.

304
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,454
I'm going to pray for you, Son.

305
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,876
I suggest you do the same.

306
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,763
Field of vision is regressing and
he's reached an eight on the pain scale.

307
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,224
The disease pattern is following
the exact course as Joe's.

308
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,017
Only it's moving much faster in Foreman.

309
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,938
Good. It's an anomaly.
Anomalies tell us things.

310
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,232
Why would this go faster in Foreman?
What's different?

311
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,359
Could be a different strain
of the same disease?

312
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,166
Right! We were wasting all this time
looking for an unknown disease.

313
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,996
We should have be looking for a
different strain of an unknown disease.

314
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,284
Joe's a cop. He's into physical fitness.

315
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,996
He could have had a more powerful
immune system, stronger metabolism.

316
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,539
Foreman's black.

317
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,625
What? How long have you been
sitting on this information?

318
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,005
Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis,
hypertension, diabetes, stop me anytime,

319
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,173
they all affect black people
more than whites.

320
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,592
Check everything.

321
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,094
Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites.

322
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,680
Look for anything
with a documented racial disparity.

323
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,226
Wait.

324
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,438
- The rat's showing symptoms?
- No.

325
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,232
He's completely healthy.

326
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,527
Maybe that's the difference
between Foreman and the cop.

327
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,284
How you feeling?

328
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,870
Why are you here?

329
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,748
Because you're a friend,
and I should be here.

330
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:58,214
I'm sorry House used my dad
to try and manipulate you.

331
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,301
You've got integrity.
You aren't going to change your mind

332
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,887
just because you're confronted
by my father.

333
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:04,971
Thank you.

334
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,515
Just like I'm not gonna forgive you,

335
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,518
just because you come by here
and ask how I'm feeling.

336
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,064
- You know I've had no choice.
- Of course you had a choice!

337
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,815
Regulations are clear.

338
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,277
And the punishment
for violating those regulations,

339
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,696
is it death? Hmm?

340
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,451
Because frankly, I'm OK
if you get a fine, a suspension...

341
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:31,748
Hell, you can spend a couple years
in jail if it saves my life!

342
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,252
- You're dying too fast.
- Couldn't agree more.

343
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,005
Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?

344
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,633
What's that?

345
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,719
Legionella... Legionella pneumophilia.

346
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,223
And why are you carrying
a vial of it around with you?

347
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,892
Foreman was perfectly healthy
before he got this infection,

348
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,687
but our cop wasn't.
He had Legionnaire's disease,

349
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,273
and our cop didn't turn into brain food
until we cured the Legionella.

350
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,901
The Legionella slowed down the disease.

351
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,903
Why would that happen?

352
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,905
No idea. I just know that it did.

353
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,824
So you want to infect Foreman?

354
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,617
You gonna tattle to the CDC?

355
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,370
The meds can't help me,
but a disease can?

356
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,872
Forget it. Just take the pain away.
Put me under.

357
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,500
If I put you under,
I can't monitor your pain.

358
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,503
If I can't monitor your pain, I won't
know if the Legionella's working.

359
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,006
I'm not consenting to you giving me...

360
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,591
- What was that?
- Hmm.

361
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,295
Wish there could have been
a puff of smoke or something.

362
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,222
Would have been much more dramatic.

363
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,641
Keep your slippers on.

364
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,436
Wouldn't want you to cut your foot.

365
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,816
You feeling any better?

366
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,278
I can't breathe. I'm dizzy
and I can barely hear anything

367
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,989
- over the sounds of my lungs crackling.
- That's the Legionella.

368
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,867
Oh, you figured that out
from the symptoms

369
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,713
or from the vial of stuff
tossed in my room?

370
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,705
I'm trying to be professional here,
and there's no reason to be nasty.

371
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,290
- I'm in pain.
- So is House.

372
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,624
And he's a delight.

373
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,085
He doesn't try to kill his colleagues.

374
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,379
You can remove the thermometer now.

375
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,973
It's down almost a whole degree.
How's the pain?

376
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,434
Great. It's the good kind.

377
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,103
How bad is it compared to an hour ago?

378
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,814
No worse.

379
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,366
Is the Legionella helping?

380
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,953
Yeah.

381
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,289
- Good.
- But not great.

382
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,750
It didn't fix anything,
it just slowed it down.

383
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,436
The whole point was to give Steve
a little more time to get sick.

384
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,963
What are you gonna do
if he never gets sick?

385
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,966
Brilliant.

386
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:53,014
Cameron, what type of illnesses
affect humans but not rats?

387
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,849
Why are you asking me that?

388
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,310
Because I'm sure that you spent
the first 12 years of your life

389
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,230
dreaming of being a vet.
The rat is not getting sick.

390
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,190
- Cameron is not getting sick.
- Sorry.

391
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,109
It's OK, it's not your fault.

392
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,612
Presumably, you're still healthy because
whatever it is, it's not blood-borne.

393
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,989
Steve has no excuse.
He did everything that Foreman did.

394
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,575
Some bacterial infections
don't affect rats.

395
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,828
Foreman tested negative
for every bacterial infection

396
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,038
- that would affect his brain.
- And what infections

397
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,416
could he be positive for
but test negative for?

398
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,170
When we test for infections,
we look for antibodies.

399
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,382
Now, what if the patient is infected
but has no antibodies?

400
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,384
What if the body
is not fighting the infection?

401
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,095
- Why would...
- I asked first.

402
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,621
Let's start with the "what."
We'll deal with the "why" later.

403
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,643
If the body doesn't recognize the
infection, our tests come back negative,

404
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,769
and the disease rampages
through the body unstopped.

405
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,730
Exactly like the cop
and exactly like Foreman.

406
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,733
Now, what if the patient was then
exposed to a second infection,

407
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,444
like Legionella? The body
would recognize that infection,

408
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:51,051
increase the white count,
send in the troops to start fighting,

409
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,658
and the initial infection
would get caught in the crossfire.

410
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,494
So the question becomes
what type of bacterial infection

411
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,079
affects humans but not rats,

412
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,540
and the human body
would be unlikely to recognize?

413
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,877
The answer is listeria.

414
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,004
I'm starting you on amp and gent.

415
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,299
So, you're basing this theory
on the tests being negative

416
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,884
and your rat being healthy?

417
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,969
And the fact that
Legionnaire's is helping you.

418
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,514
But the medicine you want to give me
will put an end to that.

419
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,682
Yeah.

420
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,185
And if it's not listeria,
all the gent will do

421
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,020
is cure the Legionnaire's disease

422
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,606
and put whatever is killing me
back into overdrive.

423
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,067
Stop asking me questions
based on the premise that I'm wrong.

424
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,657
The antibiotics are in the airlock.

425
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,830
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer

426
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,540
because you didn't go deep enough.

427
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,545
I want you to do
a white matter brain biopsy.

428
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,547
Absolutely. Don't blame you.

429
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,009
The world is such a complicated place
if you've got higher reasoning skills.

430
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,346
I'm often jealous of small animals
and retarded children.

431
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,889
Take the antibiotics.

432
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,851
There can be minimal damage
if it's done right,

433
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,145
if the surgeons drill
where I tell them to drill.

434
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,065
One slip, you could spend
the rest of your life not being able

435
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,652
- to keep your drool in your mouth.
- I'd rather be disabled than dead.

436
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,570
Sure! I make it look oh-so-sexy.

437
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,697
It's actually not as glamorous
as you might think.

438
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,617
The biopsy will tell us for sure
what's wrong.

439
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,744
The antibiotics could do the same thing!

440
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,330
- "Could," not "will."
- We try it, we see.

441
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,083
The antibiotics
will bring back the pain!

442
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,927
Pain makes us make bad decisions.

443
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,725
Fear of pain
is almost as big a motivator.

444
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,355
Look, we still have time.

445
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,777
I will do that biopsy if I have to.
But not a moment before.

446
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,049
Start Foreman on IV antibiotics.
Where's his dad?

447
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,510
Where you're supposed to be
when your son is dying.

448
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,221
- He's not with him.
- He's in the chapel.

449
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,889
Oh, man...

450
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,229
I started your son on
a new course of treatment.

451
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,441
If it works, he'll get better.

452
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,484
If it doesn't, he won't.

453
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,031
While he's not getting better,

454
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,825
he's going to experience so much pain

455
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,536
that we'll have to put him
in a chemically-induced coma

456
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,788
while we figure out what to do next.

457
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,750
My son says
you're a manipulative bastard.

458
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,337
It's a pet name. I call him "Dr. Bling."

459
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,549
I assume you're here for a reason.
What do you want from me?

460
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,636
When your son is in a coma...

461
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,640
you're the one who's gonna have to
make the medical decisions for him.

462
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,476
Whatever you decide is fine.

463
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:12,148
- You don't care what I do?
- I'm not a doctor. What do I know,

464
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,192
except what Eric tells me?

465
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,780
He says you're the best doctor
he's ever worked with.

466
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,421
I need your help.

467
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,267
There's nothing I can give you
for the pain.

468
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,716
I want to be put out.

469
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,522
I can have a nurse in here
in five minutes.

470
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,261
No.

471
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,598
Once I'm out, I might not come back.

472
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,643
I've never done a will.

473
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,522
I'll call a lawyer for you.

474
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,608
I want you to be my medical proxy.

475
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:01,364
All the things that piss me off
about you in House's office,

476
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,200
you're too emotional and too caring,
too cautious...

477
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,577
They're all good things on this floor.

478
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,873
- Your dad is...
- No.

479
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,917
- He cares about you.
- So do you.

480
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,919
I can't do this.

481
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,842
We expect family members to make
decisions about their loved ones

482
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,970
after a ten-minute briefing,
that we're agonizing over

483
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,013
even with years of medical experience.

484
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,016
That's from my article.

485
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,188
I'm sorry, Allison.

486
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,359
I shouldn't have stolen your article.
I shouldn't have exposed you.

487
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,486
You were a friend.

488
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,822
I need to know that we're OK.

489
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,290
No.

490
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,084
I'll be your proxy, but we're not OK.

491
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,505
You're scared you're dying
and it's the only reason

492
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,340
you want to set things right.

493
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,595
We're gonna get you better first
and then...

494
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,891
if you still wanna apologize,
I'll be around.

495
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,728
I'll call that lawyer.

496
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,829
- Any improvements?
- No. As far as we can tell,

497
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,749
the only thing the antibiotics
are treating is the Legionella.

498
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,001
I think we need to consider
alternate theories.

499
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,128
- Like what?
- We do the biopsy. We...

500
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,255
Give the antibiotics more time.

501
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,008
There is no more time.
The pain is almost unbearable already.

502
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,720
So he's almost in unbearable pain.
He's not almost dead!

503
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,598
Which means we have more time.

504
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,108
Mr. Foreman?

505
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,365
We need to put your son in a coma.

506
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,536
You should be there.

507
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,580
It's a medical procedure, right?

508
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,582
Yeah.

509
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,836
But once we put him out,
if we don't solve this...

510
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,173
he won't wake up.

511
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,552
What should I say?

512
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:32,139
Should I talk to him
like it's going to be OK?

513
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,602
Or should I be saying goodbye?

514
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,649
I need to know what people say when...

515
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,234
Just tell him you love him.

516
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,678
- Hey, Son.
- Hey, Dad.

517
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,391
It's going to be OK.

518
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,186
You don't know that.

519
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,691
I know.

520
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,320
You don't.

521
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,623
I don't wanna miss you.

522
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,960
I love you too, Dad.

523
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,472
Hey.

524
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,017
It's gonna be OK.

525
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,231
- Can we do this now?
- Yeah, of course.

526
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,247
I accept your apology.

527
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,564
Why weren't you with Foreman?

528
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,860
I hang out in the basement, you rag on
me. I stay in my office, you rag on me.

529
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,488
- Honky just can't buy a break.
- Do the biopsy.

530
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,826
Based on the cop's progression, I figure
he's got about another four hours...

531
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,285
You figure?

532
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,664
You're playing Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

533
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,083
No. Cutting open his head
is what's dangerous.

534
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,919
Oh, it's dangerous.
Well, what would people think?

535
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,797
The reason you don't see patients
is because if you know them,

536
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,507
- you'll give a crap.
- I know you.

537
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,843
If you give a crap,
you stop making outrageous calls.

538
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,210
If this was any other patient,
you'd have damned the risk

539
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,972
and cut their head open a long time ago.

540
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,974
He's out.
The EEG shows he's still in pain.

541
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,941
The antibiotics have had
more than enough time.

542
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,227
We're doing the brain biopsy.

543
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,594
Not unless you people can't come up
with something clever

544
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,482
- in the next three hours.
- Now. We're doing it now.

545
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,193
- Well, who died and made you boss?
- Foreman.

546
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,955
- It's legal.
- He's out of his mind.

547
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,791
Yesterday he was giggling
about a hole in a guy's head.

548
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,545
Then hire a lawyer and challenge it.
In the meantime, Cameron's in charge.

549
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,048
- Why would he sign that?
- It's nothing personal, Mr. Foreman.

550
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:57,803
My son doesn't trust me.
How exactly is that not personal?

551
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,306
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,434
You're sorry?
You're talking about this man's son!

553
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,021
- You're denying him the right to be...
- Oh, shut up, House.

554
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,316
If you want to do the biopsy,
do the biopsy.

555
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,611
If House tries to interfere, let me know
and I will take care of it.

556
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,529
Yeah, you're a hero.
If it wasn't for you,

557
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,784
we'd be cutting into a dead guy's
head instead of Foreman's.

558
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,038
Sorry. Thanks.

559
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,668
- That was great!
- It was rude and unnecessary.

560
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,796
- Yeah.
- Go away.

561
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,423
- Give me time.
- We're out of time.

562
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,592
- An hour.
- What does "out of time" mean?

563
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,427
His O2 sats are at 94 right now.

564
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,472
As long as they're above 90, danger of
fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.

565
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,350
So what? There's no point in waiting.

566
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,811
You were right. We should be cutting
into a corpse's head.

567
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,189
Yeah, we should be, except the CDC's
got the cop's body under...

568
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,941
There's got to be other bodies.

569
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,151
You think this thing
has killed other people?

570
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,402
No.

571
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,199
That apartment was a dump. Just
because Steve McQueen didn't get sick

572
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,869
doesn't mean some other vermin didn't.
You give me an hour, I go back there,

573
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,498
I find a dead animal, I cut its head
open instead of Foreman's.

574
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,792
Foreman's already on 100% oxygen.

575
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,381
Once his O2 sats hit 90,
I can't wait any longer.

576
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,844
Where's your suit?

577
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:26,600
Either you'll find the answer or I'll
find the answer. It doesn't matter.

578
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,189
Prep the drill. We've got to be
ready to go if we get the signal.

579
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,229
- Ninety-two.
- I found a blind bird.

580
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,648
Great. How fast can you get it in here?

581
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,401
I'll know in about 30 seconds.

582
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,286
You better have the bird.
The surgical team's in place.

583
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,665
- I screwed up.
- How can you not capture a blind bird?

584
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,960
That's not what I meant. I screwed up
the first time through this place.

585
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:19,004
Foreman told you everywhere he went.
It's not "where," it's "when."

586
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,131
He came here early afternoon.

587
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,510
Me and Steve came through two hours
too late. You were six hours early.

588
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,762
It's the water. The irrigation system
only pumps at...

589
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,723
House! I tested the water!
The water's clean.

590
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,185
- House.
- We tested the wrong water.

591
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,915
He stole cable, he stole fertilizer
and he stole water.

592
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,169
- It's riddled with Naegleria.
- I know.

593
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,756
You already did the biopsy.

594
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,176
I thought I had no choice.

595
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,315
How's my son?

596
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,444
He has primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis.

597
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,988
It's a parasite
that goes through the nose

598
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,116
and migrates into the brain,
where it feeds on brain cells.

599
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,579
The Legionella attacked the parasite.
That's why the disease slowed down.

600
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,583
- Is it treatable?
- We started him on an antiparasitic

601
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,669
and the amoebas
will clear out of his system.

602
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,964
And he'll be OK?

603
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,426
Then we'll wean him out of the coma...

604
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,428
Will he be OK?

605
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,975
There'll be no lasting damage
from the parasite.

606
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,979
But the surgery?

607
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,151
We don't know.

608
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,862
Up and at 'em.

609
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,074
How you feeling?

610
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,952
Can you talk?

611
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,373
I don't feel anything.

612
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,209
Are you numb?

613
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,088
No, I mean...

614
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,841
I don't feel any pain.

615
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,055
Keep your head still. Follow my finger.

616
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,686
- I'm OK.
- Your breath stinks,

617
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,190
and you're peeing into a bag.
What are our names?

618
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,111
You did the biopsy?

619
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:15,073
- Thank you.
- Names?

620
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,826
Cameron.

621
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,494
My dad

622
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,914
and the manipulative bastard.

623
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,790
You remembered.

624
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,753
- How you doing, Dad?
- Great.

625
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,215
Relieved. Great.

626
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,635
What did I have?

627
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,888
Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba,

628
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,224
the CDC autopsy
eventually found the amoeba,

629
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,101
and House found it in the water
on the cop's roof.

630
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,439
- Wiggle your left toes.
- Wait. What?

631
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,193
- You went back and she did the biopsy?
- Your left toes, Foreman.

632
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,488
I just did.

633
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,991
No, you didn't.

634
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,579
- He can't move his toes.
- He can move them.

635
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,040
Raise your right arm.

636
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,877
What?
