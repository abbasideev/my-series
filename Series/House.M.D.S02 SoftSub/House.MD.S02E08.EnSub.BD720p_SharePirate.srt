1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,877
Welcome to
the world of illusion!

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,797
What is real and what is magic?

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,799
This is what you will wonder

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,386
as I perform feats
that will astound you!

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,138
As you see,
there is nothing up my sleeve.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,141
And this hat,
it's just an ordinary old hat.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,436
Watch, as I wave
three times above the hat,

8
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,023
and whisper the magic words.
And now...

9
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,779
Mom, it's not working!
It's ripped!

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,506
It's okay, baby,
it's just a little tear.

11
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,325
- Hurry up, Mom!
- What are you so worried about?

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,453
- Sally's gonna make fun of us.
- Sally Ayerson?

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,250
She said her mom bought her dress at
Bloomingdale's and you had to make ours.

14
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,168
We're gonna look stupid.

15
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,797
Do you girls remember that music
we were listening to yesterday?

16
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,258
- That lady who sang about respect?
- Reetha?

17
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,926
Aretha, that's right.

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,293
Do you think she had lots of
money growing up in Detroit?

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,180
- What's Detroit?
- It's a city.

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,726
The point is, is that she's
one of the best singers ever.

21
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,728
If Sally's mean to you again,

22
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,272
I'm just gonna have to key
her daddy's new convertible.

23
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,607
Great. And thank you!

24
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,484
Do you know what that means?

25
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,111
Good.

26
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,171
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,048
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

28
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:36,637
Little-bitty, pretty one
Come on and talk to me.

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:42,268
Lovey-dovey, dovey one
Come on sit down on my knee.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,230
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,559
You speak to Chase and House yet?
The disciplinary hearing.

33
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,450
The McGinley case,
that's not for two weeks.

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,701
Tomorrow.

35
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,161
Scheduling disaster,
you don't wanna hear it.

36
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,871
You gotta get the boys' okay
to move the hearing up,

37
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,040
and you gotta do that
whole legal advice thing.

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,501
- Can you ask someone else?
- I'm asking you.

39
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,088
Let me work with Chase.
House should have separate counsel.

40
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,006
Stop looking for
whatever you're looking for.

41
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,217
For the last month,
House has been crowing

42
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,136
that you can't work with him because
you're just swooning in love.

43
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,390
There is nothing approaching love
in what I feel about him right now.

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,893
Well, if you can't work with him,
it amounts to the same thing.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,522
We had a fight. It's awkward.
Why not use another lawyer?

46
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,650
Because 40% of our lawsuits
last year were about House.

47
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,653
If you can't work with him,
you can't work here.

48
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,947
She's overreacting.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,951
You snuck into her shrink's
office and read her private file.

50
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,078
When Nixon did that,
he got impeached.

51
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,124
So you're saying I'm not allowed to
have oral sex with an intern, either?

52
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,835
Yes! And yes.

53
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,881
That file got me on the floor of her
attic with her pouring out her soul.

54
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,592
The only thing I did
wrong was get caught.

55
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,720
Where's Chase?

56
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,223
He's too busy to service you
until after work.

57
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,726
I got a couple minutes, though.

58
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,561
Feel free to say
something like,

59
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,855
"What'll we do
with the time left over?"

60
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,649
Or you could just stew,
that works as well.

61
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,443
She stews before
she gets violent.

62
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,195
This one says you're okay with moving
the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow.

63
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,240
This one says I've advised
you of your legal rights.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,660
- Any legal rights I should know about?
- Nope.

65
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,622
Great.

66
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,625
And you thought
this was gonna be awkward.

67
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,752
You shouldn't sign it.

68
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,712
Postponing is almost always
the smart thing to do.

69
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,089
Tempers cool, memories fade.

70
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,258
They rule on me,
it's done, right?

71
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,677
- Yeah, but...
- Then let's get it over with.

72
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,555
- Ever done a peer review before?
- No.

73
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,723
Good.

74
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,768
Peer's a misnomer.
These are your bosses.

75
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,687
This could cost you
some money, some privileges

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,940
or it could cost
you your career.

77
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,067
All I can tell them is
what happened.

78
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,777
There is an objective reality
to what happened,

79
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,112
and that committee is
never gonna know it.

80
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,323
All they're gonna know is
what they picture happened,

81
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,785
which depends a little on what
you tell them and a whole lot

82
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,079
on how you tell them.

83
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,498
May 11.

84
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,001
- The patient presented to the clinic.
- What's her name?

85
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,253
- It's in the file.
- Do you know it?

86
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,713
Then use it.

87
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,052
Kayla presented to the clinic with
multiple joint and stomach pain.

88
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,097
Dr. Foreman was called in
for a neurological consult.

89
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,598
What's the point of this, man?

90
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,142
Checking your sister's
cerebral coordination.

91
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,645
The thing is in her leg
and her stomach.

92
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,065
Wait in the clinic for six hours
so she can play patty cake?

93
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,859
You could have gone
to the ER last night.

94
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,696
You gonna come over
and baby-sit her kids?

95
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,615
Okay. Patient comes from
a family of jerks, I get it.

96
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,617
Can you stick to the medicine?

97
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,703
Something wrong?

98
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,122
- There was some uveitis.
- Meaning?

99
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,250
Her iris, the colored part
of her eye, was inflamed.

100
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,961
- Meaning?
- Worst case, blindness.

101
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,672
But there was an upside.

102
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,008
It was weird enough
to get House interested.

103
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,094
Young woman, joint pain,
gonorrhea's a possibility.

104
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,763
It's polyarticular.
Maybe rheumatoid.

105
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,809
That's typically small joints,
this hit her knee.

106
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,684
Takayasu's arteritis.

107
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,479
Get a sed rate and serologies.

108
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,357
"Childproof."

109
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,401
How many kids are
hopped up on Vicodin?

110
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,779
- Give me.
- Right. Like I'd ever get it back.

111
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,531
Chase?

112
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,075
Don't care about the Vicodin.

113
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,911
Might not just be her arteries,
could be all her blood vessels.

114
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,706
Vasculitis, with stomach
pains, so Behcet's.

115
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,500
- No, she'd have oral sores.
- Or genital.

116
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,544
Go find them.

117
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,507
I thought she was Foreman's patient.
Why did you do the exam?

118
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,802
- She'd have oral sores.
- Or genital.

119
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,471
Go find them.

120
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,520
Whoa, whoa, Foreman.

121
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,898
Chase can handle the pelvic.

122
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,068
Any pain?

123
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,236
Is it bad?

124
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,407
This would go a lot easier
if you talked to me.

125
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,368
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,788
I, um...

127
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,457
I just really hate hospitals.

128
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,043
When I was 12,
I had my tonsils out.

129
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,254
Got to skip school, lots of ice cream,
made me wanna be a doctor.

130
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,758
My mom died when I was eight,

131
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,637
so I spent months
at Princeton General.

132
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,850
She died of DTs, your mom?

133
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,646
Bottles stashed around the house?
Mood swings? That whole deal?

134
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,856
- You've been there?
- My mom.

135
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,193
Dad left,
Mom crawled inside a bottle.

136
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,529
Made for a great
year 12 of high school.

137
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,365
You okay with your dad now?

138
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,534
No.

139
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,329
Does your dad have anything
to do with this story?

140
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,789
No, it's just...

141
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,404
Okay, I get it, the two
of you bonded, which

142
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,917
is probably why you
haven't been sued.

143
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,794
Patients never sue
doctors they like.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,296
But keep it brief, okay? The
panel doesn't like to think

145
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,258
they're being manipulated when
they're being manipulated.

146
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,884
She had some ulceration.

147
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,845
Confirming Behcet's.

148
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,391
I gave her some prednisone, an antacid,
and I ran a pathergy test on her arm.

149
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,476
Takes 24 hours to confirm.

150
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,353
Told her any doctor
could check it out.

151
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,647
- You didn't make an appointment.
- Nope.

152
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,065
She just showed up.

153
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,611
- Dr. Chase?
- Hi.

154
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,781
All right, let's take a look.

155
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,787
Okay, those little pustules
mean it's positive.

156
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,791
Talk to Nurse Preven, get an appointment
with Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

157
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,794
Behcet's is very treatable,
you're gonna be fine.

158
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,796
Okay. Thanks.

159
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,049
And you were just chatting
on the phone with someone

160
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,676
and she happened
to run into you.

161
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,642
That's what happened.

162
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,013
No appointment,
no real examination?

163
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,681
Just gave her the test results.

164
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,017
So, lower standard of care,

165
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,686
you really couldn't be expected to
notice there was anything else wrong.

166
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,022
We didn't even go
into an exam room.

167
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:52,198
As your lawyer, I can't stop you from
lying, I can't even be in the room.

168
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,492
But I would be remiss if I
didn't prep you to lie better.

169
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,581
You wrote her a prescription, which
means there was an examination.

170
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,082
What really happened?

171
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,335
I was on the phone.

172
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,049
Dr. Chase? Hi.

173
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,759
Hi.

174
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,595
Kayla. I'm here
for the test. My arm.

175
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,597
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,599
Okay.

177
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,517
It's positive.

178
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:24,688
Talk to Nurse Preven, get an appointment
with Dr. Brustin in Rheumatology.

179
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,735
I took that medicine you gave
me, but my stomach still hurts.

180
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,698
Behcet's could be
stronger than we thought,

181
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,576
or it could be reflux
from the prednisone.

182
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,496
Here's a stronger antacid.

183
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,666
- Doctor?
- Yes?

184
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,086
Nothing.

185
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,007
You didn't ask her anything
about the stomach pain?

186
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,386
I made one little mistake.

187
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,389
As little mistakes go,
that was a biggie.

188
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,938
She's only advising Chase?
Not you?

189
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,108
Well, what's the committee gonna do to me?
I never even met this patient.

190
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,818
Your disdain for
human interaction

191
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,945
doesn't exculpate you,
it inculpates you.

192
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,489
You signed the charts, you're
responsible for everything Chase does.

193
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,074
Which is why
this doesn't matter.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,784
She protects Chase,
she protects me.

195
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,621
Unless her advice to Chase is
to make a deal and give you up.

196
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,042
"I'm so sorry, if only
Dr. House had paid attention.

197
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,962
He never even met her,
he never does."

198
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,423
Chase loves me.
And isn't Turkish.

199
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,426
Cameron loves you,
Chase loves his job.

200
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,678
You really think
Stacy hates me that much?

201
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,973
I think right now she hates
you more than enough.

202
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,393
You think emotion only
affects doctors' judgments?

203
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,482
Everything stemmed
from that one interaction.

204
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,768
They're gonna slam you on it.

205
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,474
Were you distracted? Your problem.
Overworked?

206
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,112
That's their problem.

207
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,363
Forgeftul, yours, lazy...

208
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,409
I just figured the stomach
pain was the Behcet's.

209
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,742
Any doctor would have
thought the same.

210
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,203
Then why did you call her an
hour after she left the clinic?

211
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,081
Nurse Preven said you asked her
to have Kayla come back in.

212
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,085
The way she hesitated, I thought she
might have had a doorknob question.

213
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,296
Patient comes in,

214
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,299
says he's got a sniffly nose, you
examine him for 10 minutes, right?

215
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,065
Then you're leaving,
hand on the doorknob,

216
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,429
and he says, "Oh, yeah, and
my penis has turned green".

217
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,848
Embarrassing question, the only important
one, patient saves it for last.

218
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,518
So you knew she was about to ask
the most important question

219
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,853
and you left.

220
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,773
No, I didn't.
I figured it out later.

221
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,149
What changed?

222
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,360
- Nothing.
- Bad answer.

223
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,321
- I wasn't thinking clearly at first.
- Worse answer.

224
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,115
So what was her
doorknob question?

225
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,701
I figured it might be
blood in her stool,

226
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,537
which could indicate
a bleeding ulcer.

227
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,580
Talk to me.

228
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,832
Thirty-five year old female,
vomiting massive amounts of blood,

229
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,044
LOC at work, BP 80
over 20, heart rate 140.

230
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,003
You push fluids?

231
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,589
Three liters in the field, and we're
bolusing another one right now.

232
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,216
It's gotta be
a bleeding ulcer, Doc.

233
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,469
Her coworkers said she's been
eating ibuprofens like candy.

234
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,429
I thought she had Behcet's!

235
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,848
One, two, three.

236
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,574
I'm in the stomach.

237
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,284
There's too much blood,
I can't see.

238
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,578
- Did she burst an artery?
- No.

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,997
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

240
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,124
Cauterizing.

241
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,668
- I can't see, use some more saline.
- Hold on.

242
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,794
Okay.

243
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,590
Looks good.
Bleeding ulcer. We got it.

244
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,467
She was fine two hours ago.

245
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,261
Systolic BP 70.

246
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,555
Where's the ulcer?
It's brown, I cauterized it.

247
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,223
There must be something else.

248
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,349
There.

249
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,644
- A second ulcer?
- Not anymore. It perforated.

250
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,646
Get her to an OR!

251
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,691
The surgeons were able to
suture the perforation.

252
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,610
But the contents
of the patient's,

253
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,780
Kayla's, stomach had
spilled into her body.

254
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,615
She got septic.

255
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
Then the infection
lowers her blood pressure...

256
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,661
Fifty over palp at one point.

257
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,038
It damaged her liver
and kidneys.

258
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,625
Listen, I know this looks bad.

259
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,502
I obviously got
the diagnosis wrong,

260
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,421
but I did everything
by the book.

261
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,965
I couldn't have known
what was gonna happen.

262
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,552
If I skip my coffee, I get cranky.
Do you want anything?

263
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,521
Why did Chase screw up?

264
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,483
He forgot to ask a question,
does there need to be a reason?

265
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,817
It might help him.

266
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,154
As far as I'm concerned, he made
a little mistake. It happens.

267
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,363
How far are you concerned?

268
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,282
You think I'm biased?

269
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,410
You're colleagues. You worked
together for over a year.

270
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,579
And everyone says
you slept together.

271
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,498
Who says?

272
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,917
The correct answer is, "We're not
involved and I'm not biased".

273
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,045
We're not involved, and I
don't know why he messed up.

274
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,298
House has worked with him
longer than I have.

275
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,050
You should talk to House.

276
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,844
Yeah.

277
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,180
Why did Chase screw up?

278
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,724
Because he doesn't give
a crap about patients.

279
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,476
Well, he always gets
positive patient reviews.

280
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,103
Yeah. He smiles
all 84 of his teeth,

281
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,522
tells them his tonsil story...

282
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,316
- It's a nice story.
- He still has his tonsils!

283
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,563
As soon as he's out of the room, which
is as soon as he can be out of the room,

284
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,363
he starts in on
the trash talking.

285
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,823
He thinks not giving a crap
makes him like House.

286
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,034
Like it's something
to aspire to.

287
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,578
Am I gonna have to testify?

288
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,206
I won't be encouraging
them to call you.

289
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,499
What did House say?

290
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,467
- Two months like this.
- Let me guess, no insurance.

291
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,512
You've just heard about the free clinic.
It's a good move.

292
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,975
You don't wanna skimp on the essentials
like wristwatches, MP3 players.

293
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,143
I need to talk to you.

294
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,312
- From the doorway?
- It's confidential.

295
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,273
Cool. I love gossip.

296
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,527
You hear that crackling sound?

297
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,487
Like crumpling up paper?

298
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,574
Keep listening,
let me know if it changes.

299
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,585
Two questions.

300
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,296
Why did Chase screw up,
and how bad was it?

301
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,424
Wow. Talk about efficient,
I only need one answer.

302
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,676
- Chase didn't screw up.
- He said he did.

303
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,637
Well, I'm not a lawyer, but that
seems like a sucky legal strategy.

304
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,557
They're gonna wanna know what you think
a reasonable doctor would have done

305
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,641
in Chase's position.

306
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,102
If I thought he was a reasonable
doctor, I wouldn't have hired him.

307
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,854
God, you two are
a couple of geniuses.

308
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,107
Deny everything, completely fool the
lawyer who's trying to help you.

309
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,485
Too bad the review committee
members are actually doctors.

310
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,362
Stacy.

311
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,409
I'm in the stomach.

312
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,536
There's too much blood,
I can't see.

313
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,413
- Did she burst an artery?
- No.

314
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,416
There. Bubbling.
Just a bad ulcer.

315
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,419
Okay. Cauterizing.

316
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,881
- Looks good.
- Bleeding ulcer. We got it.

317
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,507
She was fine two hours ago.

318
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,260
If by "fine", you mean
she had fountains of blood

319
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,305
spurting out of every orifice,
then yeah, I believe you.

320
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,892
I'm guessing those are
celebratory bells.

321
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,435
Systolic BP 70.

322
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,478
Show me the ulcer.

323
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,896
It's brown, I cauterized it.

324
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,357
Sweep back.
Show me the whole stomach.

325
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,276
Stop.

326
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,238
- A second ulcer?
- Not anymore. It perforated.

327
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,366
Get her to an OR!

328
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,451
Let's go.

329
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,790
She was not "fine"
two hours ago.

330
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,793
- Did she mention stomach pain?
- Yeah, so I gave her a stronger...

331
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,629
- You didn't do an exam.
- She just came in for a follow-up.

332
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,381
The results of
the pathergy test...

333
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,965
Did you listen to her stomach?

334
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,050
Check her vitals?

335
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,427
Maybe if she'd said something
about taking ibuprofen,

336
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,429
- mentioned the rectal bleeding...
- Yeah!

337
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,848
Why didn't she go to
med school like you did?

338
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,768
Diarrhea, blood in the stool,
these are routine questions!

339
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,228
That doctors skip all the time!

340
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,605
It was a minor mistake, I couldn't
have known this was gonna happen...

341
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,941
Mistakes are as serious
as the results they cause!

342
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,987
This woman could die because you were
too lazy to ask one simple question!

343
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,946
No, she might die because I had

344
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,989
the bad luck to spill
your damn Vicodin pills!

345
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,909
I responded with a number
of trenchant remarks

346
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,829
which made Chase cry, none of
which I'm gonna testify about.

347
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,331
Unless you convince
Chase to roll on me.

348
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,502
Excuse me. Testify about what?

349
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,006
Chuck.

350
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,467
I'm gonna break from the
parable of the wicked doctor

351
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,972
and tell a little story about a
patient, let's call him Buck.

352
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,475
Who has low O2 sats
and crackling lung sounds.

353
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,435
Like I have.

354
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,813
Buck has idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

355
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,274
His lung tissue's
turning to rock.

356
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,609
There's no known cause,
no treatment.

357
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,320
- He is slowly suffocating.
- You're talking about me?

358
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,115
Lung transplant's
about $500,000,

359
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,802
but this poor sucker's
got no insurance.

360
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,287
If he tried to sign up now, he'd be
excluded, preexisting condition.

361
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,539
But let me confirm
with my lawyer.

362
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,458
She confirms.

363
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,546
If only Buck hadn't been diagnosed
with fibrosis before he got insurance.

364
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,340
So, back to the exam.

365
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,562
That's how you tell
this guy he's dying?

366
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,647
Oh, relax. He's got a cold.

367
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,608
And soon, health insurance.

368
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,278
Such a hero,
always righting wrongs.

369
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,197
Who cares who
you have to manipulate?

370
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,201
I didn't realize
you and Buck were so close.

372
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,748
- It's a point of principle.
- Right.

373
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,416
It's got nothing to do
with what I did to you.

374
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,376
There's nothing
for us to talk about.

375
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,086
That's why you're following me.

376
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,088
- I read some notes.
- If Chase screwed up...

377
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,467
I was wrong!
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

378
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,803
If Chase screwed up so badly,
why didn't you fire him?

379
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,387
He has great hair.

380
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,891
- What are you hiding?
- I'm gay.

381
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,103
Oh, that's not what you meant.
It does explain a lot, though.

382
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,523
No girlfriend,
always with Wilson.

383
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,733
Obsession with sneakers.

384
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,903
Diarrhea, blood in the stool.

385
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,822
Two simple questions you could
have asked her six months ago

386
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,492
and averted this whole thing.
You didn't ask either, why?

387
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,454
Judging from your question
and your demeanor,

388
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,082
I assume you were
visiting with House.

389
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,459
We've been over this.
I don't know.

390
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,752
Good doctors don't
make mistakes like that.

391
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,712
Good doctors never forget
to ask questions?

392
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,090
Then you've got your answer,
apparently, I'm not a good doctor.

393
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,009
FYI, self-pity generally is not a
good strategy in these hearings.

394
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,262
What happened
after the operation?

395
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,598
The kidney damage isn't so bad.

396
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,475
The liver damage
is more worrisome.

397
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,561
There's no dialysis for livers.

398
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,856
I know. But if she loses a liver,
she can get a transplant, right?

399
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,732
We can put her on a list.

400
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,985
I could do it.

401
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,987
I could give her
part of my liver.

402
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,030
Surgeons won't operate
unless the donor's

403
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,157
had a long time to
weigh the decision.

404
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,409
There's black markets.

405
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,535
For organs?

406
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,662
That's just...

407
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,581
Oh, my stomach!

408
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,666
- The pain constant?
- Yeah!

409
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,002
- Sharp or dull?
- I don't know!

410
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,588
- It's ferric.
- It's a little cold.

411
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,591
- She's got ascites.
- No. It's a clot.

412
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,636
Nurse! Call the OR. We gotta
prep her for an embolectomy.

413
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,682
Run CBC, PT, and a liver panel.

414
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,227
Sepsis had lowered her BP so much,
she got clots in her liver.

415
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,730
They blocked the hepatic artery,
cut off the blood flow.

416
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,231
Her liver was shocked.

417
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,109
And Cuddy listed her?
With all the other problems?

418
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,197
Forget it! We can't give a
liver to a woman this sick.

419
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,490
Do you listen to
what you're saying?

420
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,536
There is no point in giving a new liver
to somebody who also has vasculitis.

421
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,788
- Treatable.
- And kidney damage.

422
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,499
- It's healing.
- You know what's really killing her?

423
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,711
Chase forgot to ask a standard
question about stomach pain.

424
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,130
So he missed the diagnosis,
so she perforated,

425
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,549
so she got sepsis,
so her BP tanked,

426
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,885
so she got blood clots,
so she lost her liver.

427
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,764
Livers are important, Cuddy. You can't
live without them, hence the name.

428
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,015
Here's the big issue.

429
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,852
Chase is a hospital employee, and
Kayla is a sympathetic mother

430
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,147
of those two jury-friendly
moppets, Caleb and Cody.

431
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,607
Dory and Nikki.

432
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,527
Your point, beyond just trying
to make Chase wet himself,

433
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,448
seems to be that the hospital
faces liability here.

434
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,367
Well, thanks for
clearing that up.

435
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,202
I still need a medical
reason to list her.

436
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,162
That is the medical reason.

437
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,583
If the family wins this hospital in a
lawsuit, they'll turn it into condos.

438
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,128
And people will die waiting
outside a condo for medical care.

439
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,470
Start praying for a 12-car
pileup on the turnpike,

440
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,598
'cause we're not exactly
swimming in livers over here.

441
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,108
When you're testifying, skip the
details on how House convinced Cuddy.

442
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,111
I don't think the people who got bumped
down the transplant list need to know why.

443
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,322
It didn't matter anyway.

444
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,823
- She next on the list?
- Yes.

445
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,993
But she's AB negative,
very rare.

446
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,122
How long can she
go on like this?

447
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,207
Probably another day or two.

448
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,208
- I'm donating my liver.
- Sam, we talked about this.

449
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,215
I'm a perfect match,
six out of six HLA proteins.

450
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,134
How'd you get
checked out so fast?

451
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,580
I know a guy in medical testing,
and I paid him to rush it.

452
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,597
- Sam bribed someone to rush his tests?
- Wouldn't you?

453
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,516
Someone's going to get
the blame for what happened,

454
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,102
so the more we spread it
around, we might as well...

455
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,148
You said no surgeon would do a live
donor transplant on such short notice.

456
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,442
House took care of that, too.

457
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,488
Your patient's hardly clotting.

458
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,367
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh
frozen plasma pre-op.

459
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,577
Pretty risky.

460
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,079
Well, that's why I came to the best
transplant surgeon in the hospital.

461
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,956
She's dead without you.

462
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,793
Get her in this afternoon.

463
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,839
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

464
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,759
And this was right before you
ran the marathon, I suppose?

465
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,803
Was it the part where he warmly
clasped my hands in thanks,

466
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,014
- was that too much?
- What did you do to him?

467
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,767
The hospital lawyer asks me
if I did something unethical?

468
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,174
If I did, the last person I'd
tell is the hospital lawyer,

469
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,897
especially since she's gone
all Old Testament on me.

470
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,941
- You'll tell me.
- Oh. Okay then.

471
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,738
One caveat, I've moved past
threesomes, I'm now into foursomes.

472
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,616
If someone backs out, then,
you've still got a threesome.

473
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,118
And if two people back out,
you're still having sex.

474
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,805
You'd be amazed,
even if three people...

475
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,705
Anything you say
is attorney-client.

476
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,041
So you can get advice about
the bad, bad thing you did,

477
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,086
knowing I'll be tortured
because I can't tell a soul.

478
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,339
Actually, it is kind of cool.

479
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,134
Are you completely
out of your mind?

480
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,053
She's dying on her own,

481
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,806
why would I volunteer
to be her executioner?

482
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,684
And I'd just be inviting a lawsuit
from the brother no matter what.

483
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,145
5 grand.

484
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,733
And that's just ante money. After
the surgery, you get another 15.

485
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,152
Though I warn you,
that includes the tip.

486
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,115
I make 600 grand a year.

487
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:13,785
You think I'm gonna risk tanking
my percentages for $20,000?

488
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,411
It's tax-free.

489
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,122
For the record,

490
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,207
I hope the Department
takes you and Chase

491
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,293
and drop-kicks both your
asses out the back door.

492
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,170
Great!

493
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,549
That means I don't have to
bother welshing on the 15 grand

494
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,217
I would have owed you.

495
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,929
If you don't do the surgery,
I'm gonna tell your wife

496
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,807
that you've been sleeping
with a series of nurses.

497
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,935
Currently Nurse Cutler
in Radiology.

498
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,147
Now, what's 600 grand
divided by two?

499
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,274
Last Christmas party,

500
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,318
Nurse Cutler handed you
one of those little hot dogs.

501
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,529
And you didn't thank her.

502
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,199
Well, that only happens when
you're very, very intimate.

503
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,266
That, and the fact that you've
been practically dancing around

504
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,998
with your zipper open, and a
used condom stuck on your shoe.

505
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,250
Your wife is apparently
the only one who doesn't know.

506
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,793
There's no way you'll tell her.

507
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,963
Of course I won't.
I'm much too cowardly.

508
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,257
No, I'll just send
an anonymous letter.

509
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:13,469
Now, I've got an OR booked
for 4:00 this afternoon.

510
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,597
Are you free?

511
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,978
Oh, and "for the record",

512
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,190
you are the worst transplant
surgeon in this hospital.

513
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:29,402
But unfortunately, you're the only one
who's currently cheating on his wife.

514
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,620
You bribed him
and then you blackmailed him?

515
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,706
She'd have been dead in two days if I
hadn't made Ayersman do the surgery.

516
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,192
Leave the blackmail out of the
story you tell the committee.

517
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,090
I tried to leave it out
of the story I told you.

518
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,838
And then there was that
incident in the parking lot.

519
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,299
- Don't do that!
- Hey, what, are you nuts?

520
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,134
No, please, I didn't do it!

521
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,970
- I didn't do anything! Please!
- No!

522
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,890
Apparently, someone sent an
anonymous letter to his wife.

523
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,936
You blackmailed Ayersman, he performed the
surgery, and you ratted him out anyway?

524
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,145
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

525
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,064
You just can't
control yourself, can you?

526
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,066
No matter how stupid,
how self-destructive...

527
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,027
To make this conversation easier,
can we discard the fiction

528
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,530
that we're talking about anything
other than what I did to you?

529
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,325
You're not mad because I broke
into your psychiatrist's office.

530
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,691
Yeah, I was
thrilled about that.

531
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,107
Okay, it was
a lousy thing to do.

532
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,162
But if what I had found

533
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,456
was that everything was all kittens
and moonbeams in Markville,

534
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,959
- you'd be over it.
- No, I wouldn't!

535
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,503
You're mad at me for letting
you know what I did.

536
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,964
Because you liked
where things were going.

537
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,760
And for that,
I actually am sorry.

538
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,470
It was stupid.

539
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,984
Let me tell you
a story about a patient.

540
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,529
A patient we'll call Fusan.

541
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,907
Because Sam had
rushed his tests,

542
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,077
we were able to get them
into surgery that afternoon.

543
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,081
Dr. Ayersman performed
the live-donor transplant.

544
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,042
He resected the right lobe,
hepatic vein,

545
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,211
and hepatic artery
of Sam's liver,

546
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,297
and transplanted it into Kayla.

547
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,173
The operation was a success.

548
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,760
Kayla and Sam continued
to receive routine care.

549
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:22,682
Two months later,
she came by for an exam.

550
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,102
July 24, be precise.
You did the exam?

551
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,708
Honestly, I just wanted...
"Honestly"?

552
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,134
So you've been
lying up until now?

553
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,482
Let's make a deal.
I won't use the word "honestly",

554
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,169
and you'll quit
stopping by to see House

555
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,404
so you don't take it out
on me afterwards. How about that?

556
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,284
I wanted to be as far away
from Kayla as possible.

557
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,494
And House was
rubbing my nose in it.

558
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,163
How are the girls?

559
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,706
They're great.

560
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,209
Dory had her first crush,
which was cute.

561
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,294
Oh, yeah?

562
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,504
And then her
first sort of breakup,

563
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,340
which was not so cute.

564
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,220
You're hot. 99.3.

565
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,348
- Have you been coughing?
- No.

566
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,475
- Pain in urinating?
- No.

567
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,271
99's not that high, is it?

568
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,941
Immunosuppressants block fevers,
you shouldn't have one at all.

569
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,654
I'm sending a nurse in here
to draw cultures.

570
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,782
And I'm ordering a chest x-ray.

571
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,909
I wasn't making
any more mistakes.

572
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,995
Another phrase to avoid
in front of the committee.

573
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,163
She spiked a fever
an hour later.

574
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,958
Her AST and ALT are up.
She's rejecting the liver.

575
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,794
No, it's just an infection.

576
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,754
One of her cultures
is growing out strep.

577
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,172
Just one?
Probably a contaminant.

578
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,966
She's dehydrated, her hematocrit's way up.
It's strep.

579
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,510
Her transaminases are up, too.

580
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,720
- That's just stress from the strep.
- Jeez, Chase.

581
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,931
You and this strep.
Get a room already.

582
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,933
She's not rejecting the liver.

583
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,269
It's just an infection,
she'll be fine.

584
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,021
Worst case,
we could re-list her.

585
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,398
You House?

586
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,860
Well, that depends.
Are you gonna hit Dr. House?

587
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,531
You haven't even seen my sister,
and you're being cute with me?

588
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,117
Sam, we're talking
about her right now.

589
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,285
- Her fever might...
- Could be hep B, hep C, right?

590
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,997
This is treatable. You give her
interferon, she's okay, right?

591
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,749
You know a lot about hepatitis.

592
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,043
He just donated his liver.

593
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,172
- You're flushed. You sick?
- I'm tired.

594
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,258
You're hiding the fact
that you're sick.

595
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,969
- Now, why would you do that?
- Hey, what are you...

596
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,762
Now, either you
specifically asked

597
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,448
for a tattoo of a heart that's
been left out in the sun too long,

598
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,684
or that is
a really bad home job.

599
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,187
It's a very common way of getting hep C.
Which you have.

600
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,231
And you've had it a long time.

601
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,376
It was gonna keep me
from giving my liver.

602
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,489
You paid off that lab tech
to say you were clean?

603
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,055
It hasn't been active in years,
she was gonna die if I didn't.

604
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,162
You paid someone off?
That is totally unethical!

605
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,832
Get an MRI for him
and his sister, right now.

606
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,710
She got hep from me,
didn't she?

607
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,337
No! No, no, no, no. God, no.

608
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,965
I think she got
cancer from you.

609
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,055
House was right?

610
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,266
The brother had
an undiagnosed hepatoma

611
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,351
that was transplanted
with his liver.

612
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:16,105
It grew a lot faster in Kayla
because she was immunosuppressed.

613
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,815
How could House have known?

614
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,067
Hepatitis can cause
liver cancer.

615
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:23,654
Plus, her hematocrit, red
blood cell count, was high.

616
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,868
Usually means dehydration.
Rare cases, cancer.

617
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,288
It probably saved Sam's life.

618
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:36,667
We were able to operate on him early
enough, before it metastasized.

619
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,377
O2 sats 94.

620
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,007
Kayla had already
started rejecting the liver.

621
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,260
- No re-listing because of the cancer.
- Nothing we could do.

622
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,012
This is good.

623
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,473
The brother lying about his
hep, it's an intervening act.

624
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,100
The proximate cause of her
cancer, not your mistake.

625
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,312
She would have died six months ago
if he hadn't given up his liver.

626
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,897
Maybe. Can't prove it.

627
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,151
You need to come with me.

628
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,986
Just been served with papers.

629
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,655
Actually, paper. One page.

630
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,325
"Defendants
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital"

631
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,911
and Dr. Robert Chase.
Blah, blah, blah.

632
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,956
"Medical malpractice,
negligence. Blah, blah."

633
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,332
You're surprised they're suing?

634
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,418
You think people love Chase so
much they're gonna just forgo...

635
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,964
Punitive damages in the
amount of $10 million.

636
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,800
Punitives? That means they're
alleging gross negligence.

637
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,677
Their lawyer's obviously
out of his mind.

638
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,887
Larry Ruseckas, he's not crazy.

639
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,223
Oh, no. I've been sued by him.

640
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:35,226
You have been hiding things
and lying to me all day.

641
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,019
I haven't lied about anything.

642
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,605
Except for the parts that
I admitted I was lying about.

643
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,567
And I'm not the one
being sued. I feel funny.

644
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,195
Well, what haven't you told us?

645
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,167
Before she checked out,
Sam found her a second liver.

646
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,212
- She had cancer, how could she...
- Black market.

647
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,007
There's a doctor in Mexico City
who was gonna do the surgery.

648
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,009
She's leaving from JFK at 5:00.

649
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,261
To meet some Mexican guy
in the back of a van

650
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,762
with a pig's liver
and a hacksaw? This is nuts!

651
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,264
You wanna rat me out to House?

652
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,850
He'll say if there's a chance
in a billion then go for it.

653
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,351
This is not what she wants.

654
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,186
She's being manipulated

655
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,273
by a morally guilty brother
and a legally guiltier doctor.

656
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,693
- You think she wants to die?
- She's dying either way.

657
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,362
Chase!

658
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,158
How many people you know walking
around with a black market organ

659
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,534
from a Third World
surgeon, huh?

660
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,828
This isn't gonna be
your salvation.

661
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,456
It's just one more thing
they'll pin on you.

662
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,751
Go in there, be the good guy.

663
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,299
We need to talk.

664
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,926
- No, there's no time.
- Two minutes.

665
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,678
Kayla.

666
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,181
I made a mistake.

667
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,644
I wasn't as blunt as I should
have been about your odds.

668
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,854
I probably didn't
want to face them myself.

669
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,814
Dr. Chase,
please don't do this.

670
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,694
The stress of the travel, the
operation and even then the cancer...

671
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,572
- Kayla, we're going!
- My dad died.

672
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,658
Lung cancer.

673
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,868
I saw him a couple of months
before it happened.

674
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,161
We never talked about it.

675
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,246
I'm sorry your father died,
but it has nothing...

676
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,248
He never even told me
he was sick.

677
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,668
I wish he had.

678
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,087
It would...

679
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,926
You're gonna die. Alone.

680
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,844
Thousands of miles
from your children.

681
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,846
You don't wanna
do that to them.

682
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,982
- Kayla...
- I'm sorry, Sam.

683
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,654
Kayla, you can't give up.

684
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,366
If you do this,

685
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,120
if you go home,

686
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,540
I killed you.

687
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,128
No.

688
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,758
You gave me three months.

689
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,637
You gave Dory and Nikki
three more months with me.

690
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,267
And when they found my cancer,

691
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,437
they found yours.

692
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,277
And I got to save
my baby brother.

693
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,708
A week later,
Kayla died at home.

694
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,461
Sam was furious.

695
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,463
Gotta be why the big lawsuit.

696
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,109
- Are you buying this?
- Of course not!

697
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,300
There was no illegal transplant,
there's no causation.

698
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,260
He was ready to kill me.

699
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,304
Maybe he's lying
to his lawyers.

700
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,097
Or you're lying to us.

701
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,309
Last Thursday he saw you for post-op care.
If you hate your doctor,

702
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,395
you find another doctor
before you find a lawyer.

703
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,857
This guy didn't sue Cameron or
Foreman, he didn't even sue House!

704
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,400
There's something
personal here,

705
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,403
something you don't want us
to know before your hearing.

706
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,657
The guy didn't hate you before
that meeting, he hated you after.

707
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,578
So, how's everything else?

708
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,497
- The girls?
- Oh, you know.

709
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,374
A lot of crying,
some nightmares.

710
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,587
We'll be okay, though.

711
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,298
Good.

712
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,384
Girls are not gonna be happy
about leaving town, though.

713
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,304
They love that house,

714
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,890
the yard, their friends.

715
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,391
- You're moving?
- Yeah.

716
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,228
Ever since the operation,
I've been on disability,

717
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,313
and the mortgage...

718
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,901
So, we're moving out of state,
somewhere cheaper.

719
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,821
Anyways, thanks.

720
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,743
I killed your sister.

721
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:09,166
I misdiagnosed her ulcer.
It killed her.

722
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,334
Shut up, man.

723
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,337
She liked you, just...

724
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,173
I was hung over when she
came back to see me.

725
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,343
I'd been up half the night
drinking, had a headache,

726
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,096
and I just wanted to
get the hell out of there.

727
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,019
I couldn't care less what your sister
was saying about her stomach pain.

728
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,412
May I speak to my future
former employee?

729
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,081
Great story.

730
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,000
You think I'm lying?

731
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,366
That's exactly what I told him.

732
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,961
I'm sure it is.

733
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,047
But you lied to him.
You want him to sue you.

734
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,883
I killed his sister.

735
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,969
I ordered black coffee
this morning and got cream.

736
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,514
- Everybody screws up.
- They didn't put poison in your coffee.

737
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,391
I've seen you hung over.

738
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,557
You weren't the day you blew
his sister's diagnosis.

739
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,646
What does it matter why? Is she
less dead if I have a good excuse?

740
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,900
If I thought you'd screwed up because
you were drunk, I would have fired you.

741
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,069
- You knew?
- You were depressed and distracted.

742
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,532
I assumed you'd gotten a phone
call from your stepmom.

743
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,202
This is Robert.

744
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,465
What did he die of?

745
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,888
That's impossible.

746
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:50,434
I saw him two months ago. If he
had lung cancer, he would have...

747
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,694
Dr. Chase?

748
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,420
Good news is, both your
parents are dead now.

749
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,339
So no reason to screw up this bad again.

750
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,882
How'd you know?

751
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,469
There's this interconnected
network of computers,

752
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,221
or "Interweb", where you can...

753
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,056
How did you know to look?

754
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,395
When he visited, he told me
he only had two months left.

755
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,314
When you screwed up,
I did the math.

756
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,024
Why didn't you tell me
he was dying?

757
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,818
He asked me not to.

758
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,990
So you just hung me out
there to be blindsided?

759
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,118
Yeah, Chase,
it was all my fault.

760
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,081
Look, you've got a choice.
You can either tell the truth,

761
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,459
the hospital settles,
the family gets some money.

762
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,878
They get to keep their house.

763
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,756
Or you can keep up this lie.

764
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,843
The family gets
punitive damages,

765
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,387
they buy a jet,
and they move to Park Avenue,

766
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,515
and you have to
find another career.

767
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,350
You're not gonna say anything?

768
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

769
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,400
Legally, it's better for me
if you go down in flames.

770
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,296
Is Chase telling
the committee about his dad?

771
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,548
I don't know.

772
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,220
I thought you were gonna
get him to sell me out.

773
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,557
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

774
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,392
You're my client, too.

775
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,519
Yeah.

776
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,149
And that's not gonna change
unless you leave this job,

777
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,151
or I do.

778
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,988
So how do you deal with a coworker
that you have feelings for?

779
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,823
Positive or negative.

780
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,203
I don't wanna
end up like Chase.

781
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:19,291
I don't wanna get emotionally
caught up and kill you.

782
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,300
It's not all negative.

783
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,522
Maybe you were right, maybe...

784
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
Maybe that is the problem.

785
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,578
So what do we do?

786
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,502
I don't know.

787
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,590
Dr. House?

788
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,647
After considering the testimonial
and documentary evidence,

789
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,651
this ad-hoc committee in the matter of
Kayla McGinley has reached a decision.

790
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,069
Dr. Chase,

791
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,489
your error resulted
in a patient's death.

792
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,243
You also lied, both to your superiors
and the patient's brother.

793
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,873
But, taking into account the mitigating
factor of your father's death,

794
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,375
we've decided not to
revoke your privileges.

795
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,380
You'll receive one week's suspension,
and a letter in your permanent file.

796
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,507
Now, as for Dr. House.

797
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,302
There is no evidence
of a failure to supervise

798
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,596
that would lead to
disciplinary action.

799
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,976
And yet, there is enough in the record
to be very troubled by your conduct,

800
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,981
including certain allegations of blackmail
from members of the transplant team,

801
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,443
and by your general refusal
to meet with your patients.

802
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,404
It should be noted
that your patient's cancer

803
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,282
was diagnosed as a result of a
direct physical examination...

804
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,076
Not of the patient. I met
the brother, never met her.

805
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:22,497
Should I go to a family reunion
every time I take on a patient?

806
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,250
The committee has determined
that for no less than one month,

807
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,545
Dr. House will have his practice
supervised by another doctor,

808
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,215
to be designated by Dr. Cuddy.

809
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,300
This proceeding is adjourned.

810
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,275
Did you know this was coming?

811
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,985
They contacted me
about an hour ago.

812
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,862
What's happening to Chase?

813
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,489
Now you're fired!

814
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,241
No. He's not.

815
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,326
Dr. House,

816
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,828
meet your new boss.

817
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,005
Guess I'm his best friend now.
