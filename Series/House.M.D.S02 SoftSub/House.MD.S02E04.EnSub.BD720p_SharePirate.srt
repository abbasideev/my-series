1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,599
Hey!

2
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,823
Dr. Sebastian.

3
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,703
Two pallets of antibiotics
for tuberculosis.

4
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,705
We've got six pallets
worth of patients.

5
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,749
Stoia Tucker needs a math lesson.
I'm headed back tomorrow.

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,001
Hey! Hey!

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,551
Come on, come on. Come on,
kids, let the truck through.

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,686
Move those boxes quick, quick. Let's move!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

9
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,813
Let's go! Let's go, man! Hurry!

10
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:09,527
I've got some very special medicine here.
It's from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

11
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,863
One per person. One per person.

12
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,865
Let's calm down, kids.
Wait, wait.

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,711
Help! Help! Dr. Sebastian!
Come quickly!

14
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,340
My son, he fell. He fell on this log.
We were just waiting for his friends.

15
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,851
I got no breath sounds
on the left. Give me that.

16
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,653
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

17
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,407
The fall didn't cause
him to drop a lung.

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,952
The lung caused him to fall.
TB chewed it up.

19
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,705
He'll be lucky
to live another year.

20
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,292
This is Sarni. I picked up the
tab for the back brace myself.

21
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,627
The funny thing is,

22
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,087
is that the brace cost more
than the medicine

23
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,882
that would have prevented her
from needing it.

24
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,717
It's your medicine.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,762
All of the antibiotics
that we need are right here

26
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,723
in your warehouses,
in your factories.

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,726
- We provide over 10,000 doses a year.
- Which is not enough.

28
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,020
You know we'd love to do more,
but our hands are tied.

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,396
New car, Jerry?

30
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,940
I saw it on the way in, looks beautiful.

31
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:29,899
Don't make this personal.

32
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,735
All the way from Germany, too. I
know that's a lot of red tape.

33
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,446
I'm not like you. I'm not
ashamed of making a living.

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,773
And I know you didn't become
a chem major for the money.

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,244
Now, you want the same things
that I want. You just...

36
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,705
You have to... You just
have to push a little...

37
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,958
You have to push
a little bit harder...

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,418
- Harder for it.
- Sebastian?

39
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,718
Call 911.

40
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,595
Is he okay?

41
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,848
Isn't someone here a doctor?

42
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,890
Selling subscriptions? I heard
20 and you get a new bike.

43
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,727
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during
a presentation at Stoia Tucker.

44
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,105
Really? Crushed under the weight
of his own ego?

45
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,191
Wow!
Is there nobody you admire?

46
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,112
Well, there is this gal I met in Nam who
could blow out a candle without using...

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,072
He thinks it's TB.

48
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,909
Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.

49
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,120
- He wants a second opinion.
- Second to his own. Okay.

50
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,082
- It's not TB.
- What is it?

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,626
Oh, you want specifics?

52
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,546
Lemma, big Knicks fan.

53
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,800
You've never had an episode
like this before?

54
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,261
No. He died last month.

55
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,889
Stupidly tried to share
his meds with his cousin,

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,600
and they only had
enough for one.

57
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,186
Dr. House,
I'm Sebastian Charles.

58
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,732
Patients aren't usually
part of the diagnostic process.

59
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,777
Well, I'm a doctor.

60
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,943
Listen, I know you guys
don't make a lot of money...

61
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,549
I wrote your people a check last month.

62
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,116
Oh, well. Write us another one.

63
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,535
- Talk to Chase. He's rich.
- My dad, not me.

64
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,038
Every minute
four people die of TB.

65
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,666
Wow!
How can you sleep at night?

66
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,352
There's people dying in Africa
of a disease that we cured over...

67
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,921
Yeah, I know.
I saw the concert.

68
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,342
Seriously. Let's see, you sleep six
hours. That means every night you kill

69
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,094
1,440 people.

70
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,179
I guess you got to get
some sleep, but come on.

71
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,766
If you'd stayed up another 10 minutes,
you could have saved 40 lives.

72
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,434
Do you send notes to the
families in the morning?

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,228
That's gonna take
at least 10 minutes.

74
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,272
So that's another
40 dead, another 40 notes.

75
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,109
Why don't you go wrack yourself
with guilt in your own room?

76
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,362
No, thanks. I'll stay.
I'd like to hear the differential.

77
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,616
Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it's not
a good idea for the patient to be here.

78
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,910
He's an immunologist
and a TB expert.

79
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,122
That'll be very useful
if we need somebody to say the words,

80
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,999
"I think it's TB".

81
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,002
What is that?

82
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,421
Oh, that. I'm sorry,
that's my body powder.

83
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,748
It's the only thing I've found
that works in the Sahara.

84
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,259
I'm kind of used to it.
I don't even notice it.

85
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,886
Who thinks it smells like
an elephant-dung smoothie?

86
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,430
It smells okay to me.

87
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,474
That is exactly why the patient
shouldn't be in the room.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,810
If you can't tell a man
that his cologne makes you want to puke,

89
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,737
how are you gonna tell him
that he's an idiot?

90
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,522
He's not an idiot.

91
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,567
Sure, you say that now,
while he's in the room.

92
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,069
Look, I don't have time for this.
It's TB.

93
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,114
Nope.
The symptoms are too varied.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,325
Well, if you haven't seen 10,000 cases,
I agree that's what you'd think.

95
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,744
I told you he's an idiot.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,788
- You said you wanted a second opinion.
- No, actually,

97
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,290
my backers
wanted a second opinion.

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,294
Yeah, doesn't look good if you drop dead
while wearing your shoe sponsor's logo.

99
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,464
It's TB and I'm not dying. I'm
gonna want you to plant a PPD

100
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,830
and induce a sputum
to confirm the TB.

101
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,093
Imaging studies will
determine the progress,

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,555
and I think we should probably
take a CT scan of my lungs

103
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,684
- just so that nobody second guesses us.
- Wouldn't want that.

104
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,814
Hello? No,
I'm feeling much better.

105
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,944
Well, what you can do is,
you can get your board to approve

106
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,697
the increased
med shipments that... Sorry.

107
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,244
No, don't, don't, don't try.
No, don't do your best.

108
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,915
Just get it done, okay?

109
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,128
That's Stoia Tucker, and they're
the nice pharmaceutical company.

110
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,297
I'm sorry,
but it's against hospital regs.

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,840
Oh, I need the phone.

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,843
Why don't we focus on getting
you better right now?

113
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,138
- What'll you do, throw me out?
- No, just the phone.

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,140
Sorry. We've got an emergency.

115
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,517
Got to go.

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,480
- There's a phone in your room.
- Yeah, I figured that there would be.

117
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,399
Right. I just thought...

118
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,654
It's not like the hospitals
you may be used to in Africa.

119
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,865
I don't know what the
facilities were like, so...

120
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,117
Thank you.

121
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,120
You're welcome.

122
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,830
And thanks for that check.

123
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,207
I should go.

124
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:47,258
The nameless poor have a face,
and it's a pompous white man.

125
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,846
Yeah, what a jerk, saving
all those lives like that.

126
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,014
What's the emergency?

127
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,642
I can't remember
how to do "walk the dog".

128
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,103
The guy's sick, maybe dying.

129
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,814
And you've forgotten all about
doing a differential diagnosis.

130
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,109
- You just sent us off to test him...
- Well, I had to get him out of there.

131
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,115
Now we can all sit around
and call him an idiot.

132
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,113
- Who wants to go first?
- He's right.

133
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,574
Tuberculosis could present
hundreds of different ways.

134
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,285
Well, by that logic, everyone in
the hospital should be treated.

135
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,496
Not everybody in the hospital has been
exposed to it for the last 20 years.

136
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,248
TB takes years to kill you.

137
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,083
Two weeks ago,
he was perfectly healthy.

138
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,889
Now he's got a whiteboard
full of symptoms.

139
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,962
What about something metabolic?

140
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,381
Welcome aboard
the Good Ship Ass-Kisser.

141
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,800
Nice day for a sail.
Pucker up, me hearties.

142
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,138
It's not metabolic. Kidney, liver and
thyroid are all normal. No diabetes.

143
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,600
- What about his heart?
- Obviously big as all outdoors.

144
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,270
Abnormal heart rhythm. Wave
forms show PR variability.

145
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,607
It's subtle, but it's there.

146
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,775
You think it's his heart?
Sick sinus syndrome?

147
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,695
Loose throttle. Sometimes beats
too fast, sometimes too slow.

148
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,615
- Causing him to pass out.
- It would account for the episode.

149
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,117
I'll put him on telemetry, do a
stress test and an echocardiogram.

150
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,912
Treat him like every
other hospital patient.

151
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,249
I want to see that pious, body-powdered
tush hanging out of his gown.

152
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,299
Could you give me a hand
with this thing?

153
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,263
I don't recall asking for a
stress test or an echocardiogram.

154
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,432
What are you gonna do,
walk out?

155
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,353
Corporate sponsors
aren't gonna like that.

156
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,023
I need your forearm.

157
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,484
What's House thinking?

158
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,819
Sick sinus syndrome.

159
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,280
Well, that's a lot
more serious than TB.

160
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,491
Is that a PPD?

161
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,534
If it changes color
in the next 48 hours...

162
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:42,122
Yeah, if House doesn't think it's TB,
why would he have you test for that?

163
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,334
Just covering
all his bases, I guess.

164
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,710
Uh-huh.

165
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,006
He doesn't seem
like a guy who does that.

166
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,428
We have you scheduled for a 10:30 echo.

167
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,429
Good for you.

168
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,062
Every minute that we refuse
to love one another,

169
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,481
another puppy
cries another tear.

170
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,026
You're just mad because he's closer
to a Nobel Prize than you are.

171
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,281
And yet I've nailed more Swedish babes.
Crazy, crazy world.

172
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,492
It's not just a trip
to Stockholm, you know.

173
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,744
It comes with a cash prize.

174
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,288
Seriously?

175
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,416
No wonder everybody's
going after that peace thing.

176
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,251
He cures thousands
of people every year.

177
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,128
You cure what, 30?

178
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:33,215
McDonald's makes a better hamburger than
your mother because they make more?

179
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,050
Oh, I see.

180
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,471
So you hate him because the lives he saves
aren't as good as the lives you save?

181
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,515
Yeah, that's the reason.

182
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,102
Nobel invented dynamite. I
won't accept his blood money.

183
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,107
The top of my head's
killing me.

184
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,155
We spent a week doing
"top of head" in anatomy.

185
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,032
I know just where it is.

186
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,621
- That is not the top of my head.
- Close enough for clinic.

187
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,166
Your sinuses are clogged.

188
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:11,045
Judging by the scratches on your
hands, I'm guessing a new cat.

189
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,505
It was my mother's. She's dead.

190
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,632
You keep a dead cat?

191
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,510
No. My mother's dead.

192
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,139
Poor cat. You're allergic.

193
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,141
We can control it
with antihistamine.

194
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,268
- One pill a day.
- Pills?

195
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,147
You don't like to swallow.
Not surprised.

196
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,067
Forget the pills.
We'll give you a nasal spray.

197
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,651
Steroids?

198
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,446
Is there something else
you can give me?

199
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,700
Well, if you live
by the river, I've got a bag.

200
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,287
Hey. Stress test was normal.

201
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,541
- But his EKG was not normal.
- Echo's normal.

202
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,836
Two for you, one for me.
We need a tiebreaker.

203
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,255
Echo and stress tests are more reliable.

204
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,757
Tilt table tests.

205
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,592
That never works.

206
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,136
I'll bet you
a week's clinic duty it does.

207
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,722
You're on.

208
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,769
You like this guy?

209
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,940
You always tell us our opinion
of the patient's irrelevant.

210
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,610
Medically, it's irrelevant.
It says something about you.

211
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,697
You figure anybody who gives a crap about
people in Africa must be full of it?

212
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,824
Yes.

213
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:27,162
There's an evolutionary imperative why we
give a crap about our family and friends.

214
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,874
And there's an evolutionary imperative why
we don't give a crap about anybody else.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,211
If we loved all people indiscriminately,
we couldn't function.

216
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,840
So the great humanitarian's
as selfish as the rest of us?

217
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,134
Just not as honest about it.

218
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,971
Well, you also always tell us
motives are irrelevant.

219
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,100
Dr. Charles, your heart's handling the
changes in orientation just fine.

220
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,226
No pauses on your EKG.

221
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:53,522
And House drives in for
the lay-up and no, rejected!

222
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,526
- What does this knobby thing do?
- I'm within protocol range.

223
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,213
You're not gonna
get a different result.

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,574
The way I figure it is, this
could show you problems at six,

225
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,034
imagine what it'll tell you
if you crank it to 10.

226
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,704
- House, is that you?
- Does it go to 11?

227
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,166
Would you stop? You lost. I'm scheduled
for clinic duty Thursday and Friday.

228
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,042
All right, I'm beginning
to feel nauseous.

229
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,420
Would you turn the damn thing
off before you break it?

230
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,464
Okay, I'm getting dizzy.

231
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,216
I can't see
and I'm gonna pass out.

232
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,721
- I win.
- At those speeds, astronauts throw up.

233
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,848
I'm not talking
about the nausea.

234
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,143
- The test revealed the problem.
- Yeah? House is insane?

235
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,854
- What he just did...
- Abusive and unprofessional.

236
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,316
If he hadn't done it, we
wouldn't have seen the problem.

237
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,152
You've got
an abnormal PR interval.

238
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,489
It could be dangerous, possibly fatal,
particularly if you're in Africa

239
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,157
away from advanced medicine.

240
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm gonna need a pacemaker?

241
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,120
You're scheduled
for surgery this afternoon.

242
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,921
We'll be able to maintain
your pacemaker from anywhere.

243
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,173
You just need to get yourself to
a phone line every few months.

244
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,343
Better yet, you could join me
at one of my clinics.

245
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,179
- I'm kind of spoiled.
- Well, we'll get you a hut with a view.

246
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,973
- Do you like sand?
- I meant medically.

247
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,935
- No PET scans, no MRis...
- This is ridiculous.

248
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,262
- Dr. Charles...
- I know. I know. Hospital regulations.

249
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,731
Darling, have a seat. Come on.

250
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,400
You're smart. You'll adapt.

251
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,819
- We're going up or down?
- Basement.

252
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,154
All right.

253
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,157
You might even find that without
the technological crutches,

254
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,742
you become
a better diagnostician.

255
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,285
My heart
can handle this, right?

256
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,497
So far, just carnival rides
have set you off.

257
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,292
When you meet these people,
it changes you.

258
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,295
We should
talk about it over dinner.

259
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,550
Are you asking me
to Africa or on a date?

260
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:49,179
I can ask you halfway around the world, I
can't ask you to a restaurant a block away?

261
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,058
- Well, one's a job, and the other's...
- Yeah, hospital regs.

262
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:58,146
You can't date patients, right? I wouldn't
wanna risk your precious objectivity.

263
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,567
You haven't answered
either question, by the way.

264
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,278
You don't think
objectivity's important?

265
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,572
I think doctors like House
cling to objectivity

266
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,908
like a three-year-old to a blanket.
Don't get too worked up.

267
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,954
Stay calm. Stay cool and maintain
the correct perspective.

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,000
The only flaw in their argument is that
when you have millions of people dying,

269
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,628
the correct perspective is to be
yelling at the top of your lungs.

270
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,302
- Sorry. My head is killing me.
- Here, sit on the step.

271
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,560
So, are you gonna go out
with me or not?

272
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,186
Your heart rate's normal.

273
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,094
Yeah, of course it is.
It's one flight of stairs.

274
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,898
I'm gonna be fine.

275
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,111
Hand's a little...

276
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,537
Call a code,
second floor stairwell!

277
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,881
- You were wrong.
- Hey, I have feelings.

278
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,717
I'm trying my best.
Isn't that enough for you?

279
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,137
- The abnormal EKG was real.
- It's not sick sinus syndrome.

280
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,390
Thank God we found out before
we put the pacemaker in.

281
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,769
And thank God you dragged him into a
stairwell to get his heart racing.

282
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,229
We were taking the stairs. They
keep them in the stairwell.

283
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,273
The guy's a selfish jerk.
Why would you...

284
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,733
Why would you say he's selfish?

285
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,068
Because he's been talking to Foreman.

286
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,986
No, I haven't.
I'm just giving my opinion.

287
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
This kind of altruism
doesn't just naturally...

288
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,448
Excellent briefing.

289
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,534
Hey, the guy's still sick.
Can we talk about that?

290
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,149
Now, headaches point to
a neurological problem.

291
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,662
Acoustic neuroma.

292
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,498
A brain tumor causes dizziness,
loss of consciousness,

293
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,583
messes with breathing
patterns, heart rhythms...

294
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,793
Get an MRI.

295
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,169
Hello?

296
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,757
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be right down.
No problem.

297
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,967
I'll do an extra hour
to make up.

298
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,429
I'm late for my clinic duty.

299
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,099
Here, go be me
for a couple of hours.

300
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,773
Explosive diarrhea, fever,
it's probably the flu.

301
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,319
Wow. You're good.
You a Harvard boy?

302
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,698
- You're not Hill, Oliver.
- No.

303
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,741
Carter, Cecelia.

304
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,576
They put you in the wrong room, Cecelia.

305
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,371
- Mrs. Carter.
- Sorry.

306
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,748
I'll just be
a few more minutes.

307
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,834
Don't take these in order,
everything falls apart.

308
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,252
I have cancer.

309
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,088
I felt a lump.

310
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,842
- I'll go get a nurse.
- Yeah, see you in an hour or two.

311
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,512
Lie flat.

312
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,061
Lift your left arm up
and under your head.

313
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,901
- Right there?
- Yeah.

314
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,070
I felt it this morning.

315
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,906
Oh, my cousin
had the same thing.

316
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,867
It's nothing.

317
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,785
We should check it again
on your next cycle,

318
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,496
but you really don't have
anything to worry about.

319
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,998
That's what they told Donna.

320
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,126
- She was dead in six months.
- Listen, the edges are smooth.

321
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,712
It has mobility. It has all
the earmarks of a benign...

322
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,797
Why should I believe you?

323
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
Because you're trying
to rush me out of here?

324
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,470
The risks of a false positive
on a biopsy outweigh...

325
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,015
Either you do the biopsy,
or I talk to your superior.

326
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,393
Which is it, Dr. House?

327
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,899
- I'll arrange the biopsy.
- Thanks.

328
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,912
- He asked me out.
- I'm shocked.

329
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,458
I'm shocked when patients
don't ask you out.

330
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,797
He also asked me
to come to Africa.

331
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,758
Boy, he moves fast.

332
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,260
I think the two questions
had two different objectives.

333
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,470
Do you like him?

334
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,765
Good-looking single guy,
genius doctor,

335
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,893
- cares about the world.
- I take it you said no.

336
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,063
- You think I'm that hung up on rules?
- He's not House.

337
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,315
There's nothing there.

338
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,407
Yeah, there is.

339
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,994
Did I ask you to plant a PPD?

340
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,205
It was positive. He's got TB!

341
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,376
Well, of course he's got TB. The guy's
been in the jungle for 20 years.

342
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,297
If he tested positive for pinkeye, would
you think that was his big problem?

343
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,800
I did a test. It was positive.
Why is that a problem?

344
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,511
Because now he's got
the big red target on his arm,

345
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,398
the stubborn jerk thinks he's right.
He won't let us do any more tests.

346
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,766
Well, maybe he's not
the only stubborn jerk.

347
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,186
I did an LP, too. Low glucose, and
he has an increased sed rate.

348
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,481
- Everything screams tuberculosis!
- Not everything!

349
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,902
If any of the symptoms are caused by the
TB, it would throw off our diagnosis.

350
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,869
You're right.
We gotta treat the TB.

351
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,789
Who knows?
Maybe he'll just get better.

352
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,916
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

353
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,761
So, it's TB, but not TB?

354
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,765
- I'm complicated.
- The guy does know tuberculosis.

355
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,268
- If he says it can manifest...
- The guy's not even a real doctor.

356
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,271
- He's a human telethon.
- Is that your problem with him?

357
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,773
You see hypocrites every day.
Why is this guy so special?

358
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,484
You think I have a hypocritical
attitude to hypocrisy?

359
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:40,155
The problem is, there are 26 letters in the
alphabet and he only uses two of them.

360
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,407
He treats thousands of
patients with one diagnosis.

361
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,492
He knows the answer
going in. It's cheating.

362
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,455
So it's all because he's one
of them useless specialists?

363
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,293
Oh, did I hurt the big-time
oncologist's itty-bitty feelings?

364
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,087
You're a big help to patients
who actually have cancer.

365
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,758
- Other times you're just annoying.
- You've outdone yourself.

366
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,928
I'll say. My salad's covering
a free T-bone steak.

367
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,180
Cecelia Carter, remember her?

368
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,766
Last week they said it was
mystery stew. They owe me.

369
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,311
She was just in my office crying
because of the way you treated her.

370
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,771
That doesn't sound like you.

371
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,689
Then it probably wasn't.

372
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,734
I get that you like
to shock people,

373
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,112
stun them out of complacency,
out of stupidity.

374
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,198
But this woman thought
she had cancer.

375
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,660
She had a lump in her breast. What
were you trying to accomplish?

376
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,205
Let me ask you something.
If this were another doctor,

377
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,833
if the patient were complaining about,
let's say, I don't know, Foreman,

378
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,796
you'd just dismiss this as the paranoid
bitching of another paranoid bitch.

379
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,298
- And file it under "P" for...
- Paranoid?

380
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,716
Am not.

381
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,803
- You're right.
- Good.

382
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,014
Apologize to her before the
end of business today.

383
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,936
- What did you do to Ceci?
- I have no idea.

384
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,106
Just the salad today.
Big breakfast.

385
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,399
Hey.

386
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,737
Levofloxacin?

387
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,907
You have
a resistant strain of TB.

388
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,702
Wow, you just
walk right in with these.

389
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,578
That's what we doctors do.

390
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,999
We write down the name of some
medicine, and someone gives it to us.

391
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:19,004
You know, there's parts of the world where
you get knifed walking around with this.

392
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,881
I mean, the regular stuff
is bad enough,

393
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,634
but the treatment
for the resistant strain?

394
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,098
They get $6 a tablet for that.

395
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,934
And I take it for two years.

396
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,062
Streptomycin.
Now, that's two grand.

397
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,442
Ten grand, cure one person.

398
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,910
I had a patient in Djani once.

399
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:56,791
It was a mother,
had three little boys.

400
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,918
She had resistant TB.

401
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,797
She couldn't afford these.

402
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,924
She couldn't afford bread.

403
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,928
We gave her
the regular stuff, but

404
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,225
- no surprise, she died.
- Sorry.

405
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,529
I'm not taking these pills.

406
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,618
Because she couldn't get them,
you're not gonna take them?

407
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,036
- That's insane.
- Why?

408
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,789
- 'Cause I'm better than her?
- Because letting her die was wrong,

409
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,500
but letting you die
is just as wrong.

410
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,919
Maybe I won't die.

411
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,923
Maybe somebody will pay a little
more attention to my story.

412
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,806
He figures
the pharmaceutical companies

413
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,692
need something big
to force them into action.

414
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,852
This'll get a lot more media play
than 1,000 African villagers dying.

415
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,646
So, he won't take the pills.

416
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,482
- Newsweek's calling you.
- And he won't agree to any more tests.

417
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,691
He has his diagnosis.

418
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,026
See what happens
when you don't listen to me?

419
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,945
Maybe millions
of lives get saved.

420
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,030
Yeah. That's my point.

421
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,825
Increased heart rate,
night sweats,

422
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,787
loss of consciousness. Besides rough
sex, what do they all have in common?

423
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,413
- T...
- It's not TB!

424
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,082
His autonomic nervous system?

425
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,502
- We know that it's not a brain tumor.
- What else could be eating his nerves?

426
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,796
Fabry's. Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

427
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,591
Shy-Drager syndrome. It doesn't matter.
He won't let us test him.

428
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,600
In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian
Charles is an idiot.

429
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,688
Yeah, you can quote me.
C-U-D-D-Y.

430
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,402
Sebastian is refusing
life-saving treatment.

431
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,322
He's refusing TB treatment.
You don't think he has TB.

432
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,450
- Ergo, you should care less.
- He won't let me test him.

433
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,952
And what do you want me to do about it?

434
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,579
Hold him down.

435
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,498
Have you apologized
to Cecelia Carter yet?

436
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,168
Trust me, she doesn't
wanna hear from me.

437
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,669
Look, the guy
is killing himself!

438
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,172
Am I the only one who realizes
this is a bad thing?

439
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:11,509
If he was a Christian Scientist refusing
meds, we'd have 18 attorneys...

440
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,680
You're putting on makeup.

441
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,558
That's not a good sign
for my side, is it?

442
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:22,145
Sebastian has called
a press conference for 3:00.

443
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,690
He's asked me to be there to confirm
the diagnosis and the prognosis.

444
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,318
You are as big
a media whore as he is.

445
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,280
Of course I am. It couldn't possibly
be that I think he's right,

446
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,699
and that I'd like to be a small
part of what he's doing.

447
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,786
Oh, whores can like the sex.
Doesn't mean they're not whores.

448
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:43,208
And with that eye shadow, I
am totally screwed, aren't I?

449
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,417
Totally.

450
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,132
How you feeling? A little weak.

451
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,009
You're having a good day.

452
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,305
The symptoms will quickly focus
more and more on your lungs.

453
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,474
You'll find it difficult to talk
and eventually breathe at all.

454
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
I think I know what I'll have
to look forward to.

455
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,602
I know.

456
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,980
I just came to ask if you'd be
willing to accept any treatment.

457
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,815
No, if you're trying to scare me into...

458
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,777
No. Palliative treatment.

459
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,695
Narcotics.

460
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,823
Fentanyl patch, morphine drip,
whatever it takes.

461
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,952
We can make your last days
fairly comfortable.

462
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,498
And if you have another
good day, maybe dinner.

463
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,419
Thank you.

464
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,767
You want Third World treatment?
You got it.

465
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,770
- Boy, is it hot here in Djani.
- What are you doing?

466
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,105
What am I doing?

467
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,857
Putting everything
on the floor of the hut.

468
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,069
What's the magic box
with the moving pictures?

469
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,321
- You think he's a hypocrite?
- Hypocrite? No.

470
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,533
Everybody in Africa's got cell
phones and running water.

471
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,122
This thing just will not flush.

472
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,333
Do you really think that if you come
in here and make it a little hot,

473
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,543
make it smell a little,

474
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,463
that I'm just gonna fold and abandon
everything that matters to me?

475
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,217
Lousy sanitation
over there, too.

476
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,178
You are not the same as them.
Your life is not the same.

477
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,015
And you're cheapening everything they're
going through by pretending you are.

478
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,433
I am the same. I'm not special.

479
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,020
You can't demand to be treated
like any Third World sick person

480
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,315
- and call a press conference!
- They treat me special!

481
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,317
That doesn't mean I am.

482
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,071
And what kind of selfish jerk
wouldn't take advantage of that fact?

483
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,130
It's all preventable.

484
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,467
Stoia Tucker makes medications
right here in New Jersey.

485
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:01,262
They have warehouses full of the stuff.
There's more than enough to go around.

486
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,474
So if I can get them,
why can't Lemma?

487
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,770
Why can't Quesmo?
And why can't Sarni?

488
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:16,194
Another person just died.
Where is your outrage?

489
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,072
No, I have no intention
of martyring myself.

490
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,238
I'm just putting myself...

491
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,159
Sure, they're dying,
but it's got a great beat.

492
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,578
Must be hot as hell under those lights.

493
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,247
- Yep.
- Hey, why the page?

494
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,334
- He okay?
- He's in a coma.

495
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,254
I need you to
apologize to Ceci, Cecily.

496
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:39,217
- Mrs. Carter? For what?
- For whatever I did.

497
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,303
- You didn't do anything.
- That has been my position all along.

498
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,431
His chestx-rays are negative, so
he's not contagious at this point.

499
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,183
His condition
is currently stable.

500
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,187
Do you ever notice how all the
self-sacrificing women in history,

501
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,731
Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,

502
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,276
can't think of any others,
they all die alone.

503
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,489
The men, on the other hand,
get so much fuzz it's crazy.

504
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,199
It's an unfair world.

505
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,660
House, she was scared and unreasonable.

506
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,995
Insulting a woman
with breast cancer,

507
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:12,917
that's a move best left to the pros.
Frankly, you don't have the chops.

508
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:17,463
I didn't insult her! I did the
unnecessary biopsy like she wanted.

509
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,465
It was negative
like I knew it would be.

510
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,634
What'd you do, call them perky?

511
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,221
You are years away
from mad skills like that.

512
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,348
I need you to apologize.

513
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,144
Cuddy's only doing this
because she thinks it's you.

514
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,146
Welcome to the world.

515
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,606
Everyone's different, everyone
gets treated different.

516
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,651
And you try fighting that,
you wind up dying of TB.

517
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,946
What are you doing?

518
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,699
Testing the patient's
autonomic nervous system.

519
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,826
Of course.

520
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,495
His internal heating
and ventilation should be off.

521
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,122
He shouldn't be able to sweat.

522
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,207
That's why he's got
that awful body powder.

523
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,128
Take it away, crank up the heat,
stick him under the lights,

524
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,465
he can't cool himself. He
should be turning bright red.

525
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,175
The picture's fine.

526
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,887
Yeah.

527
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,477
I'm asking Stoia Tucker

528
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,146
to save these lives,
millions of lives,

529
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,440
including my own.

530
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,234
Dr. House, I would appreciate
it if you left us...

531
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,777
Get that out of my face.

532
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,571
What are you
trying to prove, House?

533
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,199
Dr. House, I would appreciate it
if you left the room while...

534
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,700
He's sweating like a pig.

535
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,119
It's 100 degrees in here, House,
because you turned up the thermostat.

536
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,122
Did they hear me?
The media, did they listen?

537
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,750
- He's disoriented.
- They have to hear me.

538
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,878
- His arteries are clamping down.
- I want everybody out of here now!

539
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,671
Get the crash cart.
He's having a cardiac arrest.

540
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,340
- Get it set up.
- All right.

541
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,674
Get them out!

542
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,136
Everyone. I want
everyone out of here now!

543
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,475
Clear.

544
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,773
Come on, Sebastian.

545
00:30:58,899 --> 00:30:59,982
Clear.

546
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,610
I've got sinus rhythm.

547
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:17,333
That is not TB.
Compelling television.

548
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,590
- Do whatever tests you want.
- I want to treat you for TB.

549
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,595
Dr. Cameron found low sugar
in your cerebrospinal fluid.

550
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,975
- It's a classic finding of TB.
- Oh, now you think TB's the problem?

551
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,476
No.

552
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,145
If TB caused
cardiac arrest on a hot day,

553
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,148
your work in Africa would be even
more futile than it already is.

554
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,984
Can you get
to your point, please?

555
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,612
That whiteboard in my office, we're
up to about a dozen symptoms now.

556
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,532
Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB.

557
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,951
CSF sugar clearly is TB.

558
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,203
The rest of them
could go either way.

559
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,582
Unless we know which ones are
which, I can't diagnose you.

560
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,256
I'll take any other tests or treatments
you might want to prescribe.

561
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,345
So you're not special,
but TB is.

562
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,640
People die of TB because we let them.
It's our choice.

563
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,893
People die of malaria because we let them.
They die of dysentery. They...

564
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,731
- No, TB's my disease.
- You own a disease?

565
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,526
Well, I'm sorry I missed
the IPO on dengue fever.

566
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,697
Look, I know I have a way about me, and
I know I piss a lot of people off.

567
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,949
And a whole lot more
I just annoy.

568
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,076
But you're the first person
that I've ever met

569
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,912
who I think is actually
annoyed by what I do.

570
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,791
Do you think I'm not saving any
lives, or is that a bad thing?

571
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,502
Right now, I'm just trying
to save your life.

572
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,838
Or do you just have
a problem with hope?

573
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,386
You know, the difference between
our jobs is not numbers or styles.

574
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,182
It's that I know I'm gonna fail.
Even if I save a million people,

575
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,519
there's gonna be another million.
You couldn't handle that.

576
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,065
I think you resent
anyone who can.

577
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,401
Can't we just agree that
you're incredibly annoying?

578
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,695
Take the pills,
or I'll let you die,

579
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,490
do an autopsy,
call my own press conference

580
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,534
and make sure the world knows
that you didn't die of TB.

581
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:19,080
Corporate sponsors will be disappointed,
but they'll find another disease.

582
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,956
Why would you do that?

583
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,542
Because I'm just a mean
son of a bitch.

584
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:37,950
So, we still have to explain PR
variability, syncope, headaches

585
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,452
and

586
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,704
low sugar?

587
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,707
- That was classic TB.
- Apparently not.

588
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,001
- You rerun the test?
- Yeah.

589
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,796
- This is good.
- Good? This is bizarre.

590
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,840
"Bizarre" is good.

591
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,218
"Common" has hundreds of explanations.
"Bizarre" has hardly any.

592
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,305
What else could cause
low CSF sugar?

593
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,848
I get to ask the questions.

594
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,685
I've found you look a lot smarter asking
questions than dumbly not answering them.

595
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,688
- High insulin levels in his blood.
- They'd have to be very high.

596
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,357
Okay, very high
insulin levels in his blood.

597
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,234
How could he get
high insulin levels?

598
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,070
We've checked daily blood
sugars, all normal.

599
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,865
See how smart she looks?
'Cause she asked the question.

600
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,993
And it's not glucagonoma
because he has no rash.

601
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,246
It's not self-induced
because he's not an idiot.

602
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:28,584
And it's not a tumor because the
CT and the MRI were both negative.

603
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,419
Which just leaves tumor.

604
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,604
Why do you do this? Why do you ignore
what I say like I'm not even...

605
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,970
Small tumor.
Really, really tiny.

606
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,639
So small we can't see it.

607
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,432
Nesidioblastoma.

608
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,727
An abnormal growth of the
insulin-secreting cells in his pancreas?

609
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,312
That only intermittently
secrets insulin...

610
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,772
In response to stress,

611
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,284
like if, I don't
know, if someone

612
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,693
accidentally puts the
mechanical bull on 11.

613
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,112
Easily removed by surgery.

614
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,658
Except if it's so small
we can't see it,

615
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,304
how are we even gonna
prove it's there?

616
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,786
She asked, looking clever.

617
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,790
Just start hacking away at his
pancreas until he gets better?

618
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,117
How do you prove something
exists when you can't see it?

619
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,962
Does God exist?
Does the wind blow?

620
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,131
- We know because the leaves move.
- Look for effects.

621
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,843
You should look the other way.

622
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,970
- There's Cuddy with your patient.
- Dr. House!

623
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,055
Dr. House has an emergency.

624
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,059
- We can't avoid her forever.
- Eventually she'll die.

625
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,936
You sure she doesn't
have breast cancer?

626
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,689
We think you have a tumor.

627
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,442
Easily removed surgically. We're
gonna poke it with a stick.

628
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,779
- And if there's no tumor?
- Nothing happens.

629
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,908
Splenic artery, it's a
hard left off the celiac.

630
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,953
If there is a tumor?

631
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,123
What usually happens when you
poke something with a stick?

632
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,624
Pokes back.

633
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
He's stuck in the
superior mesenteric.

634
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,797
I knew we should have
stopped for directions. Men!

635
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,841
I'm there.

636
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,386
We're gonna inject calcium
into your pancreas.

637
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,055
The beta cells
will release insulin.

638
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,725
If there are too many beta
cells because of a tumor,

639
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,853
your blood sugar
will drop precipitously.

640
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,147
How do we know
it won't go too low?

641
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,733
Fingers and toes crossed.

642
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,652
Go ahead.

643
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,793
Glucose is holding
steady at 75.

644
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:40,633
- No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
- I already gave him one amp.

645
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,261
Well, I guess now would be the time
to give him more than one amp.

646
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,652
Fifty. It's starting to drop.

647
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,367
- Forty-five.
- I think my arm's shaking.

648
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,735
I'm gonna start him on a glucose drip.
He's gonna seize.

649
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,912
Not yet.

650
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,875
- It's continuing to drop.
- Not fast enough.

651
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,177
- He's seizing.
- We've got to reverse this.

652
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:31,433
He's at 40, 38, 35.

653
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,695
Push an amp of D50.
You want to kill the guy?

654
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,956
We're back to 40.

655
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,669
Congratulations.
You have a tumor.

656
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,300
Are you gonna go out with him?

657
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,139
- Is that any of your business?
- Nope.

658
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:12,808
I don't think so.

659
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,103
Two days ago, you were holding his hand.
What's changed?

660
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,607
He practically lives in Africa.
There's no future.

661
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,653
On the other hand, maybe there's
too much of a future now.

662
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,657
You weren't attracted to him because
he was prepared to die for a cause.

663
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,744
You were attracted to him because
he was actually doing it.

664
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,913
- Right. It's that simple.
- That was simple?

665
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,875
I put a label on him and go from there.

666
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,626
Everybody does it.

667
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,837
We are who people think we are.

668
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,214
People think he's a great
doctor, so they give him stuff.

669
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,217
- He is a great doctor.
- The reality is irrelevant.

670
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,016
I'll prove it.

671
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:58,645
People who know me see me as
an ass, treat me as an ass.

672
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:02,357
People who don't know me see a
cripple, treat me like a cripple.

673
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:07,154
What sort of selfish jerk wouldn't
take advantage of that fact?

674
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,418
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

675
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,632
Yeah. I am so sorry.

676
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,634
It was completely my fault.

677
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,552
It's nothing. I'm fine.

678
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,514
Well, I'm very relieved.
I feel terrible.

679
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,059
- Please don't worry about it. I'm fine.
- You sure?

680
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,393
Okay.

681
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,657
How's everything?

682
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,409
I'm gonna go.
My foot's killing me.

683
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:58,038
- What did you do to...
- It was nothing. It was all my fault.

684
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,794
Yeah, listen.
Bogale, relax, okay?

685
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,463
I'm gonna be back on Tuesday.

686
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,800
Tell Sarni I'm gonna bring her
a new brace. All right.

687
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,929
- Just in case.
- You get them?

688
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,640
Six-months' supply.
Should fix you right up.

689
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,526
I'll see you when you
come back for a refill?

690
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,144
Yeah, I'll see you
in two months.

691
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,396
You gonna give them away?

692
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,816
Well, you know how these things happen.
You leave a bag on the airplane,

693
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,318
you drop some pills
down the drain.

694
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,948
I have an idea. You could bring
me the refill in Africa.

695
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,159
I don't think so.

696
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,204
You actually like working for House?
You find this satisfying?

697
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,738
There he is.

698
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,656
- It's good to see you. Dr. Sebastian.
- Thank you.

699
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,035
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I appreciate the support.

700
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,829
It's not about the kids
dying every eight seconds.

701
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,709
It's about the media stroking,
adulation, the pats on the head.

702
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,004
That's your problem
with him, isn't it?

703
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,924
Look at him.
Loves it, eats it up.

704
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,802
Yeah, the man actually
enjoys what he does.

705
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,102
Listen, I saved his life.

706
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,773
That means I get credit for every
life he saves from here on out.

707
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,442
I'll make sure Stockholm knows.
