1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,550
Good morning.

2
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,895
Hey, Alfredo.

3
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,025
- You done already?
- No. Not yet. I finish tomorrow.

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,320
- Mexico playing Argentina on TV?
- No, no.

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,490
My asthma is very bad today.

6
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,451
Six years, Alfredo.
You can't lie to me.

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,370
- I'm throwing a dinner...
- First thing tomorrow...

8
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,788
Party's tonight.

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,916
A little rain and I'm gonna have to
put buckets on the dining room table.

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,961
- No clouds, no rain.
- I'll tell you what.

11
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,423
You take off, but if it pours
into my guests' wineglasses...

12
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,885
- Okay. Okay, señora. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,433
Spinal cord seems intact.

14
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,060
Take a deep breath.

15
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,687
- It hurts.
- Try.

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,214
Breath sounds bilateral. I don't
think he has a pneumothorax.

17
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,359
- Just asthma.
- That and probably a broken rib.

18
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,861
Tell me when it hurts the most.

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,158
Your two little fingers
are darker than the others.

20
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,870
They feel funny. Como needles.

21
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,207
- How long have they been like that?
- Never noticed before.

22
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,374
Is bad?

23
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,411
Judging by how it looks,
he could lose his hand.

24
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,873
How does falling off your roof
do that to a guy's fingers?

25
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,334
He could have tweaked
a vertebra in his neck.

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,253
Could impinge the ulnar...

27
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,422
Sorry, trouble concentrating.

28
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,883
That tank top
really absorbs moisture.

29
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,846
Could impinge the ulnar nerve,
cut the blood flow.

30
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,140
Or it could be disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy.

31
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,559
DIC?

32
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,686
Guy falls off a roof,
the first thought is always,

33
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,852
"It's a clotting problem".

34
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,439
Trauma can activate
the clotting enzymes.

35
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,401
- Guy could lose more than his hand.
- Thank you very much.

36
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,486
This guy's been working for me
for a long time, and I...

37
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,281
Do I get bonus points
if I act like I care?

38
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,828
Cervical MRI. Work up for DIC.
And start him on a heparin drip.

39
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,413
- Who?
- You wanna know his name?

40
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,082
I'm sure it's in the file.
Or you could ask her.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,043
She's his oldest, bestest friend.
They were in Cub Scouts together.

42
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,795
I'll get started
on the blood tests.

43
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,839
You haven't been
a real doctor in 10 years.

44
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,526
You'll make a mess all over the sheets.

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,426
- I'll do it.
- You have clinic duty.

46
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,137
- I still know how to handle a patient.
- Get me blood.

47
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,930
Lots of blood.

48
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,974
They're better.
They've showered.

49
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,576
You don't need to see him.

50
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,746
One-handed handymen
aren't in big demand.

51
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,582
Talking. That's how
lawsuits are lost.

52
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,791
I know you, Lisa.

53
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,836
You go in, you offer
to pay his medical bills, his wages,

54
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,630
you'll say something stupid
like, "I'm sorry".

55
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,881
You think I'm an idiot.

56
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,717
I think you're not a lawyer.
Don't go in there.

57
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,638
Trust me, House's people
can handle this.

58
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,891
Yeah.

59
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,269
This might sting a little bit.

60
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,023
The medicine will thin the blood
and help it to circulate.

61
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,067
Those are pretty
nasty scars there.

62
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,527
I work construction.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,909
How long
will I be in the hospital?

64
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,411
Depends how long it takes us
to figure out what's going on.

65
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,372
I need to work. I'll get fired.

66
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm sure Dr. Cuddy
won't fire you.

67
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,751
I'm a janitor at fast food six nights.
I need to work.

68
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,317
- My mother doesn't make enough.
- I can work. I'm old enough.

69
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,061
You're old enough
when you finish college.

70
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,131
Why? You never went...

71
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,137
I never had a big brother
to tell me to shut up!

72
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,428
I promise we'll let you out of
here as soon as we're able to.

73
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,432
Look, I... I am fine. Okay?
I feel better. I go home now.

74
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,560
No. If this is a clotting problem,
it could be very serious.

75
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,437
- All right?
- Look, you can't make me stay.

76
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,898
- Wait...
- You can't make me stay.

77
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,566
Turn your hand over.

78
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,902
I need to see your hand.

79
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,118
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

80
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,036
We've got a third finger
turning dark.

81
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,248
His PTT is prolonged and the fibrin
split products are off.

82
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,251
He's not clotting properly.
It looks like a mild case of DIC.

83
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,919
Well, obviously not that mild.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,463
This keeps up, his hand is
literally gonna be dead meat.

85
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,717
His hand is connected to his arm,
and his arm is connected to...

86
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,363
I'm not sure,
but I bet it's important.

87
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,554
All this from falling off
my roof!

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,473
Yeah. If only he'd fallen
on his head.

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,268
Then he wouldn't have any
of these symptoms.

90
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,563
We need something
stronger than heparin.

91
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,191
Human Activated Protein C.

92
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,569
Looks like Cuddy,
same cleavage.

93
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,281
Protein C is indicated
only for severe sepsis.

94
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,867
How many of his limbs have to be
at stake for it to be severe?

95
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,619
But this stuff
is crazy dangerous.

96
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,204
It can cause internal bleeding.

97
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,581
If he bleeds, he could stroke,
he could die.

98
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,874
He could get better.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,959
You know, if I try
to scheme like this,

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,254
you get that nasty wrinkly
face and screech like a hyena.

101
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,089
It's very sexy, I admit.

102
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,842
Do it.

103
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,932
Protein C
is borderline irresponsible,

104
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,101
except that the safe stuff
isn't doing squat.

105
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,396
- It's exactly what you would do.
- Obviously.

106
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,317
- It's exactly what he'd do.
- I know.

107
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,486
I think he's trying
to protect me.

108
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,072
Now, that's not
the type of thing he would do.

109
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,281
I overruled him.

110
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,410
He's the best diagnostician in
this hospital, and I overrule him.

111
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
You care about this kid.

112
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,290
Your judgment
should be worth more than his.

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,169
He also pointed out that I haven't
been a real doctor in years.

114
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,213
Now that sounds like him.

115
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,006
You were
just jerking Cuddy around?

116
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,592
She seriously thought
I wanted to stop her.

117
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,261
- One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.
- No.

118
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,306
First casualty of this case
is her sense of humor.

119
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,102
That's weird. There's nothing
funnier than almost killing a guy.

120
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,315
I'm just having trouble
getting up those steps.

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,276
- When did you start noticing?
- Oh, a week ago.

122
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,278
Your blood pressure's
a little high.

123
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,284
I've got something new
that should help you out.

124
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,741
It combines a nitrate
with a blood pressure pill.

125
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,285
It's targeted
to African-Americans.

126
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,662
Targeted?

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,498
Yeah. Well, see, we tend to
have nitric oxide deficiencies.

128
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,785
And the studies show this drug
counteracts that problem.

129
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,626
It's the first drug to...

130
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,878
What kind of studies you talking about?

131
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,588
What kind of studies are there?

132
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,508
They get some patients.
They give them some drugs.

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,387
I've had white people
lying to me for 60 years.

134
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,891
- You think this is a tan?
- You think they tell you everything?

135
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,342
The trouble with us black folk,

136
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,105
we can't tell the difference
anymore between racism

137
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,357
- and everybody gets screwed.
- Yeah?

138
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,319
Well, how about them cheap meningitis
drugs they're pawning off in Africa?

139
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,698
- Gonna tell me that ain't racism?
- That's just greed.

140
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,285
You really wanna screw whitey?

141
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,706
Be one of the few black men who live
long enough to collect social security.

142
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,332
Take the medicine.

143
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,265
Nurse.

144
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,560
Nurse! Help! Nurse! Help!

145
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,478
- Nurse!
- What's up?

146
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,441
- I can't move my arm!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,948
The Protein C side effects we were
worried about, they happened.

148
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,867
- Where was the bleed?
- His brain.

149
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,452
It's causing
right side paralysis.

150
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,622
I've stopped the treatment
and called a neurosurgeon.

151
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,579
I can move it now.

152
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,540
- It's okay now? Can I go home soon?
- The surgery went well.

153
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,752
But all we did was fix the problem
created by the medicine we gave you.

154
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,424
She says you... You look young.

155
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,093
Are you sure...

156
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,553
There's five of us working on the case.

157
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,639
The others are older.

158
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,808
Why doesn't Dr. Cuddy
come to...

159
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,731
That doesn't sound too good.

160
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,328
His fingers are even darker.

161
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,247
His temperature's 102
and spiking.

162
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,042
And the x-ray
now shows lung infiltrates.

163
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,921
Well, the good news is he won't be bitching
about losing his hand if he can't breathe.

164
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,300
The trauma from the fall could have caused
acute respiratory distress syndrome.

165
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,260
Right. I forgot. Your roof.

166
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,179
It would cause lung
infiltrates and maybe fever

167
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,181
and conceivably
the cyanotic fingers.

168
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,476
- The only question is why.
- Why what?

169
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,603
Why her weird psychopathology

170
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,774
requires a diagnosis informed
entirely by personal guilt.

171
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,235
Let's assume
we've been wrong up until now.

172
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,070
Let's assume,
just for one second,

173
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,032
that the earth doesn't revolve
around Cuddy's roof.

174
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,161
What if he was sick before he
had his run-in with gravity?

175
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,487
He just didn't notice anything.

176
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,373
Well, pneumonia can cause DIC
which can cause cyanotic fingers.

177
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,542
- Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.
- Sure.

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,129
Only pavement hits that fast.
It's not pneumonia.

179
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,602
He might have missed
a finger turning dark.

180
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,194
He's not gonna miss
breathing problems.

181
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,010
- What else?
- It's pneumonia.

182
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,264
He wanted to go home.
I thought he was lying.

183
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,476
I told him I had a dinner party.
I made him go up there.

184
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,388
Well, why didn't you just
take out a gun and shoot him?

185
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,147
I thought it was just asthma.

186
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,358
You might've mentioned this
earlier, Doctor.

187
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,069
Maybe we could have sent
some blood cultures to the lab

188
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,696
instead of wasting a day
indulging your self-loathing.

189
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,117
If it's just garden-variety bacterial
pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.

190
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,621
So give him garden-variety Levaquin,
and a garden-variety echocardiogram.

191
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,027
And go check out
the kid's house.

192
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,442
The blood work will show us which
type of pneumonia it is...

193
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,961
If he's huffing nail polish or pulling
the wings off his pet parrot,

194
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,380
this way'll be faster.

195
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,674
And I bet Julio's just dying to
find out what's wrong with him.

196
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,177
- Go with her.
- It's Alfredo.

197
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,846
And I can handle
getting a key and...

198
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,892
Rico and I no longer trust you deciding
what's important and what's not.

199
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,152
You ever think about writing
a book on office politics?

200
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,487
Trust me,

201
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,907
it would be a lot worse if I told her
that you had to break into her house.

202
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,120
What? Wait, wait, wait...
Cuddy's house?

203
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,830
See? It is shocking.

204
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,352
The guy's been working there every
day for the last three weeks.

205
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,335
You think it's impossible he
could've picked something up?

206
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,630
- I'm not breaking into my boss's house.
- I'm your boss.

207
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,507
She's scarier than you are.

208
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,469
She's a woman.
Relax. I'm coming with.

209
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,978
House is having lunch
with his juniors now?

210
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,730
- No. Not a chance.
- Then where do you think they're going?

211
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,150
I have no idea.

212
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,693
Then why don't you think
they're going to lunch?

213
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,020
Because it's not like House.
That was your point, right?

214
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,350
He had that smug look
on his face.

215
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,656
When he's that pleased
about something

216
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,302
he's gotta tell somebody, and the
only somebody he knows is you.

217
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,456
- He's breaking into Cuddy's home.
- What?

218
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,623
Why?

219
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,251
Medical reasons?

220
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,836
Why is he so curious
about Cuddy?

221
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,337
Why are you so curious
about his curiosity?

222
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,785
Why are you so curious
about me...

223
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,341
Because you dumped him
and you're married

224
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,012
and they are neither
of those things.

225
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,472
I'm just curious.

226
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,476
- Nothing wrong with that.
- No. Nothing wrong with that.

227
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,648
What do you think? Red thongs?

228
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,776
I think red thongs.

229
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,948
Okay, 20 bucks says I can get
through this door in 20 seconds.

230
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,700
- You're on.
- Count me in.

231
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,429
No furniture polish, no paint thinner,
nor anything else worth sniffing.

232
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,391
Nothing in here, either,
except a few cockroaches.

233
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,146
Nice. Someone
should fix Alfredo's roof.

234
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,652
So, why haven't you
fired House?

235
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,949
It's just, you guys are always
screaming at each other,

236
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,743
- and I figure you hate him, so...
- I don't hate him.

237
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,121
Why not?

238
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,167
He's a great doctor,

239
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,170
but any other hospital administrator
would have fired him years ago.

240
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,922
Four of them did.

241
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,258
The question is,
why did I hire him?

242
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,302
So, how'd you know
about her key?

243
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,514
You been doing a little handyman
work for Cuddy yourself?

244
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,434
Someone as obsessive and insecure as
Cuddy probably has three extra keys

245
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,228
hidden away
within 10 feet of the door.

246
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,481
And you consider obsession
a negative quality.

247
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,027
Insecticide is organic.
Soap is hypoallergenic.

248
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,780
I got the bedroom.

249
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,496
This is where it all happens.

250
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,380
You both went to Michigan. Did you
know him while you were there?

251
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,300
I was still an undergrad,
but, yeah, I knew him.

252
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,010
He was already a legend.

253
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,723
- So you just knew him as a legend?
- My God, you're subtle.

254
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,474
Anything on your mind?

255
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,606
- More cockroaches?
- Worse.

256
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,152
Beautiful.

257
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,740
There's no way you just
deduced where that key was.

258
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,491
Does this count as red?

259
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,371
You gave yourself 20 seconds
and put money on it.

260
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,497
Oh, my God.

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,460
She's got pictures
of you in here.

262
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,463
Just you. It's like some kind
of weird shrine.

263
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,340
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

264
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,516
She uses super tampons.
What does that mean?

265
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,646
You two are just too nasty to each
other not to have been nasty.

266
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,774
I can be a jerk to people
I haven't slept with.

267
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,275
I am that good.

268
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,527
There's nothing here.

269
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,364
You ready to go, or you got some
more stuff you wanna sniff?

270
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,199
Whoa! Check this out.

271
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:38,330
It's fuzzy. It's black.
It's alive.

272
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,274
Patient's lung function's
declining rapidly.

273
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,058
Levaquin's not working.

274
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,310
He obviously doesn't have
garden-variety pneumonia.

275
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,896
I'm glad you learned to take
his impending death in stride.

276
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,023
- Guess what he does have.
- Rats.

277
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,568
- Scars on his hand.
- Rat bites.

278
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,529
But he says
they're from construction work

279
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,740
so he won't have to admit
he's got rats at home.

280
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,492
Catholics are right.
Pride will kill you.

281
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,743
He has streptobacillus.

282
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,953
Rat-bite fever.

283
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,372
- Boogie oogie oogie.
- Fits the symptoms perfectly.

284
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,374
That's certainly
one possibility.

285
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,585
But what about the aspergillus
fungus we found under the sink?

286
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,214
- What sink?
- You should clean your bathroom better.

287
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,383
You broke into my house?

288
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,886
No. No. You're wrong.
I had a key.

289
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,888
You had no right
to invade my privacy.

290
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,015
There was no medical reason
for that whatsoever,

291
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,101
and there was certainly
no moral reason for it.

292
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,061
Oh, damn.

293
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,397
You're right.

294
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,150
The focal consolidation makes
fungal pneumonia far more likely.

295
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,484
You're right I'm right.

296
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,363
On the bright side, it has the advantage
of keeping you totally responsible.

297
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,365
The treatment for aspergillus
is amphotericin.

298
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,535
- That's hugely dangerous.
- Yeah? Your point being?

299
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,371
Going the dangerous and aggressive
route didn't work the last time.

300
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,875
It's bound to work this time.
Start him on the amphoterrible.

301
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,856
Dr. Cuddy?

302
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,401
I'm Manny, Alfredo's brother.

303
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,195
How's he doing?

304
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,114
He's worried about money.
I wanna work for you.

305
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,826
How old are you, Manny?

306
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,162
- Fifteen.
- Twelve?

307
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,708
I can paint. I mow lawns. I rake leaves.
I can start today.

308
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,419
Alfredo wants you
to finish school.

309
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,879
Like you care.

310
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,828
Manny, I've known
your brother...

311
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,135
He falls off your roof, and
you don't come see him once?

312
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,806
Bitch.

313
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,523
With a patient.

314
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,192
Not according to the log.

315
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,528
- It's 3:15.
- Is it a commercial?

316
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,656
How's Cuddy doing?

317
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,827
She's not acting like Cuddy.
It's a pleasure.

318
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,370
You know her.

319
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,665
She has trouble with these situations,
feels personally responsible.

320
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,376
The technical term
is narcissism.

321
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,086
You can't believe
that everything is your fault

322
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,588
unless you also believe
you're all-powerful.

323
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,465
Wow, does she sound messed up.

324
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,343
I don't believe
I can fix everything.

325
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,804
And I don't lie awake at
night, tormented by that fact.

326
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,639
No. You lie awake
tormented by how...

327
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,766
I thought we were talking
about Cuddy here.

328
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,059
She cares.

329
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,187
She enjoys feeling guilty.

330
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,066
Lisa cares. It's why she drives you nuts.
'Cause it's not just a puzzle to her.

331
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,432
The patients are actually real,

332
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,236
their feelings
actually relevant.

333
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,406
And I'm telling her
she can't even talk to him.

334
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,617
My God, it's contagious.
You're feeling guilty, too.

335
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,704
I'm just saying, take it easy on her.
You owe her that.

336
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,831
From the moment
I saw you at the EI...

337
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,459
- Commercial's over.
- So glad we talked.

338
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,462
Snap, crackle, pop.

339
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,008
You got some
Rice Krispies in there?

340
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,385
That bad, huh?

341
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,387
You were here yesterday.

342
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,808
I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman
prescribed medicine, not a miracle.

343
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,268
Got to give this stuff
more than a day.

344
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,604
I didn't fill
that Oreo's prescription.

345
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,983
On the theory that you didn't
trust him because he's black.

346
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,904
Well, I'm gonna prescribe the same
medicine and see if you fill it this time.

347
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,406
I'm not buying
into no racist drug, okay?

348
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,244
It's racist because it helps black
people more than white people?

349
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,623
On behalf of my peeps, let me just say
thanks for dying on principle for us.

350
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,375
Look, my heart's red.
Your heart's red.

351
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,669
And it don't make no sense
to give us different drugs.

352
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,339
You know,
I have found a difference.

353
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,786
Admittedly,
it's a limited sample,

354
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,551
but based on my experience
of the last 90 seconds,

355
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,137
all black people are morons.

356
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,307
- Sorry, African-Americans.
- I'll see another doctor.

357
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,310
Fine. Fine.

358
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,525
I'll give you the same
medicine we give Republicans.

359
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,115
I think the medicine
is working.

360
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,410
They're lighter, right?

361
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,330
They don't look lighter to me, Alfredo.
How's the tingling?

362
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,083
- Does not bother me.
- Tell her the other thing.

363
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,254
He hasn't peed since yesterday.

364
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,675
- Since last night?
- Afternoon.

365
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,511
It's not a problem.
I don't drink much.

366
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,849
I think we'll give you a little
rest from the meds here.

367
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,939
She says, "That's the medicine
that's supposed to cure me".

368
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,525
Just making a little adjustment.
Excuse me.

369
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,862
He's not making any urine.

370
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,824
I think we just destroyed the kid's
kidney with the amphotericin.

371
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,701
I think he's dying.

372
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,411
Dying?

373
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,121
Cheese it, the cops.

374
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:20,296
I guess she understands
a little English.

375
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,594
His kidneys are shutting down

376
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,723
due to the direct toxicity to
the proximal tubule epithelium.

377
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,101
Proof that my brilliant idea of giving
him amphotericin is killing him.

378
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,020
That wasn't a complete
waste of time.

379
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,981
His reaction shows that you don't
need to clean under your sink.

380
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,065
It wasn't aspergillus.

381
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,651
And blood cultures show he was
negative for rat-bite fever.

382
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,154
There's still plenty of other
cool pneumonias.

383
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,574
Tested negative for Moraxella,
Nocardia, cryptococcus.

384
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,326
He has a low titer for
chlamydia antibodies. Maybe...

385
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,038
No, no. His chest x-ray's all
wrong for chlamydial pneumonia.

386
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,204
But the titer points to...

387
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,750
- He had an STD last year.
- That explains the titer.

388
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,626
He has low sodium.
Maybe it's Legionella.

389
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,879
No. His antigen is negative.

390
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,089
Well, that all sucks.

391
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,384
Maybe we were right
to begin with.

392
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,972
His problems are all caused by DIC
precipitated by falling off my roof.

393
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,349
DIC wouldn't cause
a fever this high.

394
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,769
See? My lap dog agrees with me.

395
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:16,895
How high?

396
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,439
Two hours ago
it was 103 with acetaminophen.

397
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,691
What about on St. Alban's Day?

398
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,820
Only temperature I'm interested in right
now is his temperature right now.

399
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,119
Open up.

400
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,041
Okay. Let me clarify.
Open up and keep it open.

401
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,757
- Yeah.
- Okay.

402
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,969
Under your tongue.

403
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,351
You're using your left hand.

404
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,187
- Right one hurt?
- No, I feel better.

405
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,473
What, it really doesn't hurt,

406
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,803
or you just figure
if you say no,

407
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,024
you'll get out
of the hospital sooner?

408
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,193
It doesn't hurt. I feel good.

409
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,074
You don't smell too hot.

410
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,416
Your hand is starting to rot.

411
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,585
Why are we here?

412
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,337
We are talking about
cutting off a kid's hand.

413
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,047
Yes, we're talking
about cutting it off,

414
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,049
not subdividing it
and putting in condos.

415
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,344
- It's not a legal issue.
- Are you being intentionally dense?

416
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,805
I think it's premature.

417
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,265
- I've heard enough.
- What?

418
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,267
She says one word
and you take her side.

419
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,061
You should at least wait until she
actually gives a medical reason.

420
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,064
- Otherwise I might take it personally.
- Shut up.

421
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,442
If I were to somehow find out
that you two were in disagreement

422
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,236
over the proper
medical course of action,

423
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,488
it could make it awkward
for my client in court.

424
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,409
My client being the two of you.
So, guys, I'm a little busy here.

425
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,538
Why don't we pick this conversation
up in half an hour? Okay?

426
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,124
All of his symptoms are caused
by his underlying problem

427
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,625
and the medicine we gave him.

428
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,751
What underlying problem?

429
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,587
You have no idea what the
underlying problem is.

430
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,006
- You're the diagnostician.
- Fine. It's all my fault.

431
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,332
Does that make you feel better?

432
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,967
His hand still has
an arterial pulse.

433
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,887
His hand is a cesspool.
And the crap is spreading.

434
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,473
You are being pretty aggressive about
destroying a man's livelihood.

435
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,201
I don't give a damn
about his livelihood.

436
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,645
He loses that hand, he loses
his job, all of his jobs.

437
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,315
- He's not like us...
- Can't work as a cripple?

438
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,861
He loses his home.

439
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,156
- His kid brother drops out.
- An American dream destroyed.

440
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,657
Very sad, very emotional,

441
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,410
not one medical fact
in the whole pathetic tale.

442
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,829
You have lost perspective,
Cuddy.

443
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,635
You've stopped looking
at this as a doctor.

444
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,584
You're acting like someone who
shoved somebody off their roof.

445
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,962
You wanna make things right?
Too bad, nothing's ever right.

446
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,175
I am happy to report
that we're now so in sync

447
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,552
we're actually wearing
each other's underwear.

448
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,137
Chop-chop time.

449
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,973
- Is this true?
- No. I'm lying.

450
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,684
It's stupid to do it with her
in the room, I guess.

451
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,770
- This is a big decision.
- We made it.

452
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,772
We should convene a meeting
of the ethics committee.

453
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:06,981
No!

454
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,653
Look, she is making a medical decision
based on never wanting to feel regret.

455
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,280
You're making a legal decision
based on wanting me to be wrong.

456
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,865
Greg, you have
a history of aggressive...

457
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,408
You wanted
superficial agreement.

458
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,454
You wanted everybody's asses covered.
You got it.

459
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,330
Now can I do the surgery?
Pretty, pretty please.

460
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,835
Lisa,

461
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,673
are you sure
you're okay with this?

462
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,970
I should be the one
to tell the family.

463
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,561
Your hand is dying.

464
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,065
The bacteria are eating it.

465
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,987
When they run out of food
there, they go somewhere else.

466
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,866
If you cut off my hand,
I'll be cured?

467
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,743
Unfortunately, no.

468
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,789
We still have to find the disease
that's making you sick to begin with.

469
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,834
But you won't die of gangrene
while we're looking.

470
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:18,094
I quit school
when I am 12 to get a job,

471
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,971
to help my family.

472
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,933
I know I never get a good job,

473
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,980
never save money
or own my own house like you.

474
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,110
But, Manny, he's smart.

475
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,780
He's the best in his class.

476
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,335
Well, maybe Manny doesn't
have to quit school.

477
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:42,994
Maybe you can...

478
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,965
Are you sure I need to do this?

479
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,761
Yes.

480
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Okay.

481
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,809
Okay.

482
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,042
I gave one of my clinic
patients a follow-up call.

483
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,919
Your name came up.

484
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,880
I'm guessing an old black guy

485
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,676
who thinks the CIA invented rap music to
make your people want to kill each other.

486
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,220
He said you gave him
the white folks' stuff.

487
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,092
This is exactly why black
people don't live as long...

488
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,810
This isn't about race,
unless annoying is a race.

489
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,396
- Is he not getting better?
- He's fine so far.

490
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,525
I'm calling him back in. I'm
getting him on the right stuff.

491
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,986
Relax, Foreman, he already is.

492
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,408
I told him it was the white stuff.
I gave him the black stuff.

493
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,079
He was right.

494
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,748
You did exactly
what white people do.

495
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,960
You figure we don't need to know
the truth or can't understand it,

496
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,296
so you just lie to us.

497
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,007
- Just a white lie.
- Good one, massa.

498
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,509
Right, and I'm a racist.

499
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,973
Too bad that idiot will never know
for the rest of his long, long life.

500
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:20,526
Every slave master thought they
were doing the black man a favor.

501
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,114
Negro can't take care of himself,
so we'll put him to work.

502
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,950
We'll give him four walls,
a bed.

503
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,370
We'll civilize the heathen.

504
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,998
I'll tell you what.
Stop doing us favors.

505
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,293
If you're right, and we end up
back in the jungle

506
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,629
with lousy
blood pressure medicine,

507
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,006
it won't be on your head.

508
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,352
You okay?

509
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,233
You wondering
if you made the right call?

510
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,988
I've wanted to be a doctor
from the time I was 12.

511
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,866
I wanted to be a lawyer
from the time I was six

512
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,952
until my second week
of law school.

513
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,704
Sorry. Your story.

514
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,085
I graduated medical school at 25, pissed
off that I was second in my class.

515
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:06,632
Chief of medicine at 32, second
youngest ever, first woman...

516
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,758
Sad story.

517
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,885
If I had been
Alfredo's doctor...

518
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,512
You are his doctor.

519
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,809
I insisted on giving him Protein C.
We had to cut his skull open.

520
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,187
I insisted on amphotericin,
killed his kidneys.

521
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,481
I missed the pneumonia
completely.

522
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,694
I would have searched his home
and ignored mine.

523
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,781
I would have watched him die
trying to save his hand.

524
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,911
If I didn't have House
looking over my shoulder...

525
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,497
Are you saying you're not as
good a doctor as House is?

526
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,249
I'm saying House is right.

527
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,003
I was so anxious to get ahead.

528
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,923
I haven't been a doctor
in years.

529
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,093
His little finger is dusky.

530
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,179
Yeah, that's why
we're doing this.

531
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:57,016
No. I mean the other hand, the
one we haven't chopped off yet.

532
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,795
His O2 sats are down to 88.

533
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,631
His lungs are giving out.
He needs a ventilator.

534
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,508
And dialysis.

535
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:34,220
You're getting distracted by
the multisystem organ failure.

536
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,056
Pinkies are supposed
to be pink, right?

537
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,849
I mean,
they're not called "gray-ies".

538
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,768
But the organ failure
is gonna kill him.

539
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,645
But the pinky is weirder.

540
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,522
What does it tell us?

541
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,732
The same thing the right hand
told us before we cut it off.

542
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,652
- It's the same symptom.
- But at a different time.

543
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,239
His blood work
indicates mild DIC.

544
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,867
What if it's mild in the way that
when you get out of the ocean,

545
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,537
the water clinging to your
body makes the sea level drop?

546
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,539
It's technically true, but
it's completely irrelevant.

547
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,083
A lack of DIC
would explain everything

548
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,961
if there were also
a lack of anything to explain.

549
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,299
Endocarditis.
His heart's infected.

550
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,721
Little bacteria cauliflowers,
clinging to his valves.

551
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,224
Except sometimes they can't hold on.
They go swimming in his bloodstream.

552
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,935
Thursday, one breaks off,
goes to his right hand,

553
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,520
black fingers, gangrene.

554
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,856
Friday's child
heads for the kidneys.

555
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,151
And we all know
what Saturdays are all about.

556
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,278
Party with the left hand.

557
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,612
Also explains the fever.

558
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,698
It's perfect
except for the little fact

559
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,491
that we already tested
for endocarditis,

560
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,534
and he was negative.

561
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,287
Which means he either
is negative or...

562
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,207
What infection can cause pneumonia
and culture-negative endocarditis?

563
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,670
Prize value goes down
with every clue.

564
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,259
You're thinking psittacosis?

565
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,052
Alfredo doesn't have
any pet parrots.

566
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,513
Quit your squawking.
Give him doxycycline.

567
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,974
No! That'll just make
his clotting problem worse.

568
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,519
I liked you better when you were coming
up with wacky drugs for us to try.

569
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,064
We give him the doxy now, damn
it, maybe we can save his pinky.

570
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,066
He can teach his brother
to count all the way to five.

571
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,111
If you're wrong, he'll end up
with no hands and no feet.

572
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,031
Technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end
up dead, but I take your point.

573
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,637
- What's his night job?
- He cleans up at some fast food joint.

574
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,581
What, you think he got it
from a chicken nugget?

575
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,539
Since when do fast food joints
allow 12-year-olds to mop floors?

576
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,751
- Alfredo is 20.
- Really? Looks younger.

577
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,381
Where were you going
to work tonight?

578
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,634
What job do you do
on Saturday nights?

579
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,846
- What are you doing?
- Wake him up.

580
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,515
We just cut off his hand.

581
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,643
- Yeah. We need to talk about it.
- It's not happening.

582
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,818
Honest, I've got no idea
what I just said.

583
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,153
Why didn't you say
you spoke Spanish?

584
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,489
Well, because
she'd wanna talk to me.

585
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,533
Or something like that.

586
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,540
She says he doesn't work
Saturday nights.

587
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,833
Give me the talking juice.

588
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,200
The fact it doesn't fit your
theory doesn't make it a lie.

589
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,169
When she was out of the room,

590
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:16,215
the kid brother insisted he was gonna
cover for Alfredo at work tonight.

591
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,058
Saturday nights
he goes dancing.

592
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,727
Either it's a lie
or he's dancing with birds.

593
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,728
Give her the talking juice.

594
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,524
She doesn't know
what you're talking about.

595
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,067
Odds are it's gonna be
close to his house.

596
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,528
It's probably an abandoned
warehouse or factory.

597
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,822
Take the Scooby gang
and spread out.

598
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,448
What the hell
are we looking for?

599
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,242
Find somebody
who looks like crap.

600
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,494
Tell him you want
to place a bet.

601
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,342
It's Cuddy.

602
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,971
I already put him
on the psittacosis meds.

603
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,016
As soon as you left.

604
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,517
You're welcome.

605
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,980
What do you think the record
for one-handed juggling is?

606
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,650
You can yo-yo one-handed.

607
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,693
Good point.

608
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,954
I always wash my hands.

609
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:15,084
If a bird is infected, you can get
psittacosis just from breathing his dust.

610
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,545
But then, why do I get sick
and nobody else?

611
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,673
Your asthma
made you vulnerable.

612
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,679
- You're gonna be all right now.
- Yes.

613
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,608
For saving my life.

614
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,828
He thanked me.

615
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,497
- He should have.
- We cut off his hand.

616
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,584
If we'd figured it out
earlier...

617
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,586
If you'd figured it out later,
he'd be dead.

618
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,880
I never figured it out at all.

619
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,592
- Hello.
- What do you want, House?

620
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,431
If you're wallowing in self-loathing,
I've got something that might help.

621
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,890
We're getting sued.

622
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,561
- You saved his life. He admitted that.
- We'll settle.

623
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,605
He's got a stub where his hand
used to be. We have insurance.

624
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,566
Case seems pretty solid to me.

625
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,194
The new American dream.
Happy ending.

626
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,155
Kid's gonna be just fine.

627
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,370
Cuddy,

628
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,665
your guilt.

629
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,627
It's perverse and it makes you
a crappy doctor.

630
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,467
It also makes you
okay at what you do.

631
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,846
You figure a perverted sense
of guilt makes me a good boss.

632
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,767
Now, would the world be a better
place if people never felt guilty?

633
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,769
Makes sex better.

634
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,980
You should have seen her in the
last months of our relationship.

635
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,274
A lot of guilt.
A lot of screaming.

636
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,863
I know this wasn't just
because it was your roof.

637
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,367
Cuddy,

638
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:19,083
you see the world as it is, and
you see the world as it could be.

639
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,835
And what you don't see
is what everybody else sees,

640
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,422
the giant gaping chasm
in between.

641
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,508
House, I'm not naive.
I realize...

642
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,177
If you did,
you never would have hired me.

643
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:37,392
You're not happy
unless things are just right,

644
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,061
which means two things.

645
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,690
That you're a good boss,
and you'll never be happy.

646
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,366
By the way, why does everybody
think you and I had sex?

647
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,452
You think there could be
something to it?

648
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:09,341
Cuddy feels guilty about not
diagnosing psittacosis any earlier?

649
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,262
I think so.

650
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,557
There's no way she could have.

651
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,350
No.

652
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,854
No way she could have.

653
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,408
It's raining.
