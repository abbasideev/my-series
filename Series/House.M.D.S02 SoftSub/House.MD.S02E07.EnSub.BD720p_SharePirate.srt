1
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:02,919
My offer's withdrawn.
You can walk to work.

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,587
Got it. You're morally outraged.

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,465
Now, can we get through this part?
'Cause the next part's awesome.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,550
How do you rationalize
something like this?

5
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,719
You broke into Stacy's therapist's
office.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,889
- Borrowed a key.
- And stole her treatment notes.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,102
Nope. I made copies.
"Mark is," and I quote...

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,271
"withdrawn, passive
aggressive, won't communicate,

9
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,899
"like he resents me because I can walk."

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,528
- I don't wanna hear this.
- "Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up."

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,406
Meanwhile,
she can't stop thinking about...

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,618
I can't read that, is she
obsessed with a gray horse or me?

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,955
It says she thinks
you're an annoying jerk.

14
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,875
It's a pet name. Here's the kicker.

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,132
They're not having sex?

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,303
Doctor cleared him, but no lift-off.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,265
She's frustrated,
so she's doc-blocking me.

18
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,393
Paperwork, seminars,
meddling with my patients.

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,999
But now you've got
the proof you need,

20
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,105
just take those personal
psych records to Cuddy,

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,774
and that'll show her
Stacy's out of control.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,526
You ignoring me?

23
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,779
While looking for my newspaper.
Efficient, huh?

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,031
Over here.

25
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,704
Dr Wilson,
I want you to meet my stalker.

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,458
- Your waiting room sucks.
- I am not treating you.

27
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:28,254
- Because you're a closet case?
- We're not together.

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,466
He is so self-loathing.

29
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,718
But we gotta go now.
So, maybe see you after work.

30
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,094
No, no, no, no.

31
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,349
Nobody can figure out
what's wrong with me.

32
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,062
Well, your shirt is gaping at the
collar. That means you've lost weight.

33
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,357
You're flushed, that's fever,
and you're short of breath.

34
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:52,028
And finally, there's the KS lesion on
your face. It means you're HIV positive,

35
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,613
and you've progressed
to full-blown AIDS.

36
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,659
So you're sick
because your immune system is shot

37
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,075
and someone sneezed on you.
May I be excused now?

38
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:02,121
Brilliant, but my immune system is fine.

39
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,540
Your concentration-camp physique
begs to differ.

40
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,460
- Get your T-cell count re-checked.
- I've already done that.

41
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,755
- They test for T-cell lymphoma?
- It was negative.

42
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,008
All of this will be fascinating
to an HIV specialist.

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,636
Now let go of my cane
before it becomes your new boyfriend.

44
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,222
Honey, I will marry it
if you will look at my file.

45
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,766
Congress says you can't, so...

46
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,153
I didn't touch him.

47
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,531
He's going into anaphylactic shock.

48
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,359
- Go see Stacy.
- We gave him epi. He's fine.

49
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,988
You need a lawyer.
Go see Stacy. You hit a patient.

50
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,449
Four words, two mistakes. He's not
a patient, and I didn't hit him.

51
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,976
Of course you didn't. Go see Stacy.

52
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,788
I didn't cause the anaphylaxis.
It's probably one of his HIV meds.

53
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,540
- Abacavir.
- I'll pass that along,

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,127
make sure the ER takes him off it.
Go see Stacy.

55
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,757
- You have to treat him.
- Medically, this case is a snooze-fest.

56
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:37,925
AIDS plus infection.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,971
You don't treat him,
he charges you with assault.

58
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,763
Just 'cause he says I hit him,
doesn't make it true.

59
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,142
Watch,
I am surrounded by naked cheerleaders.

60
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,768
See?

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,647
Although, I like my chances
of some action this morning.

62
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,693
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day.
This could have waited.

63
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:01,532
You make me meet you at your house.
Your husband is conveniently absent.

64
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,745
Mark's at physio.
I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator.

65
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,080
I saw a rat last night.

66
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,542
Well, I'm surprised
your feet are touching the floor.

67
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,921
- I barely slept.
- What was Mark up to?

68
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,840
If memory serves,
a quick climb up Mount Gregory,

69
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,761
and you'd doze through a seal hunt.
Clubbing, shrieking.

70
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,804
What're you doing?

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,390
Sorry, it was just driving me nuts.

72
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,434
You hate washing dishes.

73
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,437
People change.

74
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,861
I could make sure
you'd sleep like a baby tonight.

75
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,574
Rather take care of it myself.

76
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,871
- I was referring to the rat.
- Trenton Pest is sending a guy.

77
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,877
What's going on?

78
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,547
It's not what you think.

79
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,759
I know it looks like we're cleaning
dishes, but actually we're having sex.

80
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,094
We're working.

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,640
Wow, wish I had become a doctor.
Place would be spotless.

82
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,853
Take 10 minutes,
cure the guy, and stop whining.

83
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:21,737
I give you Kalvin Ryan, so flamboyant
in person, so boring on paper.

84
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:26,409
Obviously got an opportunistic
infection, probably TB or PCP.

85
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,828
Have you read his file?

86
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,665
I started, but I found
the characters two-dimensional.

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,792
He went to an HIV clinic last week.

88
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,838
Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC,
CMV, HSV.

89
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,132
- It's not an infection.
- HIV clinic.

90
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,134
So few patients, so much money.

91
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,469
- Redo the tests.
- The results make sense.

92
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,681
Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.
That's strong enough to fight infection.

93
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,768
- Fine, parasite.
- Nope. The stool sample was negative.

94
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,021
Two months ago,
he was down to 30 T-cells.

95
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,064
Then he changed his meds,
his immune system rebounds,

96
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,777
his viral load drops, everything's
getting better, but he's getting sicker.

97
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,323
Face it.
This might be an interesting case.

98
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,332
What if his immune system
is too strong?

99
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,587
An auto-immune disease?
With HIV, that's impossible.

100
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,674
His new HIV meds
kicked his system out of a sound sleep.

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,178
It wakes up hungry, cranky,
spoiling for a fight.

102
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,513
And when it doesn't find
an active infection,

103
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,850
it starts attacking the harmless
remnants of old infections.

104
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,227
Immune reconstitution syndrome.

105
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,940
His meds made him so much better,
he made himself sick?

106
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,650
- Sounds pretty...
- Boring!

107
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,527
This is so not interesting.

108
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,156
Chest x-ray to find the old infection
and start him on steroids.

109
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,997
If you're wrong, the steroids will tank
his immune system. He'll get worse.

110
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,042
Now that would be interesting.
Where's the Coumadin?

111
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,253
If your patient's got a blood problem,
then blood thinners aren't exactly...

112
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,257
It's for Stacy's rat.
Death by anticoagulation.

113
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:10,846
Trying to win Stacy back
by killing an animal. Very caveman.

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,309
I don't want her back. I just want her
to admit her feelings for me.

115
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,769
I go to Cuddy,

116
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:21,732
Cuddy fires her or reassigns her.
Either way, I'm happy.

117
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:26,445
If you want her back,
either tell her or, better yet,

118
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,824
shut up and cry yourself
to sleep like everybody else.

119
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,702
Hi, this is, Mark Warner,
1724 Spring Street.

120
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,289
Listen, you don't need to send
that guy down. We caught him.

121
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,960
No, you should send the bill
to Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital,

122
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,170
attention Dr James Wilson.

123
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,679
Your lymph nodes aren't swollen,
that's good.

124
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:57,017
- Maybe Dr Chase should check.
- Sorry, mate, hands full.

125
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,563
He's too pretty to be straight.
You ever done any modeling?

126
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,690
Does anyone actually fall
for that line?

127
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,732
Every day.

128
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,985
Why do you think
I became a photographer?

129
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm guessing you guys
didn't think about dating on career day.

130
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,076
- I love my job.
- Really?

131
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:19,290
You seem more the "find it
exceptionally satisfying" type.

132
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,292
I'm not sure there's a difference.

133
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,086
Your mom died of diabetes.
How's your dad's health?

134
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,422
Last I heard, he had cirrhosis.

135
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:33,846
Love is love. Satisfying is
"social validation, fun can wait."

136
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,514
I have fun.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,975
Yeah, she's got some
scheduled for February.

138
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,060
Last you heard, your father?

139
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,355
He threw me out when I was 16.
It's just as well.

140
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,401
I got tired of getting BB guns for
my birthday when I'd asked for a Barbie.

141
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,987
Dads can be real sweethearts.

142
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,364
Sensitive and cute.

143
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,826
He's cute.

144
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,963
He ran into that heating vent, right
there.

145
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,677
Hopefully,
Mark's anger will go away eventually.

146
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,598
He's not angry, he just doesn't
like you. Nothing unique there.

147
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,143
Didn't seem real wild about you,
either.

148
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,853
He's fine with me.

149
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,606
He's angry. Said so in group.

150
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,610
Of course he's angry. He's looking
at months of painful physio.

151
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,489
- He's mad at you.
- There's no way he said that.

152
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,536
No. But it's true.

153
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,414
He resents you for being able to walk.

154
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,087
Been there.

155
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,968
I resented you for a hell of a long
time.

156
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,264
Past tense?

157
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,190
Might be the hospital.

158
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,283
What?

159
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,243
Bad time? Where are you?

160
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,413
At your girlfriend's place.
Ignore the moaning and squeaking.

161
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,623
His lungs are too scarred
to tell which infection triggered

162
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,376
the immune reconstitution.

163
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,877
He a smoker?

164
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,380
Yes, and possibly
more than cigarettes.

165
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,300
His tox screen came back
positive for recreational drugs.

166
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,011
Not surprising, not medically relevant.

167
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,554
His heart looks a little enlarged.

168
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,432
That's a typical side effect of AZT.

169
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,392
What are Kalvin's
most recent infections?

170
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,685
Toxo, CMV,

171
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,978
and PCP.

172
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,817
Well, let's assume it's one of those.

173
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,194
Give him ganciclovir for the CMV.

174
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,196
We can hardly hear you.
Where are you?

175
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,364
In a closet.

176
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,492
Your girlfriend's
other boyfriend showed up.

177
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,204
Ganciclovir for the CMV.

178
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:09,460
Sulfadiazine for the toxo,
Bactrim for PCP.

179
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:15,090
Gotta go. It's killing time.

180
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,578
Your tox screen came back positive
for...

181
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,499
Crystal meth and ecstasy.

182
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,086
Recreational drugs are dangerous to
begin with, but for someone with HIV...

183
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:57,341
I didn't mistake them for vitamins.
I'm a PNP boy.

184
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:02,388
Party and Play. Drugs and sex.

185
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,770
You don't approve?

186
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,232
Does the sex include condoms?

187
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,360
If he's negative, sure.
If he's positive...

188
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,780
Why put on a raincoat
if you're already wet?

189
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,324
You could get hepatitis,
or another strain of HIV.

190
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,571
Or I could get hit by a bus.

191
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,830
- AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore.
- I don't wanna have any regrets.

192
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,795
How long have you been coughing?

193
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,048
About an hour or so.

194
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,553
Try to take a deep breath.

195
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,475
- What is it?
- I think it's blood.

196
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,159
I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis.

197
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,411
Your chances of conversion are slim,

198
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,248
but I'd like to put you
on three anti-viral medications.

199
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:15,586
Nelfinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine.

200
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:20,507
There are side effects,
headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.

201
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:27,097
You'll be tested for HIV at six weeks,
three months, six months.

202
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,978
Very interesting.

203
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:37,399
He coughs infected blood in Cameron's
eyes and mouth, that's interesting?

204
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,736
The "coughing" part,
not the "in Cameron" part.

205
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,323
New symptom,
blood vessel ruptured in his lung.

206
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,158
I closed the tear.

207
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, it takes immune reconstitution
off the table.

208
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,914
What's it put on the table?

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,750
It's okay, she's not here,
you can skip the nice-guy acts.

210
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,253
You know, some human beings
are actually capable of human feelings.

211
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,340
My giving a damn or not
is not gonna change what happened.

212
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,636
- Could be Goodpasture's syndrome.
- No edema, no bloody urine.

213
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,096
Well, KS on his face
could mean KS in his lungs,

214
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,056
with bleeding from the lesions.

215
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,683
I would have seen them
when I repaired the tear in his lung.

216
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,352
Wegener's granulomatosis?

217
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,104
Wegener's
would have responded to steroids.

218
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,233
Maybe you should go home,
take the rest of the day.

219
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,943
I'm fine.

220
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,321
Well, this is good.

221
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,616
He's pretending to care,
you're pretending not to.

222
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:32,037
I think we should reconsider drugs.
Kalvin uses crystal meth.

223
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,665
Concerned enough about
his health to stalk me,

224
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:40,337
while indulging in deadly street drugs.
A study in contradictions.

225
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,798
Interesting,
but still not medically relevant.

226
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,175
It could be, if his drugs were tainted.

227
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,220
They cook meth
with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...

228
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:54,226
Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins.
Foreman, you're with me.

229
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,901
- I need a consult on another case.
- We have another case?

230
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,028
It's a hip-pocket deal.

231
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,739
Patient presents
with a distinct neck tilt.

232
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,785
- Wry neck. Is he an athlete?
- He's a regular runner.

233
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,081
- Any pain associated with movement?
- None that he's complained of.

234
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,585
Best-case scenario,
an infection in the ear or lungs.

235
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,837
Worst case, brain-stem tumor.

236
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,007
You should do an MRI,
CAT Scan, full work up.

237
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,052
I don't think so. No insurance.

238
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,560
No drugs in here. I'll take the
bathroom.

239
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,441
How about a drink after work?
Take your mind off what happened.

240
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,697
Cameron?

241
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,783
I might have HIV,
a drink's not gonna wash it away.

242
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,536
There's like zero chance
of you contracting the virus.

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,789
Big difference
between "like zero" and "zero."

244
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,792
What did
the infection control guy tell you?

245
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,836
He was very reassuring.

246
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,423
Kept reminding me that the hospital
covers all my medical costs.

247
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,842
Apparently forgot to mention
that if I do test positive,

248
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,595
that they'll pass it on to legal,
and legal will dig up any dirt they can,

249
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:17,184
trying to prove that I'm a drug user
or tramp, and that's why I have HIV.

250
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,437
It's not like they're
gonna find anything, right?

251
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,980
Right.

252
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,524
Check this out.

253
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,319
Kalvin's a photographer.
The broken bulbs were props.

254
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,781
- The glass is from 1930s fluorescents.
- Some of the bulbs are date-stamped.

255
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,825
Pre-World War II, fluorescent bulbs
contained large amounts of beryllium.

256
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,163
Beryllium dust inflames the lungs,
they get rigid, patient can't breathe.

257
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,793
My father co-authored
a paper on acute berylliosis.

258
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,338
Phew! For a moment there,
I thought you were smart.

259
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,717
Cameron, get a biopsy of Kalvin's lung
tissue, run a spectrographic analysis.

260
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,927
I can handle it.

261
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:56,932
No reason to risk exposing the entire
team. Then who would I torment?

262
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,025
I'm sorry. About what happened.

263
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:12,239
It's best not to talk.
You're gonna feel a sharp pinch.

264
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,409
This actually is gonna grab
a piece of your lung.

265
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,458
What were you guys looking for
at my hotel?

266
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,629
Your drugs. We thought
maybe you'd used toxic meth.

267
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,674
We'll know if you were exposed
to beryllium in a few hours.

268
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,346
Well, if you're still curious,
it's in my bag over there on the chair.

269
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:42,018
You brought drugs into the hospital?
Glad I wasted my time at your hotel.

270
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,063
I told you I used,
you didn't ask me for a sample.

271
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,023
You're not pissed about this,

272
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,151
you're mad because
I coughed blood on you.

273
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,821
- That was an accident.
- Would you stop being nice?

274
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,658
It's useless, and worse, it's boring.
Get angry!

275
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,577
I had one stupid night,
I end up with HIV.

276
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,747
Do you have any idea
how pissed off I was?

277
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,915
This wasn't your fault.

278
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,470
- You broke into my house?
- Well, I had to, Mark isn't here.

279
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,680
- He has physio.
- Oh, really?

280
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,391
- How's he doing?
- What happened with all the cheese?

281
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,771
Well, I had to get rid of it before
Steve McQueen ate any Coumadin.

282
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,773
I named your rat.

283
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,361
Steve's tilting his head.

284
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,781
Any neurologist will tell you

285
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,700
that suggests an infection
or a brain-stem tumor.

286
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,662
- Death cures both those things.
- We can't kill him.

287
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,083
If it's an infection, it could be caused
by something in your house.

288
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,920
Something that could affect you guys.

289
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,006
Smell this.

290
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,384
Does it smell like urine?

291
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,971
You missing any asparagus?

292
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:06,937
Okay, stuff these. If he doesn't
get better, then it's a tumor.

293
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,980
Then what, chemo?

294
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,109
Steve McQueen without hair?

295
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,362
It's a blessing he died young.

296
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,787
Hello.

297
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,790
Hi, honey.

298
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,085
I'm sorry I missed you, yeah.
I came home.

299
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,171
All right, I'll see you in a few
minutes.

300
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,592
Okay. Bye, hon.

301
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,065
Chest hurts.

302
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,671
Heart rate's a 100 and climbing,
could be an allergic reaction.

303
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,821
Neck veins are up.
Must be pericardial effusion.

304
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,823
There's no wheezing.

305
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,117
The tear in his lungs
must have reopened.

306
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,203
Kalvin? You're bleeding
into the area around your heart.

307
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,416
- I can't breathe.
- The blood's crushing your heart.

308
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,587
- Once we remove it, you'll be fine.
- If I die, please tell my dad...

309
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:17,924
- You're not going to die.
- Tell him sorry.

310
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,355
Where's the blood?

311
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,690
It's clear.

312
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,194
Only one other thing could cause this.
A tumor in his heart.

313
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,873
CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart,
and several smaller ones in his lungs.

314
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,250
That's why his heart's enlarged,
not the AZT.

315
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,585
You okay?

316
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,504
She's fine, probably getting bored
with the question.

317
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,674
Masses in the heart and lungs,
what kind of cancer are we looking at?

318
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,842
They may not be cancerous.

319
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,886
This is classic
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

320
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,971
HIV-positive patient
with a primary heart mass?

321
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,892
- It could be sarcoidosis.
- His lung tissue was negative.

322
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,436
Lymphoma's a death sentence,
sarcoidosis is treatable.

323
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,981
So is an ear infection, but since he
didn't test positive for that either...

324
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,609
I want to do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.

325
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,032
Do you have any idea how much
paperwork Cuddy's gonna need signed?

326
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,578
Do it.

327
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,834
So...

328
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,128
How's the patient's father?

329
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,216
"Tell my dad I'm sorry?"

330
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,677
Might as well have waved
a red flag at a bull.

331
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,221
He's not coming.

332
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,515
Well, it's not a tragedy.

333
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,643
Dad doesn't wanna see him,
he doesn't wanna see the dad.

334
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,645
You're the only one
who wants them together.

335
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,815
- He asked.
- He thought he was dying.

336
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,025
Dying people lie, too.

337
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,070
Wish they'd worked less,
they'd been nicer,

338
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,280
they'd opened orphanages for kittens.

339
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:09,285
If you really wanna do something, you do
it, you don't save it for a sound bite.

340
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,916
What did you say
when you thought you were dying?

341
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,045
On the other hand...

342
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:26,136
His dad tossed him out.
So what's our guy wanna apologize for?

343
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,764
Everybody has regrets.

344
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,565
If the growths in your lungs
and heart are sarcoid,

345
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:43,820
your body will recognize this material,
and we'll see a reaction on your arm.

346
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,160
- Did you really wanna see your dad?
- You called him?

347
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,414
Thanks.

348
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,376
He would've come,
tried to straighten me out.

349
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,587
How are you holding up?

350
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,923
- I'm fine.
- Convincing.

351
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,593
What did you do with my drugs?

352
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,803
The lab disposes of them
after analysis.

353
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,891
Too bad.
They could've done you some good.

354
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,102
Not really my thing.

355
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,357
You know, I hope you don't have it, but

356
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:26,654
getting HIV might have been the
best thing that ever happened to me.

357
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:31,242
I used to be a good boy.
Never wanted to piss anybody off.

358
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:37,665
Playing by the rules
makes everybody else happy.

359
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,003
Now I'm happy.

360
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,052
So you just show up
every time he's at physio?

361
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,179
Of course not.

362
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:55,100
Also when he's at group therapy
or out for dinner with friends.

363
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:59,104
And when she happens to mention
to Mark that you dropped by...

364
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,564
You tell your wife everything?

365
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,110
It's a process.

366
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,824
But Stacy doesn't have any reason
to hide this from Mark.

367
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,910
As far as she knows,
Mark's okay with you being there.

368
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,538
My bet is she mentions me
to Mark as little as possible.

369
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:20,166
Because she thinks that he thinks
that she still has feelings for me.

370
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,669
You know why she thinks that?

371
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,171
Because she still has feelings for you?

372
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,592
If you're right, she did tell him and
I don't get through the door tonight.

373
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,970
If I'm right...

374
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,108
So how long do we stay here?

375
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,235
Until something happens.

376
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:50,989
He's not gonna come out
with us right here.

377
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,493
We are downwind,
and he seems to have hearing loss.

378
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,787
He's not blind.

379
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,040
Steve McQueen
does not run from danger.

380
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,754
Antibiotics, on the other hand...

381
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,591
He ate around the pill?

382
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,095
- Smart.
- Admit it, you like him.

383
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,640
He's all right. For a rat.

384
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,310
You wanna know how cool he is?

385
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:26,941
His urine showed traces of
hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead.

386
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,902
He's a smoker.

387
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,448
Your husband's been lighting up,

388
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,035
which is particularly stupid,
given that it could cause his AIP...

389
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:41,122
Okay, I blow my smoke
into the vent so Mark doesn't know.

390
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,250
I always knew.

391
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,543
Bluffing.

392
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,423
You started two weeks
after my surgery.

393
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,636
- Menthols, then lights after a month.
- Why didn't you say anything?

394
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,805
'Cause it helped me monitor
your misery level.

395
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:05,063
One trip outside was a good day,
and upwards of six, you were in hell.

396
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,816
You could have asked me how I was.

397
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,028
I already knew.

398
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,866
I'm sorry you were miserable.

399
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,747
Sorry I caused you so much pain.

400
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,646
Glad you changed your mind
about that drink.

401
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,022
Come on in.

402
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:53,111
You should get changed, there's this
new place on campus that looks...

403
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,537
- Are you high?
- Uh-huh.

404
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,793
I thought the lab
disposed of the drugs.

405
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,169
Not all of it.

406
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,259
Slow down.

407
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,053
Your pupils are dilated. You're not...

408
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,432
Come on, Chase,
don't turn into a good guy on me now.

409
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,801
You're late. And hung over.

410
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,639
Or maybe not.

411
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,975
Why do you have a rat?

412
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,352
Jealous?

413
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,402
- Get out of my room!
- Don't you dare put this on me!

414
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,529
I'm not gonna grovel, Dad!

415
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,366
- That's not what I'm asking for!
- Like hell it isn't!

416
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,410
- You said you didn't call.
- Well...

417
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,580
Don't mind me,
just here for the show.

418
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,750
Yeah, well, there's not gonna be any.

419
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,293
What happened to the big apology?

420
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,046
Yesterday he was all,
"Daddy, I'm so sowwy."

421
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,381
This is none of your business.

422
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,966
Well, you should've thought of that
before you stalked me.

423
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,053
Now I'm interested.
So what's he got to apologize for?

424
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,659
- You're the one who tossed him out.
- Now why would I do that?

425
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,266
I don't know, because it's tough
to brag to your hunting buddies

426
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,227
that your son knows
all the words to The Wiz.

427
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,854
- That's a lie.
- 42nd Street?

428
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,107
Much easier just to get drunk
and beat him.

429
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,568
Explains his hating you,
and also your cirrhosis.

430
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,780
Also, why the more I talk,
the more you sweat.

431
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,952
What it doesn't explain,
is why he's got to apologize to you.

432
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,623
Residual guilt for sharing
your special toy with other boys?

433
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,875
Just leave it alone.

434
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,670
You just wanna leave the bigot with
some peace of mind after you're gone?

435
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,090
This has got nothing, and I mean
nothing, to do with him being gay.

436
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,635
Now Kal brought this on himself
with what he did to his mother.

437
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,680
- He steal her signature look?
- No.

438
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,515
No, he killed her.

439
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:39,444
- Kalvin lied!
- Yeah. That certainly is shocking.

440
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,781
Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed
a transplant, they tested Kalvin,

441
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,617
he was a match,
he was also positive for HIV.

442
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,620
Mom never found
a qualified donor, she dies.

443
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,999
Tragic tale.

444
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,836
Undercut slightly by the rapid-fire
delivery and constant movement.

445
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,546
Too much coffee this morning?

446
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,799
He didn't kill her. Our bodies
aren't donor farms for our parents.

447
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,094
It's not 1980.
We know how HIV is transmitted.

448
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,182
If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected
sex, dad has every right to be pissed.

449
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,226
- So you always use a condom?
- Yeah.

450
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,270
Brothers on the down-low got to.

451
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,397
I'm not ready
for any Foreman Juniors yet.

452
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,108
- You?
- Working girls are sticklers.

453
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,695
You're not gonna poll Chase?

454
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:28,034
- I'm not an idiot.
- Obviously not.

455
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,538
Who doesn't sleep with a drugged-out
colleague when they have a chance?

456
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,961
Where's Wilson?

457
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,590
We got the result of the Kveim test.

458
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,932
But so...

459
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,934
I have cancer?

460
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,605
In all likelihood, yeah.

461
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,649
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

462
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,070
And I am...

463
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,696
dying?

464
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,619
We need to biopsy the tumor.

465
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:16,541
It's near your aorta, so getting
that sample carries serious risks.

466
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,543
Is my dad still here?

467
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,921
He hasn't been in?

468
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,346
We'll inject a dye around your heart
to make the tumor visible on the CT.

469
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,267
Then a surgeon inserts a guide wire,
runs it up into your heart,

470
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,768
where he takes a small piece
of that tumor

471
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,355
so we can look at it
under the microscope.

472
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:45,152
- Ativan. It'll help settle you down.
- Why are you so calm?

473
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,488
Not coming off meth helps.

474
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,410
Last night probably
shouldn't happen again.

475
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,246
Do you think I want it to?

476
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,291
When two people have had sex,
unless it sucks,

477
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,793
if they can do it again,
they're gonna do it again.

478
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,713
And that's when things get complicated.

479
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,966
And it didn't suck.

480
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,806
So now you've gotta drum up
another excuse

481
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,434
to be around the love of your life.

482
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,394
Could hit another patient.

483
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,522
Yeah, don't like to repeat myself.
People will say I'm formulaic.

484
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,289
Well, that rules out letting
the rat go so you can catch him again.

485
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,484
I can't do that.

486
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,321
Steve needs two weeks' antibiotics
and a smoke-free environment.

487
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,448
Cigarettes aggravated his infection.

488
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:34,118
The rat is actually sick? That thing
could infect the entire hospital.

489
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:37,455
Steve's infection
is not contagious to humans.

490
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,957
I'm an idiot.
How do I miss mycoplasmosis?

491
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,292
Was that the kid's father?

492
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,170
Yeah. Remember the Black Death?
It started with rats.

493
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,631
Well, what's he doing in the hallway?
Is the kid getting his biopsy already?

494
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,132
He just won't go in the room.

495
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,926
Who knows what else he has,
parasites, bacterial infection?

496
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,388
- The kid doesn't have parasites.
- Not the kid, the rat.

497
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,434
- Was he still sweating?
- Rats only sweat through their tails.

498
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,436
Not the rat, the dad!

499
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,567
- Where are they from?
- Montana. What's going on?

500
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,696
You were right, it's a parasite.
Cancel the biopsy, it'll kill him.

501
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,908
Hey, Daddy, come with me.

502
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,371
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

503
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,084
Your son asked to talk to you.

504
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,713
Why is he here?

505
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,010
He wanted to talk to you.

506
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,348
Did you two used to hunt together?
Foxes? Did you kill foxes?

507
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,100
It's Montana.

508
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,853
Those masses in your chest
are not tumors.

509
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,399
They're parasitic cysts
from a bug called echinococcus.

510
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,236
Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard,
they can hunker down for decades.

511
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,322
Growing, spawning,
shopping, putting on plays.

512
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:59,078
- I've been tested for parasites.
- Okay, it's cancer. You happy?

513
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,497
The cysts isolate the parasites,

514
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,834
keeping them from showing up in stool
samples. Even in blood tests, cardiac...

515
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
All right, you don't need me for this.

516
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,463
But you've got
the same things in your liver.

517
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,008
I have cirrhosis.

518
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:17,138
Liver cysts have identical symptoms,
with one addition, fever.

519
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:21,934
And liver cysts we can test for.
Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's.

520
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,854
So, option A, we draw some blood...

521
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,689
No, no, no.
Look, you're not touching me.

522
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,566
Well, you see,
this is why I need you here.

523
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,194
I want you to tell your son that you
won't take a simple, painless blood test

524
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,321
to save his life.

525
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,463
You

526
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,800
never expressed a shred of regret
for what happened to your mother.

527
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:55,968
Jeez, Dad.

528
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,763
If you'd have worn a damn rubber,
you'd have been fine.

529
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:03,184
You could have saved her life.
You wouldn't be lying here.

530
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,187
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!

531
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,073
You're really mad at him
for killing himself,

532
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,774
and for destroying everything you love.

533
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,443
I don't have time for this.
Are you gonna apologize?

534
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,613
- I'm living my life the way I want.
- Are you gonna give me some blood?

535
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,491
Look, if he doesn't give a damn,
then neither do I.

536
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,618
Okay, option B.

537
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,162
Why did your wife kill herself?
Did she hate you?

538
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,206
She was a diabetic!

539
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,374
You know, you don't know a thing
about my Susan.

540
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,295
Either Susan wanted to die,
or she was both fat and stupid.

541
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,838
Used a Twinkie instead of a gun.

542
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,257
And girls with big appetites,
well, they just can't get enough

543
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,425
- of anything.
- Shut up!

544
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,511
Probably nibbled
on every Devil Dog in the county!

545
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,346
- Shut up!
- In case I'm not making myself clear,

546
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,016
- I don't mean the delicious snack.
- You son of a bitch!

547
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,812
Yeah? Come on!

548
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,856
Thank you. Means I can do this.

549
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,610
We're gonna need some epi in here,
stat!

550
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,530
- Are you out of your mind?
- You said you didn't care.

551
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,410
Notice how you can't breathe?
Now, either that's the cane

552
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,038
or, I just ruptured one of those liver
cysts we were chatting about,

553
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,084
and you've gone into anaphylactic shock.
Exactly the same way your son did

554
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,877
when he accidentally
tripped against my friend's car.

555
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,421
I'm just so excited to find out which.

556
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,972
I'm gonna schedule the surgery.

557
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,811
Clamp.

558
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,481
Pressure's holding.

559
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,083
Give me the syringe.

560
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,978
Clamps...

561
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:19,445
Two successful surgeries,
two lives saved. I'm over my quota.

562
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,196
Can I have next week off?

563
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,160
- Two family members assaulted.
- It was self-defense.

564
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,705
- You baited him.
- You're right, I was asking for it.

565
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,666
The low-cut blouse, the do-me pumps.

566
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,086
You flooded his gut with a parasite.
He could sue.

567
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,173
Go see Stacy.

568
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,717
Okay.

569
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:49,308
That's it, "okay"? No name-calling?
No squawking, no rending of garments?

570
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,310
I like this t-shirt.

571
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,816
You lied to me.

572
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,861
If this is about my mom, I...

573
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,447
This is about your lonely,
miserable life.

574
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,324
I'm not miserable.

575
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,745
And as long as there's a gay bar around,
I'm never lonely.

576
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,289
You haven't had
a single visitor except for your dad.

577
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:17,169
Drugs are great, HIV freed you,
your dad hates you, you're so happy.

578
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,837
Everything's a lie.

579
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,090
You blame yourself
for your mom's death.

580
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,009
You're not trying to have fun,
you're trying to self-destruct.

581
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,388
You wanna kill yourself, fine,
but stop recruiting!

582
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,232
Heard you hit another patient.

583
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,070
Yeah, sure, why not?

584
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,738
He hit me first.

585
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,492
Cuddy didn't mention that.
Let me see.

586
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,624
- I'm the doctor.
- My concern is purely legal.

587
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,212
- Looks okay. Does it hurt?
- A little.

588
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,007
You need some ice.

589
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,432
There's no way
that Mark doesn't know.

590
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:18,022
- About the smoking.
- He would have said something.

591
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,277
Then he hasn't been near you
in months.

592
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,656
We're fine.

593
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,120
- Can't be easy.
- Stop squirming.

594
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,090
- Why would you lie about this?
- I'm not lying.

595
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,270
I don't care if you're sleeping
with him or not, but you're not, so...

596
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,181
- I am.
- You're lying.

597
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,810
You know when I have sex?
You can smell that on me, too?

598
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,958
The only people who know about
what's going on with me and Mark,

599
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,275
- are me and Mark.
- Well, I just know you.

600
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,201
And I know you.

601
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,578
You're confident, arrogant,
but you're never certain

602
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:19,333
unless there's a reason to be certain.
One other person knew.

603
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,294
I told you I was seeing Dr Harper,
you can easily get into her office.

604
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:30,420
You read my file.

605
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:44,233
The dishes, the concern,
the acting like a human being.

606
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,151
You have...

607
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,323
This whole time,
you've been manipulating me.

608
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,951
You knew that I had an angle
the moment

609
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,495
I poured soap onto a scrub brush.

610
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,624
You could have thrown me out
or ignored me

611
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,000
or found another exterminator.

612
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,211
You didn't
even tell Mark that I kept coming by.

613
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,339
You let this happen
because you wanna be with me.

614
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,386
I don't anymore.

615
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,431
Get out.

616
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,044
I'm sorry.
