1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,879
- Two spades.
- Three hearts.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,507
It's all yours.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,801
I'm void.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,512
And that's five.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,808
And that's six. Not bad.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,812
On a slam contract, you normally
wanna play your winners early.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,148
- Sorry, Daddy.
- You're learning. You're doing fine.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,151
Connie Gilman's a good player.
And a widow.

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,114
I should take her out
because she can play bridge.

10
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,324
You're a true romantic.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,412
You should ask somebody out.
You think Cecile's not dating yet?

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,580
Cecile was dating before she left.

13
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:40,665
Oh, shut up, Marv.

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,710
Nope. I have a partner
and she's doing great.

15
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,712
Amy should be out having fun.

16
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,716
- I'm having fun.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,177
Look like you're having
the time of your life.

18
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,353
One no trump.

19
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,568
I-I'm just a little nauseous.
I think I ate too much.

20
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,655
- Can we take a break?
- Of course. Excuse us.

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,744
- What did you eat?
- Nothing weird.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,787
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Dad, you know...

23
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,789
Because I don't mind if you...

24
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,124
Dad?

25
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,465
Dad? What are you doing?

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,597
You're scaring me! It hurts! Let go!

27
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,766
What are you doing?

28
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,851
Henry!

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,480
Henry, let go of her!

30
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,359
The occasional drink
doesn't bother me, but...

31
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,655
- What?
- Are you okay?

32
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,407
What's the matter?

33
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,828
You had what's called
an absence seizure.

34
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,579
Anything like that happen to you before?

35
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,914
No, nothing.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,209
He's been really healthy.
He jogs, he eats right, he...

37
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,087
Well, I did have a headache last Sunday.

38
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,174
And for the past two years
I've been getting acid reflux a lot,

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,761
and I thought that antacids
were all I needed.

40
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,388
Should I have come in sooner?

41
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,390
For acid reflux and a headache?

42
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,649
Well, I... You know, I hear
the coffee downstairs is really good.

43
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,734
Could you get me a cup, honey?

44
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,824
Would you mind closing the blinds?

45
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,748
His right testicle
was almost twice as big as his left.

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,751
- Cool.
- It's probably testicular cancer.

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,962
No. That's impossible.

48
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,213
The symptoms all indicate...

49
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,424
The shoes aren't right.

50
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,554
Here's how testicular cancer
would manifest itself.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,807
First, the patient would get
the exact symptoms that he's got.

52
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,726
Then Foreman would examine him.

53
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,519
Then he'd suspect testicular cancer

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,688
on account of the symptoms
being so perfect.

55
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,566
Then he'd stick a needle in it,
then he'd call a surgeon.

56
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,612
And while that guy operates,
the rest of us would be out bowling.

57
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,157
And, since we're not
wearing bowling shoes,

58
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,492
the disease obviously
did not progress in that fashion.

59
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,370
LP showed some white cells.
But his MRI's clean.

60
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,874
Sure. If you call a microabcess
in his brain "clean."

61
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,628
What, you don't trust me?

62
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,088
Are you're talking
about the left temporal lobe?

63
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,673
Neat, you can see through my hand.

64
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,967
- It's just a shadow.
- Or it's an infection.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,844
When guys have brain-crotch problems

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,805
it's usually the result of using
one too much and the other too little.

67
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,934
Blood and urine were negative
for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,977
So treat him for all three, stat.

69
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,355
Negative means he doesn't have it.

70
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,357
No, negative means
he probably doesn't have it,

71
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,983
which means he probably has cancer.

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,189
I thought we were wearing
the wrong shoes for cancer.

73
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,821
We're wearing the wrong
shoes for testicular cancer.

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,575
They're perfect for lymphoma.
Except Chase's, they're just goofy.

75
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,036
Lymphoma could cause infiltrates

76
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,871
in his reproductive organs
and his brain.

77
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,374
If it's this advanced,
he's dead no matter what we do.

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,961
So give him the STD meds
and hope the tests were wrong.

79
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,054
Who's the lucky woman?

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,681
My wife.

81
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,058
No, I don't wanna know
who gets the chocolates,

82
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,894
I wanna know
who you're having the affair with.

83
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,563
He fell on his head as a child. Tragic.

84
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,941
Norwegian chocolate.

85
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,194
Frankly, you buy that stuff,
the terrorists win.

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,365
Some people bottle up their feelings,
have them come out as physical pain.

87
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,160
Healthy human beings express feelings,
such as affection, by giving gifts.

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,079
Gifts express guilt.

89
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,415
The more expensive the expression,
the deeper the guilt.

90
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,916
That's a $12 box.

91
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,836
Either you haven't slept with her yet
or she wasn't that good.

92
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,796
It's not all about sex, House.

93
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,840
Really? When did that change?

94
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,595
I wanna get Depo-Provera.

95
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,267
Actually, at your age,
as long as you're careful,

96
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,769
the risk of you getting pregnant
is pretty limited.

97
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,772
Yeah, but it would calm me down, right?
If I get a high enough dose.

98
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,652
You mean "calm" as in a peaceful lake
on a cool summer evening?

99
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,406
Or in the lesser-used meaning
of nothing can ever bother you again

100
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,283
because life has absolutely no meaning.

101
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,578
High dose of Depo-Provera
will chemically castrate you.

102
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,163
Yeah.

103
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,295
Okay, I'm gonna get up to leave now.

104
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,422
I'm gonna walk to that door,
turn the handle,

105
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,633
and then you're suddenly gonna decide
that you have to tell me the truth.

106
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,136
I'm gonna have to turn around,
come all the way back.

107
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:32,183
You see, the thing is, my leg hurts. Can
we cut the walking out of the equation?

108
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,060
I love cows.

109
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,151
Any particular variety?

110
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,945
Guernseys? Holsteins?

111
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,472
Which are the black and white ones?

112
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,282
Oh, God.

113
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,077
I pass a farm on my way to school.

114
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,123
And they're so beautiful,
they're so majestic, I dream about them.

115
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,921
Leather shoes, hamburgers.
How could anybody do that to a cow?

116
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,882
Make love, not belts. That's beautiful.

117
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,218
- I haven't actually...
- Relax.

118
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,553
This is something we doctors
deal with all the time.

119
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,057
I'm gonna write you the name of a drug.
You don't need a prescription.

120
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,809
And it looks just like Depo-Provera.

121
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,436
- But does it do the same thing?
- Oh, God, no.

122
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,690
That stuff has all sorts of nasty
side effects. It's real medicine.

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,778
No, this is all you need. Your frat
buddies will be completely fooled.

124
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,823
You can tell them
how appalled the doctor was.

125
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,491
Lots of laughs.

126
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,662
We think you may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,205
No. It's not possible.

128
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,166
Sir, maybe we should speak in private?

129
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,709
Have you tested him for this?

130
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,877
The tests were negative.

131
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,923
Well, then it's not that.
So, what else could it be?

132
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,925
Nothing good.

133
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,970
If you've been having sex
you have to tell me.

134
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,807
I have not had sex since my divorce!

135
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,273
I didn't ask him to take the medicine.
I asked you to give him the medicine.

136
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,775
- He hasn't had sex in over a year.
- He's lying.

137
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,360
He knows what's at stake.

138
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,863
We should start treating him
for lymphoma right away.

139
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,531
Maybe if we hit him hard and fast.

140
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,866
Wilson!

141
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,993
How long can you go without sex?

142
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,839
How long can you go
without annoying people?

143
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,872
No, seriously. A week, a month?

144
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,206
I'm not having an affair!

145
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,708
I didn't say you were.

146
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,544
Not in this conversation.
We're talking about a patient.

147
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,630
People have impulse control.
We don't need sex.

148
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,384
Well, not like air. But as
a biological imperative, sure we do.

149
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,095
There's two things we get stupid for:
Money and sex.

150
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,764
And since money
rarely enters the bloodstream...

151
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,350
Was his daughter in the room
when you asked if he'd had sex?

152
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,228
I told him we could talk privately,
he didn't care if she was there.

153
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,190
It's almost noon.
The little girl would go to lunch.

154
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:48,235
As soon as she's out the door, you're
gonna get paged. Then you page me.

155
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,533
Lunch is early, huh?

156
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,543
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

157
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,005
I hear you'd rather die
than admit you had sex.

158
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:14,386
- Sorry. I couldn't tell my daughter.
- Right. Because she's, what, 22?

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,055
I slept with her mom.

160
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,851
She probably knows
that's happened already.

161
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,229
Roll over.

162
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,775
My wife had an affair. I forgave her.

163
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,696
She had another affair
and I forgave her again.

164
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,574
Amy thinks I was an idiot.

165
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,827
So smart.
You must be very proud. Roll over.

166
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,664
I assume you've been in love.

167
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,833
Is that the one
that makes your pants feel funny?

168
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,169
I'm starting you
on a cocktail of STD meds.

169
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,966
Amy is just getting over it.
She barely spoke to her mom for months

170
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,593
and if she thought
that it was happening again,

171
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,762
that that's why I got sick...

172
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,393
We just happened to be

173
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,313
at the same Italian
cheese-tasting thing.

174
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,275
Cheese is the devil's plaything.

175
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,652
It was just the one night.

176
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,154
You're obviously completely over her.

177
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,325
Amy thinks love leads you
to make stupid choices.

178
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,744
You're certainly setting
a good example for her.

179
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,496
Yeah. She just doesn't get it.

180
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,707
If you're not prepared to look stupid,

181
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,918
then nothing great
is ever gonna happen, right?

182
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,171
On the other hand,

183
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,800
I guess your testicles
aren't going to explode, either.

184
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,763
Dad.

185
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,349
Is everything okay?

186
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,061
I have a sexually transmitted disease.

187
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,814
How is that possible?

188
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,359
He met a woman in church.

189
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,449
Does she play bridge?

190
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,867
Does she...

191
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,041
Crash cart! Oh, God!

192
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,088
- Is this another seizure?
- Shut up!

193
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,965
Coming in!

194
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,092
Oh, God!

195
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,177
Here you go.

196
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,429
Forty milligrams furosemide.

197
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,389
Knock him out.

198
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,807
It's in.

199
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,526
How would an STD do this?

200
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,236
It wouldn't.

201
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,535
It was flash pulmonary edema.

202
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,455
We took a liter of fluid off
but the problem wasn't with his lungs.

203
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,125
It's his heart. There are vegetations
obstructing his mitral valve.

204
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,295
It's not an STD.
Lymphoma wouldn't erupt that suddenly.

205
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,505
So what is it then?

206
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,175
A disease that attacks his brain,
heart and testicles.

207
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,345
- I think Byron wrote about that.
- Could be psittacosis.

208
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,931
Chlamydia cultures
would've come back positive.

209
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,891
Strep viridians can hit the heart.

210
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,477
Wouldn't mess
with the reproductive system.

211
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:13,190
Maybe things aren't so nicely connected.
He's 65.

212
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,067
We could be looking at multiple
systems

213
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,653
just starting
to break down independently.

214
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,572
Way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

215
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,326
He's had acid reflux for years,
it can't be relevant.

216
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,288
Seems there are other ways to kill
people besides having sex with them.

217
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,508
You don't need this so much.

218
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,097
Problem is not your lungs,
it's your heart.

219
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:52,646
That Italian cheese thing at the church,
what sort of cheese?

220
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,022
Why do you need to know?

221
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm having a fondue party.

222
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,528
- Was it sheep cheese?
- Might have been, why?

223
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,488
- Was it soft?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,283
- Taste like crap?
- Yeah, bitter.

225
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,784
Taste like this?

226
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,456
Yeah, but how did you...

227
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,791
That was regular low-fat American.

228
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,043
I added some bacteria for flavor.

229
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,503
You fed him bacteria?

230
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,046
It's pretty much on everything.

231
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,425
Especially the unpasteurized sheep
cheese they make in the Alps.

232
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,469
That stuff will give you brucellosis.

233
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,139
Key to a long life:
Exotic women and boring cheese.

234
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,725
I'm gonna start you
on rifampin and doxycycline.

235
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,393
Doesn't make any sense.

236
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,396
I mean, nobody else
at the church got sick.

237
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,942
99.9% of Christians
have so much acid in their stomach,

238
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,195
they become churning cauldrons
of death

239
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,739
for all those nasty little
brucellosis bugs.

240
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,783
But you were taking antacids
for your acid reflux.

241
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,244
So that turns your digestive tract

242
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,248
into a pleasant scenic river
for all those bacterial tourists.

243
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,756
You sure you're right?

244
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,341
Absolutely. Your socks don't match.

245
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,467
Which means you got up
and got dressed in the dark,

246
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,149
which means you don't wanna
wake your wife,

247
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,388
which means you don't wanna
talk to her, which means...

248
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,932
I was referring to your patient.

249
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,099
Oh, that.

250
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,727
No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese.

251
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,414
How long before you get the tests back?

252
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,855
Well, we'll know before that.

253
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,067
If I'm wrong, he'll just keep getting
worse and slowly die.

254
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,112
And if I'm right, either we caught it
in time and he gets better,

255
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,741
or we didn't, and he goes
into cardiac arrest at any moment.

256
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,163
Paddles!

257
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,088
Charging. Two-fifty. Clear!

258
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,675
Charging! Three hundred! Clear!

259
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,011
Charging! Three-sixty! Clear!

260
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,596
Epinephrine.

261
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,822
- You gonna tell her?
- That you suspect an affair?

262
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,157
Sure. Well, she already hates you,
why not?

263
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,369
Because you think getting it off
your chest will let you sleep better.

264
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,497
It won't. You'll end up sleeping
on my lumpy couch.

265
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,623
There's nothing to tell.

266
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,917
Why are you playing foosball here
at 8:00 at night?

267
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,753
You always wanna simplify everything.

268
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,549
Boil it down to nice, easy equations.
Nice, easy answers.

269
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,428
Go home and have sex with your wife.

270
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,018
His heart is back in sinus rhythm.
There's a lot of damage, though.

271
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,478
It was brucellosis,
but we got to it too late.

272
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,647
The vegetation broke off
in his main coronary artery

273
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,024
and caused an infarction.

274
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,194
His heart muscle's half dead.
He'll be lucky to last a week.

275
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,488
Other than that, how's he doing?

276
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,534
Seriously.

277
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,289
His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils,
how's all that other stuff doing?

278
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,877
His brain is clear now
and so is the genito-urinary tract

279
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,212
and his kidney function is good.

280
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,175
So, all he needs is a heart
and he's out of here.

281
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,056
He's a prime candidate
for transplant.

282
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,933
Doesn't smoke, drinks moderately.

283
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,103
His tox screen was negative
for illegal drugs and legal ones.

284
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,689
Surveillance blood cultures show
absolutely no sign

285
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,524
of any lingering brucella bacteria.

286
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,610
He's 66 years old.

287
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,237
He told me he was 65.

288
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,697
Liar. I'm out of here.

289
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,035
There is an inverse correlation
between patient age and success rates.

290
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,370
He's in excellent health.

291
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,123
This was his first hospitalization
since breaking his leg at 23.

292
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,833
Or 22, I'm not sure anymore.

293
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,045
If this patient were to survive
the operation,

294
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,755
he'd get another, what,

295
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,300
five, 10, maybe 20 years
if he's very lucky?

296
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,054
So you're saying that old people
aren't as worth saving as young people?

297
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,807
He's saying that hearts
are a scarce resource.

298
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,518
- We have to choose criteria...
- No, I get it.

299
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,354
Women live longer,
so they should get preference, right?

300
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,856
And African-Americans,
they die a lot younger,

301
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,149
so to hell with them.

302
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,902
What, you think you're gonna
win me over by calling me a racist?

303
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,113
If the test is who gets
to use it the longest,

304
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,323
you can either be a racist
or a hypocrite.

305
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,743
Your patient had a life, a family.

306
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,287
We've got 18-year-old kids who...

307
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,415
How old are you, Doctor?

308
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,418
When do we get to toss you
on an ice floe?

309
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,211
And thank you, Dr. House.

310
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,005
Unless anybody else
has any further questions,

311
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,675
we will now go into private session.

312
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,388
Oh, I'm on pins and needles.
I wonder how you'll decide.

313
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,105
The Nets just won their third game
in a row, beat the Lakers.

314
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,777
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,738
They voted no.

316
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,825
So,

317
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,077
when

318
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,330
will I die?

319
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,461
You might have a week.

320
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,326
I wrote a letter
to the Board of Directors

321
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,703
appealing the transplant
committee's decision.

322
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,373
I'm alleging bias against you
clouded their medical judgment.

323
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,542
- I need you to sign.
- They made the right call.

324
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,711
You don't believe that.
You told the committee...

325
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,172
I was advocating for my patient.

326
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,388
Then why are you...

327
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,557
Advocating for my patient.

328
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,768
I've got that clinic duty.

329
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,396
I need you to get me the files
on everybody who dies here today.

330
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,941
You really think this thing
will change their decision?

331
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,192
Nope.

332
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,703
I think I broke my ankle.

333
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,872
I was kicked. By a hoof.

334
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm so in love. She was so beautiful.

335
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,587
Which one?
One of the black and white ones,

336
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,340
- I'm not sure what type...
- Not which type, which one?

337
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,883
I want a name.

338
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,512
- Why would it have a name?
- Not "it." "She." Or "he."

339
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,973
I wanna know her dreams, her hopes.

340
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,224
It's a cow.

341
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,686
Hey, I'm not the one
who said he was in love.

342
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,315
People who actually have
this condition rationalize it.

343
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,861
They dismiss it, they don't elevate it
to the level of poetry.

344
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,113
Plus there's a wooden splinter in there.

345
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,448
So, either you hit yourself
with a two-by-four,

346
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,200
or Elsie has a peg leg.

347
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,202
I'm off duty at 6:00.

348
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,163
Give yourself another whack,
come back and scam somebody else.

349
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,710
I'm sick! And you're a doctor,
you have a duty to help me.

350
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,462
Technically,
I don't have to treat anybody

351
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:20,051
before running a series of painful
and often humiliating tests.

352
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,516
Whatever you need.

353
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,935
90-year-old woman died of pneumonia.

354
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,813
Unless she has a bionic heart,
what's next?

355
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,941
Baby died in the ICU...

356
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,862
Babies are useless. They got hearts
the size of ping-pong balls. Next.

357
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,698
A 40-year-old male.

358
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,200
- Yes?
- Heart attack.

359
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,663
If you really cared about me,
you'd find me a better corpse.

360
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,541
There's no other deaths. There's one
woman who was in a car accident.

361
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,876
Bad one, I hope.

362
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,170
The organ procurement people
have been notified.

363
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,296
Give me her file.

364
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,840
It's in the ER,
they're still working on her.

365
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,509
Age? About 40.

366
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,219
Young, damn.

367
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,429
Young is good.

368
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,514
Smoker? Don't know.

369
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,558
- Find out.
- She's still alive.

370
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,684
Even if we get on the list,
we can't go near her...

371
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,853
Overweight?

372
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,855
She's on the hefty side.

373
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,399
Excellent. Our odds just went up.

374
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,318
What odds? What is this?

375
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,821
60% of potential donor hearts
get tossed in the trash

376
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,740
because there's something
wrong with them.

377
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,492
With fat people, it's closer to 80.

378
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,243
But if her heart's no good, then...

379
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,789
Big fat, sloppy heart beats
no heart at all.

380
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,851
- Are you Mr. Neuberger?
- Yes.

381
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,938
I'm Dr. House. I need to ask you
a few questions about your wife.

382
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,106
Is she gonna be okay?

383
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,066
I'm afraid I don't know that.

384
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,901
Could you tell me about her accident?

385
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,530
They think she fell asleep, went off
the road. That's all they told me.

386
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,490
Any problems with her health
up until now?

387
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,658
Why?

388
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,953
Please, it's important.

389
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,456
She had a fever today,
but otherwise she was...

390
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,334
- How high?
- About 101.

391
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,714
She hasn't missed a day
of teaching in years.

392
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,591
And I should've made her stay home.

393
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,219
Any other symptoms?

394
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,639
A stomachache. Who cares?
She was in a car crash!

395
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,725
- Mr. Neuberger? Yeah?
- My name's Ellen Stambler.

396
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,436
I'm the organ procurement coordinator
for southern New Jersey.

397
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,648
I just want to assure you that we'll
treat her organs with care and dignity.

398
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,985
Her organs?

399
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,865
Laura died?

400
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,909
I'm sorry, I thought...

401
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,329
She was just pronounced dead.

402
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,540
I thought he was telling you.

403
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,375
I didn't know.

404
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,879
You should never make assumptions.

405
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,467
What did you want from me?

406
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,055
I'm sorry for your loss.

407
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,766
But I need your wife's heart.

408
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,861
The organ procurement coordinator
just left the hospital.

409
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,364
Means we got lucky.
Either that or she's getting lunch.

410
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,493
Dead woman's last name
have a "U" or a "W"?

411
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,870
You're hacking into
a confidential patient file?

412
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,705
Is that a problem for you?

413
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
It's a "U". N-E-U.

414
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,001
Berger.

415
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:47,383
Three minutes ago, her organs
were officially declared "not viable."

416
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,719
Time to go dumpster diving.

417
00:23:58,813 --> 00:23:59,854
Hey!

418
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,899
She's got Hepatitis C.
Her ALTs are three times normal.

419
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,819
With Henry's immune system down,
an infected heart will kill him.

420
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,570
Fortunately, she didn't have Hep C.

421
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,989
- She tested positive.
- Her history says otherwise.

422
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,596
Her husband told me she
was running a fever with stomach pains,

423
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,702
not symptomatic of Hep C.

424
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,319
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

425
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,446
Hey, what are you doing?

426
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,448
Again, sorry.

427
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,951
But we need to talk.

428
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,372
Mr. Neuberger has every right
to take his wife off the ventilator.

429
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,374
His wife signed an organ donor card.

430
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,544
Which became invalid
when her organs were turned down.

431
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,338
I can use them! I just need some time.

432
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,299
Committee says
they won't take her heart.

433
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,718
Another committee says
a guy can't have a heart.

434
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,303
It's a marriage made in heaven.

435
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,230
I could find a surgical team
that can do this,

436
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:18,057
classify it as experimental.
It's not gonna screw with their numbers.

437
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,664
This is what she wanted.
She wanted her organs to help other...

438
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,646
She never wanted to be kept alive
on a ventilator!

439
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,564
She's not, she's dead!

440
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,150
She's not in pain, she's not suffering,

441
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,527
it's just her meat
we're dealing with here.

442
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,449
- This is my wife.
- Not anymore.

443
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,577
She deserves some respect, some dignity.

444
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,287
- I respect the living.
- Right!

445
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,998
That is why you made me think
that you were her doctor,

446
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,918
made me believe that maybe
there was some hope.

447
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,545
- I never said that I was her doctor.
- Fine! You didn't lie,

448
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,589
but you sure as hell
didn't give me any respect.

449
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,883
I'm taking her off the machines. Now.

450
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,178
Nicely played.

451
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,387
It's not over.

452
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,188
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Neuberger?

453
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,148
Yeah, why?

454
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,691
I'm Amy Arrington.

455
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,527
I wanted to thank you.

456
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,704
This girl's father will die
by next weekend

457
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,623
unless he gets your wife's heart.

458
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,376
House, don't you think
that's a little manipulative?

459
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,295
No. It's hugely manipulative.

460
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,214
You're an ass.

461
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,467
Hey, listen!
You take your wife off life support

462
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,262
and I'll have forgotten about this
in two weeks.

463
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,638
Gail here, on the other hand...

464
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,140
- Amy.
- Whatever.

465
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,646
You're mad at me. Fine, I get that.
Take it out on me, not on her.

466
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,542
Fine. Your dad can have her heart.

467
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:34,193
Fever, stomach pain,
raised liver enzymes.

468
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,611
She's sick.

469
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,822
Worse than that, she's dead.

470
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,825
My point is, even if it's not Hep C,
it's something.

471
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,201
They turned her down as a donor

472
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,912
because if we put that heart
into someone, they won't survive.

473
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,706
Whatever made her sick will kill him!

474
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,833
Yeah. So what is it?

475
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,543
The enzymes indicate...

476
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,338
You want us to do a differential
diagnosis on a dead person?

477
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,547
We're going to cure her.

478
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,049
We're going to cure death?

479
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,510
Doubt it.

480
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,763
Just wanna get the infection
out of her heart

481
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,389
before we get the heart out of her.

482
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,183
The fever indicates an infection.

483
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,353
She probably has Hep C
and a bad case of the flu.

484
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,188
Let's assume, just for fun,

485
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,107
that the answer is something
that might be helpful.

486
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,985
Fever and belly pain.
Could be a gall bladder infection.

487
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,653
Like that.

488
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,405
Do an MRI, stat.

489
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,457
You really don't need to be here.

490
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,585
I assume House is a great doctor.

491
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,754
Why would you assume that?

492
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,217
Because, when you're that big a jerk,
you're either great or unemployed.

493
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,930
No sign
of gall bladder infection.

494
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,015
- But there was a cyst.
- Perfectly round.

495
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,726
Hep C wouldn't cause...
The question was never "Is it Hep C?"

496
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,813
The question was,
"Given that it's not Hep C, what is it?"

497
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,898
- Adenoma?
- Not solid enough.

498
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,735
- Cavernous hemangioma?
- Not vascular enough.

499
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:02,073
What if she was sloppy
about washing her hands after pooping?

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,367
Amoeba infection?

501
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,370
If the amebiasis started in her liver,
then spread to her blood,

502
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,248
that would explain all her symptoms,
except for the crushed skull.

503
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,125
But I'm assuming
that's from the car crash.

504
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,085
I'll start her on paromomycin
and chloroquine.

505
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,461
Ten grams each.

506
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,339
That's 20 times the normal dose.

507
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,968
Right, so we'll destroy her retinas
and damage her hearing.

508
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,971
Whoever wants those parts
is having a very bad day.

509
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,349
Couple hours on the meds,
she'll be feeling great.

510
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,149
I got your labs.

511
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,776
- Do you eat guinea pigs?
- No.

512
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,613
How about hamsters or mice? Humans?

513
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,407
What are you talking about?

514
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,992
Is something wrong with me?

515
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,535
Absolutely nothing.

516
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,370
Your blood work is perfect.

517
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:53,249
You have lots of vitamins,
minerals, all kinds of proteins,

518
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:58,087
including a little something
I like to call bovine serum albumin

519
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:03,301
which you get from eating
the animals mentioned. Or cow.

520
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,388
You don't really worship cows.

521
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,266
So I have to wonder,
what could be more humiliating

522
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:14,645
than someone calling your girlfriend
a cow and not being metaphorical?

523
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,829
- Nice.
- That's my mom.

524
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,710
Either that's a very old photograph
or it's your stepmom.

525
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,796
She goes around the house
in a bikini. Or less.

526
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,673
I can't stop thinking about her.

527
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,176
My dad's in Europe. I'll be watching TV,

528
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,304
she'll give me a massage.
I can't walk for an hour.

529
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,681
Still. Cows?

530
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,849
She's my mother!

531
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,059
Step.

532
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,688
Please? I just need the medicine
for three months

533
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,525
until I graduate
and I move out of the house.

534
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,111
Please.

535
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,534
You're not gonna have any fun
at graduation.

536
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,663
Keep up the good work.

537
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,581
Your shirt is ironed.

538
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,417
That means
you haven't told your wife anything.

539
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,212
Let's say you're right.

540
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,090
You're saying I'm right?

541
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,926
No, "let" is saying.

542
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,137
Does it occur to you that
maybe there's some deeper guidance

543
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,847
than "keep your mouth shut"?

544
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,935
That maybe a friend might value
concern over glibness?

545
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,562
That maybe...

546
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,607
Maybe I'm going through something

547
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,944
that I need to have
an actual conversation about?

548
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,578
Does it occur to you that
if you need that kind of a friend,

549
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,330
you may have made some deeper errors?

550
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,843
Her heartbeat's irregular.
Looks like global hypokinesis.

551
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,350
Stop the meds.

552
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:19,812
You're giving up?

553
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,690
Either we're wrong
and her heart is unusable,

554
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,859
or we're right,
but the treatment we have

555
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,944
to give her will make
her heart unusable.

556
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,157
I'm sorry. You can pull the plug now.

557
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,326
Find me another body.

558
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,453
That fat guy on Ortho service
didn't look so hot.

559
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,621
No!

560
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,582
She's not ready.

561
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,793
You were ready this morning.

562
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,420
She's not done!

563
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,965
She's got to save that guy.

564
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:00,144
Alternate theories?

565
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,480
Amebiasis was our best hope.

566
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,690
The fact that her heart rate
went back to normal

567
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,400
when we stopped the meds confirms...

568
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,818
What's our second-best hope?

569
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,113
House, put down the wand,
there's no obstruction.

570
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,741
Maybe we should just biopsy it.

571
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,951
She's a fridge with the power out.

572
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,872
If we start poking around inside,
the vegetable goes bad.

573
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:22,958
No offense.

574
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,543
I don't see that we have
a lot of choice.

575
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,295
The only way
we'll find that infection...

576
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,382
What if it's not an infection?
Toxins can cause similar symptoms,

577
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,425
especially if whatever
it is did liver damage.

578
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,427
Her toxin screen was clean.

579
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,931
Those things never cover
for any of the really cool toxins.

580
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,934
Run the screen again
for whatever you can think of.

581
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,144
You, keep the other patient alive.

582
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,813
You check out the school.

583
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,900
And I seem to need to hire
another doctor to go search her home.

584
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,278
Come on.

585
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,660
If she was taking any medications,
I'd know about it.

586
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,580
Does your wife dye her hair?

587
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,168
No. Her mom never went gray,
she didn't either.

588
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,337
Guess this must be yours, then.

589
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,132
Can you think of anything else
she might've lied to you about?

590
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,260
Any drugs she gave up
when she married you?

591
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,773
How are you feeling, sir?

592
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,152
Mr. Arrington?

593
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,947
What's going on?

594
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,117
His heart's not pumping enough blood
to his brain.

595
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,619
We're gonna have to give it some help.
Get the balloon ready.

596
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,793
Do you use this drawer?

597
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,337
No, that's for her vitamins.

598
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,922
And sleeping pills.

599
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,842
She never took sleeping pills.

600
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,218
Okay.

601
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,097
You on a diet?

602
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,141
No.

603
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,066
I guess you never
really know someone, do you?

604
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,943
Quite the insight.

605
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,696
She lied to you about her hair color

606
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,949
and didn't want you to know
she thought she was fat.

607
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,286
Unless you never lied to her
about anything that huge,

608
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,206
I think you can probably
let those slide.

609
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,335
Diet pills could have messed her up.

610
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,837
Raised the liver enzymes
and caused the bellyache.

611
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,422
Not the fever.

612
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,341
Maybe something else set off the fever.

613
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,467
Like what?

614
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,261
Before I show you these, they were
in a locked drawer in her desk.

615
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,889
The vice principal said that Laura
must have confiscated them.

616
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:45,684
- They've had some problems...
- Neither interesting nor helpful.

617
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,813
This, at least, is interesting.

618
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,565
No, it's not.

619
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,568
Sex with teenagers isn't interesting?
Where did you grow up?

620
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,030
It isn't helpful.
Teenage boys aren't toxins.

621
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,033
What if the cyst isn't a cyst?

622
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,994
Then we have nothing to go on.

623
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,664
I said it's not a cyst.
I didn't say it was nothing.

624
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,957
What if it's a scar?

625
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,834
FitzHugh-Curtis syndrome?

626
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,919
You're pushing gonorrhea again?

627
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,796
You got anything better?

628
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,841
Test her. And start her on ceftriaxone.

629
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,897
What are you testing for now?

630
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,568
Just some more infections.

631
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,042
She's positive for gonorrhea.

632
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,631
I think that's the first time
those words have been uttered in joy.

633
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,716
The meds are started.

634
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,343
Her heart should be clear enough
to use in about four or five hours.

635
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,012
I'll go tell the families.

636
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,430
He's in a coma.

637
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,433
- Start him on dobutamine.
- Already did.

638
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,645
We either do the surgery now
or we find him a new brain, too.

639
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,816
House, she's still got a significant
amount of gonorrhea in her system.

640
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,777
Hopefully tomorrow
it'll be in his system.

641
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,198
I need two O.R.'s
and the transplant team.

642
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,285
Get ready.

643
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,705
- What is it?
- Excuse me.

644
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,626
Insert IV.

645
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,461
Sides up.

646
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,213
What's going on? Is he getting a heart?

647
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,715
Yeah.

648
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,972
Come on, come on.

649
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,897
I assume this means
you found out what was wrong with Laura.

650
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,696
She had amebiasis.

651
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,492
We just found a different way
to get rid of it.

652
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,287
Thank you.

653
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,626
That was kind of you.

654
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,003
I didn't want him going postal on us.

655
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,339
As soon as his wife's heart's in
our hands

656
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,508
you can tell him about the gonorrhea.

657
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,010
He's got to be tested.

658
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,972
Preferably before
he gets any sympathy sex.

659
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,715
Paddles.

660
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,596
Fifty joules.

661
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,893
Charging.

662
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,526
Charging.

663
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,744
Let's take him off bypass.

664
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,082
Okay.

665
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,209
Switch...

666
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,183
Mr. Neuberger, there's something
I need to tell you.

667
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,855
For the last year

668
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,899
or so,

669
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,527
Laura was kind of distant with me.

670
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,279
I don't know why.

671
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,908
I thought maybe
she was having an affair.

672
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,077
But, not Laura.

673
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:17,664
And I'm not excusing myself, but when
I was traveling during Christmas

674
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,124
I had a...

675
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,002
I had a one-night stand.

676
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,754
I got gonorrhea.

677
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,926
- Are you sure...
- Yeah.

678
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,846
I should've said something to you.

679
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,599
But I didn't wanna believe
that I gave it to her.

680
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:40,270
That's what made her sick and that was
why she got into the accident.

681
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,294
Cecile?

682
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,172
Am I dead?

683
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,049
Hopefully not for a long time.

684
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,302
Why are you here?

685
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,971
Amy called me.

686
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,517
If you do Mom again,
you gotta wear a condom.

687
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,104
You're gonna have gonorrhea
