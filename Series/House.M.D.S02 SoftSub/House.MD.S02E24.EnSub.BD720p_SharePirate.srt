1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,760
He's got a temperature of 103.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,595
And why do we care?

3
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,640
Because we're human beings.
It's what we do.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,101
He said he was at a luncheon meeting.

5
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,560
You took his history?

6
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,813
The guy looks like Harpo.
You should see him.

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,982
You asked him what book
he's currently reading?

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,360
It's hilarious
to watch him try and talk.

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,487
I asked him anything I could think of.

10
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,906
Favorite color. "Blwoo."

11
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,118
Favorite dessert topping?

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,749
Trust me. You never know what fact
may prove the key to saving your life.

13
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,335
Whipped cream.

14
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,922
- I asked him if he was sure.
- Where are you going?

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,050
- You're an ass.
- I know. Where are you going?

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,429
This is either a toxin,
an infection or an allergic reaction.

17
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,889
I assume you gave him epi,
so that rules out allergies.

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,225
Put him on antibiotics
in case it's an infection,

19
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,728
and if it's a toxin,
we'll keep him here overnight,

20
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,646
let the swelling go down, send him home.

21
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,732
I'm going to the movies.

22
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,693
Which one of you is House?

23
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,696
Skinny brunette.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,948
No, that's Dr. Cameron.

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,326
I'm skinny. How do you know her name?

26
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,078
I was a patient of yours.

27
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,790
Oh, well, if you wanna leave
the chocolates downstairs...

28
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,588
Stay! Stay away from him.

29
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,970
Shocking, isn't it?

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,848
Who'd want to hurt you?

31
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,407
You're pathetic.

32
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:46,374
Judging by the growth, I'd say
I've been unconscious for two days.

33
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,669
- You been sitting there the whole time?
- No.

34
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,756
Judging by the oily buildup
in your hair, I'd say you're lying.

35
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,384
I was scared. Pardon me for caring.

36
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,762
Did I lose any organs?

37
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,488
The bullet to your abdomen pierced
your stomach, nicked the bowel,

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,267
lodged in the posterior rib.

39
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,937
I always say if you're gonna get shot,
do it in a hospital.

40
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,523
- The one in your neck...
- I don't remember that one.

41
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,817
Went right through,
severed your jugular.

42
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,194
- The shooter turns out to be a guy...
- Don't care.

43
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,866
You don't care why a guy walked
into a hospital and shot a doctor?

44
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:20,992
Shot you?

45
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,077
I assume his reasoning was faulty.

46
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,497
So what was it? Infection?

47
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,624
The surgery went fine.
You've had no post-op...

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,419
Not me. The patient. Harpo.

49
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,463
You just got shot, House.
You should rest.

50
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,133
I got shot. Diagnostically boring.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,929
Big fat tongue, on the other hand,
endlessly entertaining.

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,098
We biopsied his tongue.

53
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,017
And it was negative.

54
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,353
And the blood tests were negative.

55
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,022
I didn't say we did blood tests.

56
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,649
You don't biopsy a tongue
unless you have to biopsy a tongue.

57
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,234
And you don't have
to biopsy a tongue

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,194
unless you've already come up
with nothing

59
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,490
on a routine battery of tests which
don't involve torturing the patient.

60
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,786
Any new symptoms other than
the increased intracranial pressure?

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,290
Any guesses on how
I figured that one out?

62
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,504
You knew the next step
would be a lumbar puncture.

63
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,506
A lumbar puncture would almost certainly
give us a definitive answer.

64
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,468
Since we don't have a definitive answer,
we must not have done an LP.

65
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:25,306
And the most common reason to not do an
LP is increased intracranial pressure.

66
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,561
He was shot by security trying to...

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,605
House, what are you...

68
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,231
House.

69
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,358
I'm talking to Cuddy.

70
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,611
Lie down. You've gotta be in pain.

71
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,698
Not today. Today I'm on morphine.

72
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,535
You're gonna rip your stitches out.

73
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,912
Check Harpo's trash.

74
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,538
Forget about the patient.

75
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,166
Come on, you're curious.

76
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,584
Trash?

77
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,150
You don't know what I'm talking about,
but you know it's good.

78
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,672
You can't just be walking around.

79
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,798
Well, then stop me.

80
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,675
- You've lost blood.
- Physically stop me.

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,259
- You could damage...
- You can't.

82
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,387
Because that would involve
physically touching me.

83
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,515
And then things
would get so sexually charged...

84
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,148
I'm twice your size.
Get your hands off me.

85
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,319
Everything that lives, eats.
And everything that eats, poops.

86
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,156
That's why every organ has a sanitation
department, the lymph system.

87
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,243
Whatever's doing the damage
is dumping its waste in there.

88
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,704
That's what you meant by trash.

89
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,291
Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,593
I'm sorry, I know it's crazy,
but there's no other place.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,721
It's the ICU.
It stands for Intensive Care.

92
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,264
He needs intensive care.
So do you.

93
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,807
He needs to be shot again.

94
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,935
He is handcuffed to his bed. He is
sedated. He's not going to hurt you.

95
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,353
If your security was any good,

96
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,397
I wouldn't have been shot
in the first place.

97
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,275
He is where he's supposed to be,
where you're supposed to be.

98
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,443
Who did my surgery?

99
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,609
Gillick. Why?
Are you gonna send him a fruit basket?

100
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,779
He screwed up.

101
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,866
It's annoying enough
dealing with your Vicodin habit.

102
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,451
Quit upping your morphine.

103
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,577
I'm not.

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,205
I'm reducing it.

105
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,834
And you're not in pain?

106
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,754
I'm feeling better.

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,381
Gillick is very good.
Your recovery time...

108
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,301
This stomach kills me,
my neck is throbbing.

109
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,386
My leg feels better.

110
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,515
That's amazing.

111
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,641
It's unbelievable.

112
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,811
Since getting shot is not
an FDA-approved treatment for anything,

113
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,606
it means something
must've gone wrong in the surgery.

114
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,525
Yes, terribly, tragically wrong.

115
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,652
Enjoy the mistake.

116
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,198
He must have nicked something
in my peripheral nervous system.

117
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,242
If it's alleviating pain,
who knows what else it's doing?

118
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,370
Get back to the ICU
before you rip out your stitches,

119
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,040
and I have to chain you to your bed.

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,396
Why did you try to kill me?

121
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,192
I didn't.

122
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,278
Then the gun thing
might have been a mistake.

123
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,115
If I'd have killed you,
it would have been over.

124
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,992
I needed you to live,

125
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,996
'cause I want to see you suffer.

126
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,153
Get the needle out of there.

127
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,531
He can't breathe.

128
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,957
House.

129
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,337
The test was negative.

130
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,047
Are you sure you want to be doing this?

131
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,883
I'm fine, I think.

132
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,622
Cameron, have you got my records?

133
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,928
They don't like to release
patient's operative notes.

134
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,264
Yet you're holding them.

135
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,765
And whispering.

136
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,892
He's sleeping.

137
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,688
Yeah, killer needs his rest.

138
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,107
Otherwise, he's grumpy all day.

139
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,067
Hey, wake up!

140
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,861
Watch me save a life.

141
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,988
Almost for sure
it's some sort of infection.

142
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,948
We've got him
on broad-spectrum antibiotics,

143
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,700
but it's not even slowing
the thing down.

144
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,203
Unless we figure out
what type of infection, we can't treat.

145
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,372
And we can't figure out
what type because we can't do an LP.

146
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,874
Do an LP.

147
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,461
See what I did there? Couldn't have
done that if you'd killed me.

148
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,588
We'd have done an LP two days
ago if we could have,

149
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,590
but that much pressure,
something's bound to...

150
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,116
We would've done an LP two days ago

151
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,636
if the risks hadn't so obviously
outweighed the benefits.

152
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,473
We just cut a hole in his throat.
The equation has changed.

153
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,644
Couldn't have put it better myself.

154
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:33,072
Pressure is 120 milliliters,

155
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,576
H2O, with small, visible excursions
related to respiration and pulse.

156
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,328
Well within normal, that's good.

157
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,579
No. That's weird.

158
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,714
You wanna hear a story?

159
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,551
I have a rule.

160
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,180
People who shoot me forfeit the right...

161
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,306
My wife was sick.

162
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,185
None of the doctors
could figure out why.

163
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,396
Oh, I know this story.

164
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,608
She died.

165
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,735
So you selected
one of her doctors to kill,

166
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,113
because that would make
everything right again.

167
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,573
No, she lived. You cured her.

168
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm truly sorry I did that.

169
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,623
In the course of investigating
her illness,

170
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,918
you convinced me
that everything was relevant.

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,255
You needed the truth.

172
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,467
I confessed to you
that I'd had an affair.

173
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,641
But it turns out that it had nothing to
do with why she was sick.

174
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,687
Genetic predisposition
to brain aneurysms.

175
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,066
You told her that.

176
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,779
You also told her about my affair.

177
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,658
And you caught crap, she left you,

178
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,827
and now I've got to pay

179
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,664
because you couldn't keep
your little killer in your pants.

180
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,959
She killed herself.

181
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,866
What sort of a hospital has glass walls?

182
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,868
That's my husband.

183
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,287
Really?

184
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,624
You thought I just liked watching people
get needles poked in the back?

185
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,712
No. I figured a co-worker
or a sister, not wife.

186
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,964
Why?

187
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,260
Don't worry, it's not insulting.
At least not to you.

188
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,725
You're satisfied by that answer?

189
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,310
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

190
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,020
You're not going to shoot me, are you?

191
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,231
You treated a friend of mine.

192
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,067
She told me you only talk to people
if you have to.

193
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:19,238
And then you insult them, while
showing off how insightful you are.

194
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:24,326
Sevens marry sevens,
nines marry nines, fours marry fours.

195
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,370
Maybe there's some wiggle room

196
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,706
if there's enough money
or somebody got pregnant.

197
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,335
But you've got at least three points
on your husband,

198
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,797
and your frock says
you didn't do it for the money,

199
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,466
and your breasts say
that you haven't had any kids.

200
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,553
So you figure my marriage
is a mathematical error?

201
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,346
Numbers don't lie.

202
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,308
We're having trouble finding out
what infection your husband has,

203
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,978
and the most likely culprit is an STD.

204
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,441
You want to know if I've had an affair
with someone closer to my integer,

205
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,735
and I have to tell you the truth
or my husband will die.

206
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,028
Is your friend single?

207
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:04,450
No. And I've always been faithful.

208
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,831
I would've bet money
something would go wrong.

209
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,833
Let's rotate him back.

210
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,880
He's bleeding into his ocular orbit.

211
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,798
LP wouldn't do this.

212
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,803
Lots of pressure behind.
Gotta relieve it.

213
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,812
What's going on? What are they doing?

214
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,273
I should go.

215
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,030
I seem to have torn my stitches.

216
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,963
You collapsed in the hall,
tore your stitches.

217
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,883
I remember. I was there.

218
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,635
How's your gut? It's hurting?

219
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,887
You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?

220
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:11,016
She locked herself in the garage,
and she started the car.

221
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,561
You shoot the guy
who sold her the garage-door opener?

222
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,189
You're an ass.

223
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,359
Now that is a bold position to take
given that I shot you.

224
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,277
The shooting just makes you an idiot.

225
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,947
You're an ass because
you're trying to wrap it in the flag,

226
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,198
like you did a good thing.

227
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,658
You're an ass and a hypocrite.

228
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,369
You don't believe in rules.
You do whatever you think is right.

229
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,913
That's all I did.
You were my role model.

230
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,415
Watch out,
you're getting crumbs on the flag.

231
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,418
I didn't commit to honor her.
I didn't commit to never lie to her.

232
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,421
If you'd kept your mouth shut, she'd be
alive, and you wouldn't be shot.

233
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,382
If you'd kept your pistols
in your pants...

234
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,009
It's my fault she's dead!

235
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,220
I know it.

236
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,849
But why can't you admit that
it's maybe just a little bit yours, too?

237
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,397
That maybe it's not just medical
mistakes that screw things up.

238
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,692
Here's how life works.

239
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:07,447
You either get to ask for an apology,
or you get to shoot people. Not both.

240
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,619
Infections don't make
your eyes pop out.

241
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,372
We should get back.
You're supposed be chained to your bed.

242
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,917
I'm not done eating. Got to be
some sort of bleeding disorder.

243
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,753
This is really stupid.

244
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,676
If my stitches pop out again,
I got three doctors to save me.

245
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,888
Could be some sort of weakness
in the lining of the ocular veins.

246
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,933
Okay, I'll be you guys.

247
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,312
No way, mate,
too much blood to just be a vein.

248
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:42,232
No way, Hizzy, if it
was an artery, he'd still be bleeding.

249
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,776
Actually, he'd be dead.

250
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,237
He could've had a granuloma
in his sinuses that bled,

251
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,072
which could've been caused by Wegener's.

252
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,450
You'd think the surgeon
would've noticed a giant growth

253
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,216
while he was sticking
the eyeball back in.

254
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,203
Tongue and eyes are sick,
what about the nose?

255
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,131
It's right in between them.
Why isn't it sick?

256
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,291
So it's not spreading.
It's got a common source.

257
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,959
Which can only be what?

258
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,211
The brain, except the CT was clean.

259
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,172
Check the brain's trash.
See what it's hiding.

260
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,818
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.

261
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,634
I know. All its garbage just blows off,

262
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,136
gets caught in the snow fence
by the side of the road.

263
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,222
You're referring
to the blood-brain barrier.

264
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,142
What else? Biopsy the barrier.

265
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,978
Wouldn't it be safer
to make a few educated guesses first?

266
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,064
Try some relatively safe treatments?

267
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,442
Biopsy the barrier. But first, start him
on Mebendazole in case it's a worm.

268
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,319
And Levofloxacin
in case it's an infection

269
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,029
that slipped by the first antibiotic.

270
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,531
And Azithromycin for STDs.

271
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,745
I really don't think the wife
is the kind to be messing around.

272
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,998
If I was married to her, I certainly...

273
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,625
House.

274
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,628
The patient isn't married.
He's a widower.

275
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:51,385
Really, it's more helpful
if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.

276
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,179
My body is fine.

277
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,181
My mind, on the other hand...

278
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,849
Maybe she was a girlfriend.

279
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,060
Or maybe she was just trying
to jerk you around.

280
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,396
I spoke to every one of the nurses
on that floor.

281
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,883
The patient only had six visitors,

282
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,400
two females, no babes.
His mother and his aunt.

283
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,652
So they missed someone.
They're not security.

284
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,030
My posse never saw her or me
talking on the other side of the glass.

285
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,449
They were a little busy
trying to save the guy's life.

286
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,160
There's only one possible conclusion.

287
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,329
It was a hallucination.

288
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,667
What does that look like to you?
Point six?

289
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,751
Anesthesia?

290
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,255
No. It's got to be six smudge.
Let's say you're right.

291
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,842
It wouldn't be that uncommon after
a trauma, after that much blood loss.

292
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,387
If my perceptions are compromised,
then my judgment is compromised.

293
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,596
What if his wife told me

294
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,599
that the patient just got bit
by a rabid Vietnamese leper?

295
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,560
So pull yourself off the case.

296
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,769
And the next case?

297
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,896
You take two weeks, you recover.

298
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,648
What if I don't?

299
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,442
What if it wasn't the shooting?

300
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,610
The guy who sees connections
between everything

301
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,822
sees no connection between being shot
and minor brain disruptions?

302
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,115
What if it was the surgery?

303
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,285
What if it was the fact
that you tore out your stitches

304
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,120
and lost two pints of blood?

305
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,792
Why did Gillick give me ketamine
during my surgery?

306
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,088
Working.

307
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,214
We need to talk.

308
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,718
Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?

309
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,554
Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?

310
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,699
- Who showed you your surgical file?
- How do you know it's mine?

311
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,102
Because your patient hasn't had surgery,
and you don't care about anybody else.

312
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,481
My anesthesia was almost nonexistent,
and yet I wasn't awake.

313
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,817
For some reason, somebody
decided to put me in a dissociative coma

314
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,611
instead of just putting me out.

315
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,279
There are plenty of reasons to use...

316
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,366
Fine. I'll go beat the truth out
of my surgeon. Gillick, right?

317
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,626
It worked.

318
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,467
There's a clinic in Germany.
They've been treating chronic pain

319
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,179
by inducing comas and letting the mind
basically reboot itself.

320
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,182
There's about a 50% chance
your pain will come back,

321
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,019
which of course means
there is a 50% chance that it won't.

322
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,607
- You had no right.
- To heal you?

323
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,942
You messed with my brain.

324
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,693
Why are you so upset?

325
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,532
Are you experiencing
any neurological symptoms?

326
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,283
Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?

327
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,246
No. It's a point of principle.

328
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,378
Test was negative.

329
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,130
No trash against the fence.
Is your leg really better?

330
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,216
Don't worry,
I'm sure something else is wrong.

331
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,051
We did find blood.

332
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,262
- On which side?
- The wrong side.

333
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,555
First thing that makes sense.

334
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,015
The wrong side's the wrong side.
It can't make sense.

335
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,893
It'd mess with his brain,
wouldn't cause fever.

336
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,645
He's been sleeping a lot lately.

337
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,771
You worried?

338
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,441
I marked a change of meds on his chart.

339
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,029
Foreign object, body wants
to get rid of it, that causes the fever.

340
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,322
Blood's a foreign object?

341
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
In the brain lining it is.

342
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,326
- Blood dyscrasia means cancer.
- Find it.

343
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,287
- All the tests...
- Have been negative.

344
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,290
What do you do
if your trashcans are full?

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,001
You use your neighbor's trashcans.

346
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,254
Except it's still light outside,
your neighbor will see you.

347
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,008
So you go out the back way into an alley
and drop off your trash by their garage.

348
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,177
We'll check the lymphatic system
in the chest.

349
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,513
You got that from trashcans
in the alley?

350
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,223
The saliva glands from the tongue

351
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,601
are connected to the lymphatic system
in the lungs.

352
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,270
It's the next lymphatic system over.

353
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,981
Yeah.

354
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,358
Go get lung lymph.

355
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,658
How did he know that?

356
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,080
I wouldn't have hired him
if he wasn't smart.

357
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,373
Right.

358
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,003
'Cause you have nothing
but respect for him.

359
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,133
Maybe he knew the answer
because the question

360
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,387
wasn't nearly as tricky as you thought.

361
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,851
Maybe he's not getting smarter,

362
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,228
you're getting dumber.

363
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,878
You pretend to buck the system,
pretend to be a rebel.

364
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,215
You claim to hate rules.

365
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,095
But all you do is substitute
your own rules for society's.

366
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,390
And it's a nice simple rule,

367
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,269
tell the blunt, honest truth

368
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,398
in the starkest, darkest way.

369
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,442
And what will be, will be.

370
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,404
What will be, should be.

371
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,534
And everyone else is a coward.

372
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,497
But you're wrong.

373
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,251
It's not cowardly
to not call someone an idiot.

374
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,714
People aren't tactful
or polite just because it's nice.

375
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,469
They do it because
they got an ounce of humility.

376
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:34,019
Because they know
that they will make mistakes,

377
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,814
and they know that
their actions have consequences,

378
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:43,111
and they know that those consequences
are their fault.

379
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,624
Why do you want so bad
not to be human, House?

380
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,965
No, he's awake.

381
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,718
House, we need to talk to you.

382
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,720
How the hell did you know I was awake?

383
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,805
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.

384
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,600
- No, they do not.
- Fine. I'm lying.

385
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,687
- Test was negative.
- You knew?

386
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,253
- Force of habit.
- Showed no cancer.

387
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,876
No reason why he's got a fever of 103,

388
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,026
and no reason why his tongue
won't fit in his mouth.

389
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,072
He's post-op.
Chase is getting him up and around.

390
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,364
It's important that you're up
ASAP after surgery.

391
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,658
You think you can urinate?

392
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,710
It's getting bigger!

393
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,881
Are you getting aroused?

394
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,966
No! Not that part!

395
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,219
Oh, God, it hurts!

396
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,846
It's not stopping!

397
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,728
Surgeons found no evidence
of a burst artery.

398
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:03,108
The blood had to come from somewhere,
you took a shower in it.

399
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,317
Trauma?

400
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,278
Do you think someone snuck in here
just to kick him in the jewels

401
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,823
and poke out his eye
and swell up his tongue?

402
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,990
Keep riding.

403
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,494
I got a bet with my physio
that I can do 100 klicks by Friday.

404
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,080
What about blood from the kidneys?

405
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,253
Kidneys drain into the bladder,
which drains into the ureter.

406
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,839
There's no way it would mess
with the scrotum.

407
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,883
Yeah, basic human anatomy.

408
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,887
Therefore, I think it's safe to assume
that the problem lies elsewhere.

409
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,807
But given that this case doesn't make
any kind of sense whatsoever,

410
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,725
maybe we should
even question the basics.

411
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,227
Maybe he's not human?

412
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,647
An anatomical defect would seem more
likely, but let's not rule that one out.

413
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,859
Even more likely, he is human, his
anatomy is where it's supposed to be,

414
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,652
but he has testicular cancer.

415
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:48,987
We tested for cancer.

416
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,989
We tested
the lymph system in his chest.

417
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,448
Surgeons found no growths.

418
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,076
Surgeon was trying
to put everything back where it was.

419
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,494
They weren't doing an inventory.

420
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,707
May have been lucky. You don't catch
testicular cancer early, it kills.

421
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,376
- Probably eroded some vessel.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

422
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,211
The question is
why I didn't think of it.

423
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,298
Well, eyes popping out
is a rather odd presentation.

424
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,842
Sac blowing up, on the other hand...

425
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,719
If you could think of
everything yourself,

426
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,220
you wouldn't need a team to annoy.

427
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,097
I screwed up some basic anatomy,

428
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:20,268
and I missed connecting a testicular
explosion with a testicular problem.

429
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,270
You think there's any way
I would've done that

430
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,757
before Cuddy messed with my brain?

431
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,732
She was trying to help you,
and it worked.

432
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,068
Yeah, I can run like the wind,
but I can't think.

433
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,696
And seeing as how I'm too old
to become a professional athlete,

434
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:35,241
it looks to me as if
she screwed me over big time.

435
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,622
You don't want a healthy leg.

436
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,873
Oh, here we go.

437
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,168
If you've got a good life, if you're
healthy, you've got no reason to bitch.

438
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,694
- No reason to hate life.
- Here's the flaw in your argument.

439
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,089
If I enjoy hating life,
I don't hate life, I enjoy it.

440
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,383
I didn't say it was rational.

441
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,929
HIV testing is 99% accurate,

442
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,973
which means there are some people
who test positive,

443
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,809
who live with their own impending doom
for months or years

444
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,519
before finding out everything's okay.

445
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,899
Weirdly, most of them don't react
with happiness, or even anger.

446
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,567
They get depressed.

447
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,944
Not because they wanted to die,

448
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,571
but because they've defined themselves
by their disease.

449
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,407
Suddenly what made them them
isn't real.

450
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,660
I don't define myself by my leg.

451
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,080
No. You have taken it one step further.

452
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,750
The only way you could come
to terms with your disability

453
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:29,420
was to somehow make it mean nothing.

454
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,006
So you had to redefine everything.

455
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,677
You have dismissed anything physical,

456
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,723
anything not coldly,
calculatingly intellectual.

457
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,934
Why are you protecting her?

458
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,816
Because she's done nothing wrong.

459
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,570
You're completely comfortable
with what she did to me?

460
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,364
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

461
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,910
You agonize over moral choices.

462
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,871
You're not completely comfortable
with anything

463
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:08,084
until you've taken days to get your head
around every possible side.

464
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,170
I've known what she did for six hours.

465
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,090
How come you're acting
like you've known for days?

466
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,010
What do I have?

467
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,928
- You're not sick.
- What do I have?

468
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,138
You need to calm down!

469
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,182
- I have my brain! That's it!
- We were trying to help you.

470
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,144
Yeah, nobody tries to screw up,
they just do.

471
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,730
You were out of control.
You were shooting morphine.

472
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,815
I can make people better.

473
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,234
And you two decide to trade that
for jogging shoes!

474
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,029
If you're suffering from side-effects,
then we can look at that.

475
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,780
You value the physical so much.

476
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,783
Let me put this in terms
you can understand.

477
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,332
You're unbelievable.

478
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,834
Even when you're out of your mind
with anger and fear,

479
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,378
you still couch it in logical terms.

480
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,714
- Are you hallucinating?
- Yeah, I'm hallucinating.

481
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,549
No, I mean right now.

482
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,384
Are you hallucinating?

483
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,016
- How did you know I was...
- You were yelling at me.

484
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,394
- You were calling me Wilson.
- No.

485
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,397
You're losing it, House.

486
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,193
- I never call Wilson by his name.
- Yeah, right.

487
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,040
Now the hallucinator is going to tell
the hallucinatee what happened.

488
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,448
You're not the hallucinatee.
Wilson was the hallucinatee.

489
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,825
You think maybe you're focusing
on the wrong thing here?

490
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,871
Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee.
The bathroom was the hallucinatee.

491
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,790
Bathroom. It figures.

492
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,501
What figures?

493
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,837
You wet your bed.

494
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,507
Damn it.

495
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,095
- Test was negative.
- No.

496
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,223
AFP and beta HCG
say no testicular cancer.

497
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,975
So, let's recap.
We've just ruled out everything,

498
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,143
which doesn't make sense.

499
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,729
So the answer has to be
something that doesn't make sense.

500
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,482
Do a cystoscopy. Make sure he's human.

501
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,403
- The test was negative.
- For him being human?

502
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,370
Everything was right
where it's supposed to be.

503
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,365
All the tubes go
where they're supposed to go.

504
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,035
Most likely scenario,
some kind of bacterial prostatitis.

505
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,925
Did you find out if his father hunched?

506
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,428
His father have trouble peeing?

507
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,014
His father have sex
with his own mother?

508
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,852
If the answers to any of those questions
is yes, assume you're right.

509
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,646
If the answers are no,
assume you're right,

510
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,940
but biopsy some prostate lymphs
just to be sure.

511
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,068
But then we'd have to
cut through his stomach,

512
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,280
and since he's clearly got a bleeding
problem, this kind of surgery...

513
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,824
He doesn't clearly have anything.

514
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,996
How did I get here?

515
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,790
What are you talking about?

516
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,001
I was in the ICU,

517
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,214
and then I was coming down
these stairs with you guys.

518
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,925
What happened in between?

519
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,806
I don't remember how I got here.

520
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,696
I'm taking myself off my case.

521
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,824
Your patient is in critical care.
He's had a fever unabated for two...

522
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,659
I think I'm losing my mind.

523
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,996
I'm having blackouts.

524
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,957
- You said you weren't having any...
- I lied.

525
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,169
If you are doing this to scare me,
you made your point.

526
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:42,340
Next time you get shot, I promise
to only treat the bullet wounds.

527
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,133
I'm off the case.

528
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,558
Why did you jump up when I came in?

529
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,645
I thought you were going
to attack me again.

530
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,605
Again?

531
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,315
Yeah, you were in my face.

532
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,276
- No, I wasn't.
- You were...

533
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,445
You came in here with Wilson and...

534
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,822
- That was a hallucination.
- No, you...

535
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,033
Which means this is a hallucination.

536
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,637
How can I tell what's real
and what's not?

537
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,560
Everything looks the same,
sounds the same,

538
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,563
tastes the same.

539
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,860
Seems like I'd be the last person
you'd want to ask.

540
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,237
Why not?

541
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,657
You're obviously not here.
I'm obviously not here.

542
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,951
Which means
this is a creation of my mind,

543
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,245
which means
I'm really just asking myself.

544
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,915
If you're talking to yourself, that's
a lot of unnecessary explanation.

545
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,126
Hey, I'm trying to work this out.

546
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,504
That requires give and take,
even in my own mind.

547
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,090
What was the question?

548
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,342
How can I tell what's real?

549
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,303
Does it matter?

550
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,848
That doesn't sound like
something I'd ask.

551
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,809
All right. Your concern is that
if you act in the real world

552
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,688
based on information that's not real,
the results are impossible to foresee.

553
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,897
With you so far.

554
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,401
But information is incapable
of harm in and of itself.

555
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,194
Ideas are neither good nor bad

556
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,822
but merely as useful
as what we do with them.

557
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,783
Only actions can cause harm.

558
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,911
That sounds like me.

559
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:40,082
So you do nothing.
You refrain from taking any actions.

560
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,629
You continue to throw out your ideas
as you always would,

561
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,964
but if they're based
on faulty assumptions,

562
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,467
your team will point that out.

563
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,511
They won't do anything
that could hurt him.

564
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,266
So I trust my team?

565
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,644
Test was negative.

566
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,438
- No blood in the prostate.
- No structural abnormalities.

567
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,900
If something doesn't make sense,
what does that mean?

568
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,153
It's not rhetorical.

569
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,324
I need your input on everything I ask,
no matter how obvious it might seem.

570
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,493
It means you're wrong.

571
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,495
It means one of your assumptions
is wrong.

572
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,997
Because if something
doesn't make sense, it can't be real.

573
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,248
So what are our assumptions?

574
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,709
We don't have any.
We're just guessing and testing.

575
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,169
We assume the tests are right.

576
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,129
We've already re-done them. Twice.

577
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,339
Let's go more basic.

578
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,508
What's more basic than the test results?

579
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,468
The tests themselves.

580
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,512
What does a biopsy consist of?

581
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,681
You take a sample.

582
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,099
Define sample.

583
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,061
It's a small representative piece
of whatever you think is the problem.

584
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,605
You go down to the shore,
you fill a cup of water.

585
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,400
It's got no fish in it.
Does that mean no fish in the ocean?

586
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,818
We can do another biopsy.

587
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,486
We could fill another cup of water.

588
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,012
But we gotta dive in.
We got to see what's actually in there.

589
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,832
We can't operate,
he's got a bleeding problem.

590
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,575
We assume he's got a bleeding problem.

591
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,328
Yeah, because he bled
from where he wasn't supposed to bleed,

592
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,288
causing parts of his body to blow up.

593
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,999
Assuming that crazy
assumption is correct,

594
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,252
if we operate on him,
we'll kill him.

595
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,714
What if we could find a way
to do this surgery

596
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,551
without giving him more
than a paper cut?

597
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:18,556
You want to let a robot operate on me?

598
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,641
The technology is amazing.

599
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,561
It magnifies everything 10 times.
It's 10 times the accuracy.

600
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,938
No way. I want a person.

601
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,774
- A person would be controlling...
- People suck.

602
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,445
People have turned you from
a guy with a swollen tongue

603
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,573
into a guy with one eye, one ball,
and a stapled-on face.

604
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,076
If you want someone to hold you while
you cry yourself to sleep at night,

605
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,953
choose warm and soft.

606
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,582
You want someone to write you a poem,
pick the sensitive loner.

607
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,788
If all you care about
is that something's done right,

608
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,252
pick the guy with the metal head.

609
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,629
- No way.
- No way, no way.

610
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,758
You gotta see this thing in action
before you say no way. Come on.

611
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,926
House, what are you doing?

612
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,972
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

613
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,891
Just throwing out ideas.

614
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:05,269
I think that you should put him in a
wheelchair and take him down to the OR.

615
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,104
But I may be out of my mind.

616
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,115
Relax, Cameron.

617
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,618
I'm not going to cut you.

618
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,537
I just wanna show
what this puppy can do.

619
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,248
It can make one-millimeter incisions.

620
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,001
You don't know how small that is?

621
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,170
It's small even in metric.

622
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,299
If I do something
that doesn't make sense, even to you,

623
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,426
stop me.

624
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,563
Delicate, no?

625
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,973
House.

626
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,267
Does that hurt?

627
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,731
Seen enough.

628
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,568
No.

629
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,404
That wasn't a question.

630
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,364
You either do this, or you die.

631
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,745
You've wasted your life.

632
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:47,872
Yeah.

633
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,750
If only I'd spent more time
dedicating myself

634
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,003
to finding someone worthy to shoot.

635
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,922
If I had killed you,
would it have mattered?

636
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,174
Not to me. Have you got a pen?

637
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,093
You don't care if you live or die?

638
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,722
I care because I live.
I can't care if I'm dead.

639
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,683
I don't want to hear semantics.

640
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,852
You anti-semantic bastard.

641
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,689
Would anybody care
that the world lost that wit?

642
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,940
Working here.

643
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,443
That's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

644
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,279
Just let me soak into your subconscious.

645
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,241
You think that the only truth
that matters

646
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,410
is the truth that can be measured.

647
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,831
Good intentions don't count.
What's in your heart doesn't count.

648
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,167
Caring doesn't count.

649
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,419
But a man's life can be measured

650
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,923
by how many tears are shed when he dies.

651
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,094
Just because you can't measure them,

652
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,431
just because you don't want
to measure them,

653
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,684
doesn't mean it's not real.

654
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,733
That does not make sense.

655
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,614
And even if I'm wrong,
you're still miserable.

656
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,494
Did you really think
that your life's purpose

657
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,081
was to sacrifice yourself
and get nothing in return?

658
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,292
No.

659
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,839
You believe
there's no purpose to anything.

660
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,802
Even the lives you save, you dismiss.

661
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,432
You turn the one decent thing
in your life

662
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,394
and you taint it,
strip it of all meaning.

663
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,070
You're miserable for nothing.

664
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,616
And I don't know why you'd want to live.

665
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,932
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,906
I know what's wrong.

667
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,372
House, get out of here,
you're not sterile.

668
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,834
He'll be fine.

669
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,169
Great.

670
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,630
What's he got?

671
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:47,718
How come you guys have never tried
to yank me off this case?

672
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,472
I'm having hallucinations, blackouts.

673
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:55,601
But you're always insane,
and you're always right.

674
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,812
I'm almost always eventually right.

675
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,233
You have no way of knowing
when eventually is.

676
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,737
Every time I've had an epiphany
on this one,

677
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,073
you guys were right on board.

678
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,658
No challenges, nothing to explain.

679
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,288
No offense, but either you guys are
getting smarter or I'm getting dumber.

680
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,457
We've worked with you long
enough to know...

681
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,376
I know the test results
even before you enter the room.

682
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,879
We have identical knowledge.

683
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,047
How is that possible?

684
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,131
You're wrong.

685
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,258
If something doesn't make sense,

686
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,594
one of your assumptions has to be wrong.

687
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,972
Because if it doesn't make sense,
it can't be real.

688
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:38,727
But what if the faulty assumption
is that it's real?

689
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,814
House, you're losing it.

690
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,108
I've lost it.

691
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,071
Why did you stop me?

692
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,323
Because I think
you're going to kill him.

693
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,618
No, you don't think that. You know it.

694
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,788
Because you're in my head.

695
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:02,292
As long as the delusion makes sense,
my mind lets it go on.

696
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,004
I have to make it not make sense.
I have to

697
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,299
push it past the point
where it can trick my mind.

698
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,803
If this is a nightmare,
you're gonna wake up.

699
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,596
If it's real, you're killing a man.

700
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,349
It's also possible
that I may already be dead.

701
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,101
And I don't believe in the afterlife.

702
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,936
House, go back to your room.

703
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,021
If this is a hallucination,
it's a good one.

704
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,606
You're pain-free. You can walk.

705
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,443
It's not real. Therefore,
it's meaningless. I want meaning.

706
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,239
Oh, God.

707
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,482
Goodbye.

708
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,193
- He was shot.
- Twice.

709
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,445
Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.

710
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,155
- Hello.
- It's gonna be okay.

711
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,782
You're gonna be okay.

712
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,325
You don't know nothing.

713
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,619
Tell Cuddy

714
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,039
I want ketamine.
