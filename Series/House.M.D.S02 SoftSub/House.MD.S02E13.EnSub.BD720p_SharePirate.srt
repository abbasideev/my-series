1
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,825
Give me my next change.

2
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,914
I think I'm gonna puke.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,375
- Not on this dress.
- I'm serious.

4
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,170
Kate Moss was doing this at 13.
You have two years on her.

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,882
Yeah, that's what I like to see.
You got this.

6
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,385
The next show, you're bride.

7
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,431
Did Austin just offer you bride?

8
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,559
It wasn't a real offer, Dad.
He was just being nice.

9
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,019
These shoes are gonna be impossible
to walk in.

10
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,604
You've done this 100 times before.

11
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,565
The runway's
just a little bit longer here.

12
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,611
One of the girls said
Madonna's in the front row.

13
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,237
Sweetie, hey, come on.
Are you gonna be able to do this?

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,117
All right, come here.

15
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,621
Here, hold this.

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,292
The doctor gave me these
for anxiety, all right?

17
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,962
It'll calm you down.
Here. Come on, it's okay.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,341
Where's Alex?

19
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,678
Alex, you're up!

20
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,890
Go! Go! Go! Go! Knock them out!

21
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,222
Are you okay?

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,065
Alex!

23
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,690
How'd you get here?

24
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,028
- By osmosis.
- No helmet?

25
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,905
Didn't seem like riding weather.

26
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,950
The fact that you can barely stand
upright had nothing to do with it?

27
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,242
Infarctions hurt. House.

28
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,661
It's what they do.

29
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,997
Worsening pain could actually be
a good thing.

30
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,958
It means the nerves
might be regenerating.

31
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,585
It could be good, it could be bad.
Thanks for the differential.

32
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,087
Any other options?

33
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,882
Have you ever considered
a career as a motivational speaker?

34
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,259
- Why don't you check out some rehab?
- I did the rehab thing.

35
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,470
One session, and you
didn't even finish that session.

36
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,931
The guy wanted me
to "visualize the healing".

37
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,934
- I could do that at home.
- At least let me get you an MRI.

38
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,104
It's a very simple equation:
More pain, more pills.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,647
Teenage supermodel.

40
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,902
Presented with double vision,
sudden aggressive behavior, cataplexy.

41
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,862
You had me at "teenage supermodel".

42
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,367
You okay? Mmm-hmm.

43
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,874
Wow.

44
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,793
You should be a model.

45
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,088
- Are you really 15?
- Who are you?

46
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,050
I'll be the one saving her life today,
assuming she's dying.

47
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,052
- Who are you?
- He's my father.

48
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,430
Any idea what's wrong with her?

49
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,182
Well, from the looks of it,
not a single thing.

50
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,937
I probably should stop staring
and check out the file.

51
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,566
So what set off the brawl?
She stand in your light?

52
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,569
I didn't even know her.
I didn't know what happened.

53
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,155
Look, I know some models
are notorious for hissy fits,

54
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,157
but Alex... I've never
even seen her get angry.

55
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,575
Even when she was a kid...

56
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,618
I'm sure she was delightful
in her youth.

57
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,870
Then you passed out.

58
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,456
I was passed out, but I wasn't.

59
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,876
I knew what was going on,
but I couldn't move or talk.

60
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,254
Yeah, it sounds like a medical thing.
It's called "cataplexy".

61
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,549
Catfight and cataplexy on the catwalk.

62
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,218
Cool. How much were you drinking?

63
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,637
She only had one sip of champagne.

64
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,433
Forget it.
I'll find out from the tox screen.

65
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,019
All right, look, I gave her a Valium.

66
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,146
- Do you think that's what did this?
- No.

67
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,023
How long have you had the sweats?

68
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,777
- A couple of days.
- Any other complaints?

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,323
My stomach's been bothering me
and I've been feeling a little nauseous.

70
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,991
Okay, here's how this works.

71
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,494
My lackeys will be by shortly
to draw some blood,

72
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,996
collect some urine,
any other fluids you got.

73
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,125
I'll do some other doctorly stuff,
and we'll be in touch.

74
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,009
Since when do you voluntarily
go see patients?

75
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,637
- Have you seen her?
- She's 15.

76
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,515
There's something about her,
something in her eyes,

77
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,767
- kind of a maturity.
- Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul.

78
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,727
This is creepy, even for you.

79
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,355
She's a fashion model,
on the cover of magazines.

80
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,190
We hold her up as the sexual ideal.

81
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,396
The law says
we can't touch her for three more years.

82
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,902
How hypocritical is that?

83
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,781
Did the history reveal anything,
oh, I don't know, medically relevant?

84
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,992
History, right.
I knew I was forgetting something.

85
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,496
You should do one of those while you're
running the labs and the tox screen.

86
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,420
The labs show Valium
and heroin in her urine.

87
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,465
A supermodel on smack. Shocker.

88
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,136
Oh, Alex, I expected
so much more from you.

89
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,097
Heroin chic is so five years ago.

90
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,475
Okay, let's start crossing out
withdrawal symptoms.

91
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,227
A positive test means she tried it once.

92
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,604
It doesn't mean she's an addict.
She's only 15.

93
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
- There's no age limit on addiction.
- He's right.

94
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,574
She's never menstruated. Sounds like
a symptom of drug addiction to me.

95
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,446
Or bulimia. Or her age. Some girls don't
start till their mid-to-late teens.

96
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,741
Evidence to the contrary,
the rounded hips.

97
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,036
The perfectly-sculpted,
bountiful breasts.

98
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,915
Implants.
I've seen some of her photos.

99
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,959
They've grown dramatically
since last summer.

100
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,170
Symptomatic of turning 14.

101
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:28,174
Two clinic hours says that those
"love apples" are handcrafted by God.

102
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,052
- I thought you didn't believe in God.
- I do now.

103
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,220
You're on.

104
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,890
Could we talk about her health
instead of her breasts?

105
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,224
It could be relevant.

106
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,560
Come on, Cameron,
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

107
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,103
Many women develop breasts.

108
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,153
No, I'm fine.

109
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,578
Even if she is an addict,
a lot of her symptoms,

110
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,035
the cataplexy, the violence,
it could be neurological.

111
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,762
If we chalk this up to drugs,
we could be

112
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,039
releasing her with juvenile MS
or Parkinson's...

113
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,999
- Detox her.
- Fine.

114
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,835
We'll set her up on a program,
they'll wean her onto the methadone.

115
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,296
And in four weeks,
we'll know you're right.

116
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,822
Or, we'll know that Cameron's right

117
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,092
and the pretty girl
will do Milan next fall in a wheelchair.

118
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,054
Put her in a coma,
pump her full of naltrexone.

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,931
Cut the four weeks to one night.

120
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,145
The lab reports show that your daughter
had heroin in her system.

121
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,397
Were you aware of her drug use?

122
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,316
No.

123
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,819
We think she's suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

124
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,614
Detoxing generally takes several weeks.

125
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,575
The danger is that if the drugs
are masking some other illness,

126
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,495
it could worsen
before we've weaned her off the heroin.

127
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,871
Well, how much worse?

128
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,457
We don't know because
we don't know what's wrong.

129
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,460
There is a rapid detox procedure.

130
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,338
We flush her system
with an opioid antagonist.

131
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,423
It'll end her addiction overnight.

132
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,095
The process is dangerous
because we have to induce a coma.

133
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,307
It also means that if she ever relapses,
there's a good chance she'll overdose

134
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,643
because her body
won't react to the drug.

135
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,981
So either way I'm risking her life.

136
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,238
Do you have to tell her
how dangerous it is?

137
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,497
Is it dangerous?

138
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,584
There are certain risks.
We've gone over them with your father.

139
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,629
And he's not worried?

140
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,591
He's your dad. He's always gonna worry.

141
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,845
But he knows
we're gonna take good care of you.

142
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,181
Everything's starting to hurt.
My legs are...

143
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,018
Heroin withdrawal
is an extremely painful process.

144
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,062
But we're gonna put you to sleep.
You won't feel a thing.

145
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,650
- You promise?
- I promise.

146
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,738
That was a pretty stupid thing
to do, huh?

147
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,406
Getting hooked on drugs?

148
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,658
Yeah, not the best move
you've ever made.

149
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,119
Just, I thought it would be fun.

150
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,496
You don't have to explain to us.

151
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,124
A lot of,
a lot of the other girls were...

152
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,210
When you wake up,
you'll feel a lot better.

153
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,122
Nurse! Nurse!

154
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,684
You son of a bitch! You killed her!

155
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,938
- She's not dead.
- She had a heart attack.

156
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,648
She's stable now. The anesthesia...

157
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,233
Get her out of that coma.

158
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,735
- I don't think so.
- Stop this!

159
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,905
All right, I don't consent anymore.

160
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,616
I want her to do the slow detox.

161
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,289
Did you ever get a paper cut?
A really nasty one, between the fingers?

162
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,834
Multiply that by about a billion

163
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,003
and you'll just barely approach
the kind of suffering she'll experience

164
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,672
if we wake her up now.

165
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,299
We're committed to this.

166
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,055
She's out till morning. Go get a book.

167
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,943
I haven't slept in weeks,
because my teeth hurt.

168
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,906
The dentist couldn't find any cavities.
And I'm getting these headaches.

169
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,993
Oh! Poor you.

170
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,789
I think I'm going crazy.

171
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,835
And my stomach,
I roll out of bed and I wanna puke.

172
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,837
I take it you're married?

173
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,633
- You must be psychic.
- You must be witty.

174
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,136
- When's she due?
- How'd you know she was...

175
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,390
Because I'm doing her.
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

176
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,311
It's just a fancy way
of saying you should stop whining.

177
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,189
Millions of women have got
the same thing. They're not bugging me.

178
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,441
You're suffering
from sympathetic pregnancy.

179
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,028
Gotta go. People dying.

180
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,740
- Whole circle-of-life thing.
- It's all in my head?

181
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,201
No, it's all in your hormones.

182
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,662
The good news is, no one's gonna
lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.

183
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,128
Shouldn't she be awake by now?

184
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,797
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

185
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,799
Well, you said
that's how long it would take.

186
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,885
I said it would take
about a half an hour.

187
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,721
- Couldn't this mean something more...
- So far, it means nothing.

188
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,932
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.

189
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,643
- She could have something more...
- She's opening her eyes.

190
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,896
Alex, you okay?

191
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,024
Can you hear me?

192
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,656
I got the cute doctor.

193
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,535
Do you feel any pain?

194
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,704
Good. Let us know if anything changes.

195
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,249
If your stomach
doesn't feel right, anything.

196
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,626
Hey.

197
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,588
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

198
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,717
I let you down.

199
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,095
No, no. Not at all, sweetie, I...

200
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,889
I should have been more mature.
I should have handled the pressure.

201
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,224
Stop, stop.

202
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,770
We're gonna get you better, all right?
Nothing else matters.

203
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,148
Excuse me.

204
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,238
I've got you
on what we call a "banana bag".

205
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,990
Plenty of vitamins, nutrients...

206
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,908
I got the cute doctor.

207
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,665
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

208
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,044
- I let you down.
- What's going on?

209
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,923
I should have been more mature.
I should have handled the pressure.

210
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,341
What's wrong with her?

211
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,221
Anterograde amnesia,
short-term memory loss.

212
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,849
Evidence of a hypoxic brain injury.

213
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,644
It might be the result of getting cut
off from the oxygen when she flatlined.

214
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,940
Probably the result of that
rapid detox you told us to push on her.

215
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,484
You gonna put that down?

216
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,284
Are you gonna sulk?

217
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,912
I'm not gonna indulge you.

218
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,624
He treatment for hypoxic brain injuries
consists of...

219
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,544
Cameron, Chase and the Dark One.

220
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,338
Foreman, right?

221
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,215
The patient flatlined
for, like, 30 seconds.

222
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,717
You've got to be oxygen-deprived

223
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,636
for longer than that
to lose brain function.

224
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,639
- We can't be sure how long she was...
- Her brain's fine.

225
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,433
Memory loss. You're saying
that's not a neurological symptom?

226
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,394
No, I'm saying what I'm saying.
Her brain's fine.

227
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,605
She's faking?

228
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,899
She's got posttraumatic stress disorder.

229
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,443
We got models fighting in Iraq now?

230
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,654
Show me a woman on heroin
who looks like that,

231
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,073
and I'll show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

232
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,867
That's your proof?
That she's good looking.

233
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,789
He manages her career, travels
the world with her, at her side 24/7.

234
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,125
He's either a very good dad
or a very bad dad.

235
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,252
You saw that tokus.

236
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,005
Would the fact that
she's your daughter really stop you?

237
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,010
Her brain is running away from reality
and when the drugs can't do it anymore,

238
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,720
it starts to shut down.

239
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,307
Your theory has the advantages
of being completely unprovable

240
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,685
and completely exculpating you.

241
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,105
When you guys are done talking,
do an MRI and an LP.

242
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,671
When her brain checks out as normal,

243
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,567
then we'll know that Daddy
really, really loves her.

244
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,241
Where's House?

245
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,244
- He was in too much pain to work.
- Who's covering?

246
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,663
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.

247
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,457
It was too late to find anybody.
Exam Room One.

248
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,632
- Hi. Where's.
- Dr. House?

249
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,468
I wish I knew. What's the problem?

250
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,179
It's personal.

251
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,976
And it's so personal he didn't bother
writing anything in your chart.

252
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,853
- It's getting worse.
- What is?

253
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,021
It's personal.

254
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,067
- Fine. You can wait.
- Doctor!

255
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,078
I tell you what.

256
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,416
I am going to give you
Dr. House's personal pager number.

257
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,424
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

258
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,469
- Because I had a funny uncle.
- You were abused?

259
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,014
What? No. Why'd your mind
go to that so fast?

260
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,142
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

261
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,603
I don't know
if it's something with this case

262
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,814
or you got something personal
going on, the whole breakup thing?

263
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,441
- It's personal.
- House.

264
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,986
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

265
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,323
You got a problem
with a call I make, question the call.

266
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,741
Don't make it personal.

267
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,243
Are you saying pain
can't affect your mood?

268
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,247
If I'm right about the pain,
you're gonna wanna rush everything,

269
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,458
which is what you're doing.

270
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,709
Don't.

271
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,173
Thank you.

272
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,516
- Are you doing your daughter?
- What?

273
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,564
We should probably talk privately, huh?
Come on, walk with me.

274
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,071
- Come on.
- He's not!

275
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,199
I'm sure he's not.
She is a babe, though.

276
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,343
- We're gonna need you to keep still.
- I am.

277
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,265
What do you think that means?

278
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,976
It's either neurological
or psychological.

279
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,902
The only thing we know for sure is
it's gonna screw up the MRI results,

280
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,939
which is gonna make House
think he's right.

281
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,315
This is a waste of time.

282
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,775
Let's just get the LP.

283
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,155
I should take your head off.

284
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,870
Your glands are fine.
See, now, you're my patient.

285
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:08,206
You got doctor-patient confidentiality.
No worries.

286
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,251
- So, what did you do to her?
- Why would you possibly think...

287
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,503
Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

288
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,964
- You son of...
- It's a compliment.

289
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,343
That heart-shaped ass, those perfect,
perky, all-natural breasts.

290
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,470
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

291
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,599
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

292
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,518
"She just instinctively knows
how to walk."

293
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,147
"Designers just love that heart-shaped
ass, those perfect, perky..."

294
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,232
I'm her manager. I have to promote her.

295
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,276
Oh, that makes sense.

296
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,320
So you compartmentalize.

297
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,864
When you're dealing with the press,
you're her manager.

298
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,366
When you're helping with homework,
you're her dad.

299
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,661
When you're making sweet, sweet love,
you're her manager.

300
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,830
- All right.
- Do you love her?

301
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,790
- I have never touched her.
- Do you love her?

302
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,293
What are you doing?
Are you trying to trap me into saying...

303
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,713
Do you love her enough
to admit that you slept with her?

304
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,012
Psychological conditions can manifest
themselves in physical problems.

305
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,765
Sometimes these can be
extreme enough to kill.

306
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,684
There are treatments,
but only if there is a diagnosis.

307
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,396
Are you going to admit
that you slept with your daughter

308
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,315
or are you just gonna let her die?

309
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,574
One time.

310
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,633
PTSD.

311
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,887
Get her a psyche referral,
pack her bags. He did her.

312
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,932
- Don't think so.
- Daddy thinks so.

313
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,810
He could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

314
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,478
Maybe it was some other daughter.

315
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,106
Elevated proteins in her CSF.

316
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,070
You're wrong about PTSD and I was
wrong about the hypoxic brain injury.

317
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,740
Daddy didn't do this to her.
And neither did we.

318
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,379
We have to call
Child Protective Services.

319
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,172
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

320
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,717
Doesn't apply in abuse cases.
You know that.

321
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,885
We're mandated to report sexual abuse.

322
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,596
Is it okay if I save her life first
or do you want to make sure

323
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,307
that Daddy doesn't get visitation rights
to the gravesite?

324
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,353
Okay, elevated proteins in her CSF
could mean dozens of different things.

325
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,648
- Viral encephalitis, CNSV.
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

326
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,027
So we're just gonna leave a child
molester in the same room as his victim?

327
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,611
It's got windows.

328
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,451
Fine. Arrest him. Use Cuddy's handcuffs.

329
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,497
If you're too distracted to deal with
this because your leg hurts, then...

330
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,913
Yeah, I'm distracted!

331
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,042
I'm all hung up on this 15-year-old
patient who's cataplectic,

332
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,648
can't remember what she had for lunch

333
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,462
and is rapidly losing control
of her body!

334
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,948
And I want her father here
in case he's got any more secrets

335
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,089
that I need to know about.

336
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,718
Now, if you're not too distracted,
go take out a piece of her brain,

337
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,428
stick it under a microscope.

338
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,265
- Wilson!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,976
Do you really think we need
to jump straight to brain biopsy?

340
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,603
Nope. Let's continue playing.

341
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,564
"Pin the diagnosis on the supermodel"
until she's dead.

342
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,780
- I heard you killed your supermodel.
- Only for a minute.

343
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,575
Just for my own clarity, how many more
patients do you have to kill

344
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,620
before you admit this leg thing
just might be a problem?

345
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,829
Three.

346
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,583
I need your help.

347
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,174
We're gonna do something
called a burr-hole biopsy.

348
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,511
We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

349
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,806
Doctor, maybe you and I
should talk about this first.

350
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,973
No.

351
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,727
I just think Alex doesn't need
to be overwhelmed right now.

352
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,772
I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

353
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,909
Now, we're gonna remove
a small piece of brain tissue.

354
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,745
Do you have to shave my hair?

355
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,747
Hair grows back.

356
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,291
I guess I won't remember anyways.

357
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,086
There's a good chance
the amnesia is only temporary.

358
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,424
Okay.

359
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,919
Find a way to kick up the contribution.

360
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,382
What did House do now?

361
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,142
House, this is God.

362
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,437
Look, I'm a little busy right now.

363
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,231
I'm not supposed
to talk during these things.

364
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,941
Got time Thursday?

365
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,777
Let me check. Oh, I've got a plague.

366
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,362
What about Friday?

367
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,240
You'll have to check with Cameron.

368
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,867
Oh, damn it!

369
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,661
She always wants to know
why bad things happen.

370
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,289
Like I'm gonna come up
with a new answer this time.

371
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
House.

372
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,586
Quick, God, smite the evil witch!

373
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,879
Are you sitting on evidence

374
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,045
that your patient
was sexually abused by her father?

375
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,175
God, why have you forsaken me?

376
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,678
Don't worry.
I've contacted child services for you.

377
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,098
I let you get away
with more than anyone in this hospital.

378
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,101
Shielding a child abuser isn't covered.

379
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,897
Cooperate with this investigation
or I'll fire you.

380
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,736
What do you think House
is gonna do to you?

381
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,987
No idea.

382
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,614
Well, you did the right thing.

383
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,533
If you hadn't gone to Cuddy,
I would have.

384
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,461
If this guy had known
we'd have to report him,

385
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,329
he'd never have told House the truth.

386
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,374
She's a child,
she needs to be protected.

387
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,126
She dropped out of high school
to make millions of dollars.

388
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,670
Why does she need more protection

389
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,506
than some crack whore
shivering in the clinic waiting room?

390
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,133
I think you're just afraid
to piss House off.

391
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,803
There's that, too.

392
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,556
MRI looks exactly the same
as it did two years ago.

393
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,392
The nerves don't seem
to be regenerating.

394
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,269
I figured as much.

395
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,479
Several different researchers
have proven

396
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,856
psychological pain
can manifest as physical pain.

397
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,526
You think I have a conversion disorder?
You want me to see a shrink?

398
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,487
Brilliant idea sending Stacy away.
It's really done wonders for you.

399
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,613
Listen, none of this
has anything to do with Stacy.

400
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,782
Right. Giant coincidence

401
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,451
that you've gone completely
off the rails since she left.

402
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,329
Inducing migraines, worsening leg pains.

403
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,958
Oh, do you miss Stacy, too?

404
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,307
Brain biopsy shows
no white matter disease.

405
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,020
Cameron, you gonna tell Cuddy, or has
she already got you wired for sound?

406
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,274
I had to do what I thought was right.

407
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,652
So, white is out. It just leaves gray.

408
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,990
Neuronal ceroid lipofucinosis,
Heller Syndrome...

409
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,576
Any one of the mitochondrial
encephalopathies.

410
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,702
Am I in trouble?

411
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,829
You had to do
what you thought was right.

412
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,000
They call it "gray area" because
you never really know what's there.

413
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,793
We can't test for any of those things.

414
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,420
So I'm not in trouble?

415
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,756
You can torture yourself all you want.

416
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,138
What if everything
we're seeing is just smoke signals?

417
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,641
- Okay. Who's sending them?
- Tumor.

418
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,437
If she has cancer anywhere in her body,

419
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:12,065
she could also have
Paraneoplastic Syndrome,

420
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,151
which could be causing antibodies
to attack her brain.

421
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,611
Antibodies are stupid that way.

422
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,697
Paraneoplastic Syndrome's
awfully rare in a 15-year-old.

423
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,241
15-year-olds who look like
that are awfully rare.

424
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,244
It would explain the aggressive
behavior, the cataplexy,

425
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,705
the memory loss, even the twitching.
It's perfect.

426
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,207
What if it's not?

427
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,013
We could waste a week
searching for a tumor

428
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,543
that we don't even know is there.

429
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,379
Then let's make sure it is there.

430
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,464
There's no test
for Paraneoplastic Syndrome.

431
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,590
Sure there is.

432
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,592
The "squeeze the tube" test.

433
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,389
- What did the biopsy tell you?
- It wasn't definitive.

434
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:49,477
But the twitching should stop
right about now.

435
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,899
Oh, my God.

436
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,859
Could have just been
a coincidence.

437
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,613
Twitching does tend to stop and start.
Let's be sure.

438
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,914
The MG vacuums her blood, neutralizes
the stuff that's making her twitch.

439
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,960
It's actually kind of cool.

440
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,050
- I wonder if I could make you dance.
- Enough.

441
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,803
This is unbelievable.
You did it. You fixed her.

442
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:24,929
No.

443
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,974
All I did was prove that she has cancer.

444
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,691
I need a favor.

445
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,487
I'm not in a giving mood.

446
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,323
It'll help us both.

447
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,326
I need a shot of morphine in my spine.

448
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,163
If your leg hurts, take your Vicodin.

449
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,039
It's not enough.

450
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,542
Get a syringe.

451
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,044
Morphine is extreme, even for you.

452
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:01,799
- Yeah. Write that on the insert.
- Get one of your lackeys to do it.

453
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,176
I don't want them knowing...

454
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,178
That you're on the road
to becoming a junkie?

455
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,637
That I'm in this much pain.

456
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,348
I don't want them
questioning my judgment.

457
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,143
I can't ask Wilson, because he figures
it's all in my head.

458
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,354
Well, I agree with him. I'm going home.

459
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,652
- What about this?
- What are you doing?

460
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,696
Is this in my head?

461
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,786
Because I could swear
I remember a thigh muscle being here.

462
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,833
I'll get a syringe.

463
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,598
- It's gotta be cancer.
- It's not cancer.

464
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,727
You seem to be
back to your old miserable self.

465
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,399
So I just randomly predicted
she'd respond to MG?

466
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,901
Her twitches are gone,
her memory's getting better.

467
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,069
What did you take?

468
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,405
The increased pain was psychological.

469
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,906
No drug's gonna help.

470
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,993
If you think it will help, the drugs
will help. The power of the mind.

471
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,119
You're right.

472
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,705
The more I talk to you,
the more the pain floods back.

473
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,875
I knew the twins were real.
Chase owes me.

474
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,087
- Did you check the pancreas?
- Oh, come on.

475
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,631
You're just making up organs now,
aren't you?

476
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,383
We checked the pancreas.

477
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,053
- Obviously, you've taken something.
- Did you check the bones?

478
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,640
- There are a lot of bones, I think.
- And none of them have cancer.

479
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,350
- Ovaries?
- There's no mass.

480
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,935
If anything, they're undersized.

481
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,271
No leukemia, no Hodgkin's,
we checked everything.

482
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,898
Unless they've invented a new organ,
it's not cancer.

483
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,909
- Differential diagnosis.
- It's gotta be cancer.

484
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,703
There's gotta be something we missed.

485
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,390
You've got to learn to let go, Foreman.

486
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,082
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

487
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,667
It might just still be PTSD.

488
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,252
Just PTSD?

489
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,088
Yeah, Daddy's diddling her.
Nothing to worry about.

490
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,632
Okay, let me rephrase.

491
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,384
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

492
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,845
Oh, my God! It might be PTSD!

493
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,015
If it was PTSD, the twitching
wouldn't have magically disappeared

494
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,975
when we started the MG.

495
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,769
Wrong.

496
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,189
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

497
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,275
Nothing to stop it
from magically disappearing.

498
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,070
She was watching me
start and stop the medicine.

499
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,030
You think she's faking?

500
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,531
Not consciously.

501
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,159
But if her subconscious
is trying to get away from it all,

502
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,495
cancer's gotta be
a lovely vacation spot.

503
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,374
Tell her you've got to give her
a fresh IV.

504
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,260
Don't tell her
you're starting her on saline.

505
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,169
See if the twitching comes back.

506
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,228
How long has the social worker
been in there?

507
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,055
Just went in.
She was in with the dad before.

508
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,225
- You switched the girl's IV?
- About a half an hour ago.

509
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,394
When's she gonna start twitching?

510
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,064
If she's gonna start twitching.
Another few minutes.

511
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,942
We've got to wait for the remaining MG
to clear her system.

512
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,987
That was quick. What's gonna happen?

513
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,781
What'd you think was gonna happen?

514
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,728
- The father had sex...
- Do you have any medical evidence?

515
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,286
- He admitted...
- He denies the conversation took place.

516
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,497
- But she...
- She denies it, too.

517
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,082
I'm sure you meant well.

518
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,137
You have to tell her the truth.

519
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,513
Nothing happened.

520
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,266
You don't have to be afraid of him.
They can protect you.

521
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,184
From what? Things are fine.

522
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,440
You think things are fine. They're not.

523
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,734
- He's my dad.
- He's abusing you.

524
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,319
He's not a bad person.

525
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,364
I seduced him.

526
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,577
You're the child. He's the adult.

527
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,496
- He has the responsibility...
- I got him drunk.

528
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,124
I had to get him drunk.

529
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,043
I wanted to have sex with him.

530
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,005
You're sexually attracted
to your father?

531
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:57,762
No. But by sleeping with him,
now he lets me do whatever I want.

532
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,102
I also slept with my photographer,
my financial manager and my tutor.

533
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:11,025
If I hadn't, I'd be getting Cs

534
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,278
and posing for newspaper ads
back in Detroit.

535
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,908
- Come on, we all do it.
- No, we don't.

536
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,953
After your father slept with you,
you were traumatized.

537
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,372
My dad was last.

538
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,128
You've never taken a run
at your boss or professor

539
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,713
or somebody else you needed?

540
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,760
You're 15. You're smart.

541
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,930
- You don't have...
- I am not that smart.

542
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,558
I am that beautiful.

543
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,112
What's wrong with me?

544
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,371
Oh! George, get your butt over here!

545
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,332
- Help me.
- How'd you get my pager number?

546
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,542
Please!

547
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,087
The problem is,
if I give you an epidural,

548
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,964
you won't be able to feel when to push.

549
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,174
- You're not funny.
- I'm pretty sure I am.

550
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,340
You just can't appreciate it
because you're in pain.

551
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,388
George, if you don't get off your ass
and help me...

552
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,431
Oh, shut up!

553
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,769
You've got yourself the perfect man.
A woman.

554
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,981
He's got more estrogen
coursing through his veins than...

555
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,989
- Who did her vaginal exam?
- I did.

556
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,533
- Did she have hair?
- What are you getting at?

557
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,953
Right now I'm getting at whether or not
she had hair down there.

558
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,246
Not much.

559
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,249
She's manipulative,
yet completely docile.

560
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,544
Everybody tells us that outburst
on the catwalk was out of character.

561
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,755
- She's never had a period.
- You're thinking this is hormonal?

562
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,174
I'm thinking she's the ultimate woman.

563
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,761
I need to schedule an MRI.

564
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:06,974
The twitching stopped.

565
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,186
Because we changed your medicine
back to the real stuff.

566
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,479
Stop talking.

567
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,481
You gave me fake medicine?

568
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,026
That's what I said,

569
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,672
in the vain hope that you wouldn't feel
the need to also say it.

570
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,196
Stop talking.

571
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,159
Wilson already did an ultrasound.
He said her ovaries were undersized.

572
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,996
The ultrasound would be the way to go
if you were looking for ovarian cancer.

573
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,956
What are we looking for?

574
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,794
That.

575
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,173
Oh, my God.

576
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,801
It looks like a tumor, doesn't it?

577
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,430
- But those are...
- Yep.

578
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,614
We found a tumor.

579
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,325
She has cancer?

580
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,956
- Technically, no.
- So it's not cancer?

581
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:16,085
No, it's cancer, but "he" has cancer

582
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,048
on "his" left testicle.

583
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,679
- I don't have testicles.
- She's not a guy.

584
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,306
His DNA says you're wrong.

585
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,519
Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails.

586
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,815
You've got male
pseudohermaphroditism.

587
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,526
You see, we all start out as girls

588
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,570
and then we're differentiated,
based on our genes.

589
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,366
The ovaries develop
into testes and drop.

590
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,121
But in about one
in every 150,000 pregnancies,

591
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,622
the fetus with an XY chromosome

592
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,291
a boy, develops into something else,

593
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,127
like you.

594
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:03,173
Your testes never descended,
because you're immune to testosterone.

595
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,634
You're pure estrogen.

596
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,847
Which is why you have heightened
female characteristics,

597
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:13,183
clear skin, great breasts.

598
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,604
The ultimate woman is a man.

599
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,358
Nature's cruel, huh?

600
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:26,196
This is obviously a joke.
This is impossible.

601
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,784
No. A joke would be
me calling you a homo.

602
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,286
You see the difference?

603
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,873
I'll schedule him for surgery.

604
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:43,213
No! You're wrong!
I'm a girl! Look at me!

605
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,507
How could you say I'm not a girl?

606
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,261
You see, they're all looking at me.
I'm beautiful!

607
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,184
That anger.
It's just the cancer talking.

608
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:02,066
Put your clothes back on.
We're gonna cut your balls off.

609
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,442
Then you'll be fine.

610
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,312
- How's the patient?
- Post-op.

611
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,733
They sent him/her up for a psyche visit.

612
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,487
Calling her a "him/her"
isn't really helping.

613
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,574
The good news is, I don't think Dad's
gonna be sleeping with him/her again.

614
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,284
You see, now it's gross.

615
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,791
I need another shot.

616
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,002
When did the pain start coming back?

617
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,504
A few hours ago.

618
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,507
About an hour after you solved the case?

619
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,846
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed,
I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.

620
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,597
Same dosage?

621
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,642
If you'd be more comfortable,

622
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,562
I might be able to deal
with a few less CCs of morphine.

623
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,272
It wasn't morphine.

624
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,360
What did you give me?
I told you I wanted...

625
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,820
It was saline.

626
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,739
I gave you a placebo.
