1
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,115
Honey?

2
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,454
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:42,083
Yeah, I'm just fighting off
a stomach bug.

4
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,376
I'll be fine.

5
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,797
- Did he sleep OK?
- Great, as long as I was holding him.

6
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,590
I can't wait for colic to be over.

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,179
Hold on, Mikey. Bath time's coming.

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,599
He lifted his head yesterday.

9
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,103
Take the day off.

10
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,022
I mean, you're sick anyway,
and you hardly ever see him.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,108
Or me.

12
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:08,901
I can't.

13
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,903
I've got a meeting with
Crandall's Kitchens.

14
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,322
I think that deal's gonna close.

15
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,117
They called about the car payment again.

16
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,910
It's two months late.

17
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,166
We're gonna be fine, honey.

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,377
Enjoy your bath, little man.

19
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,148
You know, honey?

20
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,987
Honey, I'm not gonna go in.
I'm coming down with something.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,950
Honey?

22
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,661
Kara?

23
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,835
Kara!

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,095
Mikey!

25
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,306
Kara!

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,018
Mikey!

27
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,428
Four-week-old infant submerged
in a bathtub. Don't know how long.

28
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,097
Non-responsive at the scene.

29
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,016
- Get a trauma team for six.
- Obviously breathing now.

30
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,102
Continue the Bodybox.
Stat portable chest.

31
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,436
Caucasian female, 32.

32
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,106
Where am I?
Tonic-clonic seizure.

33
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,901
- Brent, where am I?
- On one, two, three.

34
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,487
- Where am I?
- One, two, three.

35
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,739
You're in the hospital, honey.
You're in the hospital.

36
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,147
Honey, Mikey's here,
and the doctors say he's gonna be OK.

37
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,203
Hopefully.
He needs to be checked out by the NICU.

38
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,912
- What happened?
- You passed out.

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,831
- What?
- Mikey fell.

40
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,667
- Has your wife had a seizure before?
- No.

41
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,711
I can't move my head! I want to see him!

42
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,046
He's right here, honey.
He's OK. He's right here.

43
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,550
Tonight. I Word marathon.

44
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,470
- You watch The L Word?
- On mute.

45
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,722
I'll pass.

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,474
Dinner with Cuddy.

47
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,063
Still sucking up so she'll fund
your play space for the chemo kids?

48
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,151
They really ought to save their energy
for other things, like crying.

49
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,320
She's the suck-up.

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,072
She asked you?

51
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,577
She's smart.
She knows if she buys me enough alcohol

52
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,163
my defenses just might be weakened.

53
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,125
It doesn't make sense.
Unless she ran out of batteries.

54
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,171
Hey. I'm recently single, she's single.

55
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,674
You're too nice for her to like you.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,177
She's not needy enough for you
to like her.

57
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,681
She's got an agenda, just not one that
includes an appearance by little Jimmy.

58
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,102
I'll poll my peeps. How many of you
think that Cuddy asked...

59
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,105
Or, rather, peep.

60
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,274
Chase caught a case in the ER.
He wants us to take a look.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,361
Unless Chase broke his neck
falling off his polo pony,

62
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,488
he had no reason to be in the ER.

63
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,698
Cuddy put him on a two-week NICU
rotation.

64
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,992
Patient had an unexplained seizure.

65
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,121
Seizures are cool to watch,
boring to diagnose.

66
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,667
What about Foreman? He needs to get
his malingering butt back here.

67
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,918
He almost died.

68
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,505
- "Almost" being the operative word.
- Hey.

69
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,551
- How are you doing? You look great.
- Thanks. I feel great.

70
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,932
Glad you're back.
Cameron makes lousy coffee.

71
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,936
I take mine black, the way I take
my brain-damaged neurologists.

72
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,354
Happy to help.

73
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,986
- How are you coming along?
- Tell her everything's great.

74
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,821
Neither of us wants to deal with
her guilt.

75
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,489
- I don't feel guilty.
- Of course not.

76
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,826
Hell, if people felt guilt every time
they accidentally lobotomized a guy...

77
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,494
I was trying to save his life.

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,122
Yeah. Your heart was in the right place.

79
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,460
It's just his brain that's not quite
where it's supposed to be.

80
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,965
- Tell her everything's great.
- It's true.

81
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,635
No more left side/right side reversals.
Still some short-term memory loss

82
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,889
and spatial processing problems, but
I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.

83
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,975
Yeah, might pull a muscle.

84
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,143
We have a case?

85
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,061
Seizure that can't be explained
by epilepsy

86
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,022
and accompanied by
elevated calcium levels.

87
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,941
Still bored. Tell her why.

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,612
Because seizure with mildly elevated
calcium is diagnostically simple.

89
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:08,492
It's either hyperparathyroid, cancer,
or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.

90
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,744
Well done.

91
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,582
But until you can remember how
to make coffee, hands off the patients.

92
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,417
House.

93
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,504
All those reasons this case bores you,
the ER has already ruled them out.

94
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,018
Lungs are clear. Get an EEG.
Confirm the brain function is OK.

95
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,270
Can we focus on the task at hand?

96
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,608
Why did Mommy twitch so hard that
she tossed the baby in the bath water?

97
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,861
- You don't need me for this.
- Of course I need you. We're a team.

98
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,531
Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries
in the brain cause seizures.

99
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,284
Inflamed arteries in the kidneys
cause calcium build-up.

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,246
You're a moron. Did you even look at
the file? Kidney function is fine.

101
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,874
- Whipple's?
- What?

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,919
- Whipple's.
- Test her.

103
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,881
Cameron thinks it starts with a "W".
I'm thinking "V".

104
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,926
The dad vomited this morning.
Maybe they've both got strep.

105
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,732
You think you can do
a strep-throat culture

106
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,846
without the swab ending up in
the guy's poop chute?

107
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,182
- "V" for "vasoconstriction".
- That'd be my guess.

108
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,643
Excess calcium makes blood vessels
in the brain clamp down.

109
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,562
Best case scenario, seizure.
Worst case, stroke.

110
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,065
Do a digital subtraction angiogram.

111
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,692
Foreman can't tell up from down,
Cameron's a girl.

112
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,985
All that mechanical stuff.

113
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,446
Sorry. Cuddy says I'm stuck here.

114
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,468
You're late.

115
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,388
And you are in my locked office.

116
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,016
- Again.
- What you got there?

117
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,935
Special panties for your date
with Wilson?

118
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,312
It's not a date.
And it's none of your business.

119
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,356
If it's not a date, it is business.

120
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,163
And if it was business, you wouldn't say
it was none of my business.

121
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,695
- What do you want?
- To talk about your date with Wilson.

122
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,072
- It's not a date.
- This is fun.

123
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,159
Spring Chase from NICU
and I'll shut up about your date.

124
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:17,955
- NICU is short-staffed.
- Have you lost the ability to lie?

125
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,000
Nobody's quit NICU in two years.

126
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:26,172
And if you're making up reasons,
that means there is no reason,

127
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,133
which means he asked for the
assignment, didn't he?

128
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,136
If Chase needs a break from you,
he should take it.

129
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,142
Absolutely.

130
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,904
Both Mom and Dad are negative for
strep.

131
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,868
You'll be back playing with
the big toys soon.

132
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,622
- Or not. Either way, I'm fine.
- You don't have to say that.

133
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,459
It's OK. I could always work
in a research lab or teach.

134
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,088
- And you'd be OK with that?
- Why wouldn't I be?

135
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,009
You were planning on pursuing grants
of your own, running a department.

136
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,802
I'm alive.

137
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,388
Changing jobs, not making coffee,

138
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,226
if that stuff bothers me now,
I don't deserve this second chance.

139
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,905
They say that physical contact
helps the healing process.

140
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,095
What's happening?

141
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,099
Your son's not getting enough oxygen.
Take Mr Mason outside.

142
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,026
Lung's collapsed. He's not getting
any air. I need an IV catheter.

143
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,073
Another seizure?

144
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,701
Her chest muscles aren't contracting.
It's something else.

145
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,502
Her whole back is spasming.
I need two milligrams of lorazepam.

146
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,053
He's OK.

147
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,849
His lung wouldn't collapse if he was OK.

148
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,435
- What the hell's happening?
- I have no idea.

149
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,916
So what causes seizures,

150
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,879
hypercalcemia, and the thing
where Mommy bends like Gumby?

151
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,715
- Little busy here.
- Uh-oh.

152
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,092
Baby's lungs are gonna conk out
any minute.

153
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,510
Probably want to deal with that.

154
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,956
I'll get right on it as soon as
I finish indulging my boss.

155
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,349
- Multi-task.
- Chemical pneumonitis.

156
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,060
Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs
when he was underwater.

157
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,022
Start him on prednisone.
Keep him on high FI02.

158
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,232
Let the indulging commence.

159
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,568
Lithium could cause all three of
the mother's symptoms.

160
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,071
- No record she's on lithium.
- And the tox screen was negative.

161
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,948
Lithium doesn't show on
a basic tox screen, Scarecrow.

162
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,118
Myelomatous meningitis could also
cover everything.

163
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,206
Rare complications of a rare blood
cancer. You're not totally hopeless.

164
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,292
Get an S-PEP and an MRI for
myelomatous meningitis.

165
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,044
Search the patient's place for lithium.

166
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,339
The baby's lung problem is bacterial
and not chemical. Start ECMO.

167
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,426
While you're searching for the lithium,
take a water sample and check the pipes.

168
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,096
You want me to write this down for you?

169
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,559
I ask you, is almost dying
any excuse for not being fun?

170
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,941
I'm not putting that baby on ECMO.

171
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,193
The chance of there being bacteria
in bathwater...

172
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,737
Why don't you want to work for me?

173
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,031
I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.

174
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,410
I'm not working NICU because of you.

175
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,831
The baby's x-ray suggested
chemical pneumonitis.

176
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,709
Not to me.
The x-ray was too consolidated.

177
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,004
So, why are you down here?
Hoping to expand your make-out pool

178
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,007
to include the preemie
to nine-year-old demographic?

179
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,680
I needed a break.

180
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,016
From the patients.

181
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,270
They lie to us all the time.

182
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,440
Foreman almost died trying to save
a drug-dealing cop.

183
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,527
I just wanted to get away from that
for a while.

184
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,449
What a complete load of crap.

185
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:08,287
What am I? A nurse you're trying to prep
with this vulnerability thing?

186
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,913
ECMO could kill him.

187
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,292
You don't start him on ECMO and that
infection could rampage through his body

188
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,878
like Pistons fans after a championship.

189
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,382
But you do it your way.
Nothing more honest than a dead baby.

190
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,639
ECMO stands for
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

191
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,268
- We remove your son's blood...
- OK, all of his blood?

192
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:35,772
We run it through a machine which takes
out carbon dioxide and adds oxygen.

193
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,359
Then we re-warm the blood
and run it back into his body.

194
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,198
There is a significant risk of internal
hemorrhaging, and he may also suffer...

195
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,034
You put him on antibiotics.
Won't that take care of the infection?

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,619
Not fast enough.

197
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you sure this is Mikey's best shot?

198
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,210
Absolutely.

199
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,530
- Cuddy's trash?
- Not any more.

200
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,740
I paid good money for it.

201
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,492
Look at what she bought.

202
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,664
- Red clover.
- What is red clover used for?

203
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,002
Also used to treat asthma,
psoriasis, joint pain...

204
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,047
She doesn't wheeze, flake, or ache.

205
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,009
And she didn't ask a pulmonologist
or a dermatologist for dinner.

206
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,886
She invited an oncologist.

207
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,057
It's not a date. It's a consult.

208
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,853
Mom's MRI was negative for
masses, abscesses.

209
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,147
- There's no sign she has myelomatous...
- Fascinating.

210
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,984
- Call me when we have...
- She has a subarachnoid bleed.

211
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,737
So, why is our patient
bleeding into her brain?

212
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,115
Her blood work-up shows
her pro-time's elevated.

213
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,952
She's bleeding because she's not
clotting. So, why is she not clotting?

214
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,328
What did you bring us, Daddy?

215
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,374
The only mood-altering drug was vodka
at the back of a drawer.

216
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,668
Hiding booze is
a classic alcoholic behavior.

217
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,795
- That'd explain the bleeding.
- What bleeding?

218
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,591
You don't remember? She bled
all over you this morning. Kidding.

219
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,927
Idiots are fun.
No wonder every village wants one.

220
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,472
If she's an alcoholic, she would
also be more prone to hypercalcemia.

221
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,683
But the tox screen was
negative for alcohol.

222
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,226
Hey, it was your idea.

223
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,438
Now, it's even better.
Mommy quits. She gets the DTs.

224
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,566
- Even explains the seizure.
- It also fits conversion disorder.

225
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,986
They're deep in debt, he's working
around the clock, they got a new baby.

226
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,822
I think the seizure was a physical
response to psychological stress.

227
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,866
Boozy Mommy covers more symptoms.

228
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,494
Put her in a nice phenobarbital coma
before the DTs kill her.

229
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,750
- Where are you going?
- To put her in a pheno coma.

230
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,793
What if I'm wrong?
What if Daddy's the drunk?

231
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,639
Do you want us to give her
the pheno or not?

232
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,088
I want him to argue his point.

233
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,341
I assume you considered the father
and ruled him out.

234
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,135
What's that saying? When you assume,
you become a pain in the ass to me.

235
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,304
Why should I argue?
You'd just overrule me.

236
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,058
Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon
farm.

237
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,934
- House?
- I need him to react.

238
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,811
I need him to act like a human being.

239
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,981
I need him to get over
this boring near-death rebirth.

240
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,652
I have changed.
That's not something you get over.

241
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,572
Nearly dying changes everything forever.
For about two months.

242
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,825
Two months is too long.
I need the guy I hired back. Now.

243
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,454
No matter how much your misery
loves company, it's not getting mine.

244
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,421
I'll talk to the dad.
Cameron can take the mom.

245
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,958
- We'll figure out if Mom is a drinker.
- Waste of time.

246
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,711
Put her in a coma
before the DTs kill her.

247
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,772
So...

248
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,317
is this a separation, or...

249
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,072
Well, lawyers have been hired,
friends divvied up.

250
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,741
Oddly, she didn't fight me for House.

251
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:20,122
At least there aren't kids involved.
You just have each other to deal with.

252
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,127
If there had been kids,
maybe we would have done more of that.

253
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,383
Do you want kids?

254
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,849
Listen, is there anything in particular
you wanted to...

255
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,852
- Hospital business or...
- Catching up.

256
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:48,024
I mean, you know, it's not like either
one of us has anybody to run home to.

257
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,986
No.

258
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,124
How are you feeling?

259
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,920
OK. A little groggy.

260
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,922
There's somebody here to see you.

261
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,970
Hey, Mikey. Mommy's awake.

262
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,729
Oh, Mikey. Gosh, I was so scared.

263
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,649
Oh, I love you.

264
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,237
I love you so much. Oh.

265
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,617
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,663
You don't have anything to be
sorry about. You were sick.

267
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,344
Turns out she and her husband met
in AA.

268
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,930
Obviously, she slipped. Good call.

269
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,309
It wasn't hard, considering my other
choice was your stupid psych theory.

270
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,646
Which was not stupid.

271
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,317
I'm telling you, I'm gonna drop
the N-bomb if I have to.

272
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,821
- You're addicted to conflict.
- Did they change the name?

273
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,782
You could have handled this patient
without dragging Chase in.

274
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,909
But the fact that he didn't want in
killed you.

275
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,829
Just like the fact you can't get
a rise out of me.

276
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,043
Where's the baby?

277
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,430
Get off me! No! I have to do this!

278
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,933
No breath sounds.
Crash cart and epi! Stat!

279
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,021
I told you your psych theory
wasn't stupid.

280
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,860
Your son is stable.

281
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,070
But the lack of oxygen
damaged his kidneys.

282
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,990
She must have rolled over on him
by mistake.

283
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:04,035
Mr Mason, I was there.

284
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,413
Your wife tried to smother your son.

285
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,544
That's impossible.
Kara would never hurt Mikey.

286
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,468
He knows. They said Mikey knows.

287
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,846
You hear voices?

288
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,474
They wouldn't quit saying that
Mikey would be better off if...

289
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,021
They were right.

290
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,527
We've been trying to diagnose
a seizure that didn't exist.

291
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,530
She faked it when her husband caught
her. I don't think she faked it.

292
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,742
She just happened to seize right in
the middle of drowning her child?

293
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,578
- Lucky break for the kid.
- Hey, take it easy on Foreman.

294
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,622
He's playing with one lobe
tied behind his back.

295
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,916
Postpartum psychosis
makes her want to drown her kid.

296
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,876
The internal conflict
triggers a seizure.

297
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,879
You know what else might be a trigger?
A physical illness.

298
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,005
It's a wild idea, I know.

299
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,799
Especially since she doesn't have
any obviously physical symptoms,

300
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,344
like internal bleeding
or excess calcium.

301
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,598
- I'll draw some blood.
- Oh! Jeez! You've done it again!

302
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,267
- Will you argue with me?
- Drinkers don't eat right.

303
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,269
That explains the bleeding
and the calcium.

304
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,835
This might just be some crazy drunk,

305
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,815
and I'm telling you she's about
to die of myelomatous meningitis.

306
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,401
- We already tested for...
- Exactly. It's an insane idea.

307
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,988
- What do you want me to do?
- Have an original thought.

308
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,366
In the meantime, stress her into
having another seizure.

309
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,992
We can't. She's on haloperidol.

310
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,329
You also can't because it's dangerous
and highly unethical.

311
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,873
Therefore, if you get caught,
pretend you can't make coffee.

312
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,125
Mental defectives get tons of slack.

313
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,005
Take her off the haloperidol,
hook her up to an EEG,

314
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,591
flash some lights, make her pant,
shoot her up with a placebo.

315
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,469
When she starts twitching, if
the machine twitches along, it's real.

316
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,764
If not, well, call the cops,
cos she's a psycho killer.

317
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,897
- Stop pushing him.
- Stop protecting him.

318
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,483
- He needs it.
- Not if he wants to get better.

319
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,903
- He might not be able to get better.
- Well, I need a new neurologist.

320
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,154
He got sick doing his job.

321
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,449
If he got killed doing his job,
I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.

322
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,370
I don't care how guilty you feel or how
touched you are by his reborn spirit.

323
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,414
- I am not touched.
- Then you're guilt-ridden.

324
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,499
- I'm not guilt-ridden.
- Then you're pathetic.

325
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,667
Right now, I'm annoyed.

326
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,503
Keeping him up in the seizure lab
is not the way to advance his recovery.

327
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,088
- It's too much.
- You're right.

328
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,258
You should stick around.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

329
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,352
Kara, look directly into the light.

330
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,439
Keep looking.

331
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,942
Thought you'd be gone for the day.

332
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,320
Thought I'd wait for
the bone marrow biopsy results.

333
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,489
House sent you to baby-sit me,
didn't he?

334
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,158
He asked me to wait for the results.

335
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,535
- Cameron, it's fine.
- Of course it is.

336
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,458
Look, a few weeks ago, you were upset
that I didn't consider you a friend.

337
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,793
Now you're upset that I'm happy?

338
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,838
What can I say? Apparently, I'm a bitch.

339
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,214
I didn't say that.

340
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,382
It's annoying.

341
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,384
Insisting every day of your life
is a blessing

342
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,386
is basically calling
everyone else shallow.

343
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,930
- It gets old.
- Sorry.

344
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,390
Oh, give it a rest.

345
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,897
How was dinner?

346
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,983
Cuddy did not mention cancer.

347
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,904
- She lost her nerve.
- It was a date.

348
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,492
- What are you doing?
- PCR test.

349
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,038
You're doing it yourself in
the middle of the night.

350
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,999
On a spoon.

351
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,044
Cuddy's spoon.

352
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,296
I'm checking her saliva
for cancer markers.

353
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,010
Yeah. I do that after all my dates, too.

354
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,056
People think you're the nice one.

355
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,391
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?

356
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:59,562
You go first.
You desperately want this to be a date.

357
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,273
Because the alternative is cancer.

358
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,025
Just admit that you like her.

359
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,821
She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod.

360
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,824
I think it's great you can look
beyond the fact she's the devil.

361
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,159
I stole a spoon. You stole her garbage.

362
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,994
She's my boss.

363
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:19,624
If she gets sick, the hospital might
replace her, especially if she dies.

364
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,418
I'd have to learn how to
manipulate someone new.

365
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
Whoa.

366
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,881
I think I'm gonna cry.

367
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,883
Find me when the results come in.

368
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,271
Mr Mason, because of the damage
done to your son's kidneys,

369
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,940
his potassium is climbing.

370
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,192
That's causing irregular heartbeats.

371
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,737
I'm doubling the meds
and starting him on dialysis.

372
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:56,161
But unless we get his potassium down,
he's gonna have a heart attack.

373
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,791
Kara, just another few minutes.

374
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,879
Biopsy's back. She's negative for
myelomatous meningitis.

375
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,755
And she's not seizing.

376
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,135
- So, we're wrong and House is wrong.
- And you're OK with that?

377
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,888
She's seizing.

378
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,977
She's not doing anything.

379
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,063
Her brain activity isn't accelerating,
it's slowing down.

380
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,779
Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping
and sucking motions.

381
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,073
She's in an encephalopathic delirium.

382
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,950
Hmm.

383
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,746
A genuine physiological illness.
That rules out a few things.

384
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,914
Like what, I wonder?

385
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,833
Postpartum psychosis
and conversion disorder.

386
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,878
The thing about being a good loser,
you're still a loser.

387
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,129
Ouch.

388
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,798
The delirium means her brain is
shutting down,

389
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,926
reverting to
its most instinctual functions.

390
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,762
And since it's progressing,
I think we can assume it's progressive,

391
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,599
which means it won't be long before
the brain closes shop altogether.

392
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,392
Ideas?

393
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,815
- He's in V-fib.
- His potassium's still too high.

394
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,903
No pulse. Get him off the machine.

395
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,910
Charge to 10. Clear.

396
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,038
Still in V-fib.

397
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,083
Another amp of epi.

398
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,257
Chase shouldn't be
wasting his time in NICU.

399
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,758
Could be Wernicke's.

400
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,010
No. Treatment for
Wernicke's is thiamine.

401
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,554
We gave her that
together with the pheno.

402
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,121
Delirium points to lithium.
I know we didn't' find any, but...

403
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,476
She'd have to be smuggling it in
to be getting sicker.

404
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,104
Whipple's causes
encephalopathic delirium.

405
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,522
The test was negative.

406
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,775
- The test could have been wrong.
- Ideas are not soda cans.

407
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,904
Recycling sucks.
Give me something new and shiny.

408
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,867
Or go retro. Take an old idea,
shine it up, and add a new symptom.

409
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,954
Encephalopathic delirium.

410
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,832
Pellagra.

411
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,043
She drinks. Alcoholics get pellagra.

412
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,629
They eat lousy diets, so no niacin.

413
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,882
- He agrees with me. What a shock.
- Well, you're right.

414
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,719
Lack of niacin starves the brain.
Neurons shut down.

415
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,722
Causes seizures, encephalopathic
delirium and psychosis.

416
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,888
We give Kara niacin,
she'll come out of her delirium

417
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,517
and she'll be totally sane.

418
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,061
Don't think she's ever
gonna be sane again.

419
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,898
Her son just died.

420
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,513
How do you feel?

421
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:04,891
Er...

422
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,063
My stomach kinda hurts.

423
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,316
I need to ask you some questions,
see how you're doing.

424
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,110
Mmm-hmm.

425
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,820
Tell me your name.

426
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,283
Kara Mason. Is my son here?

427
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,369
When were you born?

428
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,497
Please. Where's Michael? Is he OK?

429
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,791
Do you hear any other voices
besides mine?

430
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,377
No. Answer me.

431
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,879
You've been suffering from delusions.

432
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,007
They were caused by a vitamin
deficiency, pellagra.

433
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,885
It made you believe things
that were not real.

434
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,597
Like the voices.

435
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,436
I...

436
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,237
remember doing things to Mikey.

437
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,822
Were those real?

438
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,243
I'm afraid so.

439
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,041
So, I...

440
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,839
- You tried to suffocate your son.
- But...

441
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,887
You... You stopped me.

442
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,389
And...

443
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:31,102
that other doctor,
he got Mikey breathing.

444
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,896
Your son's organs were damaged
too severely.

445
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,235
He passed away this morning.

446
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:46,659
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

447
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,119
No!

448
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,876
Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God!

449
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,425
Pellagra doesn't cause
bloody vomit.

450
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,594
She's still sick and getting worse.

451
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,724
So what causes pellagra
and crimson spew?

452
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,352
Dead baby, while sad, not our problem.

453
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,480
I should have given him
more polystyrene.

454
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,691
You killed him. If you don't get
over it, you're gonna kill Mama, too.

455
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,861
Her alcoholism caused the pellagra.
Maybe it also explains the vomiting.

456
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,030
- Gastritis.
- Gastritis meds aren't helping,

457
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,449
which may confirm her story.
She only slipped once.

458
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,868
You remove drinking from the equation,

459
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,038
internal bleeding, hypercalcemia,
seizure, and pellagra are all back in.

460
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,248
Chase, will you get your head
out of the dead baby's butt

461
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,834
and focus on the barely alive?

462
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,631
How much polystyrene
did you give the kid?

463
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,424
One gram.

464
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,551
His potassium just kept rising.

465
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,820
I need your son.

466
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,908
Who are you?

467
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,496
Your wife's doctor. Your son may
have had the same condition she does.

468
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:17,833
My son didn't have a condition.
She killed him.

469
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,879
If I biopsy her intestine,
she'll bleed out.

470
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,257
He obviously won't.

471
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,927
You're not using my son's body
to help her.

472
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:33,057
OK. How about trading him for a beer?

473
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,560
Or maybe you're more of a whiskey guy.

474
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,106
You didn't have strep or a stomach bug
the morning you came in.

475
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,192
You puked because you were hung over.

476
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,946
Accuse a recovered drunk of slipping
and most of the time, you'll be right.

477
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,239
So I drink.

478
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,742
You're acting like this is my fault.

479
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,452
People are gonna feel sorry for you

480
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,122
and they'll tell you that
you can't anticipate the unthinkable.

481
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,873
The fact is, you can.

482
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,667
It's just not all that pleasant.

483
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,313
Look, you don't know anything about...

484
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,661
I know that people don't get crazy
enough to kill someone

485
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,507
without first being crazy enough
for someone to notice.

486
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,595
How many times did you go out
for a drink because she was crying?

487
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,138
How many times did you stay at work

488
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,600
because you couldn't listen to her
telling you what a bad mother she is?

489
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,894
You were relieved when she shut down

490
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,731
and just sat staring
for hours at a time.

491
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:27,069
She held the pillow over his head.
You slept while she went nuts.

492
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,364
- Not exactly a draw, but...
- What is wrong with you?

493
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,908
What kind of a person
says those things now?

494
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,037
Let me do the test.

495
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,790
It'll be one less thing
for you to feel crappy about.

496
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,470
I got a dead baby for you to biopsy.

497
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:56,307
- Let Cameron do it.
- Love working NICU?

498
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,184
- I could get you transferred.
- I told you.

499
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,144
I just wanted to trust patients.

500
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,688
You don't give a crap about patients.

501
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,735
Your paycheck.

502
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,365
You've been double-dipping.

503
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,285
Taking your vacation time here,
while drawing a salary in NICU.

504
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,955
Strange. Rich boy doing all that
for some extra cash.

505
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:27,171
- I'm not rich.
- But your dad was. Now he's dead.

506
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,174
If you're not rich,
that means that Daddy cut you out.

507
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,885
I'm not rich.

508
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,097
Don't let it change you.

509
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,142
And do the test.

510
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,581
God of compassion,
take Michael into your arms

511
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,792
and welcome him into paradise.

512
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,880
Let there be no sorrow, no weeping,
and no pain.

513
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,342
Peace and joy forevermore.

514
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,849
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,876
It was a date. Cuddy's negative
for all cancer markers.

516
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,128
It was a date.

517
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,802
The baby's intestine shows
slight villous atrophy.

518
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,810
Why would a baby have flattened villi?

519
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,521
He was being treated with polystyrene.

520
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,899
- Polystyrene shouldn't...
- It didn't.

521
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,651
The question is, what do they use
in the NICU to bind it together?

522
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,029
- Wheat gluten.
- It's great stuff.

523
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,823
Unless your body can't tolerate it.

524
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,618
The baby didn't have colic?
He had celiac disease?

525
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,703
Just like Mom.

526
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,915
Celiac can be triggered by
all kinds of stress.

527
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,751
Bills, childbirth, drunk husband...

528
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,504
Every time she had a bowl of pasta or
a slice of bread

529
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,217
or a slosh of soy sauce,
her small intestine became more damaged,

530
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,553
less able to absorb the vitamins
and minerals into her bloodstream.

531
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,640
Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin,
caused the pellagra.

532
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,850
Couldn't absorb vitamin K,
caused the bleeding.

533
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,020
And celiac is why the baby's meds
didn't work.

534
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,316
His body just couldn't absorb them.

535
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,570
Switch Mom to IV nutrition.
It's gluten-free.

536
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,405
That'll spruce her villi right up.

537
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,741
No. Celiac causes
nutritional deprivation.

538
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,952
Our patient has excess calcium.

539
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,789
Tell them what causes excess calcium
with a chaser of bloody vomit.

540
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,795
Celiac patients are susceptible
to cancer of the stomach lining.

541
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,966
- She has MALT lymphoma.
- Well, she's your patient, now.

542
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,678
And it wasn't a date.

543
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,691
- You don't have cancer.
- You don't have dwarfism.

544
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,361
You have no proof of that.
I, on the other hand, have this.

545
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,199
You ran a PCR on me without my
consent?

546
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,410
- Hey, it's good news.
- Really?

547
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,661
It's just hard to access

548
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,789
because of this overwhelming sense
of personal violation.

549
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,543
Deal with it on your own time.

550
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,337
Bad news.

551
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,047
Estrogen is too high.

552
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,008
No matter how many people
you tell otherwise,

553
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,761
I am and always have been a woman.
Estrogen is normal.

554
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:06,557
Not this much. Not for, at least,
another week.

555
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,559
That's when you ovulate.

556
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:16,942
You monitor my periods
based on when I get bitchy or...

557
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,529
Once a month, when you leave
the kids' cancer ward,

558
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,698
your eyes glisten.

559
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,992
And about three days later,
you break your ban on sugar

560
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:30,247
and chow down a bucket of frozen yogurt
in the cafeteria. Sprinkles included.

561
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,374
Based on the last yogurt sighting,

562
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,668
you've got another week
before you ovulate.

563
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,464
You're on fertility meds.

564
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,719
With red clover as an herbal booster.

565
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,432
And the dinner with Wilson
was an audition.

566
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,562
It's too bad he didn't land the gig.
He would have had fun.

567
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,815
I was considering a donation.
Not a party.

568
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:01,904
So, when's our dinner?

569
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,621
- Oh, he's gonna be so disappointed.
- Right.

570
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,832
You two are gonna have
a lot of fun with this.

571
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,210
Your patient won't let me touch her.

572
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,760
I killed my son.

573
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,102
Is it my turn
to say something obvious now?

574
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,521
Oh, I know. You were insane.

575
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,856
I did it. I chose to do it.

576
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,985
Yeah. Like diabetics choose
to not produce insulin.

577
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:47,366
Listen. Someone got sick.
Someone died.

578
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,909
It happens every day.

579
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,247
The only difference in this case is,
it wasn't the same someone.

580
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,790
I could have stopped.

581
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,877
I didn't have to listen to those voices.

582
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,672
Spoken like a true sane person.

583
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,509
This is not your fault.

584
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,970
You're healthy now.

585
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,806
Except for the cancer.

586
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,395
Those voices felt as real to me

587
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,565
as Michael's hand

588
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,526
right here, when he nursed,

589
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,070
and the smell of his hair.

590
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,246
You do not deserve to die.

591
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,833
Maybe.

592
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,216
I don't want to live.

593
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,812
She said no.

594
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,273
So we get her declared unstable,
appoint a medical proxy...

595
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,277
She was unstable. Now, she's sane.
She's entitled to refuse the treatment.

596
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,529
You have to change her mind.
You can't just walk away.

597
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,532
Fine! Go on in there and tell her
that every day is a blessing.

598
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,870
"So you killed your baby? Shake it off.
Think positive. At least you're alive."

599
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,332
Hmm.

600
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,667
Kinda hard to sell when
you don't believe it, huh?

601
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,835
And you never believed it.

602
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,588
You just wanted all that crap
you went through to mean something.

603
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,800
Well, it didn't mean anything.
It never does. Welcome back.

604
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,472
Why are you doing this to me?
I was happy.

605
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,224
You were aspiring to be content.

606
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,269
Don't give me a semantic argument.
I was content with the way things were.

607
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,771
- That's what happiness is.
- Yeah.

608
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,773
If we were all just satisfied
with what we had,

609
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,525
what a beautiful world it would be.

610
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,610
We'd all slowly starve to death
in our own filth,

611
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,737
but at least we'd be happy.

612
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,949
Listen, I need your self-worth
to hang on this job.

613
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,618
Kicking ass here to be all that
lets you rise above miserable.

614
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,746
If waking up in the morning is enough,
I don't need you.

615
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,540
I can live with that.

616
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,002
No, you can't. Not any more.

617
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,117
If you got treatment,
then maybe we could...

618
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,965
When you see Mikey...

619
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,804
tell him his dad says he's sorry.

620
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,526
Hi.

621
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,780
- Night.
- Night.

622
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,369
Did you tell Cuddy
we tested her for cancer?

623
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,079
- Yeah.
- And?

624
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,457
It wasn't a date.

625
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,502
Turned out she had some skin lesions.

626
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,880
Guess there was
no genetic predisposition.

627
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,968
You TiVo The L Word?
