1
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,714
Hannah, you okay?

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,093
- Still can't sleep?
- I'm fine.

3
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,931
Can I do anything to help you?

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,517
Just go back to sleep.
I'm going to go get a glass of wine.

5
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,728
- I can keep you company.
- You have work in the morning.

6
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,563
Are you sure you don't want me to?

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,065
I'll be right back. Just sleep.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,327
Hannah?

9
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,958
Hannah?

10
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,555
What did you do?

11
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,057
I just wanted to sleep.

12
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,185
I'm calling an ambulance.

13
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,156
You've seen one patient
in the last two hours.

14
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,367
Complicated case.

15
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,910
I'm a night owl.

16
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,080
Wilson's an early bird.
We're different species.

17
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,623
Move him into his own cage.

18
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,251
Who'll clean the droppings from mine?

19
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,713
Twenty-five-year-old female
with sleep issues.

20
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,882
I'm guessing she's...

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,219
What's the medical term? Upset!

22
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,430
These 25-year-old females,
they're usually completely rational.

23
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,432
They're rocks, really.

24
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,811
My theory seems to be
supported by the fact

25
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,813
that she swallowed
a bottle of sleeping pills.

26
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,482
Get her a shrink. I need some shut-eye.

27
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:16,487
She's a little bit more than upset.
She hasn't slept in ten days.

28
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,489
She's lying.

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,701
Without REM sleep,
your neurons start regenerating.

30
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,036
Your brain shuts down lobe by lobe.

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,290
She'd be insane after five days,
dead by ten.

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,960
Give me a little credit.
I know what gets you off.

33
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,046
She took the pills to sleep,
not to kill herself.

34
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,132
- Clever alibi.
- They didn't work.

35
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,677
She stayed awake, even though
she downed the whole bottle.

36
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,976
And the longest anyone's ever survived
without sleep is 11 days.

37
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,645
Which gives you about 22 hours.

38
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,777
- You stole my article.
- I wouldn't do that.

39
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,822
I wrote up the case where
we induced hypothermic cardiac arrest

40
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,073
in the terminal cancer girl.

41
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,742
I wrote my own. I didn't steal yours.

42
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,162
You knew I was writing one.
You gave me notes!

43
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,788
Got a case.

44
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,417
It can wait. You two finish.

45
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,170
Five bucks says someone loses an eye.

46
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,007
Fine, you're only putting off
the inevitable.

47
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,302
Twenty-five-year-old female
hasn't slept for ten days.

48
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,917
I assume the ER tried
giving her some sedatives.

49
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,430
We should up the dosage.

50
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,224
- Sedation isn't the same as sleep.
- Thanks for your insight.

51
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,102
For someone who hasn't slept
in ten days, sedation is a great start.

52
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,897
Sleep is an active process.
Reboots the system, restores the brain.

53
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,149
- Sedatives don't...
- The brain is being stressed.

54
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,275
We need to relieve that.

55
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,819
You've had my article on your desk
for the last four months.

56
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,029
I'm a very slow reader.

57
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,157
No fever, no white count,
means no infection.

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,617
Schizophrenia?

59
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,620
- No delusions.
- You read his.

60
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,580
Signed it. Didn't read it.

61
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,084
Aside from the sleeping pills,
tox screen was clean.

62
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,836
No cocaine, methamphetamines
or diet pills.

63
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,838
The only medication she's had recently

64
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,175
are steroids for poison ivy and
ibuprofen for a knee she hurt skiing.

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,177
Nothing that would cause
sleep disturbances.

66
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,597
- When did you get his article?
- About three weeks ago.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,143
- Let's go back to the beginning.
- How far back?

68
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,895
Genesis.

69
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,190
God said, "Let there be light."

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,527
Sleep is initially controlled
by external light cues.

71
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,946
And if her brain can't interpret
those cues...

72
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,781
Optic nerve disease.

73
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,243
I'm sensing another article.

74
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,245
I'll go run the tests.

75
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,959
I'm injecting a dye which will
allow us to take a look at your retina

76
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,003
and your optic nerve.

77
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,839
- Everything's kind of blurry.
- Normal, because of the dye.

78
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,341
It's going to be that way
the next few hours.

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,516
- Need a hand?
- No.

80
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,686
Are we never going
to work together again?

81
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,148
I just don't see the need to make you
feel better by forgiving you.

82
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,109
I wasn't asking for forgiveness.
I was asking if you needed help.

83
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,956
It's unprofessional to be talking
about this in front of the patient.

84
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,281
Maybe that doesn't matter to you, but...

85
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,117
It doesn't matter.
She's not listening.

86
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,911
She's asleep.

87
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,289
Normal stage-one brain waves.

88
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,459
Maybe she's better?

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,963
Still blurry.

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,091
- You fell asleep.
- No, I didn't.

91
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,387
Negative
for optic nerve disease.

92
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,805
But she sleeps.

93
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,059
For, like, ten seconds.
Maximum one minute.

94
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,187
We also checked the ocular pressure.
It's normal.

95
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,272
And she doesn't know she sleeps.

96
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,816
The brain is often unaware
of stage one sleep.

97
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:45,071
The CT showed no tumors,
no clots, no seizure disorder.

98
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,616
So she sleeps.
She just can't stay asleep.

99
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,410
You going somewhere with this?

100
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,621
You know what keeps me awake at
night?

101
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,539
Monsters in the closet.

102
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,833
There's no monster in the closet.
We looked.

103
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,170
Well, it's certainly not showing up
on the scans.

104
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,838
Where's Cameron?

105
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,717
She felt I could deliver the news
on my own.

106
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,347
Oh, this is going to work out great.

107
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,683
Come on.

108
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,190
If you two guys can't play nice
together, I'm taking away your toys.

109
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,692
- I don't care whose fault this is.
- If you hadn't...

110
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,195
I especially don't care
if it was my fault.

111
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,907
Whatever this woman has,
it's not showing up on our tests.

112
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,828
Which means she's sick,
just not sick enough for us to see it.

113
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,455
- You want us to make her sicker?
- Yes.

114
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,292
I want to stress her body.
Specifically her brain.

115
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,919
Keep her awake.

116
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,339
Depriving her of even the few minutes
of sleep she does have, it's torture.

117
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,299
So is cutting people with knives,

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,927
but you can totally get away with that
if you have a doctor coat on.

119
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,853
Those few seconds of sleep are maybe
the only reason she's still alive.

120
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,432
The more symptoms we can force out
of her, the more tests we can do.

121
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,519
The more tests we do,
the more information we get,

122
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,895
the quicker we make a diagnosis.

123
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,731
See how much more fun it is
when you guys get along?

124
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,401
You two take the first four hours.

125
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,117
Hannah?

126
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,704
Hannah!

127
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,541
You fell asleep.

128
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,209
No, I didn't.

129
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,712
Your brain doesn't remember.
It was just a few seconds.

130
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,172
Is this really necessary?

131
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,426
The sooner we find out what's wrong, the
sooner she can get a real night's rest.

132
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,344
Hannah?

133
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,805
Hannah? Hannah.

134
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,226
Ow.

135
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,605
- What did you do that for?
- You fell asleep again.

136
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,356
- No, I didn't.
- We're sorry.

137
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,525
We have to do this.

138
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,736
We don't have to be cruel.

139
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,488
You know what happens when you're nice?
Nothing.

140
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,241
That's how you define nice?
Not stealing?

141
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,076
Doctors!

142
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,412
Did she fall asleep again?

143
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,681
- We've got rectal bleeding.
- What, all of you?

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,895
So the monster is peeking out
from under the bed.

145
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,147
Which either means
she has a clotting disorder

146
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,857
or she has a tumor in her colon.

147
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,569
- I'll do a colonoscopy.
- Who's keeping her awake now?

148
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,280
I figured once we found another
symptom, it really didn't matter.

149
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,450
- Yeah, he's got all the ideas.
- Who is with her?

150
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,286
Her partner's donating blood,
so she's with a nurse.

151
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,456
Probably singing her lullabies.
I want her awake.

152
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,750
You have to sedate a patient
to do a colonoscopy.

153
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,044
Why? Just because of the pain?

154
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,589
If you find a tumor in her colon,
you can knock her out.

155
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,050
If you don't, she stays awake.

156
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,889
Oh! God, it hurts!

157
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,434
- Can't you hurry?
- Trust me, you don't want me to hurry.

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,020
God, you're killing me!

159
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,480
Hold my hand.

160
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,401
Keep breathing, nice and steady.

161
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,488
How am I supposed to work with him?

162
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,742
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this
right now?

163
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,744
Think I'm overreacting?

164
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,540
I need you to relax your anus.

165
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,919
We're not here. We're skiing.

166
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,880
It's Thanksgiving at Vail.

167
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,925
You want me to think about nearly
killing myself on a snowboard?

168
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,303
Come on, you never fell.

169
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,639
You were awesome.

170
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,687
Is that what you told him? I'm
hysterical and I need to relax my anus?

171
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,733
I told him... How many cases
do we work up in a year?

172
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,444
They're all weird. He could have
written up any one of them.

173
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,238
She's bleeding.

174
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,033
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

175
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,451
Hold on.

176
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,210
We packed her nose to control the bleed

177
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,421
and started transfusing
two units of whole blood.

178
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,008
The pathology from the rectal bleed
showed traces of nasal epithelium.

179
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,093
So the butt bleed's just a nose bleed.

180
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,637
That much blood
is not a "just a" anything.

181
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,433
When two people fight this much,
you know what it means.

182
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,393
It's gotta be a massive sinus hemorrhage

183
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,519
that was draining down her throat
and out the back.

184
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,398
- The question isn't what, it's why.
- Oh, get a room.

185
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,567
Rat poison mixed with
some sort of neurogenic toxin

186
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,486
could cause bleeding
and sleep disturbances.

187
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,813
Do you have a specific type
of neurogenic toxin in mind,

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,466
or should we just start running
a thousand different tox screens?

189
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,409
Just pretend I'm not here.
I'll be reading.

190
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,215
It could also be
some type of coagulopathy.

191
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,580
Or it could be us.
Do you have any idea what it feels like

192
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,416
to have a six-foot-long hose
shoved into your large intestine?

193
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,920
No, but I now have a much greater
respect for whichever basketball player

194
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,380
you dated in college.

195
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,550
We've basically been torturing
this girl for the last eight hours.

196
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,636
We've been poking her foot,
not punching her face.

197
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,638
Extreme stress can cause
high blood pressure,

198
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,432
- which can cause bleeding.
- Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.

199
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,186
What if the poison ivy
wasn't poison ivy?

200
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,565
She got the rash
that was diagnosed as poison ivy

201
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,692
around the same time
the insomnia started.

202
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,529
Rash plus nose bleed
plus sleep disturbance

203
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,031
equals Wegener's granulomatosis.

204
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,825
Start corticosteroid treatment.

205
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,036
- The poison ivy treatment was steroids.
- Much lower dosage.

206
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,497
Get her back on the juice
and triple the dose.

207
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:32,626
Get a cANCA and an upper airway biopsy
to confirm the Wegener's.

208
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,516
She has menstrual problems.

209
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,477
They're really bad.
The pain keeps her in bed all day.

210
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,771
Plus, she's super depressed.

211
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,571
She said, "Super depressed"?

212
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,409
She heard that birth control pills
can make her feel better.

213
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,579
She wants birth control pills
for her PMS.

214
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,955
I guess.

215
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,543
Judging by the redness
around your mom's nostrils

216
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,212
and the tissue she's got
conveniently stashed in her wristband,

217
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,300
I'd say her problem
is more likely a URI than a PMS.

218
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,718
A URI?

219
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,846
Upper respiratory infection. A cold.

220
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,556
I don't think so.

221
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,641
I also think she's got a problem
with a SAC.

222
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,893
SAC?

223
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,146
Thanks for playing.
Stupid American Child.

224
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,191
If you want the pill, all you have to do

225
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,153
is to walk into any health clinic
in Jersey, alone, and ask for it.

226
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,947
What exactly was your plan?

227
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,074
You're going to exchange
the birth control pills

228
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,035
for some over-the-counter
decongestants

229
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,621
and hope that your mom's cold
lasts another six years?

230
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,788
No.

231
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,170
- Is that for a cold?
- No, that's for your ovaries.

232
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,632
I assume you haven't had a stroke.
Have you ever had a blood clot?

233
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,092
- No.
- Super.

234
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,554
In three months when you need a refill,
take a bus to a free clinic.

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,349
Don't wait around hoping for Mom
to get another sniffle.

236
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,895
Not the sharpest chopstick
in the drawer, is she?

237
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,607
Was this just one of your experiments?

238
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:22,110
You just wanted to see how I'd react
to being screwed over by Foreman?

239
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,074
Nice idea, but no. This was just
good old-fashioned laziness.

240
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,118
I gotta hand it to Foreman, though.

241
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,913
He knew that you were a suck-up
and I don't give a crap.

242
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,998
He successfully exploited us both.

243
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,502
Right, we're both victims.
A simple heads up, that's all I needed.

244
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,754
Maybe between
your incredibly witty remarks

245
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,882
about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts,
you could have tipped me off.

246
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,260
Yeah, but then I'd have Foreman
pissed at me.

247
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,053
And as annoying as you could be,

248
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,348
at least I know
you're not gonna pop a cap in my ass.

249
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,933
Witty, huh?

250
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,898
You, on the other hand,
continue to be flabbergasted

251
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,694
every time someone actually acts
like a human being.

252
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,905
Foreman did what he did because
it worked out best that way for him.

253
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,699
That's what everyone does.

254
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,076
That is not the definition
of being human.

255
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,870
It's the definition of being an ass.

256
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,669
This will numb you up.

257
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,258
And this will keep your tongue
out of the way.

258
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,596
Don't worry. You shouldn't feel anything
except for a slight pulling.

259
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,472
So, do you think I was out of line?

260
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,059
That article would have sat on House's
desk for the next six years.

261
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,312
I could've told her.

262
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,607
You could have written it for her, too.
She knows House as well as any of us.

263
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,650
She should've known
she was waiting for him

264
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,028
to do something he was never gonna do.

265
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,199
Chase?

266
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,245
Hannah? You still with us?

267
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,081
- What's wrong with her eyes?
- It looks like REM.

268
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,791
- What's that?
- Rapid Eye Movements.

269
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,637
It's what your eyes do
when you're sleeping.

270
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,587
- But she's awake.
- Hannah!

271
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,423
Hannah, can you hear me?

272
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,884
Yeah, of course.

273
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,929
- Was she sitting up or lying down?
- Sitting up.

274
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,139
Then it wasn't REM.

275
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,145
Chase says her eyes were moving
the exact way...

276
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,476
You start her on the steroids?

277
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,002
- Not yet. We were still doing...
- Then she wasn't sleeping.

278
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,856
- How do you know?
- Because we haven't done anything yet.

279
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,862
She may be able to sleep with her
eyes open, but unless you also discover

280
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,111
she's got two extra teats
and hooves for feet,

281
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,677
there's no way she'd be able to maintain
enough muscle tensity

282
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,532
during REM sleep to sit upright.

283
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,578
It's a movement disorder,
which rules out Wegener's.

284
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,954
Where's Foreman?

285
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,873
- Keeping her awake.
- Good.

286
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,251
Rabies could cause muscle spasms,
malaise, anxiety and wakefulness.

287
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,778
Pretty unlikely she'd forget
being bitten by a crazed animal.

288
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,760
She could've been exposed
through an open wound.

289
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,508
- Does she have a dog?
- For less than a week.

290
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,915
She had an allergic reaction,
so they had to give it away.

291
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,928
Allergies.

292
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,430
Animal allergies seems unlikely,
but it's possible that...

293
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,557
- When?
- When what?

294
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,060
- When did she get rid of the dog?
- About a month ago.

295
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,063
Her girlfriend gave it to her
for her birthday.

296
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,565
Well, then, it's not allergies.

297
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,693
She's just leaving her girlfriend.

298
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,406
You... spoke to the dog?

299
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,116
If her birthday was a month ago,

300
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,535
she would have still been on steroids
for the poison ivy.

301
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,537
Those meds would have suppressed
any reaction

302
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,863
she might have had to the dog,

303
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,582
which means she lied about being
allergic. A dog's a commitment.

304
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,589
You pretend to be allergic because
you don't want to tell your girlfriend

305
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,838
that you're not planning
on being around that long.

306
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,549
So, I think we can move on
to options other than allergies.

307
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,342
We should still do
a scratch test.

308
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,971
- If she's allergic to one thing...
- She is not allergic.

309
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,932
Okay. Well, we could either base
our diagnosis

310
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,601
on your admittedly keen understanding
of lesbian relationships,

311
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,062
or we could do a scratch test.

312
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,109
Do a scratch test.

313
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,113
Are you still feeling
a lot of blood in your throat?

314
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,993
No, it's actually getting
a little better.

315
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,163
Good, maybe things are just starting
to improve on their own.

316
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,789
Just a few more.

317
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,126
- Want some water to wash your mouth?
- No, I'm okay.

318
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,795
Come on, that can't taste good.
I'm gonna get you a soda.

319
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,630
It's okay, isn't it?

320
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,555
You and Max seem to have a
really nice relationship.

321
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,932
- Yeah.
- She's very supportive.

322
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
When Max got you the dog,

323
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,858
did you lie about having
an allergic reaction?

324
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,444
No.

325
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,656
- Why?
- If you have preexisting conditions,

326
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,577
it's important we know, but
if you don't, it's just as important.

327
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,246
If I'm wasting my time doing this...

328
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,415
You're not going to tell her, are you?

329
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,627
It's none of my business.

330
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,756
She's a good person, and we've just
been together so long, I...

331
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,261
I'm tired of her.

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,810
It sounds terrible, doesn't it?

333
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,939
I guess it happens sometimes.

334
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,733
My back hurts.

335
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,699
Hannah, can you turn over?

336
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,661
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,459
Oh, my God.

338
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,557
- She has massive internal bleeding.
- Did she have access to aspirin?

339
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,074
She'd have to take a hell of a lot.

340
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,386
Why not?
Considering her current mental state.

341
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,805
What about her mental state?

342
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,474
You were right about her
wanting to break up.

343
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,852
That just means I was right.
Doesn't mean she's suicidal.

344
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,378
A bottle of pills is what
landed her here in the first place.

345
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,691
Sleeping pills.
God knows why she'd want them.

346
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,070
What else could cause sleep disorder
and internal bleeding?

347
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,824
Drugs or alcohol could mess with
the sleeping and compromise the liver.

348
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,243
What are you doing here?
Who's keeping her awake?

349
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,788
Doesn't matter. Liver function tests
are through the sky.

350
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,749
Liver's not compromised. It's dead.

351
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,711
She doesn't need a diagnosis.
She needs a new liver.

352
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,920
She's not getting a new liver unless
we can figure out what's wrong with her.

353
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,259
Test for cirrhosis, 12 hours.
Test for hepatitis, eight.

354
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,011
Her liver's not gonna last another six.

355
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,513
So your advice is we just give up?

356
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,683
My advice is that we narrow our focus
to conditions that we can diagnose,

357
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,019
treat and cure in less than six hours.

358
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,314
And there's nothing on that list.

359
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,068
The girlfriend donated blood, right?

360
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,820
Yeah, so?

361
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,864
It means they're the same type.

362
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,869
You can't ask the person she's about
to dump to donate half her liver.

363
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,163
It does seem tacky, doesn't it?

364
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,049
I'm Dr House.

365
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,426
I'm in charge of your case.

366
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,470
What's going on?

367
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,556
How come no one
is keeping her awake anymore?

368
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,725
You're in acute liver failure.

369
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,188
We can continue the transfusions
and the lactulose,

370
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,148
but it's only a stopgap.

371
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,233
There's really nothing we can do
to stop the toxins

372
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,029
from building up in your bloodstream,

373
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,324
which means that, in a few hours,

374
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,451
you will lapse into a coma...

375
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,080
and you won't wake up.

376
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,170
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,049
That's it? You're giving up?

378
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,719
You're not going to try to figure out
what's doing this to her?

379
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,596
Well, even with the right diagnosis,

380
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,122
any treatment's gonna take longer
than the time she has left.

381
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,435
If it's her liver,
can't she get a transplant?

382
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,813
Wouldn't work without a diagnosis.

383
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,191
Whatever killed the first liver
would do the same to the second.

384
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,238
But it would give you more time
to make the diagnosis to get her better.

385
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,411
Well, it might give us
an extra day or two,

386
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,372
but no procurement agency
is gonna let a liver go to a patient

387
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,290
with an undiagnosed, preexisting...

388
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,793
Hannah and I have the same blood type.

389
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,878
Couldn't I be the donor?

390
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,848
Well, it is medically possible
for us to take a part of your...

391
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,726
Please, I don't care about the risks.

392
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,031
You're very lucky
to have such a devoted partner.

393
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,465
I just bought us 36 hours.

394
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,135
Differential diagnosis.
Which monster eats your liver,

395
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,054
screws up your sleep
and causes bleeding?

396
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,764
Does Max know Hannah plans to leave
her?

397
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,640
Didn't come up, so I guess no.

398
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,928
If she knew, there's no way
she'd go through with this.

399
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,853
And if you didn't have
a pathological need

400
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,939
to create a close, personal relationship
with every dying person you meet,

401
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,317
we would be blissfully ignorant
of any ethical dilemmas

402
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,944
and might actually be able to
concentrate on the differential.

403
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,362
The scratch test was negative.

404
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,409
It's rare, but any of the hepatitis
viruses could cause sleep disturbances

405
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,253
- and liver failure.
- No, PCRs were normal.

406
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,705
- We have an ethical dilemma.
- No, we don't. Continue.

407
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,000
What about splenic cancer
or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?

408
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
She's the right age.

409
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,962
It could explain the bleeding,
maybe the liver failure.

410
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,674
We're withholding information relevant
to her decision to risk her life.

411
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,928
- How is that not an ethical dilemma?
- It's not medical information.

412
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,930
- Who cares?
- The AMA.

413
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,308
Wilson's disease could explain the
liver and neurological symptoms.

414
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,851
It also causes bleeding disorders.

415
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,812
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.

416
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,378
Rings don't have to be there
if there's neurological symptoms.

417
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,942
- This is immoral.
- Look, let's say you're right!

418
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,821
We tell, she changes her mind,
our patient dies. How is that moral?

419
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,156
What else?

420
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,158
Poisoned mushrooms
can cause liver failure,

421
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,993
sleep disturbances
and internal bleeding.

422
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,496
She's not shrooming. She's a sports nut.

423
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,623
Right, skiers never party.

424
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,042
She's doing this out of love,
and Max doesn't know...

425
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,420
It's only moral to save a person
if they love you?

426
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,132
That's kind of a selfish way
of looking at life.

427
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,051
I like Wilson's disease,
like cancer, love mushrooms.

428
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,387
Yeah, but we don't have the time
to test for any of it.

429
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:36,015
Before she can get the transplant,
we need to do about 80 procedures.

430
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,434
So, do those tests
and my tests at the same time.

431
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,645
Use the PET to look for cancer
and Wilson's.

432
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,940
While you endoscope her bile ducts,
scrape her stomach for mushroom spores.

433
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,567
One of you CT her liver,

434
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:49,821
while the other two
check protein CA-125 and CA-19.5.

435
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,867
Oh, yeah, anyone says anything to Max,
they're fired.

436
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,369
We have to.

437
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,789
We have to not,
because she's not our patient.

438
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,084
She's getting surgery.
She's someone's patient.

439
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,339
I think that's it. Great, thank you.

440
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,883
I need a little help.

441
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,428
Inexplicable rash on a patient's scrotum
you need me to look at?

442
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,097
Twenty-seven-year-old female
wants to donate half her liver

443
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,225
- to her dying girlfriend.
- That's very generous.

444
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,061
This the sleepless girl? What's she got?

445
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,396
Liver failure.

446
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,691
Sort of figured that out when you said
she needed a new liver.

447
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,906
- You don't have a diagnosis?
- The transplant buys me time.

448
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,158
Let's just skip the part
where I say this is insane.

449
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,451
It was her idea.

450
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,287
If she wants to be an idiot,
it's her call. You don't need me.

451
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,623
Have one of your team
walk her through the process.

452
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,876
The donor and the donee
sort of have opposing interests, right?

453
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,878
We can't really advise them both.

454
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,881
You're concerned
about the ethics of this?

455
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,382
What's going on?

456
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,135
- What do you know?
- Nothing medically relevant.

457
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,721
But you know something,
and it is relevant.

458
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,141
If I can't tell her,
I can't really tell you, can I?

459
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,227
I mean, if you're advising her.

460
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,563
I assume this information
is in the medical file.

461
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,234
- In my patient's confidential file.
- This hospital's file.

462
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,615
You can either satisfy your curiosity,
or you can remain ignorant,

463
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:20,078
do nothing ethically wrong, and
my patient doesn't die in three hours.

464
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,338
These tests and the counseling

465
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:34,217
normally happen over weeks,
sometimes months.

466
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,386
It's okay.

467
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,181
Well, the most important part
we're skipping is time.

468
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,892
Time for you to change your mind.

469
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,144
I don't wanna change my mind.

470
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:50,650
Not now, but, with time and perspective,
maybe we learn things...

471
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,944
If we had the time, we'd take the time,
but we don't.

472
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,113
So can you get this over with?

473
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,286
Either I sign off on this,
or it doesn't happen.

474
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,497
So I need you to listen to me,

475
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,459
because there's a chance
that you will die on that table.

476
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,763
I just want me and Hannah
to be able to lie in bed together

477
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,516
as old ladies,

478
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,351
compare scars.

479
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,196
I need you to lie on your side
and hold your knees.

480
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,786
I'm going to check
for vascular abnormalities

481
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,289
that might prevent us
from doing the transplant.

482
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,750
At the same time,
I'm also checking for mushroom spores

483
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,236
- to see if that's the underlying...
- I don't do mushrooms.

484
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,505
If you lie about your love life,
maybe you lie about drugs. Open.

485
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,137
Aren't you at all concerned about
what Max is going through right now?

486
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,014
They're shoving a tube up her rectum,

487
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,460
then they're going to swab her stomach
just like I'm doing.

488
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,894
It's going to hurt just like this hurts.

489
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,398
Which is nothing at all like the risk
she's taking on the table.

490
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,695
And you don't love her, do you?

491
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,447
I'm not leaving her because I don't...

492
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,950
I'm not talking about the leaving.
I'm talking about this.

493
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,995
If you care for her at all,
you won't let her do this blind.

494
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,543
- You'd really tell?
- Yeah.

495
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,172
You'd die?

496
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,642
I take it you've seen that.

497
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:54,607
Seen it, digested it, watched it
blow up my entire department.

498
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,652
- Did you read Cameron's version?
- I didn't read either.

499
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,112
It was good.

500
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,073
- Better than Foreman's?
- Maybe.

501
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,952
He was more analytical
about the diagnostic procedures.

502
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,288
She concentrated more on the
ethical dilemmas of informed consent.

503
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,935
How any patient can really be informed
without a medical degree.

504
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,876
Same old party lines.

505
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,506
- Foreman should have told her.
- Oh, shoulda, woulda, coulda.

506
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,632
If you allow this sort of thing
in your department,

507
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,260
you're basically saying it's okay.

508
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,720
No, I'm saying that I don't care
what they do

509
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:28,266
as long as my life isn't interrupted by
pointless conversations like this one.

510
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,852
They won't trust each other,
and they won't trust you.

511
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,520
They shouldn't.

512
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,106
Deception like this
is just one step removed

513
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,359
from actively sabotaging one another.

514
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,735
Then what would you do?

515
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:43,239
I could be the kindest,
gentlest boss in the world,

516
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,409
and Foreman would still have done
what he did, because that's who he is.

517
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,121
We can only hope that Cameron
has learned something.

518
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,583
Right,
because you're all about the teaching.

519
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,627
Our children are the future.

520
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,010
Hey.

521
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,512
Cuddy cleared Max for surgery.
She's okay to go.

522
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,764
- How's our patient?
- She's also cleared.

523
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,976
I don't care about the prep.
I care about the diagnostic tests.

524
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,783
Looks negative for Wilson's disease.
We'll know for sure in an hour.

525
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,133
- Blood proteins are normal. It's not...
- Where's Cameron?

526
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,983
Taking a sample of the bile duct.

527
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,111
Surgeries are supposed to start
in about 15 minutes.

528
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,637
She had a chance to get one last...

529
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,216
Hannah and Max will be in the same
room.

530
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,200
You wanted us to do
as much as we can before...

531
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,744
They're both awake with Cameron.

532
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,128
Maybe we should give these two
a minute together before the surgery.

533
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,047
You ready, honey?

534
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,178
- Max.
- It's okay, I'm right here.

535
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,057
- I need you to know something.
- I know.

536
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,684
I love you, too.

537
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,396
- I don't know how to say this.
- Good Lord!

538
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,317
- You can tell me anything.
- She hasn't slept in 11 days!

539
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,778
You people trying to torture her?

540
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,076
Ding, ding, let's go.

541
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,291
- I told you...
- I didn't say a word to Max.

542
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,877
This is exactly why you got screwed
with Foreman.

543
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,129
You're looking for people
to do the right thing.

544
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,048
She hasn't slept.
Her judgment is compromised

545
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,008
due to inactivity
in her prefrontal cortex.

546
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,929
Oh, she could have the best prefrontal
cortex in the history of mankind,

547
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,695
but given the choice
of life versus death,

548
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,850
those bad, bad people
are going to choose life.

549
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,895
Then why'd you sedate her?
If she wasn't going to tell,

550
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,274
if she was never going to do the right
thing, why bother knocking her out?

551
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,987
This isn't about them. If she talks,
if she does the decent thing,

552
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:49,323
then you don't get to solve your puzzle,
your game's over, you lose.

553
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,368
Yeah, I wanna save her.
I'm morally bankrupt.

554
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,975
How's it going?

555
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,185
They're about to remove Hannah's liver.

556
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,276
All right, I'm good to go.

557
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,820
You can start removing Max's liver.

558
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,533
You wanna let me in on what
the big secret is between these two?

559
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,577
You read Foreman's article?

560
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,913
It was good.

561
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,751
He basically stole it from me.

562
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,255
- So?
- You're on his side?

563
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,883
Sides? No, this isn't dodgeball.

564
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,720
What am I supposed to do,
just sit back and take it?

565
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,555
No, write another article.

566
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,350
Kick ass until you're sitting behind
some big, expensive desk,

567
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,102
and someone from Johns Hopkins calls
and says,

568
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,106
"We're thinking about hiring
Eric Foreman as our head of Neurology."

569
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,776
And you can say whatever you want.

570
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:11,072
Lovely. Revenge as motive for success.

571
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,742
Well, it doesn't have to be the motive,
but it sure tastes good.

572
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,829
- She's in VF. I've got no pulse.
- She's arresting.

573
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,169
I am so relieved
you two are here.

574
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,775
Without you looking out,
they'd be playing foosball down there.

575
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,966
- Max's heart stopped.
- Your patient is on the other side.

576
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,552
Now get yourself upstairs
and figure out what Hannah has,

577
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,305
or Max has risked her life for nothing.

578
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,810
Charging.

579
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,396
Clear.

580
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,568
We're okay.

581
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:59,537
Max's cardiac arrest was caused
by hypoxia from hypoventilation.

582
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,955
They restarted her heart,

583
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,834
and the right lobe of her liver was
successfully transplanted into Hannah.

584
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,794
Now, where were we

585
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,672
before we were so rudely interrupted
by the liver transplant?

586
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,882
Dopa decarboxylase
was processed normally,

587
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,135
and the ceruloplasmin
and copper levels were normal.

588
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,344
So, no Wilson's disease.

589
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,514
Gastric content was negative for spores,
so no mushroom toxicity.

590
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,891
And initial tests
were negative for cancer.

591
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,017
- Which cancer were you looking for?
- Any of them.

592
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,396
We ran blood tests
for ovarian, lung and lymphomas.

593
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,605
Not gonna tell you much.

594
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,233
Her blood was taken after she
was given immunosuppressants.

595
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,110
They fight rejection.

596
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,946
They also mess up our ability
to get any clear readings.

597
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,242
Great battles kick up a lot of dirt.

598
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:43,247
Obscure the battlefield
so generals can't see what's going on.

599
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:47,042
So, what are your orders, General
House?

600
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,588
Sound the retreat.

601
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,634
How you feeling?

602
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,927
Is Max okay?

603
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,764
She's still unconscious,
but her vitals look good.

604
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,018
We need to stop
all the immunosuppressant drugs

605
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,270
which are protecting your new liver.

606
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,317
But if you stop the drugs, I'll die.

607
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,570
You're dead anyway if we don't
figure out what caused all this.

608
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,115
By removing any outside influences,

609
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,618
it'll help us see
what's really going on with your body.

610
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,787
So you did all this
to buy me a couple of days,

611
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,039
and now you're taking one back?

612
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,795
Will it hurt?

613
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,507
As your body goes into
acute organ rejection,

614
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:38,052
your liver will begin to swell,
and that'll put pressure on...

615
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,097
Yeah, it'll hurt.

616
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,974
But we can knock you out.

617
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,312
No, if Max wakes up,
I want to talk to her.

618
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,864
She's been taking the decongestants,
but she's not getting better.

619
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,909
- She also says...
- What?

620
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,246
Her boobs are bigger.

621
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,673
How could you get them mixed up?

622
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,009
They come in a little wheel. They
don't look anything like decongestants.

623
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,178
Oh, God. The cashier
put them both in the same bag.

624
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,264
I thought I gave her the right ones.

625
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,191
No, you gave her the wrong pills.

626
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,027
You speak Mandarin?

627
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,073
I can count to ten,
ask to go to the bathroom and...

628
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,372
I'm not pregnant.
We haven't even done it yet!

629
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,128
Okay,
I'm going to leave you two alone now.

630
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,422
I'm sure you got a lot to talk about.

631
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,015
Fever is 106.
She's in full rejection mode.

632
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,975
Is that supposed to surprise me?

633
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,019
Her white count is normal.

634
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,273
Normal is not normal.
She's been on steroids.

635
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,026
The transplant team gave her
a cocktail of immunosuppressants.

636
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,154
She hasn't slept in over a week.
Her white count should be in the tank.

637
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,239
Looks like the problem
is some sort of infection.

638
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,867
Probably caused
the hypotension, shocked the liver.

639
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,119
We should start
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

640
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,538
Yeah, you might want to add
some chicken soup.

641
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,416
It'd be just as useless,
but it's got chicken.

642
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,169
We need to know exactly what kind
of infection we're dealing with.

643
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,339
What infection causes sleep disturbance,
bleeding, a movement disorder,

644
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,883
organ failure
and an abnormally normal white count.

645
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,760
- What about tularemia?
- Chest was clear.

646
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,678
Tularemia doesn't cause
movement disorders.

647
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,724
- It would if she developed meningitis.
- There was no ulcerations on the skin.

648
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,143
With the bleeding,
it looks more like leptospirosis.

649
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,437
Without conjunctivitis
and elevated creatinine?

650
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,648
What about typhoid
or some kind of relapsing fever?

651
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,254
Makes sense, if we were in the Sudan.

652
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,239
Are you sure she hasn't
been out of the country?

653
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,071
She hasn't even been out of the state
in at least a year. Neither has Max.

654
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,948
Maybe she lied.

655
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,159
- You talk to her friends, neighbors?
- You don't know?

656
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,286
Come on, if you don't stay
up-to-date on my notes,

657
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,664
where's your next article
gonna come from?

658
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,415
Talked to the dog?

659
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,001
We're not as up on foreign languages
as you are.

660
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,922
- Has the dog been traveling?
- It came from a breeder.

661
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,758
- Where?
- I don't know.

662
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,928
Place called Blue Barrel Kennels.

663
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,846
They only had the thing
for, like, two days.

664
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,933
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus.

665
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,352
You see many cacti in Jersey?

666
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,196
Wanna see a magic trick?

667
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,913
Oh, no. Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

668
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,289
Is it here?

669
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,043
No. What about here?

670
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,880
There it is.

671
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,176
Oh, that doesn't look anything
like a nose.

672
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,263
That wasn't there this morning.

673
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,906
- Get that to the lab and call the CDC.
- Tell them what?

674
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,951
That we have a patient with the plague.

675
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:36,331
- The black plague?
- Looks that way.

676
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,292
Plague is carried by rodents, not dogs.

677
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,046
Where there's dogs, there's fleas.
If they hail from the Southwest,

678
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,089
then those fleas
can't tell the difference

679
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,800
between prairie dogs and puppy dogs.

680
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,971
A small percentage of plague cases
present with sleep disturbance.

681
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,684
Imagine an idyllic river of bacteria.

682
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,646
Okay, it's not idyllic for her,
but it serves my purposes.

683
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,356
The steroids and immunosuppressants

684
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:04,777
acted like a big honking dam
across the river. Physics 101.

685
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,863
Put a dam up in front of a raging river,
the river rises.

686
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,657
By stopping the immunosuppressants,
we blew up the dam,

687
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,911
and a 100-foot wall of bacteria
flooded her lymph nodes.

688
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,996
We better find out
where that dog is now.

689
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,123
After you restart
the immunosuppressants,

690
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,958
and fill her up to the eyeballs

691
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,711
with streptomycin sulfate,
gentamicin and tetracycline.

692
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,463
Use a garden hose if we've got one.

693
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,633
Get yourselves
some prophylactic treatments as well.

694
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,095
I've got the plague?

695
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,723
Don't worry, it's treatable.

696
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,769
Being a bitch, though,
nothing we can do about that.

697
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,695
You weren't in your room.

698
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,907
The surgeon said I'd heal faster
if I walk.

699
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,076
I got this far, needed a rest.

700
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,913
What you did was crazy,
but it was pretty amazing, too.

701
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,415
Yeah. I'm a hero.

702
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,088
She's been planning to leave me.

703
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,968
Really?

704
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,096
She told a friend.
The friend let it slip.

705
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,227
You knew, and you gave up
half your liver anyway?

706
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,190
She can't leave me now.

707
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,655
You really want her to stay
out of guilt?

708
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,032
That's not gonna make
either of you happy.

709
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,118
You don't know that.

710
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,703
I love her.

711
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,332
I just want her to stay.

712
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,602
I don't own House's cases.

713
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,231
You had just as much right as I did
to write it up.

714
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,360
You should have told me, but
I should have handled it better, too.

715
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:16,033
If we want this not to get in the way
of our friendship,

716
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,662
I think we both have to apologize
and put it behind us.

717
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,084
I like you, really.

718
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,879
We have a good time working together.

719
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,048
But 10 years from now,

720
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,218
we're not gonna be hanging out
and having dinners.

721
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,762
Maybe we'll exchange Christmas cards,
say hi,

722
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,806
give a hug if we're at
the same conference.

723
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,978
We're not friends. We're colleagues.

724
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,901
And I don't have anything
to apologize for.
