1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,089
As the riders begin Lap Two, Jeff
Forster is leading the pack.

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,655
Theyre jockeying
for position, now...

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,053
This is so cool.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,346
Did we miss anything?

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,473
They've got, like,
11 laps to go.

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,612
We gotta find a good place where we
can see the sign when he goes by.

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,602
Wait up, kids!

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,232
There is a strong chase pack
forming led by Vernonski...

9
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,777
At this point in the race, things
are still too close to call.

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,071
It's anybody's race,
but Forster looks...

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,825
Turn six. Come on.

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,914
Mike Larson has made
a nice break from the pack

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,375
and has closed the gap
on Forster and the lead group.

14
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,051
That's it. Up there.

15
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,637
Can you see anything?

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,307
Did you bring his inhaler?

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,517
Crap!

18
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,478
I think it's in the car.
I'll go get it.

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,446
Are you okay? Your dad's
gonna be right back...

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,933
I can see him.
He's right up front.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,198
Honey, you're wheezing.

22
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,909
Here they come. Go, Jeff! Yeah!

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,661
You're number one!

24
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,496
He doesn't look so good.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
Forster is down.

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,764
Yeah!

27
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,766
We need to talk.

28
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,687
Oh, God. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I
really wanna finish high school.

29
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,106
You have to renew
your credential.

30
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,733
They're good
for two more months.

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,693
Three weeks. And the
paperwork takes forever.

32
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,905
Your application,
your malpractice insurance,

33
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,792
criminal records check and you know
that's gonna take some explaining.

34
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,328
You know, our relationship was way
better when we were sleeping together.

35
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,163
Why did we stop doing that?
Did you get married?

36
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,208
Yeah. Otherwise I'd be on you
like red on rice.

37
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,086
Look, rice isn't...
Oh, I get it.

38
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,921
You're also behind
on your dictations.

39
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,422
I don't do dictations.

40
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,882
Cameron does them, or somebody.

41
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,051
And you can't have your sole
female employee

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,637
doing your clerical work, which
you'd know if you'd attended

43
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,597
the required
sexual harassment seminars.

44
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,684
Now, I'm gonna pause so you can
make a crack about harassment.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,810
Joke killer.

46
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,020
House, got a patient.

47
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,525
Sorry. Can't play anymore.
My mom's calling me.

48
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,238
We just admitted
a world-class cyclist.

49
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,866
- You gotta fire Stacy.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

50
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,494
Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest
at 30 miles per hour.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,955
She's loading me up
with pointless paperwork.

52
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,249
Well, you're way behind
on your pointless paperwork.

53
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,501
- O2 sats are in the...
- She's hostile.

54
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,754
You know me, hostility makes
me shrink up like a...

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,632
I can't think of
a non-sexual metaphor.

56
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,552
She's gonna stand over my desk with
a ruler, checking my spelling...

57
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,137
ER checked for lung infiltrates.
Nothing there.

58
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,182
Professional athletes, Cuddy. It's
like watching an old movie at 2 a.m.

59
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,893
Reliving all the
classic moments.

60
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,854
The part where
he denies it's drugs.

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,106
The part where the good guys
ride in, tests a-blazing,

62
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,774
prove that it is drugs.

63
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,028
Oscar clip. He can't imagine
how they got into his body.

64
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,196
It's so familiar,
so comforting.

65
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,781
She can't handle
working with me.

66
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,366
Oh, right. Yeah.

67
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,286
She's still got a thing for you,
making it impossible for her to deal.

68
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,538
It makes perfect sense,
except for the pronouns.

69
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,916
Anyway, thanks for getting me
out of that meeting.

70
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,711
He's not denying the drugs.

71
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm thinking
he's actually sick.

72
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,473
Jeff Forster, this is...

73
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,309
I'm a doctor.
You're a sick person.

74
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,021
And you are a loved one.
Actually, manager.

75
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,606
We've been together
for 7 years.

76
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,567
So what's the drug du jour on
the bike circuit these days?

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,987
Still erythropoietin, or are you
guys just chugging battery acid?

78
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,617
There's no way I'd touch EPO.
Too many guys stroking out and dying.

79
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,785
Damn.

80
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,454
10 bucks for the ticket,
six for the popcorn.

81
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,498
I do straight blood doping.

82
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,666
Plot twist.

83
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,044
That's a very daring
confession.

84
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,837
We've got confidentiality,
right?

85
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,256
Assuming I'm more ethical
than your client.

86
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,095
So, injecting yourself with donor
red blood cells for fun and profit.

87
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,722
Any other tricks
up your sleeve?

88
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,474
Well, nothing much recently.

89
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,769
I'm in town for a charity ride,
so it didn't matter if I won.

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,270
The kids just needed to see me.

91
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,481
If you go slower,
they see you longer.

92
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:20,236
Let's say our health could be affected
by things we did before last Friday.

93
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:26,951
Well, I usually sleep
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

94
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,246
I've been pumping up
electrolytes with an IV drip.

95
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,959
Anabolic herbal supplements,
amphetamines and diuretics.

96
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But why would you be sick?

97
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,216
I know that doping has risks.
I know that it's outside the rules.

98
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,680
But I do what I have to to
kick ass at my job. Don't you?

99
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,767
Dr. House is a firm believer in
good old-fashioned hard work.

100
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,690
This guy doesn't even get
sick like a regular person.

101
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,984
Instead of a list of symptoms
and no cause,

102
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,070
we have a list of possible
causes for one symptom.

103
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,114
Is the symptom death?

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,699
Respiratory distress.

105
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,076
Insanity doesn't cause it.
I looked it up.

106
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,705
It's the doping. Injecting extra red
cells boosts your endurance level

107
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,373
but it also
thickens your blood.

108
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,834
Thick blood equals clots
equals respiratory distress.

109
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,836
Not with a clean
spiral chest CT.

110
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,713
The guy's sleeping
in a Hyperbaric Chamber.

111
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,631
Over-oxygenation
can cause cell damage,

112
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,133
and if the cells
in the lungs are damaged...

113
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,299
That'd cause pulmonary edema,
which he doesn't have.

114
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,679
The supplements he's been
taking contain yohimbe

115
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,473
which can cause
nerve paralysis.

116
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,849
Tox-screen was normal.

117
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,309
All the tests were normal.

118
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,021
There's no clot, no edema, and
yet he still can't breathe.

119
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,815
So there's something in here
that we can't see.

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,445
Air.

121
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,613
Come to Papa.

122
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,074
This guy's been injecting
himself how many times a day?

123
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,720
All it'd take is one slip of the
needle to cause an air embolus.

124
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,620
So, air is keeping him
from breathing air.

125
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,288
Well, let's go with that
for the irony.

126
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,166
Get a VQ scan and check
his veins for bubbles.

127
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,006
Xenon 133.

128
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,635
It's just radioactive enough for us to
track the air moving through your lungs.

129
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,095
Was my accident on the news?

130
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,222
Yeah, you made
Plays of the Week.

131
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,309
A few more of those, and cycling
will be as popular as NASCAR.

132
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,355
We inject similar stuff into your
blood so we can watch it circulate.

133
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,733
If you accidentally
injected a bubble,

134
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,194
we'll see good air flow
but poor blood flow.

135
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,071
I'm careful, man.

136
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,740
With all due respect, man,

137
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,661
I doubt there's anything wrong with
you that you didn't do to yourself.

138
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,917
There's this kid in oncology, she's
got a picture of Jeff above her bed.

139
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,462
Mickey Mantle was an alcoholic.

140
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,909
At least he hit
his own home runs.

141
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,799
He didn't physically
alter himself.

142
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,552
We take drugs to help us fall
asleep, to stay awake...

143
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,054
Yeah, but we don't make careers out
of who can stay awake the longest.

144
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Really? Ever been to, oh,
I don't know, med school?

145
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,686
Guys, he plays a game
for a living. Who cares?

146
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,229
You don't even like sports.

147
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,606
He's making millions of
dollars ripping off fans.

148
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,900
Anyone who thinks
they should pay a guy money

149
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,778
because he can throw a ball
really far or pedal really fast

150
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,948
- deserves to be ripped off.
- Yeah, stupid, stupid kids.

151
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,618
I've got an uncle. He can
spit a cherry pit 50 yards.

152
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,156
He's working part-time at a lube shop.
Life isn't fair.

153
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,750
Maybe it is.

154
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,919
You were right.

155
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,256
Now, there were
three wasted words.

156
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,926
There is a bubble in his lung. We
should do a Swan-Ganz catheterization.

157
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,512
I love when you do both
sides of the conversation.

158
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,806
It's like white noise.
It's very peaceful.

159
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,319
Is there a light somewhere
that goes on when I have food?

160
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,531
Green for food, orange for
beverages, red for impure thoughts.

161
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,034
That bulb burns out
every two weeks.

162
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,243
How's your biker?

163
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,996
Pumped an air bubble
into a vein in his lung.

164
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,957
The things people do.
Doping, Vicodin...

165
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,585
Hey, you're talking about me,
aren't you?

166
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,242
I'm just trying to function. He's trying
to win himself some little yellow jerseys.

167
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,717
Oh.

168
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,843
What?

169
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,346
Trouble in paradise. 2 o'clock.

170
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,514
Your 2 o'clock or my 2 o'clock?

171
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,724
There.

172
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,773
She seems perfectly happy.

173
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,651
Obviously they huddled in the hall
and worked up this circus act

174
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,985
on the off chance
you'd be in here.

175
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,946
She was unbelievably pissy
three hours ago.

176
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,947
Hmm.

177
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,491
Pissy with you,
happy with her husband.

178
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,993
Yes, there can only be one
possible explanation for that.

179
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,287
When she's angry
she gets sarcastic.

180
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,956
When she's annoyed she's funny.

181
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,791
But when she's frustrated
she gets pissy.

182
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,709
Yes, yes, I'm with you so far.

183
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,712
She's miserable with Mark
because he's not me.

184
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,422
So she's gotta make me not me,

185
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,966
so she makes my professional
life miserable.

186
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,302
- If I can't do my job...
- You really, really need to get some...

187
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,596
Oh, I get some
"some" all the time.

188
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,599
It's why I always need
to borrow some money.

189
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,271
Hi, James. Greg, you
gotten to that paperwork?

190
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,897
I've been pissy.

191
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,856
Pardon me?

192
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,025
I've been busy.

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,237
When you save someone's life,
they owe you forever.

194
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,531
You're right. Take Stacy.

195
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,701
Oh, wait, she'd probably
just leave you all over again.

196
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,079
How's your recovery going? Gotten
around to the small muscles yet?

197
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,666
It's not the size of the muscle,
it's where you get to put it.

198
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:30,170
My goodness, it's like watching Oscar
Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade.

199
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,547
Excuse us.

200
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,386
How awkward was that?

201
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,557
What's he doing here anyway? He's
got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.

202
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,102
Mark is in group therapy for
people coping with disability.

203
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,104
He was thinking about
developing a drug addiction,

204
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,150
- but that would be stupid.
- Hey, you're... You, again.

205
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,447
You're not gonna make some joke
about Mark being in therapy?

206
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,076
What's there to say? He's
doing the responsible thing.

207
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm sure he's got
a lot to deal with.

208
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,874
You're making me nervous.

209
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:13,922
Every time an athlete goes down,
you guys assume it's drugs.

210
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,010
Look, the doctors say
it's probably acid reflux.

211
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,680
Yeah, look, call me tomorrow. There's
a good chance he'll be released.

212
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,265
Okay. Bye-bye.

213
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,434
So, is this fixing him?

214
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,187
If his acid reflux isn't worse
than we thought, yeah.

215
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,898
I gotta be in Spain
in four days.

216
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,816
Shouldn't be a problem.

217
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,068
Great.

218
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,279
If I could just find the little bugger,
should be able to suck it out.

219
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,870
My legs feel weak.

220
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,832
You're under mild sedation
for the test. It'll wear off.

221
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,085
There it is.

222
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,720
- Got it.
- Fantastic, I'll pack his things.

223
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,890
Not yet. I wanna monitor him for a
couple of hours, make sure he's okay.

224
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,310
Give him time to sign a picture
for me, maybe even a jersey.

225
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,604
"To Doctor Chase,
I owe you everything."

226
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,523
It doesn't
have to be that personal.

227
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,818
Not too many eBay shoppers
named Doctor Chase, huh?

228
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,238
Still trying to unload
the Barbara Walters spit cup.

229
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,531
Here you go.

230
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,663
Seriously, anything's fine.

231
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,291
Jeff!

232
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,044
You all right?

233
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,588
Jeff, can you swallow?

234
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,427
What makes a guy
start drooling?

235
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,305
Chase, were you wearing
your short shorts?

236
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,599
Muscle fatigue
in his neck and jaw.

237
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,685
He's obviously got something
worse than an air embolus.

238
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,811
Why?

239
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,688
Because you don't
drool from your lungs?

240
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,595
Maybe the problem is not
the embolus itself.

241
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,400
Maybe it's the treatment.

242
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,735
Maybe you hit a nerve,
literally.

243
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,532
The embolectomy was clean.
His legs were tired, too.

244
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,993
I thought it was from the
sedation, but if not,

245
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,327
it means he's got
something systemic.

246
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,374
Which means it would have nothing to
do with the stunts he's been pulling.

247
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,460
Lupus or polymyositis.

248
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,347
It explains the progressive
muscle weakness.

249
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,421
It could be ALS.

250
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,507
He's too young for that.

251
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,132
Some type of
muscular dystrophy?

252
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,508
He's too old for that.

253
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,594
So what would be
just right, Goldilocks?

254
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,473
Full blood workup,
including ANA for lupus.

255
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,810
And get a muscle biopsy. Find out if
we're talking myopathy or neuropathy.

256
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,521
I'm late for my session.

257
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,522
Session?

258
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,525
It's all a part of the process.

259
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,152
You get angry
and then you get...

260
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,654
Yeah. I'm right on schedule.

261
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,781
So, when am I gonna be done?

262
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,451
No, I need to know,
'cause I got plans to make.

263
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,078
When can I safely
book a game of squash?

264
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,247
When am I gonna
stop being angry?

265
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,540
Not today.

266
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,669
I've come for the healing.

267
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:03,217
Dr. Harper, as you know,
I have a bum leg.

268
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:08,472
What you don't know is I'm upset about it.
I need to talk.

269
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,391
You know House.
You know we have a history.

270
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,852
You've been telling me for
years that I should come by.

271
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,563
Here I am. Hi, guys.

272
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,024
- I've got a Thursday group.
- Poker night.

273
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,193
- Monday morning?
- Book club.

274
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,781
Well, look, if it's a problem, I'll
just go deal with my rage privately.

275
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,907
Wait.

276
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,284
If you two could
resolve this tension,

277
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,245
you could really
help each other.

278
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,998
I'm tired of fighting.

279
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,213
So either I say yes
or I'm the jerk?

280
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,465
Oh, God, I know that feeling.

281
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,136
I took the muscle specimen
from Jeff's thigh.

282
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,722
I figured that's where we'd have the
best chance at finding something.

283
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,808
The most painful place
to cut into.

284
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,562
I assume that's caffeine-free.

285
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,147
Wouldn't want to be artificially
boosting your performance.

286
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,566
Don't start her up again.

287
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,984
Caffeine's legal.

288
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,361
All about the rules, eh?

289
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,196
It's a bike race,

290
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,053
a completely arbitrary set of
rules that everyone complies with

291
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,868
for no other reason than that some
committee says that they should.

292
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,204
But that's the point.
That's what the game is.

293
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,499
So, if you break an arbitrary
rule, Cameron damns you to hell.

294
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,585
But if you break a rule
that actually has a reason

295
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,907
that's designed
to protect people,

296
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,921
Cameron develops
a crazy crush on you.

297
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,424
House doesn't pretend
to be some golden boy.

298
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,384
He does it to help people,
not to glorify himself.

299
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,720
So why don't you report Jeff
to the biking authorities?

300
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,722
Ethics.

301
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,849
Well, you wouldn't be doing
it to glorify yourself.

302
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,695
You'd just be trying
to make a better world.

303
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,155
At least you can still
get around on your own.

304
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,232
Yeah, I know.

305
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,444
But you're starting to walk.
You're gonna get better.

306
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,572
You have a job,
a way to be productive.

307
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,157
And you have a wife.

308
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,159
Which gives greater meaning?

309
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,496
A wife could make things
harder, too, I suppose.

310
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,875
This isn't about Stacy.

311
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:04,338
When it happened to me,
Stacy was great.

312
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,715
She kept telling me
not to rush it.

313
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,760
I never believed her.

314
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,803
She means it.

315
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,431
I know, but...

316
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,019
Stacy. She shouldn't
have to wait, right?

317
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,229
And you know she feels it, too.

318
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,652
There's more time at work. There's
more satisfaction from work.

319
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,196
She didn't get married
to be a nursemaid.

320
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,574
She wants a man.

321
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,252
How the hell could she have loved a
manipulative son of a bitch like you?

322
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,629
That's an interesting question.

323
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,548
Maybe she was attracted to
different things in the two of us.

324
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,675
She left you.

325
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,093
But why was she with me
to begin with?

326
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,929
- She made a mistake.
- Maybe it's that simple.

327
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,543
Or maybe she saw
something in me,

328
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,140
something she doesn't get
from you.

329
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,476
- I'm not an ass.
- Maybe she wanted an ass.

330
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,937
- She obviously did once.
- Either he goes or I go.

331
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,605
You think that's the kind of
thing you can just turn off?

332
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,942
- Get him out of here!
- Dr. House, cancel your book group.

333
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,568
You're coming on Mondays.

334
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,452
Here's my new theory. The drooling's
another competitive edge.

335
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Nobody can draft behind it.
The road gets slick.

336
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,432
He's the only one
not racing in the rain.

337
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,500
He can barely move
his arms and legs.

338
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,586
- Paralysis?
- No, just general weakness.

339
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Muscle biopsy is negative
for polymyositis.

340
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,258
And ALS and muscular dystrophy.

341
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,427
ANA for lupus, also negative.

342
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,303
Maybe his bike shorts
are just on too tight.

343
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,056
So, by your rationale,
House shouldn't use a cane.

344
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,517
He should just drag his bum
leg around as God intended?

345
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,854
House has a handicap. All
he's aiming for is normality.

346
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,605
And who decides what's normal?

347
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,172
What if we find a drug that makes
people live 20 years longer?

348
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,526
Should we ban that
because it's not normal?

349
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,820
Jeff doesn't want normal.
He wants superpowers.

350
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,282
- So why is he normal?
- Oh, God, you too?

351
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,493
He's shooting
for extraordinary.

352
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,899
So why is everything
so ordinary?

353
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,123
I mean, this guy's breathing,
drinking and injecting himself

354
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,490
with everything he can find
to amp up his body chemistry,

355
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,745
and yet every test is normal.

356
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,338
He's artificially raising his red
blood count, so why isn't it raised?

357
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,798
Maybe his count is raised.

358
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,801
Maybe what's normal for us
is out of whack for him.

359
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,636
Can't slip anything by you.

360
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,764
Well, if that's true,
his white cells are up, too.

361
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,610
Which would point
to some kind of infection.

362
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,102
Muscle weakness, exhaustion.
He could have encephalitis.

363
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,271
- That's kind of a long shot.
- Yeah.

364
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,356
But it's been over an hour
since we've poked the patient

365
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,193
with something sharp.
So, get a lumbar puncture

366
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,361
and order broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

367
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,364
No, it's not about judging.

368
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:40,160
It's just that on a dating
service you should post a photo.

369
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,537
I have to go.

370
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,291
- I am so sorry to bother you.
- Nope, not a problem.

371
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,919
I was just accounting.

372
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,796
I'm Jeff Forster's manager.

373
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,464
He's been here a whole day,

374
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,300
and it doesn't seem like we're
any closer to a diagnosis.

375
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,344
Jeff Forster. A whole day, huh?

376
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,470
Mmm-hmm.

377
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,140
I was just wondering if I
could help speed things up.

378
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,435
Your client's had a muscle
biopsy, a full blood workup

379
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,063
and he's scheduled for a lumbar
puncture at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

380
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,689
Jeff is in the Lucas Wing.

381
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,400
If Mr. Lucas showed up
needing a lumbar puncture,

382
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,110
would he have to
wait until tomorrow?

383
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,363
- Mr. Lucas is dead.
- Good.

384
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,449
Then there's an opening.

385
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,203
Jeff is used to doing whatever
he has to to be first, isn't he?

386
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,788
It's been
very lucrative for him.

387
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,791
He feels it's important
that he give something back.

388
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,670
I hear you've been raising funds for
your nuclear medicine department

389
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,715
or whatever.

390
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,269
Thank you, guys,
for working so late.

391
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,520
Glad to be here.

392
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,316
The lumbar puncture will tell us
what kind of infection you've got.

393
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,819
In the meantime, we're
administering antibiotics.

394
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,739
Do you like being a hero?

395
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,451
It's a living.

396
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,412
You don't feel
a sense of responsibility?

397
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,099
There's kids out there
that worship you.

398
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,210
When I was a rookie
on the tour,

399
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,672
I got a letter
from a guy in Wisconsin.

400
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,967
He wanted me
to send a note to his son.

401
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,720
He said he worshipped me.

402
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,265
You know what worship means?
I looked it up.

403
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,563
It means to love unquestioningly
and uncritically.

404
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,860
So the kid doesn't even
know me, but he loves me

405
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,654
unquestioningly
and uncritically.

406
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,532
So you decided
to take advantage of that.

407
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:48,121
What should I have done?
"Dear sir, I'm just a guy"

408
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,415
who rides a bike pretty good.

409
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,543
"You and your kid
are out of your minds."

410
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,589
My arms feel funny.

411
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,429
The sats are dropping.
He's in respiratory arrest.

412
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,764
He can't be. We fixed that.

413
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,599
Apparently not.

414
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,574
So glad we cured
his respiratory arrest.

415
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,077
It freed him up to develop
respiratory arrest.

416
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,995
LP was negative
for encephalitis.

417
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,401
The white count's
still the same,

418
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,832
but the red count's
fallen to 29%.

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,167
What was my theory yesterday?

420
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,044
That I screwed up
the embolectomy.

421
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,047
We'll get a chest x-ray
to check.

422
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,534
I didn't screw up.
Why would you...

423
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,926
How can you be so petty, Chase?
He's down a quart.

424
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,679
Either he's losing blood
because you nicked something

425
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,930
or he's just
not producing blood,

426
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,015
in which case,
we're talking acute anemia

427
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,183
combined with
a muscular disorder.

428
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,060
Paraneoplastic syndrome?

429
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,646
Either you screwed up
or he's got cancer.

430
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,780
I think I should
start smoking again.

431
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,992
You want a medical opinion
supporting that decision?

432
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,077
The symptoms started
as soon as I quit.

433
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,664
Symptoms meaning diarrhea.

434
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,084
- A lot of diarrhea.
- 10 or 12 times a day.

435
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,504
It's really embarrassing.
I'm a flight attendant and...

436
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,773
Well, on the up side,
my hiccups are gone.

437
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,176
You went to his group.

438
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,014
Well, you were the one who was all, "Greg,
you need to confront your feelings".

439
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
That was five years ago.

440
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,307
Well, I've been pissy.

441
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,102
Fine, you don't want help. Does
that mean nobody should get it?

442
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,856
Mark's looking for help because,
what, he's resentful, overwhelmed?

443
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,108
- I'm asking because I care.
- Not about him.

444
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,694
You still wanna jump me, so you
don't care whose marriage...

445
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,904
Listen, I can get my rocks
off any time I want.

446
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,781
What I don't seem to be
able to do is my job

447
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,491
without you hanging over
my shoulder.

448
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,290
How many packs?

449
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,794
A bit over one a day, but
they were lights, and I quit.

450
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,380
You used to go out with her?

451
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,548
Yeah.

452
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,216
What was I thinking?

453
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,637
I'm talking about the gum you're chewing
to replace smoking as an oral fixation.

454
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,098
- How many packs?
- Six, maybe seven.

455
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,684
I'm trying to protect you.

456
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,812
Cuddy and I may be the only people
stopping you from jumping off a cliff...

457
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,398
- You're pissy.
- Oh, I am angry!

458
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,525
- You get pissy when you're frustrated.
- Shut up.

459
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,069
Okay, I'm wrong.

460
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,655
This is unbelievably difficult
for Mark, which you should know.

461
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,117
Which you should be able to summon
up some level of empathy for.

462
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,037
Right. The crippled boys.
We should start a band.

463
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,206
I have a good thing with Mark.

464
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,833
We are handling this
the best way we know how.

465
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,679
And none of this has
anything to do with me?

466
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:44,923
No, nothing, except that you
can't or won't just let it go.

467
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,885
Let it go.

468
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,977
You're being poisoned.

469
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,313
By gum?

470
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,608
Sugarless gum uses sorbitol
as a sweetener.

471
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,569
We use sorbitol as a laxative.

472
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,662
This will tell you if he's
got cancer in his blood?

473
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,581
If he does, we'll see
abnormal cells in the marrow.

474
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,668
How long will the tests take?

475
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,586
I'll get them in
as soon as I can.

476
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,299
And if he doesn't have cancer,
what else could it be?

477
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,302
It's possible some damage was done
during one of the tests we gave him.

478
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,180
So either one of your doctors
screwed up a simple procedure

479
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,557
or he's got cancer.

480
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,060
We can't know anything for sure
until the biopsy comes back.

481
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,189
It stings, I know.

482
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,899
No, he wants the tube out.

483
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,151
I can't do that, Jeff.

484
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:49,445
If you wanna say something,
you've gotta write it down. Okay?

485
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
Here.

486
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,133
If it's cancer, it's possible.

487
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,218
There's no way
to know for sure.

488
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,642
Phone not working?

489
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,647
One of the morgue attendants
asked me to bring this to you.

490
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,736
Wonder why they're calling me.

491
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,862
Yeah, me too, actually.

492
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:35,283
I was wondering why the Times
was returning your call.

493
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,995
You a doctor
or the bicycle police?

494
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,832
He's cheating.
He shouldn't get away with it.

495
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,295
Have you actually
told them anything yet?

496
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,421
You worried
about the precedent?

497
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,923
I'm worried about you.

498
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,132
You gonna turn me in?

499
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,593
No.

500
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,058
He's made a mistake. Revealing
the truth doesn't undo it.

501
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,978
Kids love him, and he's not who
they think he is. It's not right.

502
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,481
Who cares if he's what he says he is?
Who the hell is?

503
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,818
If love is based on lies, does
that mean it's not a real feeling?

504
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,946
It doesn't bring
the same pleasure?

505
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,781
Are we still talking
about the patient?

506
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,664
Have you ever cheated?

507
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,338
Well, I have.

508
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,215
You wanna punish him?
Good for you.

509
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,051
But you can't do it without
punishing the people who love him.

510
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,011
Is that how you justified
lying to your wives?

511
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,390
I always told them.

512
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,771
Well, he's negative for bleeds.

513
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,732
Congratulations, Chase.
It's cancer.

514
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,654
Clean him up and let oncology have him.
It's their party now.

515
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,574
He doesn't have cancer. Biopsy shows
he's got pure red cell aplasia.

516
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,869
There's no way PRCA
could manifest so suddenly.

517
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,123
Unless it's drug-induced. He's
lying about not being on EPO.

518
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:06,791
Why would he lie?

519
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,126
What does it matter?

520
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,131
People lie for thousands of reasons.
But there's always a reason.

521
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,675
Philosophically interesting,
medically irrelevant.

522
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,176
Unless he's not lying.

523
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,310
You've got a leak. The press is
all over the Jeff Forster story.

524
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,854
On the off chance that one of
you was stupid enough to call

525
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,060
from your own office, I'm
pulling your phone records,

526
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,399
including your cell phones.

527
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,777
I assume if I point out the fact
that you have no right to do that,

528
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,504
you'll interpret that
as a sign of guilt?

529
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,074
Wilson's chatty, plus he's
got two ex-wives to support.

530
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,326
You want me to tell him
he's fired?

531
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,412
Until we figure out who's behind
this, I'm sitting in with you guys.

532
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,540
You have the ethics of a 4-year-old.
I'm gonna treat you like one.

533
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,918
How am I supposed to practice medicine
with a lawyer sitting on my shoulder?

534
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,296
- Responsibly.
- You know I can't do that.

535
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,132
Cameron.

536
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,091
I'm not the leak.

537
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,802
Somebody once told me
that everybody lies,

538
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,888
and since you're the only people
who know he has cancer...

539
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:02,972
He doesn't have cancer.

540
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,016
The point is,
you're his medical team.

541
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,143
He's threatening to sue.

542
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,978
Why would Cameron leak cancer?

543
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,273
How does cancer
make the guy look bad?

544
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,238
He's on EPO.

545
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,620
Your anemia is caused
by pure red cell aplasia.

546
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,290
This is gonna hurt,
but we gotta talk.

547
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,625
What the hell are you doing?

548
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,834
He'll be fine, sort of.

549
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,671
I just don't have time to
watch him write out answers.

550
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:41,010
PRCA comes in two varieties,
chronic and acute.

551
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,055
Since it came on fast,
you have the acute version.

552
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,264
He doesn't have cancer.

553
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,475
Is the good news.
The bad news is

554
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,894
pants are on fire.

555
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,273
Acute PRCA is caused by drugs,
most commonly, EPO.

556
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,235
Ready, and action!

557
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,695
But I haven't used EPO.

558
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,324
Okay, but this time,
with more anger.

559
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,910
Remember, this guy's
accusing you of cheating.

560
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,454
I haven't used that stuff.

561
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,876
I believed it. It was simple, it was pure.
Did you believe it?

562
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,088
I guess it's silly to cast someone
after the first audition.

563
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,006
- Why don't you do a reading?
- Give me that.

564
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,176
- He doesn't do EPO.
- What did you think?

565
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,388
It's a different way to go, but, I
don't know, I just didn't buy it.

566
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,931
Does she handle
any of your injections?

567
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,016
You think I'm giving it to him?

568
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,560
Test him.

569
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,228
Gee, that's a great idea.

570
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,858
I sure hope that EPO's not one of those
drugs that's undetectable after six hours.

571
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,111
Hey, you know what we can test for?
Phone calls.

572
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,030
Take her cell phone.
Push the redial button.

573
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,241
Even money says you'll be
connected to the newspaper

574
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,567
that leaked your cancer story.

575
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,203
Okay.

576
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,332
Okay, I should have told you.

577
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,585
It's not just about
the races, Jeff.

578
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,336
It's about your image, okay?

579
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:02,091
If you come back from cancer, those
sponsors will be all over you.

580
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,513
Okay, so I messed up. Okay?
But I did not give you EPO.

581
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,932
That stuff could kill me.

582
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,519
Come on, give her a break.

583
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,886
She was only doing what she
has to to advance her career.

584
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,940
Don't you have that tattooed
on your tushie?

585
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,319
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

586
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,571
Who are you gonna believe,

587
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,781
the manager you've trusted
for years?

588
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,910
I've been to college.

589
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,711
You're fired.

590
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,763
Okay.

591
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,100
You're basing this
whole diagnosis, everything,

592
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,854
on the idea that I was
slipping him illegal drugs.

593
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,362
You're gonna kill him.

594
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,337
If Doctor House is so sure,
why do you need to stay?

595
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,464
He's a very cautious man.

596
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,717
Your breathing's better.
Let the prednisone do its job.

597
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,302
Get some sleep.

598
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,021
Jeff?

599
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,993
His red blood cell count
plummeted to 16%.

600
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,496
He passed out, had to be resuscitated,
and he still can't move his legs.

601
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,374
That's not possible. The drugs should
be flushing out of his system.

602
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,418
Can't leave
if they don't exist.

603
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,421
The EPO use explains
every one of his symptoms.

604
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,188
He's been lying and cheating, and
now it's coming back to bite him.

605
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,968
The only problem with that theory
is it's based on the assumption

606
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,845
that the universe
is a just place.

607
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,098
If it were, then his poor manager
wouldn't have been fired for no reason.

608
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,225
- Lambert-Eaton.
- His chest was clear.

609
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,644
So we run
an electromyography test.

610
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
You're still not explaining
the PRCA.

611
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,440
What's his red count now?

612
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,774
I had to give him
a blood transfusion.

613
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,359
He's back around 30.

614
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,570
He needed a transfusion?

615
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,240
Well, he was losing blood, so, I
thought maybe he needed blood.

616
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,871
Go forth and scan his neck.

617
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,080
His neck?

618
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,125
Or repeat everything I say
in question form.

619
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,723
She came into the clinic
and yelled at me.

620
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,144
Then she left, she came back
and yelled some more.

621
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,479
Hmm.

622
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,649
Yelling. That might be a clue.

623
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:09,278
I know what the yelling means. It's the
coming and going I find interesting.

624
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,530
- It's not rational.
- Anger is not rational.

625
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,074
Some anger is.

626
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,077
She could have pulled me aside,
screamed at me privately.

627
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,497
Her beef is simple
and well founded.

628
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,832
But she was out of control.

629
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,459
You're having fun, aren't you?

630
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,628
She's in my face.
I need to know why.

631
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,171
Professional reasons.

632
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,339
Why else?

633
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,511
Do you really think this is
going to end well for anyone?

634
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,561
After this, let's scan some other
totally random body parts.

635
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,480
50 bucks says
we find something.

636
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,191
Find what?

637
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,694
Don't have a clue. We on?

638
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,653
No way.

639
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,617
No. We'll find something.

640
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,709
- We found a thymoma.
- How'd you know to look in his neck?

641
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,502
Thymoma's usually present
in the chest.

642
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,379
I knew it wasn't in his chest.

643
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,215
All we've done since he checked
in is look at his chest.

644
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,022
- All the more reason not to think...
- There are two types of PRCA.

645
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,846
Acute comes on suddenly,
chronic takes its time.

646
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,932
We all thought Jeff's was acute because
it happened right in front of us.

647
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,685
But what if it'd been there
for months, maybe years?

648
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,645
There's no way. It would
have kept him from racing.

649
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,052
With that kind of anemia, he
would have needed constant...

650
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,025
Blood transfusions.

651
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,695
Which he was getting in
convenient blood doping form.

652
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,864
He was treating himself
without even knowing it.

653
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,492
Up to half of patients with
chronic PRCA have a thymoma.

654
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,120
And up to half of patients
with a thymoma...

655
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,123
I've always wanted to do this.

656
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,261
I'm not getting any better.
Does that mean I'm...

657
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,767
You are healed. Rise and walk.

658
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,518
Are you insane?

659
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,645
In the Bible,
people just say, "Yes, Lord",

660
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,647
and then start right in
on the praising.

661
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,359
First you tell me
I've got cancer.

662
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,697
And then you tell me
that my manager...

663
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,629
What did you do?

664
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,131
No, "What did you do, Lord?"

665
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,884
Thymoma is a tumor
on the thymus gland.

666
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,845
He's a bit of a wimp, but he
hangs with the tough guys.

667
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,557
PRCA and an autoimmune disease
called myasthenia gravis.

668
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,018
MG causes muscle fatigue

669
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,063
including respiratory problems
and difficulty swallowing.

670
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,774
And it can hit you that fast?

671
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,276
The treatment for PRCA
is blood transfusions.

672
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,529
The treatment for MG
is hyperbaria.

673
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,490
You were doing both as part
of your regular freak show.

674
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,659
When you took a break,
everything went to hell,

675
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,411
which is not an uncommon
reaction in Jersey.

676
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:08,624
So, the whole thing
with my manager...

677
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,294
Oops. No, no EPO.

678
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,130
This has nothing to do
with anything you did.

679
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,633
- Let her know she's in the clear.
- I could.

680
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,679
Or 10% of a Nike contract

681
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,639
is a hell of a lot of cash.

682
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,810
You don't need your thymus.

683
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,728
If we take it out,
everything else is manageable.

684
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,438
Manageable?
I thought you just cured me.

685
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,108
Uh-uh. This is just diagnostic.

686
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,653
Tensilon erases the symptoms
of MG for five or six minutes.

687
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,664
Sometimes less.

688
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,585
This is exactly
why I created nurses.

689
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,545
Clean up on Aisle Three!

690
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,225
If you've come to search my office,
you should wait 10 minutes.

691
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,560
I'll be out of your hair.

692
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,897
Here, start with my purse.
Just save me some mints.

693
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,358
What do you wanna know?
My sex life with Mark?

694
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,569
My guilt over
crippling your damn leg?

695
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,322
Or are you just here to gloat
because you weren't the leak?

696
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,115
I want to apologize.

697
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,622
Maybe I've

698
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,834
been punishing you
for a little too long.

699
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,172
And maybe you've been
punishing me.

700
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,843
If we're going to work
together, I need to know.

701
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,515
Do you hate me
or do you love me?

702
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,728
Either way, I think
we've got a problem.

703
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,151
I hate you and I love you.

704
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,864
And I love Mark.

705
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,369
And you don't hate him.

706
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,578
No.

707
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,708
So what do we do?

708
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,044
We deal with each other.

709
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,547
Right.

710
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,467
That plan's been
working great so far.

711
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,513
It'll get better.
It'll get easier.

712
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,682
- Why?
- I don't know.

713
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,517
That's what my therapist
tells me.

714
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,206
In the professional cycling
world, we are subject to

715
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,459
what seems like constant
witch-hunts and finger-pointing.

716
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,839
But I want to thank Dr. House
and the excellent medical team

717
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,632
here at Princeton-Plainsboro.

718
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,635
My hope is that this diagnosis

719
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,429
will put to rest any rumors
that I would ever...

720
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,472
He needs blood transfusions
every two weeks,

721
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,474
which means
he can dope all he wants.

722
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,727
He's got a doctor's pass.

723
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,062
It's medicinal.

724
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,982
He got away with it.

725
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,608
Mmm-hmm.

726
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,361
He cheated and won a game.

727
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,742
Life's more complicated than who
gets to the finish line first.

728
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,915
I fell in love
with my husband's best friend.

729
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,380
Near the end, I was at
the hospital every day,

730
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,676
and Joe would come by
after work.

731
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,638
We'd go for walks and try to
talk each other through it.

732
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,892
We kind of clung on
to each other.

733
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,565
My wife

734
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,528
wasn't dying.
She wasn't even sick.

735
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,489
Everything was fine.

736
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,033
But I met someone who

737
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,580
made me feel funny.

738
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,126
Good.

739
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,713
And I didn't want to
let that feeling go.

740
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,472
What happened to you?

741
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,726
How can anyone
go through that alone?

742
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,978
You can't control
your emotions.

743
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,188
No.

744
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,069
Just your actions.

745
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:56,370
You didn't do it, did you?
You didn't sleep with him.

746
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,082
I couldn't have
lived with myself.

747
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,050
You'd be surprised
what you can live with.

748
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,401
Hey.

749
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,363
I need you to open a door.

750
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,573
It's not allowed.

751
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,410
Yeah, I was having
therapy in here today

752
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,078
and I left my cane.

753
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,413
Sorry.

754
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,000
Dude,

755
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,627
I'm crippled.
