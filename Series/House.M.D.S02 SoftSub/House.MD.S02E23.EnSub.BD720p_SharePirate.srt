1
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,180
I know that one.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,730
I was at the studio when
grandfather recorded it.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,340
Been thinking about your mom?

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,580
Mama, everything, my whole life.

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,660
It was all a lie.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,014
I never knew you.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,932
I never knew you were my dad.

8
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,852
Your life's going to be okay, Leona.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,290
You're a good kid.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,760
You got it together.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,560
Survived the last eight months.
On your own.

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,550
You're not your grandfather.

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,656
Or your mom.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,242
You're not going to make
the same mistakes they did.

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm proud that I'm your father.

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,293
I'm glad I'm getting this chance.

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,540
Ready for a cookie, darling?

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,090
We gotta go! Get out of here!

19
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,180
Leona!

20
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:31,821
Leona!

21
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>You've reached a number
that has been disconnected...</i>

22
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,400
<i>...and is no longer in service.</i>

23
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,950
<i>If you feel you've reached this recording
in error, go with it, hang up.</i>

24
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,632
<i>On three. One, two...</i>

25
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,635
House, pick up.

26
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,387
I know it's your day off.

27
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,139
And you've no doubt
got lots of exciting plans...

28
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,599
...but I've got a case.

29
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,186
16-year-old girl presenting
with cardiogenic shock.

30
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,564
No heart attack.

31
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,621
Her heart looks fine.
ER did a full cardiac work-up.

32
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,970
Tox screen's clean,
blood shows no infection.

33
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,060
All on the top page.
I'm a real good reader.

34
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,047
Personal chart hand-off
means there's something else.

35
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm hoping it's not personal.

36
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,620
The guy who brought the girl in,
says he knows you.

37
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,097
I thought I'd met all your friend.

38
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,143
I was also wondering
if you could take a look at these.

39
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,820
Um, when you have a chance. No hurry.

40
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,760
It's just a couple of medical histories,
 one with a minor cancer concern.

41
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,775
No problem.

42
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,861
G-man!

43
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,909
You thought I was gonna do it, didn't you?

44
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,120
Do I know you?

45
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,205
Come on, it's me. Crandall.

46
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,999
Doesn't ring a bell.

47
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,840
-Man, I can't believe you've forgot...
-Unless you mean Dylan Crandall,

48
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,712
the man who'll believe anything.

49
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,090
See, I just made you believe that I...

50
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,675
You haven't changed.

51
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,844
Heard about your leg.

52
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,310
Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing twister.

53
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,931
Just gonna walk it off.

54
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,610
So who's the girl?

55
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,686
Jesse Baker's granddaughter.

56
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,450
You always said you'd give
your right hand to play like him.

57
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,525
No, I said I'd give my right hand to have his left.

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
Why is she with you?

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,190
She lost her mom to Katrina.
Her home, everything.

60
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,702
And I'm her father.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,890
Yeah, she looks just like you.
Got the same 'fro.

62
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,546
I wrote a book about Baker.
Hung out with him.

63
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,180
And his daughter.

64
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,240
That is how babies are made.

65
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,950
I never knew.
She never knew.

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,514
Her mom lied for 16 years.

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,599
That's unbelievable.

68
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,892
Yeah.

69
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,450
No, seriously. I don't believe it.

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,370
Her mom was pissed
at me about my book.

71
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,030
I trashed her and her dad.

72
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,580
She wouldn't talk to me.
Obviously she's not gonna tell Leona that...

73
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,820
You're a sucker. You always were.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,698
Does that mean you're not going to help her?

75
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,300
Why wouldn't I?

76
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,161
She's not scamming me.

77
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,370
Acute myocardial infarction?

78
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,423
ER said no. Retest.

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,340
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?

80
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,009
ER said no. Retest.

81
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,670
And read the damn file.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,887
You just gave them to us.

83
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,390
-Delta wave on the EKG...
-It's all a no.

84
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,110
Everything about her heart is healthy.

85
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,150
She's a Katrina victim.

86
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,030
She's better than Crandall.
He's a Katrina victim victim.

87
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,490
I don't think she was
expecting your sympathy.

88
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,020
I think her point was,
New Orleans was a third-world country.

89
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,170
Toxins, molds, sewage in the streets.

90
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,447
What if her heart is like my bike?

91
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,577
Runs like crap when I'm by myself,
but if I take it to the mechanic, it runs great.

92
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,911
An arrhythmia.

93
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,390
One-time event?

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,665
What are we going to do?
Keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor till...

95
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,460
...she has another arrhythmia?
That could be weeks, months.

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,544
Relax.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,838
I happen to know she's going
to have one right after lunch.

98
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,860
We are golden.

99
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,570
You can't induce
an arrhythmia on someone...

100
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,843
...whose heart nearly
gave out 48 hours ago.

101
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,969
Sure you can.

102
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,514
It's kind of technical, you stick all these
cool little wires inside her somehow.

103
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,670
I mean you shouldn't.

104
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,730
Oh, right...

105
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,710
because it would be much more ethical
to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting.

106
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,070
There's always a team of
cardiologists having lunch...

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,899
...at the next table. This is Jersey.

108
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,777
She's a minor.
She's going to need consent.

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,650
I'll go talk to him.

110
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,490
Oh, that's an excellent plan.

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,010
Give him the form and
tell him it's wrong and dangerous.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,827
I can handle a simple consent form.

113
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,190
Okay.

114
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,622
I'll be Crandall.

115
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,890
-Dr. Cameron!
-House.

116
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,230
From what you say, this guy will trust...

117
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,585
Are you in this scene?

118
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,504
Go.

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,410
I need to talk to you about
a procedure we'd like to do on Leona.

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,800
Like to do?

121
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,530
Is this fun for you?

122
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,180
He's not you.
He's not going to mock me...

123
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,263
Stay in character.

124
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,330
I'm so scared. Hold me.

125
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,435
In order to figure out
which circuit is misfiring...

126
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,820
...we need to map all
the electrical activity in her heart.

127
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,900
Swear to me on the bible
you'd do this if it was your kid.

128
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,486
Good bye.

129
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,075
To map the electrical pathways in her heart,

130
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,390
we send electricity through each, one at a time,

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
until one fails.

132
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,900
That sounds dangerous.

133
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,060
It's a risk I am prepared to take.

134
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,668
If she's got an electrical problem,

135
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
couldn't more electricity
blow her whole system?

136
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,966
Well, look who's been
watching "Bill Nye the Science Guy".

137
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,120
Test is perfectly safe.
We do it every day.

138
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,685
And you believe me.

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,380
I shouldn't do the test?

140
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,273
It's crazy dangerous.

141
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,611
Just sign the damn form.

142
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm not crying. I can handle this.

143
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,703
Then blow your nose.

144
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,580
I need DNA from somewhere.

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,360
You're not running a paternity test.

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
She's gonna stay around just
long enough to get your bank account,

147
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,110
your credit card numbers,
then she's going to be off with her next daddy.

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,980
With what she's been through,
why would you assume...

149
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,410
Because of what she's been through.

150
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,040
Because that's your default position.
Always has been.

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,970
Because she's still alive.

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,610
Raised by a junkie,
living on the streets,

153
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,540
that tends to kick
the sweetness out of you.

154
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,750
I figured you'd have mellowed.

155
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,269
Because you're an idiot.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,470
If I let you do the test,
it means I don't trust her.

157
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,109
No, it means I don't trust her.

158
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,493
100, 99...

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,163
-98...
-She's out.

160
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,840
Heart rhythm's normal.
Insert the first catheter.

161
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,820
I'm in.

162
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,320
All heart rhythms still normal.

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,580
Haven't zapped her yet.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,597
Send the first electrical pulse.

165
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,517
Sinoatrial node is normal.

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,920
Next.

167
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,970
-I've got supra ventricular tachycardia.
-Stop the current.

168
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,940
Is she hallucinating?

169
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,790
IV. Push stat, 12.5 adenosine.

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,430
She's crashing. BP's plummeting.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,290
Foreman, is she hallucinating?

172
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,850
No, normal waves.

173
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,570
The AV node is not the bad pathway.

174
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,430
All that was was a heart attack.

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Reset her so we can find the real problem.

176
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,530
Charging.... Clear.

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,600
Normal rhythm.

178
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,058
Chase. High right atrium, please.

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,394
Her heart's fragile
after that last attack.

180
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,670
Chances of tachycardia...

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,399
You have my permission to blame
Foreman at any negligence trial.

182
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,196
Send the electrical pulse.

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,120
That's the one. She's hallucinating.

184
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,955
It's near the coronary sinus.

185
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,415
Freeze it.

186
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,503
Damaged heart muscle gone.

187
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,990
Cryoblation complete.

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,841
EEG's back to normal.
No hallucinations.

189
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,801
She'll be fine by breakfast.

190
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
Interesting reading.

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Those are my top two choices for sperm donors.

192
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,942
I wanted your medical opinion on genetics.

193
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:57,279
They're losers.

194
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,940
Uh, medically, or...

195
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,970
Donor 1284 likes square dancing.

196
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,911
No one likes square dancing.

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,914
613's been practicing medicine...

198
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:09,875
...for five minutes.
Calls himself a "healer."

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,140
Loves Mozart.

200
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,230
I'm not going dancing with them,
I'm looking for healthy sperm.

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,070
He's got four living grandparents.

202
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,530
Who they are, what they do,
that doesn't matter?

203
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,450
I'm leaning towards 613.

204
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,429
Oh, sure, go with the Jewish number.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,750
1284 has a cousin that tested
positive for the BRCA1 gene.

206
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,960
But his mother was negative,
which means so is your baby.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,580
-What about the...
-Mediterranean-dutch factor...

208
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,200
...on the dad's side? It's not a problem...

209
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,920
...because his dad's mom didn't
carry the thalassemia gene.

210
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,710
The bigger issue is
the jerk and poser genes.

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,810
-This Mozart lie...
-People can't like classical music?

212
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,100
You're designing a kid. A loser kid.

213
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,400
He's already getting pummeled at recess.

214
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,730
Here. Knock yourself out.

215
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Go find sperm
that can beat up 613's kids.

216
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,417
And thanks for your help.

217
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Pretentiousness is hereditary.

218
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,882
Just 'cause they haven't found the gene yet...

219
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,500
Could I have some water, please?

220
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,393
Hello?

221
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,939
I just need some water.

222
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,152
Is anyone there?

223
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,923
Mama?

224
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,718
No!

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,398
Second hallucination
means we didn't fix her heart.

226
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,530
Maybe we missed something.

227
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,910
Her heart's fine.

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,310
If she hallucinated,
it wasn't caused by her heart.

229
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,250
If.

230
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,448
The screaming, the floundering?
It was a hallucination.

231
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,350
What if it wasn't a hallucination?

232
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,870
-We covered...
-Not finished.

233
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,730
What if it was an atypical seizure?

234
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,664
Seizure?

235
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,730
She saw her mother. Mother's dead.

236
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,334
Ergo, hallucination.

237
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,310
Anyone want to explain that?

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,590
His leg hurts.
Walking takes his mind off of it.

239
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,927
Flashback.

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,830
All that wind and rain from the hurricane.

241
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,130
Post-traumatic stress syndrome.

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,770
Why are you so bent on her
not having a hallucination?

243
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,170
If she did have a hallucination,

244
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,500
then the heart problem that
we predicted, found, and fixed...

245
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,510
...was just a gigantic coincidence.

246
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,527
-His leg always hurts.
-It's getting worse.

247
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,322
What if the heart
isn't a coincidence...

248
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,440
...and isn't what caused the hallucination?

249
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,120
The arrhythmia hurts.

250
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,160
What if her hallucination
was caused by pain?

251
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,920
What if she has a disease...

252
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,270
...that translates pain into a bizarre
physiological response, like a hallucination?

253
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,340
She has an autoimmune disease.
She needs a CRP, a rheumatoid factor...

254
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,250
I can prove an autoimmune
disease in five minutes.

255
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,910
-She needs a PET scan.
-You can't test for autoimmune in a PE...

256
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm proving that her hallucinations
are a consistent response to pain,

257
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,750
which proves that she has
an autoimmune disease.

258
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,644
How do you test
someone's response to pain?

259
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,810
Easy.

260
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,896
Hurt them.

261
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,151
It's not going to hurt at all.

262
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,196
We just need to make sure you don't move.

263
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,156
I won't.

264
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,784
Okay, give me your arm.

265
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,286
Let's check your muscle responses.

266
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,060
Okay, turn it over. Palm upward.

267
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,463
Everything okay?

268
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,923
Yeah.

269
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,716
Ow!

270
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,080
What the hell was that?

271
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,177
Diagnostic test.

272
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,590
Cerebral cortex responded normally.
She's not hallucinating.

273
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,050
You know he's not your father, don't you?

274
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,394
He's my dad.
Mama told me.

275
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,020
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

276
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,270
House, leave her alone.

277
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,580
Come on, we both know it's a hustle.

278
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,870
Are the walls closing in?

279
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,890
No. Why are you doing this?

280
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,366
-Spiders coming out of my nose?
-Let me out.

281
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,970
House, the test is over.
Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex...

282
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,286
-Give me your hand.
-No!

283
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,705
Give me your hand.

284
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,083
Forget him.

285
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,980
He's not the perfect mark because
he was the perfect mark.

286
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,214
Plenty of people got there before you.

287
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,424
He's used up.

288
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,134
Tainted.

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,719
Pumped dry.

290
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,932
She's hallucinating.

291
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,439
She's lost everything.
And you're breaking fingers. A new low.

292
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,818
Diagnostically, she needed to be hurt.
I wanted to hurt her. Win-win.

293
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,230
What I didn't consider was a threshold...

294
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,780
...to trigger the hallucinations.

295
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,710
Otherwise, I'd have done
the finger-bending first...

296
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,951
...instead of stabbing her twice.
That was cruel.

297
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,910
If her autoimmune disease is this advanced,
 usual treatment's not going to help.

298
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,870
We don't even know which
autoimmune disease she has.

299
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,541
-Could be Lambert-Eaton, could be Graves...
-Good point.

300
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,959
Let's kill them all at once.

301
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,070
The only way to do that is
to replace her entire immune system.

302
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,080
Good point. Let's do that.

303
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,540
Bone marrow transplant
requires an exact match.

304
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,120
Leona has no siblings.

305
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,428
Good point.

306
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,307
She's all alone, poor thing.
No one in the whole, wide world.

307
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,940
I asked for this tuned.
Did you get this instrument tuned?

308
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,350
If my daughter needs bone marrow,

309
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,259
why are you looking in
a bone marrow registry?

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,138
Because that's where they
keep the bone marrow.

311
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,264
I'm her father.

312
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,530
How does somebody
who believes absolutely...

313
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,910
...anything become a nonfiction writer?

314
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,313
Test my bone marrow.

315
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,430
Here's how this is going to end.

316
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,370
One day, you'll be
sitting at your computer,

317
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
writing one of your little music books,

318
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,117
and your daughter will come home with
a big, angry policeman who'll...

319
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,286
...throw you in jail because
"daddy touched my poozle."

320
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,246
Test me.

321
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,539
Happy to.

322
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,128
Just my marrow.
I'm not authorizing a paternity test.

323
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,838
You're that afraid of the truth?

324
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,005
I know the truth.

325
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,130
Easy lay fay's truth
was that she needed...

326
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,550
...a bus ticket home
to see her sick grandma.

327
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,221
You gave her 100 bucks.

328
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,223
She bought weed.

329
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,860
I know, because I told her
you'd go for the sick grandma story.

330
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,470
If our friendship means anything to you...

331
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,630
Oh, come on. Do you know me at all?

332
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
If you do the test,
one of two things happens.

333
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,310
Either you're right or I'm right.

334
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,070
If you're right, I'll be miserable.

335
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,350
And if I'm right,

336
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'll hate myself
'cause I didn't trust her.

337
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,784
Either way, I lose.

338
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,793
They don't itch. Not raised.

339
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,650
He's had his MMR.

340
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,174
No one's sick at school.

341
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,170
His father took him camping.

342
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,177
We caught two spiders.

343
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,850
You didn't tell me about the spiders.

344
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,890
Did you get a new couch?

345
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,599
-Do you think there might be some sort of toxin?
-What color is it?

346
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,309
Red.

347
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,000
Is that where you watch your cartoons
after you take your bath?

348
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,760
Fall asleep sometimes?

349
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,863
-Yes.
-Bless you.

350
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,340
Need you.

351
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,470
Now.

352
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,909
Yes, mistress.

353
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,123
I'll write you a prescription for one of these.
Just wet and apply.

354
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,175
You didn't tell
anyone else what I'm doing?

355
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,468
Not a soul.

356
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,388
Wilson?

357
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,950
Cameron, maybe you mentioned it to her.

358
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,060
No, I'm a really good secret-keeper.

359
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,070
I never told anybody
that Wilson wets his bed.

360
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,540
Oh, you tricked me.

361
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,090
Part of the protocol
for in vitro fertilization...

362
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,260
...is twice-daily injections of menotropins.

363
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,825
I can't do it myself.

364
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,162
Turn around.

365
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,480
-No clever comments about bending over?
-Not unless you want me to.

366
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,380
I'm just not used to House the professional.

367
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,641
I was just thinking about
what your mother looked like.

368
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,690
Since your father obviously
chose her for breeding purposes...

369
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,850
Shut up.

370
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,481
Natural selection sucks.

371
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
We pick our mates based
on breast size, cars they drive.

372
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,570
They did autopsies
on married couples.

373
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,200
Found a correlation in pancreas size.

374
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,970
We're hard-wired
to pick for stupid reasons.

375
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
You have the chance
to pick for smart reasons.

376
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,740
I think the Germans had
a similar theory about 60 years ago.

377
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,530
I'm not advocating wiping out entire races.
I'm just saying.

378
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,700
You don't want to mate with the first
plastic cup that buys you a drink.

379
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,134
I'm pretty sure you got that.

380
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,220
Microbes can be sneaky.

381
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,352
Thanks.

382
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,230
Twice a day.

383
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,190
This is going to be fun.

384
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,671
I got it.

385
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,474
So why were you friends with this guy?

386
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,950
We were 20 years old.
He had a car.

387
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,940
If he'd been a woman,
I would have married him.

388
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,250
-Is he a match?
-No.

389
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,199
Lying girl lucked out.
We found one in the registry.

390
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,493
Is he the dad?

391
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,000
-I don't think so.
-You didn't run the test?

392
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,748
Said I wouldn't.

393
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,310
Okay. So either you lied, or he has...

394
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,714
...pictures of you being nice.

395
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,425
Stop the radiation.

396
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,433
What the hell is that?

397
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,979
I have no idea.

398
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,908
Lab results on the black ooze.
You're not gonna believe it.

399
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,868
She pooped out of her mouth.

400
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,390
The sample contains stool and digested blood.
How did you guess?

401
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,957
Because it oozed.

402
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,084
If it was in her stomach,
it would have sprayed.

403
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,950
If it was in her lungs, she would have coughed.
This oozed, as in squeezed...

404
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,839
...as in reverse peristalsis.

405
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,674
Who's hungry? Mexican takeout?

406
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,344
In order for digested blood to be in her
intestines, she had to have internal bleeding.

407
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,431
In order for whatever was in her intestines
to come back up, there had to be a blockage.

408
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,910
Liver failure.
There'd be no proteins to clot the blood...

409
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
so it'd leak into her stomach,
mess up her intestines.

410
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,010
Which means, oops we were wrong, because no...

411
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,270
...autoimmune disease
shuts down an organ in two hours.

412
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,234
We need to do a liver biopsy,
find out what the real problem is.

413
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,160
Hey.

414
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,411
Need to talk to you.

415
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,970
The good news is, she doesn't
have an autoimmune condition,

416
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,890
so she doesn't need
a bone marrow transplant...

417
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,620
...and we were able
to stop the irradiation in time.

418
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,978
Bad news, she has potty mouth.

419
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,691
Her liver is failing, which has made
her digestive system go in reverse.

420
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,653
It's actually much worse than it sounds.

421
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,533
We need to do a liver biopsy.

422
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,430
I don't know what's going to happen...

423
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
...when we stick a needle into her liver.

424
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,082
She could die right then and there.

425
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,377
You need to tell me what to do.

426
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,423
No inside information on this one.

427
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,387
Crandall, three days ago,
you didn't even know this girl.

428
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,268
If she'd been hit by a bus,
you wouldn't lose a moment's sleep.

429
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,530
There are people all over this hospital in just
as much trouble, and just as not related to you.

430
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,276
You telling me I shouldn't care?

431
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,540
Prepping me to handle it for when she dies?

432
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,934
It's brown, it's lumpy.

433
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,812
I'm going to heave all over my desk.

434
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,990
Chicken mole?

435
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,400
21 herbs and spices.

436
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,320
I find it very comforting,

437
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,830
you defending a man
you haven't seen in years.

438
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,090
To know my friend, no matter what,
 will always be my champion.

439
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,040
My protector.

440
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,372
I'm not protecting him,
I'm smacking her.

441
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,910
The modesty of a true hero.

442
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,120
Push me and I'll let her die,
just so you'll stop annoying me.

443
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,430
Here's my theory. You're jealous.

444
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,510
He's maturing,
he's accepting responsibility, you're...

445
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,380
...emotionally stuck at 17.

446
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,970
He's manufacturing responsibility,
he's not maturing.

447
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,640
He hasn't changed at all.

448
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,560
So then, why do you care?

449
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,104
That black ooze we saw?

450
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,189
That was a bowel movement.

451
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,984
Out of her mouth.

452
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,910
You're trying to end
this conversation by grossing me out?

453
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,531
I'm an oncologist.

454
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,742
Half my patients have their skin sloughing off.

455
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,246
Why are you so worried about this guy?

456
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,290
He was having a rough time with his girlfriend.

457
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,837
He was in love.
He was always in love.

458
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,175
Wanted to marry her.
I thought she was flaky.

459
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,677
She was sending mixed signals.

460
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,639
So you gave him advice
and she dumped him.

461
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,602
No, I told him
that I would talk to her.

462
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,563
And you blew it?

463
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,160
Technically...

464
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,290
I was doing him a favor.
She was nuts.

465
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,882
Stop the biopsy.

466
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,870
I'm right at her liver.

467
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
It's House. He says stop.

468
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,147
Check it out.

469
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,401
Please tell me you didn't stop
the biopsy to play us some tunes.

470
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,870
The left hand. It's very subtle. Very delicate.

471
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,031
This girl is dying.

472
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,300
Be dying a lot faster if I let you
do that obviously unnecessary biopsy.

473
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:46,460
Now listen.

474
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,623
<i>I asked for this tuned.
Did you get this tuned?</i>

475
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,810
My God, grandpa was a angry drunk.
If only we'd known.

476
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,730
Here's how to become a great artist.

477
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,131
First, get miserable.

478
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,560
Misery drives you
to become a great artist,

479
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,230
but the art does nothing for
your misery, which drives you to drugs...

480
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,480
...which makes you a lousy artist.
And this is not lousy.

481
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,725
You saying he didn't do drugs?

482
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:10,227
Not when he played this.

483
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,314
Something was screwing
with his personality.

484
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah, drugs and alcohol don't do that?

485
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,160
And that note that he says is out of tune, it's not.

486
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,190
Which means that something is
screwing with his aural perception too.

487
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,742
Now, what happens
when you add all of that to...

488
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,827
...the liver disease
which he supposedly died of?

489
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,705
Too much iron. He could have had
hemochromatosis. That's genetic.

490
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,450
Unless you can tell me
Miles Davis couldn't play stoned...

491
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,751
He played better when he wasn't.

492
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,630
I think... I mean,
no one knows for sure.

493
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,050
I'll get Leona a TIBC and serum ferritin.

494
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,841
We can test this in three minutes.

495
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,395
So, what is she, Foreman?

496
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,816
Light-skinned black chick
or dark-skinned white chick?

497
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,320
Not sure.
Can we hear the music again?

498
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
It's too early to see
jaundice from her liver.

499
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,282
True. This is a photograph of
Leona when she was 13 years old.

500
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,992
She's darker now.

501
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,500
She's been living on
the streets for eight months.

502
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,915
No tan line.

503
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,240
So unless those streets she's
been living on are indoor streets,

504
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,754
I'm thinking she's got
iron deposits and melanin.

505
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,383
Both byproducts of hemochromatosis,
 just like granddad used to make.

506
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,346
Squid exam to calculate
the amount of iron in her blood.

507
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,980
Treat her with deferoxamine.
She'll be fine by lunch.

508
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,728
See, I was wrong before,
about the breakfast.

509
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,550
There's the iron. Lots of it.

510
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,135
I'm not going to get this job, am I?

511
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,138
It's a done deal.
I knew it the moment I saw you.

512
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,390
Interview's just a formality.

513
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,560
House. What are you...

514
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,769
Lisa Cuddy,
this is Patrick Linehan.

515
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,522
Patrick's going to be the new intern
rotating in my department.

516
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,859
I didn't even know you were looking for one.
Nice to meet you.

517
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,863
Sorry, I laugh when I'm nervous.

518
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,241
Bet you've been doing
that your whole life, huh?

519
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,078
What kind of medicine
are you interested in, Patrick?

520
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,957
Cancer, infectious disease. The big devils.

521
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,462
I-I think that medicine has
become too institutionalized.

522
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,350
We need to send a message to
our patients that we're just like them.

523
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,426
I mean, we're all people.

524
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,210
"We're all people." I like that.

525
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,603
She's all hard science, facts.

526
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,800
I like to know a person's hopes and dreams.

527
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,870
What kind of music do you like, Patrick?

528
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,692
-Actually, I...
-I'm a Mozart man.

529
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,390
He says what I feel, but can't express.

530
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm late for a meeting.

531
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,037
See, this is why the face to face
interview is so important.

532
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,414
You gotta know who you're getting in bed with.

533
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,756
Get him out of here.

534
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,680
Deferoxamine is a chelating agent.

535
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,646
It binds to the iron so that
her liver can get rid of it.

536
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,810
Once the iron's out of the liver,

537
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,567
it's finally evacuated by
the body in the form of urine.

538
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,278
Should be quick and painless.

539
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,430
-Leona?
-What's happening?

540
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,780
Crash cart.

541
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,240
She's not getting any air.

542
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,327
CT showed her lungs are Swiss cheese.

543
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,248
Ventilator's helping, but at this rate,
 her time's basically up.

544
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,459
We developed a theory.

545
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,490
Hemochromatosis.

546
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,950
Like good scientists, we tested that theory.
 We proved that theory.

547
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,990
We acted based on that proof,
and we treated her.

548
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,010
As a result of which,
she is on the verge of death.

549
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,260
Is it just me, or have we discovered
a flaw in the scientific method?

550
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,130
Walk me through it, step by step.

551
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,470
What is supposed to happen...

552
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,100
...when you give
someone deferoxamine?

553
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,510
It's a chelating agent.

554
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,720
And what does the chelating do?

555
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,530
-Removes excess iron from the liver.
-How?

556
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,270
The iron is heavy. It gets stuck.
Deferoxamine is like a lubricant.

557
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,697
It makes the iron slick
so it can move around again.

558
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,080
Moves around where?

559
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,210
It's supposed to be discharged through waste.

560
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,121
Her waste system is a little screwy right now.

561
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,760
Means the iron can't go
where it wants to go.

562
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,500
What if it moved to her lungs?

563
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,255
And whatever's in her lungs likes iron,
 bound with it, started poking holes.

564
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,600
What likes iron?

565
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,150
Oxygen attaches itself to iron,
 which increases her chance of infection.

566
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,890
No, we started massive antibiotics
prior to the radiation.

567
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,740
Some neurodegenerative diseases like iron.

568
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,809
MRI was clean.
No iron deposits on the brain.

569
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,400
Fungus likes iron.

570
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,290
No objections to that one?

571
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,840
If a fungus is doing all this, she's dead.

572
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,150
There are 25 antifungals.
If we don't know which fungus...

573
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,910
-When in doubt, go broad.
-The most common is aspergillus.

574
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,782
Continue to ventilate her lungs.

575
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,140
Get her on a voriconazole drip and...

576
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,286
...hope she has aspergillus.

577
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,839
The process is confidential.
You violated his privacy.

578
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,551
-How did you even...
-I looked up "loser" in the cryobank.

579
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,512
You wouldn't go
within 100 miles of that idiot...

580
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,420
...and yet you're willing to have his baby.

581
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,550
I'm not looking for a date.
I'm tired of looking...

582
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,147
Cotton ball?

583
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,970
I don't care if you marry this guy,

584
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,903
date this guy, go through his garbage,
but you should know.

585
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,073
Genes matter.
Who you are matters.

586
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,159
Find someone you trust.

587
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,412
Someone like you?

588
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,915
Someone you like.

589
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,300
Listen. Uh, sorry. Okay.

590
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,710
-It's not what you think....
-I rub his leg.

591
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,806
Oh, Ingrid. Hi.

592
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,433
Okay.

593
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,120
You feel guilty about stealing the guy's girl.

594
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,730
I get that, and I'm glad. It's a good thing.

595
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,690
But you did the paternity test.

596
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,486
And either the paternity test comes back
negative and you shove it in the guy's face.

597
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,739
Or it comes back positive...

598
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,580
...and you shut up,
and your leg starts hurting.

599
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,493
Or I never ran the test.

600
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,960
-Not what you think.
-Leona's lungs collapsed.

601
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,167
The treatment's not working.
We've got the wrong fungus.

602
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,879
You can stop. She ruined it.

603
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,591
Three rules for hunting fungus.

604
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,630
Location, location, location.

605
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,930
Crandall says she was living
at the children's shelter in Ridgeland.

606
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,190
Okay.

607
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,190
The one thing we know
for sure is she was not living...

608
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,770
...at the children's shelter in Ridgeland.

609
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,019
Why would he lie about that?

610
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,270
He wouldn't.

611
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,650
But he'd believe her story about the sweet
little girl trying to do the right thing.

612
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,190
We can't ask Leona where she was,
she's intubated.

613
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,790
Don't try to talk.

614
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,507
You've got a big medical thing in your mouth.

615
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,550
Just blink if you understand me.

616
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,097
Fantastic.

617
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,101
Blink if you lied to Crandall about everything.

618
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,024
You picked up a fungus somewhere.

619
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,945
If you were living at the shelter,
like you told your new daddy,

620
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,140
then I got nothing to go on.
And you will die.

621
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:46,440
So...

622
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,912
...did you lie to Crandall?

623
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,627
You're a lousy con artist.

624
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,256
First rule of the game is know your mark.

625
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,592
Once you got Crandall to bite
on the papa thing, you had him.

626
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,511
You could have told him that...

627
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,389
...you were servicing Al-Qaeda
suicide bombers for crack,

628
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,540
and this guy would still have let you
pick out the colors in your new room.

629
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,147
Did you lie to Crandall?

630
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,320
Where were you?

631
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,670
And the winner is...

632
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,840
Oh, you read it.
I just get so nervous at these things.

633
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,970
-Recording studio.
-She read the book.

634
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,640
She knew how much Crandall hated that place,
what went on there.

635
00:38:56,063 --> 00:38:57,481
She overplayed her hand.

636
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,590
She was desperate.

637
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,460
If she didn't sell this,
she was stuck in hell.

638
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,510
Recording studio doesn't help us medically.

639
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,862
Recording studios.

640
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,210
Why are these buildings different
from all other buildings?

641
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,420
Sound proofing.
Absorbs sound, also absorbs moisture.

642
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,747
Where there's moisture,
a lot of it, say, Katrina moist.

643
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,060
Zygomycosis.
Only occurs at the highest levels of mold.

644
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,230
Start her on an IV drip of Amphotericin B
with colony-stimulating factors.

645
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,714
She'll be fine by...

646
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,591
...dinner.

647
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,891
She's going to be fine.

648
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,602
She said she'd never go back there.

649
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,020
She lied to you.

650
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,040
She's your kid. Get used to it.

651
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,442
Thank you for the injections.

652
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,653
You're welcome.

653
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,284
You came all the way up
here just to tell me that?

654
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
No.

655
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,820
Pretty much normal.
Liver function tests are good.

656
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,680
Thanks, G-man.

657
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,643
What makes you think
you'd be a good father?

658
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,250
I don't know.

659
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,732
Feels right.

660
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,859
Feels good.

661
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,010
Well, at least you've got a good reason.

662
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,760
Feels good is a good enough reason.

663
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,810
What's happening?

664
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,940
She's choking. She can't breathe.
Get him out of here, will you?

665
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,374
Out.

666
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,320
Quick, the curtain.

667
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,971
You're breathing on your own.
Choking's normal.

668
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,440
I lied to him.

669
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,064
I ran a paternity test.

670
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,850
Your lie...

671
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,655
...was a bad one.

672
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,786
He is your dad.

673
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,750
We're even.

674
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,604
<i>Uh, your machine's broken.
There's not even a message.</i>

675
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,566
<i>House? Are you there?</i>

676
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,820
<i>Okay, see you Monday, I guess.</i>
