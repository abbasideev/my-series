1
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,446
Do you feel the Spirit?

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,916
And in the 39th year of his reign,
Asa was diseased in his feet

3
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,793
until the disease was exceedingly great,

4
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:49,507
yet he didn't seek help from the Lord,
but from the physicians.

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,969
Now, there is nothing wrong
with seeing a doctor.

6
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:57,515
But can a doctor heal through the power
that Jesus gave his disciples?

7
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,268
Men of science can walk through life
with blindfolds,

8
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,895
never knowing that you or I
could not take a single step

9
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,106
if we were not uplifted by God.

10
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:16,617
Agnes, thank you for letting me be
an instrument of God's love for you.

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,137
In faith...

12
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,056
all things are possible.

13
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,938
My friends, I want you to let Agnes

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,483
feel the wave of faith
in this church here today,

15
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,068
lifting her into God's hands.

16
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,156
Praise God!

17
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,617
You can do it. Come on, sister.

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,753
Praise Jesus!

19
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,254
Thanks be to God!

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,008
Thank you, Lord! Thanks be to God!

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,760
Thank you, Lord!

22
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,903
- Is he all right?
- No!

23
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,075
My son!

24
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,371
Daddy, I think I need a doctor.

25
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,248
Didn't remember my DVD player?

26
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,708
Well, if you wanted it,

27
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,918
you shouldn't have left it behind
when you moved out.

28
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,380
I get it.
It's a drag watching porn on VHS.

29
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,939
I'll call you
as soon as I'm done with it.

30
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,801
That's if you ever get
a phone installed.

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,556
Oh, forget it. I'll come by
and get it myself. After work, Thursday?

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,850
Won't be home Thursday.

33
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,061
No problem. I still have a key,
I can let myself in and out.

34
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,230
I guess maybe I could
bring it in tomorrow.

35
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,608
After all, how many times
can you hit "pause"

36
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,611
at the part where Lindsay Lohan
wins the spelling bee?

37
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,217
What is it about girls who can spell?

38
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,908
- It's a math contest.
- What is it about girls who can count?

39
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,076
It's poker night, isn't it?

40
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,120
You said weeks ago that I could play.

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,997
- Stop making excuses.
- Gotta go!

42
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,334
Building full of sick people.
If I hurry, maybe I can avoid them.

43
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,671
The abdominal series showed
no evidence of obstruction.

44
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,299
- What did you have to eat?
- Chicken sandwich.

45
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,259
We travel, lots of fast food.

46
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,139
Thank you, I barely felt it.

47
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,934
You're welcome.

48
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,061
God told me you were kind.

49
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,898
You talk to God?

50
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,443
God's presence often descends on Boyd
to help him guide others.

51
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,071
- This been going on long?
- Since he was 10.

52
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,909
God told me
I would meet a woman healer

53
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,205
who was harboring vengeful thoughts
about a man she works with.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,625
That's God's job.

55
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,629
I'll keep that in mind.

56
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,342
- His urine is dilute.
- What does that mean?

57
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,011
Could mean that for some reason
his kidneys aren't purifying

58
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,181
the way they should, which would
let toxins accumulate in his body.

59
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,892
We'll run the blood work
and see what it tells us.

60
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,144
Thank you, I appreciate it.

61
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,609
God talks to him?

62
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
It's not psychosis. He's just religious.

63
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,198
The only medical issue that showed up
on the blood work is low sodium.

64
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,702
No. You talk to God, you're religious.
God talks to you, you're psychotic.

65
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,912
A lot of people experience
their religion

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,706
as something more than symbolic.

67
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,873
That doesn't mean...

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,835
God ever talk to you
when you were in the seminary?

69
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,923
- No.
- God's loss, our gain.

70
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,175
He's either psychotic or a scam artist.

71
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,636
He was actually really impressive.

72
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,848
Well, yeah, with the burning bush
and all, it's quite the show.

73
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,934
He was intelligent, polite, dignified.
He's not a typical 15-year-old.

74
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,811
And he told Cameron God wants her

75
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,147
to stop being pissed at me
over the article.

76
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,774
God knows you stole Cameron's article?

77
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,652
He knows she's harboring
vengeful thoughts.

78
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,695
I'm over it.

79
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,699
I could tell that from the Berlin Wall
of body language between you.

80
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:11,454
I'm shocked that he picked up on it.
Low sodium. Check for Addison's?

81
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,873
No pigmentation
and potassium levels were normal.

82
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,082
Cirrhosis?

83
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,585
Liver feels fine,
transaminases are normal.

84
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,505
We should monitor his saline
intake to correct the low sodium.

85
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,549
No more than 1 meq per liter, per hour.

86
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,009
Let's push the patient history,

87
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,595
see if there's any evidence of drugs
or other delusions.

88
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,764
I'll take care of it.

89
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,893
You're gonna talk to a patient?

90
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,561
God talks to him.

91
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,230
It'd be arrogant of me to assume that
I'm better than God.

92
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,784
So, you're a faith healer?
Or is that a pejorative?

93
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,412
Do you prefer something like
"divine health management"?

94
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,666
Thought God might have mentioned
that I was coming.

95
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm OK with faith healer, Dr House.

96
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,842
That's a nice one.
You didn't even go with,

97
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,428
"I see an H in a medical coat."

98
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,306
- The nurses talk about you a lot.
- Yeah, don't believe them.

99
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,433
I keep a sock in my pants.

100
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,645
Faith. That's another word for
ignorance, isn't it?

101
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,651
I never understood how people could be
so proud of believing in something

102
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,775
with no proof at all.
Like that's an achievement.

103
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,487
God's asking for our trust. You can't
love somebody and not trust them.

104
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,656
Trust has to be earned.

105
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,825
You can't trust someone
hiding in a closet.

106
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,619
You don't trust anyone.

107
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:39,834
You seem lucid.
There's no confusion, no lethargy.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,418
What drugs have you been taking?

109
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,046
Nothing, some aspirin.

110
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,173
I get focused on something,
I forget to eat,

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,217
next thing you know,
I've got a hunger headache.

112
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,636
So, aspirin and hospitals are OK.

113
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,141
That's an interesting attitude for
someone who's kept any number of people

114
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,267
from getting medical help.

115
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,352
Just because I believe in prayer

116
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,480
doesn't mean I don't believe
in germs and toxins.

117
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,947
That bottle's been opened before.
You refilled it at the water cooler.

118
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,740
- Yes.
- How often do you do that?

119
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,577
Few times an hour.
He likes to stay hydrated.

120
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,666
- You think germs might have gotten in?
- I think water might have gotten in.

121
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,218
- We can adjust your pain meds.
- Again.

122
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,972
Suppose we increase your oxycodone?

123
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,144
We both know the only reason
I'm talking lucidly now

124
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,439
is because I did not take my full dose
this morning.

125
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,069
You've done your best

126
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,363
and I have been a good soldier.

127
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,367
It's time we accept it's over.

128
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,706
What about the trip
you were talking about taking?

129
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,459
You've wanted to see Florence
since you were a teenager, right?

130
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,711
Yeah, go now all drugged up?

131
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,381
It's not exactly the trip
I'd been dreaming of.

132
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:17,097
OK, but you're strong,
you're dealing with this

133
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,852
and there is the right combination of
pain meds out there. And we'll find it.

134
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,230
Don't give up on us.

135
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
And don't be startled by the sound
you're about to hear.

136
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,487
Excuse me.

137
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,115
I have a friend with... boundary issues.

138
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,920
- Can this wait five minutes?
- Is she dying?

139
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,171
Yeah.

140
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,799
Before the end of this consult?

141
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,969
They could build monuments
to your self-centeredness.

142
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,932
Patient, 15-year-old, faith healer,
hotline to God.

143
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,435
- What are his symptoms?
- He is not a saint.

144
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,479
He figures out what's going on
in people's lives

145
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,231
by watching, listening, deducing.

146
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,441
And you're worried about
trademark infringement?

147
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,070
Then he passes on advice from God
so he can watch them jump.

148
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,488
It's a power trip.

149
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,783
Oh, and there the similarities end.
Why is he here?

150
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,660
I fear for the human race.

151
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,121
A teenager claims to be the voice of God

152
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,206
and people with advanced degrees
are listening.

153
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,542
The majority of Americans believe in
a personal god.

154
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,878
- What are his symptoms?
- Massive cramps, low sodium.

155
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,880
Turns out he's been
drinking water non-stop,

156
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,716
God told him to purify his body.

157
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,551
Huge water intake
would cause low sodium.

158
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,518
Which would cause the cramping.
Yeah, I got it.

159
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,638
What, that's it? You solved it?

160
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,226
You just brought me out here
to rant because faith annoys you?

161
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,354
Mmm-hmm. He's all better.

162
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,818
You know, I'd get it if people were just
looking for a way to fill the holes.

163
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,322
But they want the holes,
they wanna live in the holes

164
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,700
and they go nuts when someone else
pours dirt in their holes.

165
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,787
Climb out of your holes, people!

166
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,352
Go tell it on the mountain.

167
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,356
Over the hills and everywhere.

168
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,318
Go tell it on the mountain.

169
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,280
That Jesus Christ is born.

170
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,326
Go tell it on the mountain.

171
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,038
Over the hills and everywhere.

172
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,416
Go tell it on the mountain.

173
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,252
That Jesus Christ is born

174
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,881
Boyd, are you all right?

175
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,007
Boyd.

176
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,603
Come on, let's go.
Can you tell me your name?

177
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,773
Do you know where you are? Boyd?

178
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,611
Boyd?

179
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,573
God doesn't want you to be afraid.

180
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,327
He sent me here to heal you.

181
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,913
You think he hasn't heard your prayers,
but he heard them all,

182
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,199
even the ones you didn't say.

183
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,530
I'm sorry, Boyd, come on,
let's get you back to your room.

184
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,963
- In faith, all things are possible.
- Let's go.

185
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,426
Lord, I call on you to relieve
the suffering of your daughter...

186
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,761
Grace?
...and make her whole again.

187
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,389
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
What is this?

188
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,392
He's just had a complex partial seizure.
He's disoriented.

189
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,603
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Well, get him back to his room. Now.

190
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,608
You OK?

191
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,243
Are we certain he even had a seizure?

192
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,621
Him singing and healing,
he does it all the time, doesn't he?

193
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,081
Isn't it interesting

194
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,459
that religious behavior is so close
to being crazy,

195
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,793
we can't tell them apart.

196
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,922
The repetition, the lack of affect
and awareness. It was a seizure.

197
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,883
- Infection?
- No fever.

198
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,344
Could be Wilson's or maybe it's
a glycogen storage disease.

199
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,431
- Or a brain tumor.
- Or tuberous sclerosis.

200
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,850
Hmm.

201
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,727
How to settle this?

202
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,981
We could ask our patient to ask God
or we could MRI his brain.

203
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,816
Which way do you wanna go?
I'm open to all.

204
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,109
- House!
- Yes.

205
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,904
Why the hell do you let an unstable
patient wander the hallways?

206
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,864
His leash broke.

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,551
The last thing a terminal patient needs

208
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,326
is to hear somebody
taunt them with a cure.

209
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,953
She was freaked, she was angry.

210
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,999
And now she's not freaked and angry
and you are.

211
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,627
She says she's feeling better.

212
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,394
Maybe not singing and dancing,
but she's feeling a little bit happy

213
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,756
for the first time in months.

214
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,467
A sudden drop in pain
could create euphoria.

215
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,302
Why don't you let her have her vacation?

216
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,096
Oh, that's great.
And when vacation's over?

217
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,474
When she crash-lands
from all this denial?

218
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,935
She was dealing with her illness.

219
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,436
Now her expectations are rising.

220
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,064
And you're not the one who has to be
there when all that false hope

221
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,565
gets yanked out from under her.

222
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,532
Don't you guys have anything to do?

223
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,411
How long have you been healing people?

224
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,330
You believe that's what I'm doing?

225
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,874
I'd like to.

226
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,043
But you don't.

227
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,672
Why do you always do things
you don't want to do?

228
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,344
It's OK, I don't expect a real answer.

229
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,654
God would probably want you
to take the stick out of your butt

230
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,447
and get over this.

231
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,575
If there is some higher order
running the universe,

232
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,369
it's probably so different from
anything our species can conceive,

233
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,871
there's no point in
even thinking about it.

234
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,499
But I doubt it gives a damn
about my butt.

235
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,794
So you believe God might exist,
but you don't think about it?

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,254
It's the most important issue...

237
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,860
I think penguins might as well
speculate about nuclear physics.

238
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,260
- Why are we having this conversation?
- What? I'm curious.

239
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,698
You cannot tell someone they are
your colleague and not a friend,

240
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,017
and then casually chat
about the afterlife.

241
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,331
You actually keep score?

242
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,336
Your MRI results aren't done yet.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,339
Go back to your room. No singing.

244
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,176
Well, you would get a point for
figuring why the low sodium.

245
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,053
What are my guy's points for?

246
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,723
Your trick about the spat
between Dr Cameron and Dr Foreman

247
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,308
apparently impressed someone.

248
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,726
And the second point?

249
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,566
Do you think it could be
because I healed Grace?

250
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,570
She's been back to see me, I like her.

251
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,616
You like messing with people.
That's why you're here now.

252
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,036
Maybe you think that your batteries
are powered by God, maybe you don't.

253
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,497
Either way, you enjoy what you do.

254
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,708
Yes, I like helping people.

255
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,211
I get a rush when I see the look
on their faces when they realize

256
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,754
their burdens are gone.

257
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,520
But you make sure
you're in the next state

258
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,634
by the time the endorphins wear off
and the arthritis comes back.

259
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,428
That doesn't happen.

260
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,223
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?

261
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,266
God told me.

262
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,646
You see, that's not fair.
We were having fun.

263
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,898
It's hard to keep sniping rationally

264
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,858
when you throw a bomb
like that in there.

265
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,283
He spoke with me about you, too.

266
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,077
Forgive my enemies?

267
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,163
Never date a Taurus
when Mercury is in retrograde?

268
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,125
Yeah, I learned that one myself,
the hard way.

269
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,086
God says you look for
excuses to be alone.

270
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,923
See, that is exactly the kind of
brilliance that sounds deep,

271
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,385
but you could say it about any person
who doesn't pine for the social approval

272
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,304
of everyone he meets, which you were
cleverly able to deduce about me

273
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,390
by not being a moron.

274
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,559
Next time, tell God to be more specific.

275
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,188
God wants you to invite Dr Wilson
to your poker game.

276
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,581
Don't talk to my patient.

277
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,292
What are you talking about?

278
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,336
You get all huffy when my patient
stumbles into yours in the hallway,

279
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,964
but you got no qualms about
chatting my guy up.

280
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,217
This is fun, it's like Password.
Keep talking.

281
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,762
I'll jump in when I get a clue
what the hell you're talking about.

282
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,306
God knows about my poker game.

283
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,474
You think I told him?

284
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,310
Either that or I start going to church
every Sunday.

285
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,956
That would mess with
my bowling league.

286
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,272
Aside from yelling at him
to get back to his room,

287
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,149
I've never spoken to your patient.

288
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,157
MRI shows an abnormal area.

289
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,827
Tuberous sclerosis.

290
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,433
- It's the right neighborhood.
- Accounts for all the symptoms.

291
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:48,210
- All of them.
- Leading cortical tuber's identifiable.

292
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,379
- We can do this surgically.
- Tell our patient, "Congratulations."

293
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,841
Soon his chats with God
will be a thing of the past.

294
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,719
Tie goes to the mortal.

295
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,737
Did you know the Catholic Church keeps
a doctor at Lourdes?

296
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,656
He hears the same thing every day.

297
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:22,536
But, out of the thousands of cases of
people who have claimed to feel better,

298
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:27,249
the Catholic Church has only recognized
a handful as miracles.

299
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,459
But they do recognize a handful.

300
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:34,172
Well, they're a church.
It's what they do.

301
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,761
Look. For the past couple of years,

302
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,430
the world's been getting smaller.

303
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,516
Eight months, six months...

304
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,688
I watch a trailer for a movie
and I think,

305
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,649
"Am I gonna be here
when that comes out?"

306
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,154
But maybe there is still
a horizon out there.

307
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:03,326
You know, maybe... Maybe I can make
plans for a year from now.

308
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,619
Two years.

309
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,249
I like the view.

310
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,295
The view is a lie,
and if you believe it,

311
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,672
you're going to crash so hard.

312
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,302
Let me take new images of your liver.

313
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,721
You can't accept that it could be true.

314
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,016
Well, if it is true,
you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.

315
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,815
Tuberous sclerosis is
a genetic disorder.

316
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,319
It causes small, benign tumors
to grow in various parts of the body.

317
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,280
- In this case, the brain.
- You said benign.

318
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,451
They probably are, but benign or not,
they're not in a good location.

319
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,412
- We need to remove them.
- You're talking brain surgery?

320
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,457
His symptoms are getting worse,
which means the tumors are growing.

321
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,252
Surgery will correct it all,
the chemical imbalance, the seizures,

322
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,587
the auditory hallucinations.

323
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,881
Hallucinations?

324
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,343
Without the surgery,
it's just gonna get worse.

325
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,094
Might even be fatal.

326
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,724
With the surgery, your son should be
a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.

327
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,061
I'm not normal.

328
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,239
I need you to talk to my patient.
I'll get this one.

329
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,452
Why do I have the feeling
you're plotting world domination?

330
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,872
Moses is refusing surgery.
You have a gift.

331
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,667
People thank you for telling them
they're going to die.

332
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:39,214
If I can get him to agree to surgery,
I want in on the poker game.

333
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,968
You would let this kid die
just to get into a stupid game?

334
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,719
You'd let him die just to keep me out?

335
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,769
Hi.

336
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,731
I'm Dr Wilson.

337
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,818
I knew they'd send somebody else.

338
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,696
- That God has a big mouth.
- House.

339
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:08,702
Can I ask why you don't want
the tumors removed?

340
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,412
God put them there for a reason.

341
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,790
You think God needs a telephone
in your head to talk to you?

342
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,251
Isn't he everywhere?
It's not a long-distance call, is it?

343
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,670
This is the way God does things,
through natural law.

344
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,382
If he went around doing big
flashy miracles all the time,

345
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,028
- nobody would need faith.
- How come everyone else needs faith,

346
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,263
but you just get the guy
screaming his existence in your ear?

347
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,475
Your turn.

348
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,815
Do you think God wants you to die?

349
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,569
This is the way that the Lord often is
with his chosen ones.

350
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,822
He gives the most trials
to those that he loves the most.

351
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,657
How sweet.

352
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,869
You abdicate your authority,
avoid those tricky parental issues,

353
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,289
like whether to let him drive at 16.
Just let him die at 15.

354
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,002
So, you believe your son is...

355
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,130
erm, a saint?

356
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,802
The way I understand it, one of
the hallmarks of a saint is humility.

357
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,723
Now, someone with true humility
would consider the possibility

358
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,393
that God hadn't chosen him for
that kind of honor.

359
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,604
Well, he'd consider the possibility

360
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,733
that he just had an illness.

361
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,284
You have a gift for manipulation.

362
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,578
I listen, I have an actual conversation
with people,

363
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,498
which, shockingly, does raise
the odds they'll be cooperative.

364
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,707
That's what I'm saying.

365
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,503
You read that kid and you manipulated
the hell out of him.

366
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,465
Bring pretzels.

367
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,853
I know that knock.

368
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,440
Use your key, I'm not getting up.

369
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,790
Game's not till tomorrow night
and those aren't pretzels.

370
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,627
I took some images of
Grace Palmieri's cancer.

371
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,631
Yeah?

372
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,265
Her tumor's shrunk.

373
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,951
Don't tell my patient.

374
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,416
I want all the records on miracle woman.

375
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,210
Every test,
every treatment she's ever had,

376
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,838
every question she's ever answered
in this hospital.

377
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,425
And anything sent from previous doctors.
Go back to neonatal if you have to.

378
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,432
Which part of "keep them away from
each other" confused you?

379
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,060
They're friends.
She thinks he saved her life.

380
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,647
Now we have obligingly offered
medical proof

381
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,441
that his delusions are true.

382
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,943
They've withdrawn permission
for the surgery.

383
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,071
I put the lawyers on it.
Her tumor shrank?

384
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,406
I'm on it.

385
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,704
Tell Jesus that we need another 24 hours
to normalize his sodium level.

386
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,706
He's already normalized.

387
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,792
Actually, tell Joseph.
Jesus will know you're lying.

388
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,399
And I want you and Foreman and
Cameron

389
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,088
to go over every line of every file
on that woman.

390
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,924
Isn't he the one we're supposed to save?

391
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,012
The only way to save him
is to prove that she is still dying.

392
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,356
MRI machine checks out.

393
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,983
Maybe the radiologist mis-charted
which machine they used.

394
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,443
I checked both.

395
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,947
This is insane,
we're diagnosing a recovery.

396
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,113
What about six months ago?

397
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,367
Maybe there was a malfunction in
her "before" pictures,

398
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,620
some shadow that made the tumor
look bigger than it really was.

399
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,039
I'll go see what I can find out.

400
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,500
Maybe it's a delayed effect
from radiation.

401
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,043
Sometimes it could take a while.

402
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,878
She hasn't had radiation
for six months.

403
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,380
- Here.
- Nowhere. Her records...

404
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,306
There's about a dozen appliances
in every home that give off radiation.

405
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,844
Dosages that wouldn't hurt a hamster if
it was tied to the machine for a year.

406
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,555
If the machine's operating properly.

407
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,432
Sometimes remissions just happen.

408
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,020
You think House will just shrug
and say that

409
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,147
if one of us doesn't check the home?

410
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,760
- Kings on nines.
- Out.

411
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,096
Thank you.

412
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:28,646
Wilson. This is a dry cleaner,
tax accountant, guy from the bus stop.

413
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,023
This is Wilson.

414
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,691
How come he gets a name?

415
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,944
Seniority. Hello.

416
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,003
Find anything?

417
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:55,631
Do you have any idea how many
electrical devices give off radiation?

418
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,051
- All of them.
- I'm going to be here all night.

419
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,719
Everybody's a whiner.

420
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,180
Be a doer, not a me-tooer.

421
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,390
Raise.

422
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,351
I'm out.

423
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,687
She's got at least four different types
of pain pills here

424
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,731
and an LED device.

425
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,028
I'll raise your raise.

426
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,325
Keep looking.

427
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,376
Fold.

428
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,589
You were bluffing,
he knew you were bluffing.

429
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,383
Your luck's changing tonight.

430
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,720
So, did they find anything?

431
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,407
Or are you gonna have to
accept the fact

432
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,974
that every now and then
remissions happen?

433
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,539
This call had better be worth my time.

434
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,251
This is what happens when it's not
our patient. We don't know enough.

435
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:17,088
- That's why you're there.
- She's got a boyfriend...

436
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,551
Unless you think he's radioactive...
...who could show up any minute.

437
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,179
The honor of working for you
is not worth a felony charge.

438
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,264
Give me a minute.

439
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,609
I'm saying the odds of you
having a straight flush are pretty low.

440
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,615
House?

441
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,378
I'll fold.

442
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,006
- Fold.
- Fold.

443
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,884
I'm screwed, aren't I?

444
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,774
Nine bucks for a straight flush.

445
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,743
He's not coming home. Relax.

446
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,959
There's nothing in this universe
that can't be explained, eventually.

447
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,046
Take this game.

448
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,925
Only two people knew that
you wanted in on it.

449
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,468
I didn't tell him...

450
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,513
- I told you, I didn't tell him.
- Why would you?

451
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,599
No, the only person he's been getting
all intimate and conversational with

452
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,142
is your cancer chick.

453
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,936
How would she know?

454
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,646
The subject of my poker game

455
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,232
isn't likely to come up in
the course of a patient interview.

456
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,109
Well, that's the kind of thing that
you mention

457
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,987
to someone you're used to
sharing the details of your day with.

458
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,199
Don't.

459
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,286
Your rabbi.
Guidance counselor, parent.

460
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,539
She's not your mom, is she?

461
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,874
I'm seriously saying don't.

462
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,962
- You've been having sex...
- This is so not the place.

463
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,047
With our miracle woman.

464
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,557
Excuse me. May I talk to you?

465
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,100
Of course.

466
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,727
Boyd's getting dressed,
he's ready to check out.

467
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,647
He can't check out
without your permission.

468
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,441
- His sodium level still isn't normal.
- I told him.

469
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,695
He said that God said it was OK,
he was fine.

470
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,073
Could you talk to him?

471
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,285
Tell them my name isn't Wilson.

472
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:58,124
Most people in your situation
just have their careers to worry about.

473
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,126
You've got that and divine retribution.

474
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,460
Tell them.

475
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,130
Tell me how it happened,
and I'll tell them whatever you want.

476
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,051
She'd had a bad day, pain-wise.

477
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,805
Her ride didn't show up
to take her home.

478
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,142
- So, you offered?
- Yeah.

479
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,312
She didn't have any groceries,
she was too sick to go out,

480
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:24,984
I figured I could afford
to take a half hour

481
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,350
and pick her up a few things...

482
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,030
- Stay and make sure she's OK.
- Yeah.

483
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,616
And never leave.

484
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,869
You told me you got an apartment.

485
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,164
But you moved in with her.
You lied to me.

486
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,249
Tell them.

487
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,838
His name is not Wilson
and he's screwed up worse than I am.

488
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,007
OK. Yes, I lied to you.

489
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,133
I'm sorry.

490
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,511
Half the doctors who specialize in
oncology turn into burned-out cases.

491
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:55,598
But you, you eat neediness.

492
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,350
Lucky for you.

493
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,562
Thanks for the game, guys.
I don't think I'll be coming back.

494
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,314
You're a functional vampire.

495
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,108
Sure, you're heroic, useful to society,

496
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,985
but only because it feeds you.

497
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,240
There's nothing worth stealing,
so don't even look.

498
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,167
You don't just have a fetish
for needy people, you marry them!

499
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,044
- Here we go.
- You mean it!

500
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,173
And then time passes, and suddenly
they're not so needy any more.

501
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,134
Your fault.
You've been there for them too much.

502
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,805
They're getting healthy,
independent and that's just ugly.

503
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,517
God, you must be pissed at God
right now, making her all happy.

504
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,844
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you're being stupid.

505
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,690
You know what you're risking
by sleeping with a patient.

506
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,274
Oh, that's crap.

507
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,902
You're not mad
because I'm risking my job.

508
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,508
You're not even mad
cos I lied to you.

509
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,823
You're mad because I lied to you
and you couldn't tell.

510
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,325
- Yeah. You got me nailed.
- Yeah.

511
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,869
That's why you didn't want me
in your poker game.

512
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,788
Because when it comes to
being in control,

513
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,582
Gregory House leaves
our faith-healer kid in the dust

514
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,335
and that's why
religious belief annoys you.

515
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,462
Because if the universe operates
by abstract rules,

516
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,798
you can learn them
and you can protect yourself.

517
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,677
If a supreme being exists,
he can squash you any time he wants.

518
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,429
He knows where I am.

519
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,433
I think it's yours.

520
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,643
Yeah.

521
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,981
I'll be right there.

522
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,986
Jesus is spiking a fever.
He's delusional.

523
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,821
Tuberous sclerosis
doesn't cause fever.

524
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,740
I know.

525
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,324
I'll drive.

526
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:48,043
Pick any random guy off the street,
bring him in here,

527
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,173
examine him exhaustively, you will find
at least three things wrong with him.

528
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,426
This kid has tuberous sclerosis,
a mild case.

529
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,844
But his tumors are growing.

530
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,055
We assumed that the tumors were growing,
cos he's getting sicker.

531
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,662
But he could have grown old and died
and never known about them

532
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:03,851
if he hadn't come here.

533
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,146
We were looking for something, it's more
or less in the right part of the brain.

534
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,775
It's like we found someone
standing over a dead body holding a gun,

535
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,541
we arrested them,
didn't look any further.

536
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,989
Sometimes people really do
just stumble into a murder scene.

537
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,366
His fever's 103 and rising.

538
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,694
If we don't do anything, he's gonna be
chatting with God

539
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,953
face-to-face real soon.

540
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,081
Fevers don't come from
a long-term underlying condition.

541
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:31,212
He's a garden-variety religious nut
who happens to have an infection.

542
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,339
It's lumbar puncture time.

543
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,970
No, no, God told me,
no more of man's medicine.

544
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,816
If we have faith in him,
he'll make me well.

545
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,767
It's just a test.
We just want to find out what's wrong.

546
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,561
God knows what's wrong,
God will take care of it.

547
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:52,149
He's delirious and he's a minor.
This is your decision and not his.

548
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,675
"The Kingdom of Heaven is like
a treasure hidden in a field,"

549
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,947
which when a man finds, he hides,
and for joy he goes and sells

550
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,782
"all he owns and buys that field."

551
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,409
Buy all the land you want,
don't blow your brains out.

552
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,416
You're watching your son kill himself.
He's out of his mind with fever...

553
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,959
Dad! If your faith is weak, I will fail.

554
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,586
I need you.

555
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:22,638
I'm sorry, you don't even know
what's wrong with him.

556
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,517
God knows the answer

557
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,478
and I would rather leave it
in his hands than yours.

558
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,072
Wilson.

559
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,782
I need you to do your thing.

560
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,870
You do know that I don't actually
have magical powers.

561
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,371
I have faith.

562
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:50,040
You're better off trying to slip
some antibiotics into a meal.

563
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,835
Which antibiotics?
We don't know what infection he's got.

564
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,441
- Go as broad as you can.
- Forget it.

565
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,922
Our best hope is your silver tongue.

566
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,716
What if it's not an infection?

567
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,802
Were you not paying attention when
I was doing my murder scene metaphor?

568
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,679
What if the tuberous sclerosis
is guilty.

569
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,848
It had the gun in its hands,
it was standing over the...

570
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,099
Doesn't cause fever.

571
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,561
It causes everything else. What if
the fever's the innocent bystander?

572
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,480
The fever could have been set off
by something he picked up anywhere.

573
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,087
It could have been a bug he got here.

574
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,072
Or a bug he gave here.

575
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,870
He gave it to your patient.

576
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,749
That's why her tumor shrank,
the virus went after the cancer first.

577
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,710
Are you saying
a virus attacked her tumor?

578
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:39,757
For 200 years, there've been reports of
wild viruses that target tumors.

579
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,469
Early 1900s, an Italian medical journal
wrote up a woman with cervical cancer

580
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,596
who was injected with
a weak strain of rabies.

581
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,140
I have no idea why they did that,
but her tumor shrank.

582
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,725
You think he gave her rabies?

583
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:54,355
One of the virus types most prone
to go after cancer cells is herpes.

584
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,981
Herpes encephalitis.

585
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:58,984
It would fit.

586
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,655
Seizure, low sodium,
even the blurred vision.

587
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,700
And it would mean, if you're right,
Grace's cancer is coming back.

588
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,052
You're not gonna be able
to convince them.

589
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,248
They don't want any more tests,
they don't wanna...

590
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,292
They can't argue with the mark of Cain.

591
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,507
I'm not going to change my mind.
No more tests. God knows the way.

592
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,926
OK, let's start with the shirt.

593
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,971
What are you doing? What are you
doing?

594
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,806
I'm on a mission from God.

595
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,475
If you won't let me undress you,
then strip.

596
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,977
What's he doing? What's going on?

597
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,646
That woman you helped?
You gave her a virus.

598
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,606
No, she's healed, I have a gift.

599
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,693
A gift is jewelry, socks.

600
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,736
What you have is herpes encephalitis.

601
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,364
And the only way
you could've transmitted it

602
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,131
is by scratching one of your own sores
and touching another person.

603
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,327
That's something you get from sex,
right?

604
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,747
Either that or cold sores.
Your kid got it from the sex.

605
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,667
No, no. No sores. No, my body's clean.

606
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,073
They examined me when I came in!

607
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,545
- No sores.
- Herpes hides.

608
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,007
You have an outbreak, it goes away,
it comes back, goes away. Strip!

609
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,759
Maybe you didn't have a sore when
you came in, but you've got one now.

610
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,970
Dad, I've never, ever...

611
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:12,224
Do you wonder why a perfect child of God
should feel so desperate

612
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,351
to "purify his body" that he needed
to scarf down

613
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,270
a dozen gallons of water a day?

614
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,272
Boyd, is he right?

615
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:22,818
Dad! No, he's crazy! Help me!
Dr Wilson, help!

616
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,612
God said no medicine, no procedures.

617
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,323
Taking off your clothes doesn't count
as either of those.

618
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,825
This one's your call.

619
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,247
Son...

620
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,752
- Dad, you have to have faith in me.
- I have faith in the Lord.

621
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:44,923
You, I trust,
as much as you can trust a teenage boy.

622
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,761
Take off your clothes.

623
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,191
Relax.

624
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,818
A few Hail Marys, a little acyclovir,

625
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,196
you'll be picking up angels again
in no time.

626
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,091
Come in.

627
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,601
My father told me
I have to apologize to you.

628
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,063
You still hearing the voices?

629
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,818
You're lucky.

630
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,613
You go through life with a certainty
that what you're doing is right.

631
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,992
I know how comforting that is.

632
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,833
Good luck.

633
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,976
You're not gonna give me my final point?

634
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,562
You knew it was me?

635
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,480
Who else?

636
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,369
You don't think God should get
a point knocked off?

637
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,913
- The tumor shrank.
- Because of a virus.

638
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,239
Do you know what the odds are?

639
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,892
She had to have
the right type of cancer,

640
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,043
he had to have the right type of virus.

641
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,963
- The exposure...
- She won the lottery.

642
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,091
You say "won the lottery",
he says "miracle".

643
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,928
Yeah, the hand of God reached into
this kid's pants, made him have sex

644
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,348
so he could scratch a rash and stick
his fingers in some woman's face,

645
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,058
give her a few extra months.

646
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,478
Come on, he's just another liar
and manipulator.

647
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,939
Well, nobody's as perfect as you are.

648
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,904
It is possible to believe in something
and still fail to live up to it.

649
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,088
So, how's your girlfriend?

650
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,092
She got a little extra time out of this.
Not a lot.

651
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,178
She didn't crash.

652
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,097
No. She says she's happier when
she believes in something

653
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,933
bigger than she is.

654
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,018
She still believes.

655
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,479
Faith. She's going to Florence.

656
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,398
You moving out?

657
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,900
Yeah.

658
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,568
Moving back in with me?

659
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,240
I don't think that's a great idea.

660
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,285
But we're OK?

661
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,497
House, you are...

662
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,877
as God made you.
