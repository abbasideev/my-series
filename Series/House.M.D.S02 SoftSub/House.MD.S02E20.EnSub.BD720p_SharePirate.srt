1
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,348
Gosh! I guess he got away.

2
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,771
Can Baby Shoes come out to play?

3
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,360
Come on! Hands on your head.
Climb out.

4
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,450
I can't climb out
if my hands are on my head.

5
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,454
Just keep them where I can see them,
man. Come on.

6
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,256
- You high, popo?
- Yeah, man.

7
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,592
Catching morons makes me high.

8
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,011
Lift your shirt up by your collar
and turn around.

9
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,390
Would you look at that?
Dude's got a weapon.

10
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:46,564
All right.
You have the right to remain stupid.

11
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,191
Watch the gun.

12
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,485
Anything you say will be
completely incomprehensible.

13
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,447
- Seriously, man! Careful!
- Seriously, man? Seriously?

14
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,699
Does your mama know what you do?

15
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,456
Oh. It's sweet. Your dad's proud.

16
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,625
- You made the local paper.
- For my article.

17
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,545
Give it a rest. You read
what he wrote in the margin?

18
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,173
"Our friend Lazarus sleeps,
but I go that I may wake him up."

19
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,467
Yeah. He's not proud of me,
he's proud of Jesus.

20
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,386
Everything I do right is God's work.

21
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,305
Everything I do wrong is
my own damn fault.

22
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,809
Cop with a sense of humor.

23
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,937
Differential diagnosis.

24
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,439
Guy's in the ER, bleeding on everybody.

25
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,275
- Drugs?
- He's a cop.

26
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,485
Good point. How about drugs?

27
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,406
Tox screen was clean.
He did, however, get hit by a bullet.

28
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,408
Just mentioning.

29
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,494
- He was shot?
- No, somebody threw it at him.

30
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,539
I'm thinking trauma. He got
bullet fragments lodged in his brain.

31
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,584
According to Baby Shoes,
the cop was laughing before he got shot.

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,294
- Baby Shoes?
- The guy who shot him.

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,712
Reliable witness.

34
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,424
His name is Baby Shoes.
How bad can he be?

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,719
The fragments are in the wrong part
of the brain to cause euphoria,

36
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,387
so let's expand the search.

37
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,389
Factor in the cough
and the cloudy lungs.

38
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,391
Why are we ignoring
the elevated heart rate?

39
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,559
Because he's in shock.

40
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,895
What if the heart was already fast
before he got shot?

41
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,563
You mean after the foot race?

42
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,316
He's giddy.
Indicates a blockage of oxygen.

43
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,401
Carbon monoxide gas would elevate
the heart rate,

44
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,528
cause coughing
and impair neurological functions.

45
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,907
- He got CO poisoning outdoors?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,410
All 'cause those bastards
didn't ratify Kyoto.

47
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,872
Or he got CO poisoning indoors
and then moved outdoors

48
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,625
before he'd inhaled enough
to make him drop dead.

49
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,501
Test his arterial blood gas.

50
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,087
If his carboxyhemoglobin levels
are higher than 15%,

51
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,006
stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.

52
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,927
You go check the cop car for gas leaks.

53
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,012
If it was the cop car,
his partner would be sick.

54
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,599
Maybe she is, but just doesn't have
as good a sense of humor.

55
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,061
Also, check his personal car,
his work, home.

56
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,854
I'll check the precinct.

57
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,528
The blood test confirmed you have
low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.

58
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,031
We're putting you inside
a high-pressure chamber that...

59
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,700
You don't really care, do you?

60
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,619
Do you live near a gas supply?

61
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,082
Yeah, me. After, like, a huge enchilada.

62
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,007
Anything toxic you have at your home?
Any paint solvents, anything unhygienic?

63
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,512
No. No, I keep a pretty clean home.

64
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,922
If you have trouble breathing,

65
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,330
you can press this button
and the chamber will decompress.

66
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,470
- Like this?
- Not now. If you have trouble.

67
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,013
- It's broken.
- All right.

68
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,890
If you have problems,
we'll push it for you.

69
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,434
Muscle contracture.

70
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,270
- How bad does it hurt?
- Not at all.

71
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,981
Looks wild, though, huh?

72
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,984
Your brain's not getting enough oxygen.
You're losing motor function.

73
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,321
- We should start this right away.
- Should I be scared?

74
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,823
No, you probably have a
carbon monoxide leak in your place.

75
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,658
We have a guy there checking things out.

76
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,269
Sounds okay.

77
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,939
- How about the gas intake valve?
- Looks great.

78
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,233
It's down in the furnace room.

79
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,152
Your system's fine.
If you had a carbon monoxide leak,

80
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,570
half the force would be sick.

81
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,572
Then why are you here?

82
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,700
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

83
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,621
Yeah.

84
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,668
I've got a disability.

85
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,551
- These are speeding tickets.
- A lot of emergencies.

86
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,681
He's feeling better now,
but you never know.

87
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,977
I'll see what we can do.

88
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,609
Where does your partner sit?

89
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,283
The place is a cesspool, but I don't
think I need to test for anything.

90
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,326
Nope. Waste of time.

91
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,913
- You know about the marijuana?
- I've heard rumors.

92
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,040
The cop's acting high
because he is high.

93
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,459
- He's got...
- Legionnaires' disease.

94
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,253
It's a good thing Joe got shot

95
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,548
or the whole precinct would have gotten
wiped out. Anarchy on the streets.

96
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,508
It takes 48 hours to test
for Legionnaires'.

97
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,927
But only two seconds to recognize
that the symptoms fit

98
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,722
while staring at the rancid,
unchanged water of an AC unit.

99
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,601
Marijuana explains the high carboxy,
the cloudy lungs and the happiness.

100
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,770
Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's
gotten worse since he was admitted.

101
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,137
Why don't we agree to disagree?

102
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,472
Actually, why don't we agree
that you'll disagree with me

103
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,944
while treating him for Legionnaires'?
It's not as pithy, but...

104
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,324
I feel a lot better.
The meds are working.

105
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,536
Heart rate's normal.
COHb levels are down. No fever.

106
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,372
Take some deep breaths.

107
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
You seem disappointed.

108
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,503
I'm glad you're feeling better.

109
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,006
- You got a problem with cops?
- Please don't talk.

110
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,176
In my experience people who just don't
like cops have a reason...

111
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,719
I need you not to talk.

112
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,890
No rales.

113
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,101
These clouded areas
of the upper lobes,

114
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,978
they're the infiltrates we found
yesterday.

115
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,648
- They're not there anymore?
- They're clearing up.

116
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,776
You had Legionnaires'. Now you don't.

117
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,279
So, you didn't find anything
at my place?

118
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,701
Nothing medically relevant.

119
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,497
So there's nothing I need
to worry about, then?

120
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,290
Not this time.

121
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,921
What are you doing?

122
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,382
I want to make sure
he sees what's involved.

123
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,425
What we found was fairly advanced.

124
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,095
These cloudy areas here and here,

125
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,014
these parts of your lungs
simply weren't functioning.

126
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,183
But they're okay now, right?

127
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,896
Everything's okay now.

128
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,618
I'm fine.

129
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,456
You're blind.

130
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,419
I bumped into something.
That doesn't mean I can't see.

131
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,588
- I'm sure this is frightening, but...
- What's Doctor Cameron wearing?

132
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,845
Dark blue pants, white shirt,
black shoes.

133
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,348
Almost,
except for the pants, shirt and shoes.

134
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,641
You're blind.

135
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,687
He really thinks he can see?

136
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,023
He can physically see.
His brain just can't process it.

137
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,942
- No chance this is a practical joke?
- No way.

138
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,654
Anton's blindness indicates
damage to both occipital lobes.

139
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,861
It must be from the trauma.

140
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,075
Bullet fragments just happened
to hit the same spot in both lobes?

141
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,371
A stroke could cause Anton's blindness
and euphoria.

142
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,000
Officer Krupke is clotting in his brain.

143
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,295
Start heparin to thin the blood.
Find the clot and yank it out.

144
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,089
The clot would be at the top
of the bilateral vertebral arteries.

145
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,300
Great. Chase,
stick your fingers in there

146
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,885
and grope around until you find it.

147
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,969
Oh, wait.

148
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,721
When you turn him into a vegetable,

149
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,265
then there's going to be
frivolous lawsuits.

150
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,976
You know what would be better?
Contrast MRI.

151
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,144
Do we have one of those?

152
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,551
You can't do an MRI.
If the bullet fragments are magnetic,

153
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,086
they'll move and rip his brain apart.

154
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,984
Well, let's flip a coin.
Heads MRI, tails he dies.

155
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,029
Police-issue Kevlar vests don't have
the ceramic plate insert

156
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,075
that would shatter a bullet.
They would catch it.

157
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,597
So, the bullet shattered on its own.

158
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,868
Meaning Baby Shoes was using
.38 caliber hollow points,

159
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,954
which unfortunately are ferromagnetic.

160
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,045
It's just so cool that you know that.

161
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,047
We could do an angio
to find the clotting.

162
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,300
Waste of time.
The skull creates too much artifact.

163
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,843
We'll never get a decent view.

164
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,137
- It's the next best thing to an MRI.
- And a waste of time.

165
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,265
- An angio might show...
- Oh, God, it's a coup!

166
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,809
Fine, go do your angio.

167
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,145
When you're done wasting your time,
meet me down in the morgue.

168
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,984
We're going to snake a catheter
into your femoral artery

169
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,031
and up into your brain
so we can check for clots.

170
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,657
Keep this on throughout the procedure,

171
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,243
unless the pot's
already made you sterile.

172
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,829
I have a stressful job. You got no idea.

173
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,999
I grew up with cops like you.
One part bully, nine parts hypocrite.

174
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,802
- What is wrong with you?
- Just having some fun.

175
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,179
- The man is sick and scared.
- The man's a crooked cop.

176
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,390
Maybe you should take yourself
off the case, Foreman.

177
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,017
You don't have to like someone
to be their doctor.

178
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,436
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?

179
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,063
Just sit still
and we'll have you back out there

180
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,149
scaring the crap out of people
in no time.

181
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,151
Happy?

182
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,949
- What did the angio tell us?
- What are you looking for?

183
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,077
I called my mom. She didn't pick up.

184
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,037
What did the angio tell us?

185
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,914
That Foreman should be off this case.

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,541
He's a neurologist.

187
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,169
Unless you think the patient's
optic nerve is in his spleen.

188
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,837
He doesn't like cops.

189
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,966
Foreman, policemen are our friends. If
you and I ever get separated shopping...

190
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,594
- I was just busting the guy's chops.
- See?

191
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,387
He was just busting the guy's chops.

192
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,639
Foreman is essential
to solving this case.

193
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,975
Medically, what did the angio tell us?

194
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,941
There appears to be some clotting,
possibly around the circle of Willis.

195
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,565
Based on the progression of symptoms,
the clot is growing.

196
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,733
We need to cut into...

197
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,610
Saying that there appears to be clotting

198
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,695
is like saying
there's a traffic jam ahead.

199
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,741
Is it a ten-car pile up, or just
a really slow bus in the center lane?

200
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,495
And if it is a bus, is it
a thrombotic bus or an embolic bus?

201
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,183
I think I pushed that metaphor too far.

202
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,249
Angio can't tell us
that kind of information.

203
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,295
Oh, so you're saying
it was just a waste of time?

204
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,046
It gave us some information
without killing him.

205
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,923
You don't know that an MRI will
kill him.

206
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,674
The bullets have a ferrous base!

207
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,719
Little tiny pieces trapped in his head.
They're not going anywhere.

208
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,847
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery
to remove the fragments.

209
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,475
Surgeons say inoperable
and the patient's on blood-thinners.

210
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,935
Other than that, perfect plan.

211
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,604
- You got a better plan?
- Much.

212
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,822
The bullet's identical to the one
that Baby Shoes popped Joe with.

213
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,658
Let's see how magnetic it is.

214
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,992
Did anybody hear a...

215
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,995
I shot him. He's dead.

216
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,047
The bullet split into four fragments.
No exit wounds.

217
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,675
I only used a half-load of gunpowder.

218
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,512
It won't be exactly precise comparing
the locations on an X-Ray to an MRI.

219
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,848
How unprofessional was Foreman?

220
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,017
Ask him yourself. He's right here.

221
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,061
Worse than usual.
Better than you.

222
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,522
He berated Joe for being a bad cop.

223
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,983
Berated or humiliated?

224
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,152
I'm not sure.
I didn't have my thesaurus with me.

225
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,530
One implies that he took pleasure in it.

226
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,617
I want to know if it was repressed
black anger or just giddiness.

227
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,078
You think I'm sick?

228
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,165
I think that an appropriate response
to watching your boss shoot a corpse

229
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,709
is not to grin foolishly.

230
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,129
The fact that I've grown bored
by your insanity is proof of nothing.

231
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,633
Doctor Foreman,
Doctor Chase requests your assistance.

232
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,264
I can't even imagine the backwards logic

233
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,433
you used to rationalize
shooting a corpse.

234
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,060
Well, if I'd shot a live person,
there's a lot more paperwork.

235
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,938
Then it won't be a problem for you to
stand beside the casket at the wake

236
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,544
and explain why a cancer patient
has a bullet hole in his head.

237
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,319
The man donated his body to science.
Yes, it's a tragedy.

238
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,696
If I hadn't shot him, his body could
have spent the next year

239
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,407
letting first-year med students
use the carpool lane.

240
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,909
- He's set.
- Do not turn that on, House.

241
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,953
You're mad
because I put a bullet in his head.

242
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,164
At worst, all I'm doing now
is taking it out.

243
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,384
My bad.

244
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,195
They have to shut down the magnet
to fix it.

245
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,698
MRI is going to be out of commission
for at least two weeks.

246
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,079
Oh, it doesn't matter. We obviously
can't use it on this patient.

247
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,667
No, but there are other doctors
in this hospital and other patients.

248
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,753
That helps explains how they can afford
all the fancy equipment.

249
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm sure not pulling my weight.

250
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,090
Is doing nothing an option?

251
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,095
I'm just saying, maybe the clot will
break up on its own.

252
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,264
- The giddiness seems to have gone away.
- The blindness hasn't.

253
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,266
- Echo his heart.
- Looking for what?

254
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,976
The problem is obviously neurological.

255
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,938
The clots are in his brain.
The source of the clots may not be.

256
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,065
Do a complete
transthoracic echocardiogram.

257
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,151
Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are
coming from his heart.

258
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,868
- Heart's clean.
- Where else could we look?

259
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,371
We could ultrasound his legs,
look for a DVT.

260
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,917
I need you to move over.
Joe, are you okay?

261
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,503
Tachycardia. Heart rate 150 and rising.

262
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,797
Saline wide open. He's bleeding out.

263
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,084
House wanted to thin his blood.
He sure did a good job.

264
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,136
BP's crashing. He's going into shock.

265
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,430
Intracranial bleeding.
We need to relieve the pressure.

266
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,056
We need a surgical team.

267
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,020
- Foreman, get out!
- Boy, is he screwed.

268
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,774
We clot his blood, he dies.
We thin it, he dies.

269
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,237
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

270
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,619
Oh, man!

271
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,169
I'm not sick!

272
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,839
Did you hear the one about the guy
who bled into his brain

273
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,925
and had to have a hole drilled
in his skull to relieve the pressure?

274
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,093
Hilarious.

275
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,263
Someone laughs, they're dying?
That's absurd.

276
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,598
But not funny.

277
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,851
If I'm not sick, all you're doing
is locking me up with the source.

278
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,217
I'll get sick, prove you right.

279
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,392
If you're not sick, it's not contagious
and you've got nothing to worry about.

280
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,150
If you are sick, the two of you are
staying in here until we find out why.

281
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,611
So you might want to make friends
with the pig.

282
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,197
The good news is
I can finally get my MRI.

283
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,116
No, you can't! You blew up the machine!

284
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,578
Not the portable one, chuckles.

285
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,791
Chase and Cameron are bringing it
to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.

286
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,003
- Where are you going?
- To the office. Got work to do.

287
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,839
Eat your meals, take your temperature
every half-hour

288
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,966
and any meds I command you to take.

289
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,302
- So I'm just a regular patient now?
- No.

290
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,971
You get your own thermometer.

291
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,317
Check your blood.

292
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,905
Anyone with an elevated sed rate gets
to be Foreman's new roomie.

293
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,115
- He should be a part of this.
- He's a patient.

294
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,117
- He's not irrational.
- He's not objective.

295
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,286
He's got the most motivation to get
this diagnosed.

296
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,081
Right. You're not even friends with him.
Why would you care?

297
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,836
There is an area of increased T2
attenuation in the cingulate cortex.

298
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,673
- Kind of mushy.
- Cingulate cortex controls emotions.

299
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,802
This mushy spot explains the euphoria.
Question is, what's causing the mush?

300
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,429
A question you might want
to ask a neurologist.

301
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,349
Foreman is a selfish jerk,
but he's a neurologist

302
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,475
and he's the only one who's been in that
apartment.

303
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,522
This is why he shouldn't be here. You
wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.

304
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,567
If you think he screwed up at that
apartment you'd keep it to yourself.

305
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,777
- No! I...
- Well, we'll never know.

306
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,072
As long as he's not here,
he's just like any other patient,

307
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,449
which means we can dump on him
all we want.

308
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,078
What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?

309
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,330
West Nile
or Eastern equine encephalitis would...

310
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,082
Test Foreman's blood.

311
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,959
Given that he's the only one who got it,

312
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:14,462
person-to-person transmission is less
likely than some sort of deadly toxin

313
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,215
that Foreman picked up
in the guy's home.

314
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,217
Who wants to go next?

315
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,106
You're ready to sacrifice yourself for
a guy who doesn't consider you a friend?

316
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,192
He's just a patient, right?
It's the job.

317
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,028
Hey.

318
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,906
You don't have to go anywhere.

319
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,575
Joe's apartment is
right downstairs in the lab.

320
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,119
Foreman brought back
samples of everything.

321
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,998
What was that, "Who wants to go next"?
Some kind of test?

322
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,750
Don't worry. You made the right call.

323
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,794
Foreman stumbled
into whatever it is without knowing.

324
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,047
And he's way smarter than you are.

325
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,151
Ow! Damn, Chase!

326
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,405
- You suck at this.
- Sorry, it's this damned suit.

327
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,991
I can do it myself.
And I'll throw that out.

328
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,621
What'd the MRI show?

329
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,749
I can't be a part of the differential

330
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,751
and I can't even know
what the differential is?

331
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,337
You'd have told any other patient
what you found out.

332
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,344
MRI showed a lesion
on your cingulate cortex.

333
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,888
What's the thinking?

334
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,141
Toxins are in the lead,
viral's a distant second.

335
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,018
Do you think the lesion could be
an abscess?

336
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,938
It's just a small, soft area.
More mush than anything.

337
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,857
Was there inflammation in the lining
of the ventricles?

338
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,402
There was an increased signal there,
yeah.

339
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,032
- What are you thinking?
- Staph infection.

340
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,119
Toxins lead to neurodegeneration
which causes the lesion.

341
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,913
- Not without a fever.
- The cop had a fever.

342
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,359
Mine could be coming.
I could have got it directly from him

343
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,167
or a dirty dishtowel at his place.

344
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,836
Give us Ommaya reservoirs.

345
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:22,132
Deliver linezolid directly
into our brains, and we're cured.

346
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,221
Samples tested negative for toluene,
arsenic and lead.

347
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,472
What about the blood?

348
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,891
Negative for West Nile
and Eastern equine.

349
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,299
We have to go back to Joe's apartment,
get more samples...

350
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,188
No one goes back to that place
until we know what we're looking for.

351
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,316
Get some of that cop tape,
stick it over the doors and the windows.

352
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,318
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions.

353
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,237
The chance of infection is
next to nothing.

354
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,989
Yeah, I was never that great at math,

355
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,575
but next to nothing is higher
than nothing, right?

356
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,245
- It's not your fault he got sick.
- But it would be his fault if we did.

357
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,497
We should get a sample directly
from Joe's brain.

358
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,707
We can't do a biopsy.

359
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,710
There's too much edema from the bleeding
because you gave him heparin.

360
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,463
I don't think this is the time to be
pointing fingers.

361
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
I didn't give Foreman any.

362
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,261
You want to give Foreman a brain
biopsy?

363
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,139
Come on. Really, who doesn't?

364
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,270
This could be a simple staph infection
causing neurodegeneration.

365
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,605
Without a fever? Not a chance.

366
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,857
- Joe had a fever.
- He also had Legionella.

367
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,319
The mush might be forming an abscess,
and since there was inflammation

368
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,362
of the lining of the ventricles,
it makes sense.

369
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,948
The staph releases toxins,
causes neurodegeneration,

370
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,034
- causes the lesions.
- This is a waste of time.

371
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,536
We should put an Ommaya reservoir
in Foreman's brain

372
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,330
and start administering antibiotics...

373
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,217
If I'm going to be arguing with Foreman,
I may as well do it directly.

374
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,182
Kernig's sign, negative.

375
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,980
Brudzinski's sign, single positive.

376
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,949
Patient Joe Luria,
distal and proximal arm contractures.

377
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,492
Duration four seconds.

378
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,997
Staph infection most commonly presents
on the skin.

379
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,750
Most commonly?

380
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,378
You want to treat me
like any other patient, do it.

381
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:27,006
But the House I know
never uses phrases like "most commonly."

382
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,385
- You're not laughing anymore.
- No.

383
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,888
You think that's a good thing?

384
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,099
Sort of doubt it.

385
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,688
Staph would be in your heart, lungs,
spleen, liver or kidneys

386
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,189
before it gets to your brain.

387
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,941
Your organs are clear. It's not staph.

388
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,610
The infection could be limited
to a brain abscess.

389
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,155
Which I would have seen in your MRI.

390
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,200
Sign this so that I can take out
a piece of your brain.

391
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,414
Let me see the MRI.

392
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,543
- There was no abscess on the image.
- Let me see it, then.

393
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,297
I liked you better when you were jolly.

394
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,642
MRI was taken over an hour ago.

395
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,145
That soft spot could now be an abscess.

396
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,315
If it was staph you'd have a fever,
which you don't.

397
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,359
101.6.

398
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,279
What idiot gave you that?

399
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,617
Put the Ommaya reservoir in my skull
and treat me for the staph.

400
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,249
Triangle.

401
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,836
This one?

402
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,089
Circle.

403
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,301
Next.

404
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,138
Foreman, why aren't you answering?
Is there a problem?

405
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,557
- Square.
- Tell me your date of birth.

406
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,392
Is that House? Yeah.

407
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,229
- Next?
- Square again. Why is he here?

408
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,106
Because my neurologist is
having surgery.

409
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,775
I thought I was just another patient.

410
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,777
You didn't believe that crap, did you?

411
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,153
Date of birth.

412
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,989
The Ommaya reservoir is inserted
in the parietal lobe.

413
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,700
My spatial recognition is the issue,
not my memory.

414
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,955
Oops. Did you say Ommaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.

415
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,459
Hey, I'm just messing with your head.
Mother's maiden name, please.

416
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,212
Get out of my temporal lobe, House.

417
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,140
Hello?

418
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,895
Are you awake?

419
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,900
They told me somebody was sick like me.

420
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,194
I'm up.

421
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,116
Your voice...

422
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,369
Aren't you my doctor?

423
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,039
Not anymore.

424
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,501
You're the guy who doesn't like cops?

425
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,504
Yeah.

426
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,631
Can you see?

427
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,177
- You can't?
- Not a thing.

428
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,059
You've been blind a while.

429
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,147
The fact that you're aware of it now
could be a sign of improvement.

430
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,196
It hurts so much, doesn't it?

431
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,866
I'm okay.

432
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,243
It's going to hurt.

433
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,582
The morphine barely takes the edge off.

434
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,170
I'm going to die, aren't I?

435
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:56,174
You die, I die.
It's not going to happen.

436
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,176
Why not?

437
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,846
Are you just too stubborn to die?

438
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,806
They took a piece of my brain.

439
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,312
Whatever is wrong with us, they'll find.

440
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,320
Do you believe in prayer?

441
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:25,953
Not really.

442
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,875
Neither do I.

443
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,506
My dad always prays.

444
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,176
So does mine.

445
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you want to try it?

446
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,269
Try praying?

447
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,983
Okay.

448
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,295
- How is he?
- Still dying.

449
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,300
Well, you've almost mastered
another skill, though. That's good.

450
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,345
We have Foreman's biopsy results.

451
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,598
Non-specific signs of inflammation.

452
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,102
That's it?

453
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,480
I also swabbed for staph. Negative.
He's not even a carrier.

454
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,486
Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.

455
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,738
Yeah, there's that.

456
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,201
- Can I go to Joe's apartment now?
- No.

457
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:52,165
Go back to the lab and start retesting
all the samples that Foreman collected.

458
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,292
- For what?
- Everything.

459
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:58,171
Bacteria, toxins, fungus,
anything that likes to feast on brain.

460
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,299
- That's thousands of...
- Better hurry.

461
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,010
Cameron, suit up.
You're going to monitor Foreman.

462
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,346
He's on to hand contractures.
He'll be at Anton's blindness soon.

463
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,183
Run hourly checks,
because when he does go blind

464
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,430
he won't be able to tell us.

465
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,436
We'll use the data to construct a
timeline

466
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,354
so we can see how far behind Joe he is.

467
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,941
Why are you still here?

468
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,326
You're being cautious.

469
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,747
You're being common.

470
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,084
When you don't give a crap...

471
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,254
How many of your guys have caught
cancer from their patients?

472
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,300
Let me know when that happens,
then we can have this conversation.

473
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,427
It's just another case, huh?

474
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,514
I'll bet you can even have unprotected
sex with your cancer patients

475
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,182
without catching a damn thing.

476
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,310
Boy, I wish I had your job.

477
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,785
Biopsy showed nothing.

478
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,996
How can it be nothing?
You cut out a piece of my brain.

479
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,165
It's nothing personal.
We just didn't find anything.

480
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,042
Can you up his morphine, for God's
sake?

481
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,711
He's already maxed out.
20 milligrams per hour.

482
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,005
- What about toxins?
- Everything was negative.

483
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,341
There was a cupboard above the stove.
Did you see it?

484
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,219
I didn't check all the food,
but could be listeriosis.

485
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,346
I didn't go back. Follow right.

486
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,223
Who did?

487
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,058
House said we shouldn't go.
Too dangerous.

488
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,061
The answer's got to be in that
apartment. Not going is too dangerous.

489
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,564
- I'm sorry.
- You're thankful.

490
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,734
If House would've pointed at you instead
of me, you'd be the one in here.

491
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,654
Tell me when you can see the light.

492
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,074
It's your job to go back! You're
a doctor! You go where the disease is!

493
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,534
Say when you can see the light.

494
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,078
I'm dying and you're sitting here
measuring how fast I go?

495
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,581
- Tell me when you can see the light.
- My vision is fine!

496
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,307
- Your left-side periphery is reduced.
- It's fine! I'll prove it!

497
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,670
Ow! Son of a bitch!

498
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,091
Now we're both exposed.

499
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,969
You got two choices.

500
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,264
You can go tell House what just happened
and get your own cot brought in here,

501
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,850
or you can go back to that apartment.

502
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,854
You save me, the cop and yourself.

503
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,153
It's not SSPE.

504
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,448
I checked your past vaccinations against
Joe's. No batch matches.

505
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,700
Did the blood show antibodies
for Coxsackievirus?

506
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,953
Guys, can you please shut him up?

507
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,998
- He's over his limit on morphine.
- Where's Cameron?

508
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,251
She said she had some stuff to do.
Said she'll be back soon.

509
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,812
What are you doing?

510
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,191
Foreman!

511
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,824
Imagine being constantly reminded
of the pain you're about to be in.

512
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,242
I can't take it!

513
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,870
Just stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

514
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,416
Mainlining morphine into his carotid
could stop his heart!

515
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,543
So could pain-induced
stress cardiomyopathy.

516
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,587
Either the morphine kills him
or the pain does.

517
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,880
You're condoning this?

518
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,383
I'm certainly not going in there
to stop him.

519
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,929
I'm going to make you feel better.

520
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,453
Joe has a new symptom.

521
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,164
Hyperalgesia.

522
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,793
The infection's spreading
into the pain center of the brain.

523
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,884
Make it stop! Make it stop!

524
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,890
His brain is telling him
that his whole body is in pain.

525
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,518
Because of the location,
painkillers do nothing.

526
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,314
Suit up. Put the guy in a coma
before the pain kills him.

527
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,600
What if he used cedar wood
to hide the pot smell?

528
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,518
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.

529
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,229
- Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?
- No, but maybe...

530
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,689
Maybe what?

531
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,901
Maybe somebody could go back,
take a second look?

532
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,154
And why aren't you pissed off
that Cameron's playing hooky

533
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,198
while your life hangs in the balance?

534
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,852
Why doesn't anyone listen to me
anymore?

535
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,981
- I decided you were wrong.
- God, you're weak.

536
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,487
Guy steals your article,
tells you you're not his friend,

537
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,373
and you still want
to risk your life for him.

538
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,745
Foreman broke my skin
with a tainted needle.

539
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,705
- Wow!
- Yeah.

540
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,708
God, you're weak.

541
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,085
The guy tried to kill you.

542
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:15,798
First thing on my list of things to do
would be to stab him back, shoot him.

543
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,008
I've got a gun in my desk.

544
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,970
The last thing on my list would be
to lie to my boss about it,

545
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,972
and then give the bastard
everything he wanted.

546
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,891
I'm not here for Foreman.
I'm here to save myself.

547
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,063
Even with a needle stick, your chances
of infection are pretty slim.

548
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,274
That's why you're wearing a suit.

549
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,694
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.

550
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,740
What does that guy have to do
to make you hate him?

551
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,254
Give me the bag.

552
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,100
- Mildewed dishtowel.
- To re-test for staph.

553
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,227
What is that? Mouse droppings?

554
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,814
Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara.
It'd explain the blindness.

555
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,983
Now that I recognize as oven crud.

556
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,236
Could be meat with Trichinella.
It would explain the high fever.

557
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,072
What's with the rye bread?

558
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,450
Mold could be responsible
for ergot poisoning,

559
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,702
which could explain the contractures.

560
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,204
- There are three loaves.
- So?

561
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,336
You're going back in there.

562
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,258
A guy who lives on take-out pizza
does not buy three loaves of rye.

563
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,969
That's looking too far into the future.

564
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,889
Unless he cares about
something a lot more than his diet.

565
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,435
- Are you on the roof yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

566
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,772
- I don't see any birds.
- Whistle or something.

567
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,024
Do that "come hither" thing.

568
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,998
They came that fast
because it's their behavior pattern.

569
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,708
Joe's been feeding them.

570
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,044
Now look down.
Do you see a river of pigeon turd?

571
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,881
No. There's barely any.

572
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,716
It's not weird, it's cheap.

573
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,094
Joe's a guy who looks for the easy way.

574
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,763
Probably been stealing cable
from his neighbors.

575
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,641
Why not steal fertilizer
from rats with wings?

576
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,643
You see a shovel or a dust pan?

577
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,063
I found a scraper. It looks used.

578
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,107
Sitting on a bucket.

579
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,526
A bucketful of pigeon crap,

580
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,029
the perfect home
for Cryptococcus neoformans.

581
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,781
Yup.

582
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,075
Fungus enters the brain
through the sphenoidal sinus,

583
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,910
where it dances its triple threat

584
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,871
of happiness, blindness
and intractable pain.

585
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,666
Let's hope this experience teaches
our cop a lesson.

586
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,168
Don't cut corners
when you're growing your pot.

587
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,004
See you back home.

588
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,714
I was there.

589
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,632
I should have found it.

590
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,593
Yeah, you could have saved us
a lot of time.

591
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,222
Get me a flush of ampho B
and flucytosine.

592
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,182
I'll start us both.

593
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,686
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
I haven't heard from House yet.

594
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,563
Look at his EEG.

595
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,026
Theta band's been increasing steadily
since we put him under.

596
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,611
The guy's unconscious,
but still in pain.

597
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,448
Theta bands could indicate
at least half-a-dozen different things.

598
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,366
One of which is pain.

599
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,994
The fact that he's no longer screaming
makes us feel better,

600
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,871
not necessarily him.

601
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,292
Chase?

602
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,963
How's Cameron?

603
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,675
She's not giddy.

604
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,329
Fever's down. White count's improving.

605
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,124
Has she said anything to you?

606
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,503
You mean, like, "I completely understand
why Foreman did what he did"

607
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,130
and I hold no grudge?"

608
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:11,135
What I did, did save my life.

609
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,731
Get in here and help! Forget the suit!

610
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,609
He's tachycardic. Wide complex.
Looks like V-tach.

611
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,320
- It's not Cryptococcus!
- What?

612
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,156
House was wrong.
The samples were negative.

613
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,442
- What is it?
- We don't know.

614
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,616
Give him the amio.

615
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,785
- Do we have any more leads?
- That was our lead.

616
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,871
- Foreman!
- This isn't doing anything.

617
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,957
Foreman, he's in V-fib!

618
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,633
- No good. Hit him again.
- Come on, man. Come on, Joe.

619
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,219
Hit him again!

620
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,767
Give him an amp of epi.

621
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,734
Nothing.

622
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,530
He has multiple system failure.

623
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,578
Foreman!

624
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,919
Foreman.

625
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,714
Foreman!

626
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,633
Time of death?

627
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,967
No!

628
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,726
Time of death...

629
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,025
12:26 p.m.
