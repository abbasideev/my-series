1
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,400
Mummy went up to your bedroom,
but you were gone.

2
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,120
Do you remember what happened?

3
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,440
A man came.

4
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
There was a man in your bedroom?

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,600
He said it wasn't mine.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,360
He wanted me to go.

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,880
Where did you go, Isaac?

8
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,440
To the woods.

9
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
And how did you get there?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,640
In a car.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,160
Do you remember what the car looked like?

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,080
Black.

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,240
Isaac, what happened
when you got to the woods?

14
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,800
They left me.

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,640
Who left you?

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,880
Just stay here.

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,680
I'll find someone
to take the kid back to the station.

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
He remembers what people say.

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,440
It's like a photographic memory
but with words.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Can you remember
what else they said, Isaac?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,160
Keep the door locked.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,680
It's okay, she's coming back.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,960
You're okay.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,840
How about we listen to some music?

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,080
Who wanted to listen to music?

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
The man in the black car?

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Have you ever seen him before?

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,160
Could you tell us what he looks like?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Left these on the printer.

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,680
Thanks.

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,840
Not our case anymore.

32
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,176
MCIS know you're holding evidence?

33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,560
It's just personal interest.
Don't worry about it.

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not worried.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Here, take a look at this
from my fly-tipping hotspot.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
How did you get this?

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,880
Old colleague of mine
moved to MCIS a year ago.

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
He's my man on the inside.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,960
What about the other cameras?

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,760
Nah, wrong angles, didn't catch anything.

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,080
Must have spotted this one though,
got spooked.

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,000
Drove off in a hurry.

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
Lost a hubcap.

44
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,320
Can we ID the vehicle?

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
We can narrow it down.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,440
Rough shape, wheel size, tyre tread.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Might find something
we can work into your theory.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,080
What about MCIS?
What's their theory?

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Snuff films. Porn.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
Whatever Slade had goin' on in
that basement, our suspect was in on it.

51
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
But they had a disagreement.

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,840
Our man killed Slade,
starts workin' alone.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,440
Great.

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,360
Now work in Shane Fisher,
the dead dog, the watch...

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,616
The watch wasn't stolen,
the boy said he was wearin' it.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
Isaac hadn't worn that watch for years

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
and our suspect had
a picture of it on his wall.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
- Make sense of that.
- Don't have to.

59
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,200
It's not our case anymore.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
How many times you watched that?

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm just listening to music.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Right, silly me.

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,400
<i>Could you tell us
what he looks like?</i>

64
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,920
<i>Have you always believed
in the supernatural?</i>

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Define "supernatural."

66
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Clairvoyance, precognition,

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,200
you seem to have
a distorted relationship with time.

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
My perception of time
is better than anyone's.

69
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,040
You think you see the future.

70
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
I don't see it, I remember it.

71
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
And in this delusion of yours,

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
are you a time traveller
or a fortune teller?

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
Neither and both.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Do you know what I'm gonna say next?

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,760
"No more questions,
Mr Shepherd, you're free to go."

76
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,240
- That's funny.
- That's funny.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,320
Sorry, should have seen that coming.

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
What about those cuffs?

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,160
Did you see those coming?

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Eventually.

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,640
I knew you wouldn't give up,

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,920
not after what happened
with Aiden Stenner.

83
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,280
But you probably
don't want to talk about that.

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,320
I don't know
what you want me to say.

85
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,400
You could start by telling us
where Aiden is.

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
When did you last see him?

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,320
Saturday. No, erm, Friday.

88
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,960
So why didn't you report him missing?

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,680
He's not missing,
he's just not here.

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
He does what he likes.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,200
- He's 17, Kate.
- 18 in January.

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,920
But 17 now which means
it's still our job to look out for him

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
and we can't do that
unless you tell us where he is.

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Fuck sake, he's just staying with mates.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah, well what is he doing for money?

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,760
Kate, we need names and addresses.

97
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
You could try Mia Thomas.

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,760
Right. Who's that?

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Used to live downstairs.
They had a thing.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,240
- And where does she live now?
- I don't know. Ask her mum.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Number eight. I need a piss.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Oh.

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Of course you do.

104
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
I mean, whose case was this?

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,080
It's Karen's.
Look it's not her fault.

106
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
These last two weeks have been a mess.

107
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll have to tell my son
to stop getting kidnapped.

108
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Could you?

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,280
- 'Cause I got no idea how to do your job.
- You did fine, Rob, honestly.

110
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Thank you for stepping up, appreciate it.

111
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,360
If you need more time,
you know you should take it.

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
I guess she moonlights
as a birthday clown.

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,640
Mm.

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,760
Oh, nitrous oxide,
do you think she's got any more?

115
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I could do with a laugh.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Oi, are you taking pictures?

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
Why are you taking pictures?

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,896
- I'm talkin' to you.
- Calm down.

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,016
Why are you taking pictures?
Why are you takin' pictures?

120
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,240
- Stop.
- Are you fuckin' deaf or something? Oi!

121
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
Are you gonna calm down?

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,720
- Are you gonna calm down?
- Yes.

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes.

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,880
Fuckin' bitch.
I'm phoning the police.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,760
Are you all right?

126
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,200
How did you do that?

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,880
I have no idea.

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
Could you do me a favour?

129
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,960
Could you stay perfectly still
just for one second?

130
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Is it dying?

131
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Just needs some food.

132
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Bees are key to our survival.

133
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,640
Without bees, there's no crops.

134
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,960
No crops, no food.
No food, no us.

135
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,440
My sister's allergic to bee stings.

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,640
That flies off and sticks her,
it's on you.

137
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
It feels good.

138
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,120
It's only a small thing
but making one life a little better

139
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,800
without making something worse.

140
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,280
I ran over a dog two weeks ago on purpose.

141
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
Then I reversed over
its head just to make sure.

142
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
It belonged to a four-year-old girl.

143
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,720
<i>Hey, you still there?</i>

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Yeah.

145
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,400
<i>Sorry, I, I didn't hear
you say anything.</i>

146
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Well, I don't really know what to say.

147
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,800
It's a bit out of the blue.

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,640
We nearly lost him, Luce.

149
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
<i>I nearly lost him.</i>

150
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah, no, I know, I know.

151
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,200
Erm... And I get why
you've been ignoring my calls too.

152
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,040
And I fucked up.

153
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,400
<i>But I just... I wanna try again, you know.</i>

154
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
For him or for me?

155
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,240
<i>Both.</i>

156
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,960
I was thinking that, erm,
I was thinking we could all go

157
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,600
to your mum's old cottage,
just the three of us.

158
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,800
Uh, I've got people booked in.

159
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,040
<i>Well, cancel 'em.</i>

160
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,600
<i>Say there's a, a damp problem
or something.</i>

161
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
There is a damp problem.

162
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
Well, there you go.
You don't even need to lie.

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
Let me think about it.

164
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,560
Okay.

165
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,920
<i>- Bye Mike.</i>
- Bye.

166
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,800
- Hi.
- Sorry, I know it's late.

167
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,640
It's fine.
I thought you were back in the city?

168
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
I am.

169
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,280
I was. Erm, I wanted to give you this.

170
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,440
What is it?

171
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,880
Isaac's interview.

172
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,640
You said a psychiatrist
wanted to see the footage.

173
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,040
You said you couldn't give me this.

174
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,640
I can't.

175
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
So don't lose it.

176
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,360
And don't make copies.

177
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,720
Thanks. I won't.

178
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,600
And, erm, let me know
what she says, okay?

179
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,640
I will.

180
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
Do you wanna come in?

181
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,016
Actually I wanted to ask you something.

182
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
Oh, shit. Erm, uh, come in,
come in, come in, come in.

183
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,120
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, ah.

184
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,520
Yup, that's, uh, broken.

185
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Erm...

186
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, I mean...

187
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,800
This, erm,
this doesn't seem like a good time.

188
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
Well, it is not.

189
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,760
But you don't get to run away,
this is entirely your fault.

190
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,080
It was. I'm sorry.

191
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,200
You will be.
Now you have to make us dinner.

192
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,960
- Do I?
- Obviously.

193
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,120
- What would you like?
- I'm not fussy.

194
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Isaac likes lobster.

195
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,440
What did you wanna ask me?

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,080
Slade's house.

197
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,080
You say you guessed the code to his safe.

198
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,120
Uh, classical music fan,

199
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,000
1812, I mean, it's not much of a stretch.

200
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
And the violin?

201
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,480
You asked me if Slade kept
a violin above his stairs.

202
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,536
I'm sorry, I know this is probably
the last thing

203
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,320
you want to think about right now.

204
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
I remembered it.

205
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
So you have been there before?

206
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
No.

207
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,880
But I remember it now

208
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,400
and it's like...
the memory already existed

209
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,200
before... somehow.

210
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,840
What else do you remember?

211
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,840
Uh, I remember the house,

212
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,840
that awful room in the basement.

213
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,000
<i>Those two little girls
from the photographs,</i>

214
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,440
dead, being pulled from the water.

215
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,200
That didn't happen.

216
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Those girls are alive.

217
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
I spoke to them myself.

218
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, sometimes I remember it wrong.

219
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,880
Hello, sweetheart.

220
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,880
You okay?

221
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm cold.

222
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,960
You're cold?

223
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,640
Aw, come here.

224
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Oh, you don't feel cold.

225
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
Isaac, do you remember Detective Dhillon?

226
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
Hello, Isaac.

227
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,120
Manly handshake?

228
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Tap it.

229
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,280
Back, now three bumps.

230
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,440
One, two, three.

231
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,720
Explode it, hold it.

232
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,280
High five.

233
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,760
That is a very secret

234
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,800
policeman's handshake.

235
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,560
Don't tell anyone I showed you, okay?

236
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

237
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
You're my undercover officer now.

238
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
You need to keep an eye
on your mum for me.

239
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Make sure she doesn't
do anything dangerous.

240
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,560
Like try to cook dinner.

241
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,080
I've heard the best way
to get warm is hot chocolate.

242
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
Lots and lots of hot chocolate.

243
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,320
Okay.

244
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,320
Well, I tell you what, you can have
a hot chocolate if you lay the table.

245
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,480
Mummy is gonna get a takeaway
because she's useless.

246
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,480
Would you like to stay for a Chinese?

247
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,240
Oh, uh, I shouldn't, but thanks.

248
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
Are you sure?

249
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah, things to do.
Early start tomorrow.

250
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
How far is home?

251
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,640
Back in the city.
Hour or so.

252
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,240
You came all this way?

253
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
It's good to see you again, Isaac.

254
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,760
Look at that, got it in one.

255
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,040
Great work.

256
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Take care of your mum, okay?

257
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,640
Okay.

258
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,320
DI Dhillon?

259
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,800
- Ravi.
- Ravi.

260
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
Oh, I know I shouldn't ask you this,

261
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,616
you can tell me to piss off if you want.

262
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Piss off.

263
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
What is it?

264
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,200
I have this case at work, a kid...

265
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,400
well, he's 17.

266
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Aiden Stenner,
his mum hasn't seen him for days,

267
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,080
sounds like drugs.

268
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Right.

269
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,720
He has a friend, Mia, Mia Thomas.

270
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
Would you write it down?

271
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
And you've already reported this?

272
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,560
Yeah, I just don't know
how seriously they're taking it.

273
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,880
It's just a teenager shacked up
with his girlfriend.

274
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,680
So why are you so worried?

275
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,920
It's my job to worry.

276
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,200
I'll ask around,
see whose desk it landed on.

277
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,480
Maybe I can oil the wheels.

278
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,040
- Thank you.
- No problem.

279
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm sorry about your dinner.

280
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,440
You should be.

281
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah, wait for your plate.

282
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,920
If you keep picking there'll be none left.

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,160
It's comin', it's comin'.

284
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,880
Hold on.

285
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,160
Just wait, just wait!

286
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
You need to hurry,
she is really nearly done.

287
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,616
All right, here it comes,
here it comes.

288
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,520
- Smells good.
- I know. Get out of it.

289
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
A little bit.

290
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,976
Beef, you're not coming for my beef.

291
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
All right, bye, bye.

292
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,560
More? You've had
about a thousand as it is.

293
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,200
How many, how many do you want?

294
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
- Oh, you bloody prick.
- What?

295
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,520
Now, I see why you wanted
to use my car.

296
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,000
- It's inconspicuous.
- Bollocks.

297
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,320
You just worried about someone
keying your paintwork.

298
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,640
It's not insured is it?

299
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,080
Because this isn't
official police business?

300
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,280
You see, I know what you're doin'.

301
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,400
Relax.
We'll be five minutes, tops.

302
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,280
That's the way it works now, is it?

303
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,480
She says, "jump," you say,
"how high?"

304
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,360
- Who?
- You know who.

305
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,120
Mystic Meg and the demon child.

306
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,016
- Your fancy woman.
- She's not my fancy woman.

307
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,320
Fuck off.

308
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,880
What?

309
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,440
Do you live here?

310
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
Maybe.

311
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,880
We're looking for Mia Thomas.
You seen her?

312
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,120
Mia!

313
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,760
What do you want?

314
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,120
Are you Mia?

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,880
We understand
you know Aiden Stenner.

316
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Who are you?

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,800
He's not in trouble,
we just wanna make sure he's all right.

318
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,120
Are you police?

319
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Like I said, he's not in trouble.

320
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,720
Just your name on the lease,
is that right?

321
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Yeah.

322
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,040
Who's that lot then?

323
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,200
- Friends.
- A lot of friends.

324
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
Do they sleep over?

325
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,800
Are you all right with that?

326
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,600
Mia, shut the fucking door!

327
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,920
Aiden's not here.

328
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Don't.

329
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
Walk away.

330
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,240
That's cuckooing.

331
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,560
I bet my life on it.

332
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
How many guys do you think
she's got squatting in there?

333
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,160
Too many.
I don't like your chances.

334
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,720
I don't like her chances,
cooped up with scum like that.

335
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,256
They'll do worse than scratch your car.

336
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,440
- Come on, be clever.
- You're the clever one.

337
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
- We're not even supposed to be here.
- So what?

338
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,440
- What? We just ignore it?
- No. But we do this properly.

339
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll say we're following up
on an anonymous tip, okay.

340
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,880
I'll log it this afternoon.

341
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Hey, what you doing tonight?

342
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,800
Chilli con Carne.

343
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
Sod it.

344
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
Never been a fan of Bella's chilli.

345
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,360
Don't tell her I said that.

346
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,160
This is a nice watch, isn't it?

347
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,360
Did Mummy get it for you?

348
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,200
- It's broken.
- Yeah, yeah,

349
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,120
I can see the strap's broken, isn't it?

350
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Do you remember how that happened?

351
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,920
It got caught on the window.

352
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,360
Got caught.

353
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
Is that when you were
climbing into the house?

354
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Mm.

355
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,120
Mummy says
you don't normally wear this.

356
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Did someone tell you to put it on?

357
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,080
You just wanted to?

358
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Mummy likes me to wear it.

359
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,440
Wanted to make mummy happy?

360
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,560
Isaac,
how did you find the house?

361
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,160
I walked.

362
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
Who was in the house, Isaac?

363
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,160
No one.

364
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,640
So, you slept there

365
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,600
for two nights all on your own?

366
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
Oh, where?

367
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,960
On the floor.

368
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,080
So you slept there and then you left.

369
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Why did you leave?

370
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,800
I was cold.

371
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,720
He keeps saying he's cold.

372
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,240
He's never said that before.

373
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,120
I mean, he's been cold before,

374
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,400
I've heard his teeth chattering,
but he's never said it.

375
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,520
Like...

376
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480
Like it upsets him,
like he wants it to stop.

377
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,000
Isaac, do you remember
when Mummy found you?

378
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,040
How did that make you feel?

379
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
I don't know.

380
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,960
You know sometimes
we cry when we're happy

381
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,400
as well as when we're sad.

382
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,960
Is that why you cried,
because you were happy?

383
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,680
And do you remember
why you were happy?

384
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,600
She knew me.

385
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,840
What's in the sandwich?

386
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Fish paste.

387
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,760
Oh, it stinks.

388
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,920
- I've got extra.
- Oh.

389
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,880
Bella hates it, too.

390
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,040
Can't eat these at home.

391
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,840
Strictly a work meal.

392
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,120
What did she say about overtime?

393
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,040
What do you think?

394
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,320
Ah, I'll pick up some flowers
from the garage.

395
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,720
Get myself back in the good books.

396
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Should I do the same?

397
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,200
Dragging you out here?

398
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,520
Well, you hardly had
to twist my arm, did you?

399
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,640
That's somebody's little girl in there.

400
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,120
She's 20.

401
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
Still a kid.

402
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
You never wanted any?

403
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Kids, I mean.

404
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,560
We talked about it,

405
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,280
decided we had enough to worry about.

406
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,480
Happy just the two of us.

407
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,240
You?

408
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,280
Maybe. One day.

409
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,400
Need to find someone first.

410
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,240
Maybe stop spending
your evenings like this.

411
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,920
This is the job.

412
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,840
It's hardly
conducive to romance, is it?

413
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,800
Sitting in a car with some fat old duffer
eating fish paste sandwiches.

414
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,520
People probably think we're doggin'.

415
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,080
Oh, for fuck's sake.

416
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,920
Hey! What have I said?

417
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,600
Uh! Ah!

418
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,920
- Uh! Uh! Ow! Uh!
- Move!

419
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
I'll call it in.

420
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,840
Nick, wait!

421
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,360
This is Detective Ravi Dhillon,
we require immediate assistance

422
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,360
on Drakeford Lane, Matson Tower.

423
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,520
Hello?

424
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,680
Shit. Hello?

425
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,920
Hello?

426
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,840
If anyone can hear me,
there is an assault in progress...

427
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,400
- Police!
- Oh, for fuck sake!

428
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,280
- What is up with this...
- Move, man, move, man.

429
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,840
- Ow!
- Mia!

430
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
What do you mean?
I haven't done anything.

431
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
Mia!

432
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
Mia!

433
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,400
Oh, you fuckin...

434
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,880
Stay still, stay still!

435
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,640
Stay fuckin' still!

436
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,400
Still!

437
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,560
Stay still, stay still!

438
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,080
Get on your feet.

439
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,200
Get on your feet!

440
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,120
On your fuckin'...

441
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,080
So you like hitting little girls,
do you hey?

442
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,280
Huh?

443
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,560
Do you like hitting little girls,
you fuck?

444
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
Move. Move!

445
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Ah, you fuck!

446
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Fuck you, fuckin'!

447
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,040
C'mon, son!
Come on!

448
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
Let's see what you're made of, eh?

449
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,040
Come on!

450
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,800
Come on!

451
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,280
Fuck!

452
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,920
Do you know who the fuck we are?

453
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,320
- Get the fuck off me!
- You're under arrest.

454
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,000
- You're fucking dead!
- You don't have to say anything, but...

455
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,320
- Fuck off!
- Shut up!

456
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,800
- Fuck off!
- Shut the fuck up!

457
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,880
Hey stop it, stop, stop.

458
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,320
What's wrong?

459
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,600
Why were you doing that?

460
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,080
I don't know.

461
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,320
Were you having a bad dream?

462
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,520
What were you dreaming about?

463
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,840
He thinks this is his home.

464
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,560
Who?

465
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,240
I'm cold.

466
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,240
Oh, darling.

467
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,040
I'm sorry. I'll turn the heating up.

468
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,360
Oh.

469
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,280
We're not supposed to be here.

470
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,280
We returned to the property
at approximately 10:30 pm

471
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,000
hoping to speak to Ms Thomas again.

472
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,280
This was when we observed
a domestic disturbance outside.

473
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,640
Her attacker
grabbed her by the hair,

474
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,960
threw her against the wall,

475
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,200
dragged her inside.

476
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,520
No, I called it in.

477
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,680
DS Holness decided to...

478
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,360
investigate the disturbance.

479
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,560
In my professional opinion
there was an assault in progress.

480
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,760
An assault in progress.
That's my professional opinion,

481
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,360
at which point my partner acted without
any concern for his own well-being.

482
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,000
As we were the only two officers
on the scene, I made a call.

483
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,840
- He entered the property unarmed.
- Unarmed.

484
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,280
At which point he was met
with extreme resistance

485
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,680
from armed gang members.

486
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,880
They came at me with a knife,

487
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,360
- I picked up a crowbar.
- A crowbar.

488
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,600
No, it's not that unusual.

489
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,560
These people often
stash weapons on the premises

490
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,200
in case they're raided by rival gangs.

491
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,600
I got lucky.

492
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,880
As I said,
it was reasonable force.

493
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,360
He made the right call.

494
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,400
<i>I shouldn't have hesitated.</i>

495
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,320
Are we done?

496
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,800
Look, I know
she's been through a lot.

497
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,640
I just wanna ask some questions.

498
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,480
I won't be long.

499
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
Mia?

500
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,320
This lady's from social services.

501
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,280
Wants to talk to you.

502
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,320
You want a tea?

503
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,080
No, thank you,
I won't be a minute.

504
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Hi, Mia.

505
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,680
How you feeling?

506
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,520
Must be nice to be back
with your mum.

507
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,360
I wanna talk to you about Aiden.

508
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,400
His mum said you were close.

509
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,280
I don't know where he is.
Don't bother asking.

510
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,080
You know what these people
are capable of.

511
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,760
He don't want your help.

512
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,560
Well...

513
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,680
neither did you.

514
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,920
Look, I'm giving you a chance

515
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,160
to do the right thing here.

516
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,320
But we are running out of time.
We need to find Aiden today

517
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
before the storm.

518
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Erm...

519
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,280
Look, I know you're scared.

520
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,600
But you are safe now, Mia.

521
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,680
You can't promise that.

522
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
I can promise

523
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
that you are gonna regret
this tomorrow

524
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,880
when it's too late.

525
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,040
Okay.

526
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,680
Speed Kings.

527
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,320
There's an old go-kart track
on the Runford Estate.

528
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,080
If you're looking to score you go
and see the Speed Kings.

529
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,000
Pass me that brown one.

530
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,880
What's that supposed to be?

531
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,440
It's liquorice.

532
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,920
Liquorice?

533
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
Who wants a liquorice candle?

534
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,880
I'll tell you who wants
a liquorice candle!

535
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,160
Mary Dean of 43 Abbots Road.

536
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Well, there you go Mary Dean.

537
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,120
How many more of these
have we gotta do?

538
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,040
Four more orders,
then we'll start on dinner.

539
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,960
We?

540
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,760
- I'm missin' half a hand here.
- Rubbish.

541
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,000
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

542
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,120
Pass me a lemon one.

543
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,400
Careful, you clumsy sod!

544
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,320
Wounded in the line of duty

545
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,080
and this is the thanks I get?

546
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,360
I nearly died, you know.

547
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,760
Yeah, it does smell like lemon.

548
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Bella?

549
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,920
You have to stop.

551
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,560
I know.

552
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,480
<i>So, uh, what time you back?</i>

553
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,000
Not late.
Uh, I'm not sure, sorry.

554
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,160
No, it's all right, I'm just...
I'm glad you came.

555
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,160
I brought this in case
you wanna read together

556
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,160
or just stick the telly on,
whatever you want.

557
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,640
No, this is... uh, this is great.

558
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,320
And I got you some ice cream
for after dinner.

559
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,560
- Oh.
- He only eats the strawberry.

560
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
- Don't ask me why.
- That's all right,

561
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,640
it means that Daddy can have
all the chocolate bit. Ah.

562
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,440
Mm, I ate the chocolate,
you can have the vanilla.

563
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,400
What?! Vanilla?

564
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,400
Boring.

565
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,080
He has been smiling on and off.

566
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,120
Tell him one of your shit jokes,
he'll like that.

567
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,920
Uh, mm,

568
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,880
I don't know any shit jokes.

569
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,280
I know lots of excellent jokes.

570
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,440
You laugh at daddy's jokes, okay?

571
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,640
Bye, sweetheart.

572
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Bye, sweetheart.

573
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I'll see you later.

574
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,640
Mm. Uh, uh, just...

575
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,840
you like the new doctor don't you?

576
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,480
Dr Bennett?
Yeah, she's great.

577
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,840
Yeah, erm...

578
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,040
I was thinking maybe
I could come along, get involved?

579
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,480
Yeah. I'd like that.

580
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,000
Cool, okay.

581
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

582
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,560
So...

583
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
do you wanna cook or shall I?

584
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,280
Thought so.

585
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,360
Okay.

586
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,480
Two fish in a tank.
One says to the other,

587
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,760
"Do you know how to drive this thing?"

588
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,280
Do you know what a tank is?

589
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,280
You know with a big gun on the top?

590
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,040
You do, right. Okay.

591
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,360
Well maybe, maybe it's a bad joke,

592
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,880
but uh, you could at least smile.

593
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,760
Oh, okay.

594
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,640
Mummy says that when they found you,
you were crying.

595
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,320
Wanna talk about that?

596
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
I'm a good listener.

597
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,600
Got big ears.

598
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,120
See. Uhhh.

599
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,560
You really don't care
about anything do you?

600
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I mean do you,
do you even get tired?

601
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
Do you... you know, do you even get hungry,
do you even get thirsty?

602
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,880
Would you even care
if I took that away from you?

603
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,960
How about now? Hm?

604
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,800
Do you want this back?

605
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,160
Do you want it?

606
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
No, thought not.

607
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,800
Yo, pack it in, man.

608
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,640
Supposed to be low key out here.

609
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,160
- Are you Aiden?
- Who are you?

610
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,120
Aiden Stenner?

611
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,680
Don't know him.

612
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
My name's Lucy.

613
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,400
I spoke with your mum.

614
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,320
She doesn't know where you are,
she's worried.

615
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,240
For real, what are you,
like social services?

616
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Fuck.

617
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,160
You shouldn't sell here, not tonight.

618
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,880
Who says I'm selling?
I ain't selling nothing.

619
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,840
Okay, uh, look I will pay you.

620
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,120
I've got 200 in cash,
it's yours, no questions.

621
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,440
All you have to do is go home.
Just stay indoors.

622
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,360
Two bills, you know,
that's like pocket money.

623
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,560
- I'll go for 200.
- None of you should be here.

624
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,760
Ooh, be smart, yeah.

625
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,520
I am just trying to help you.

626
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,920
Why?

627
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,920
It's my job.

628
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,320
- Child protection.
- Shit, are you serious?

629
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,440
Do I look like
I need fucking protecting.

630
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,480
You don't need that.
Just go home. Please.

631
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,976
Why don't you just grab
the money? You've got the poker,

632
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,240
just fucking take if off her.

633
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,840
Yo, shut the fuck up, mate!

634
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't think you're a bad person.

635
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,160
No? Is that what you do, is it?

636
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,536
You decide who's good and who's bad?

637
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,120
You are 17, Aiden,

638
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,880
you've got your whole life
to look forward to...

639
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,600
What is this?

640
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,920
This ain't no fuckin' drive-thru!

641
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,680
Stay where you are.

642
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,040
What the fuck was that?

643
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,720
Who you callin'?

644
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,920
Oi, I said, "Who you callin'?"

645
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,360
Fuck this.

646
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,320
Put the phone down now!

647
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,760
You don't wanna hurt me.

648
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,840
No? Why's that?

649
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,120
'Cause I think I just saved your life.

650
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,800
Run home Aiden. Don't stop.

651
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,320
<i>This is DI Ravi Dhillon.</i>

652
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,056
<i>I'm sorry I can't take your call
at the moment.</i>

653
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,416
<i>For anything urgent, please contact
the Heart Valley Police Department</i>

654
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,200
<i>on 01632960555.</i>

655
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,360
<i>In 200 yards, turn left,</i>

656
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
<i>then you have reached your destination.</i>

657
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,800
This is DI Ravi Dhillon requesting
a PNC vehicle check

658
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,520
on registration November, four, three,
six, whisky, November, tango.

659
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,360
<i>Confirming.
November, four, three, six,</i>

660
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,160
<i>whisky, November, tango.</i>

661
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,320
That's it.

662
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,600
<i>It's not in the database.</i>

663
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,520
<i>It's all connected,</i>

664
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,440
<i>your dreams,</i>

665
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,840
<i>your memories,</i>

666
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,080
everything that happens,

667
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,840
everything that doesn't,

668
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,120
everything that will.

669
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,520
You, me, him.

670
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,760
Isaac.

671
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,200
I don't know what happened to your son,
Lucy, but I can guess.

672
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,320
- So guess.
- You won't believe me. Not yet.

673
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,960
Not until you're as crazy as I am.

674
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,800
So that's what this is,
you're going for the insanity plea,

675
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,080
avoid a prison sentence.

676
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,520
I really don't care very much
what happens to me.

677
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,360
Sooner or later
I'll find a way to kill myself.

678
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,856
If that's what you want,
I... I'm not gonna stand in your way.

679
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,400
I think you would.

680
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,880
You're a good man,
that's why this job never suited you.

681
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,080
You're not at home in the dark.

682
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,440
You pretend that you're not scared
but most days you're terrified,

683
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,240
lost, lying to yourself,

684
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,120
trying to play the action hero

685
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
but that's not who you are,
is it, Dhillon?

686
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,520
He's just turned off junction six.

687
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,800
<i>What road is that?</i>

688
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,000
I don't know.

689
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,440
Southbound?

690
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,720
Look it up and call it in.

691
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,160
<i>Are you sure
you wanna be doing this?</i>

692
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,440
We can't lose him Nick.

693
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,560
<i>What if he doesn't like being followed?</i>

694
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,840
Nick?

695
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,360
<i>I said,
what if he doesn't like being followed?</i>

696
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,040
He won't see me.

697
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,560
Oh, shit.

698
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,200
You there?

699
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,880
Put your hands on the car!

700
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,360
You're not supposed to be here!

701
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,640
You don't wanna do this.

702
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,920
Back away, Dhillon.

703
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,080
I've never killed you before
and I'd rather keep it that way.

704
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,960
Little bit further. That's it.

705
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,280
This won't end well for you.

706
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,280
It won't end well for anyone.
Not with Stenner alive.

707
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,320
What do you know about Aiden Stenner?

708
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,896
I could have put him
out of his misery

709
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,440
if she hadn't been there.

710
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,480
If you hadn't followed me.

711
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,480
Now somebody else is gonna die.

712
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,280
No one has to die.

713
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,440
Just put the gun down, let's talk.

714
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,560
We are talking,
but you're not listening!

715
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,240
You never do.

716
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
What are you doing?

717
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,040
Waiting.

718
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,440
Waiting for what?

719
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,440
<i>"I never killed you before,"</i>

720
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,920
<i>that's what you said to me,
that night in the lanes.</i>

721
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,800
"I haven't killed you yet,"
that would make sense.

722
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,120
But you said,
"I haven't killed you before."

723
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,520
You should have listened.
I wish you'd listened.

724
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,120
I could have stopped the chaos,
but now you blame me.

725
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,760
You blame me because that's easier
than blaming yourself.

726
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,760
Blaming myself for what?

727
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,640
What happened after the storm.

728
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,080
That's all I got.

729
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,800
Mia's place.

730
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,520
They're looking for you right? Police?

731
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,920
I dunno.

732
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,200
You see that makes me nervous

733
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,296
'cause we got three of ours in jail
right now, bruv,

734
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,120
so who you been talkin' to?

735
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,160
Ain't a snitch.

736
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,560
Mia says you want off the line.
Is that right?

737
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,840
- Man, I paid. I paid what I owe...
- I tell you what you fuckin' owe me!

738
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,560
What's that?

739
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,760
Nothin'.

740
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,360
Show me.

741
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
You use this?

742
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,720
I could. Like, if I need to.

743
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,800
Look, you wanna come off the line,

744
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,616
- you gotta make it right with us, yeah?
- Yeah.

745
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,880
Can't fuckin' hear you!

746
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,720
Yeah, man.

747
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,360
I'll make it right.

748
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,856
Well, that's music to my fuckin' ears.

749
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,520
You got a burner?

750
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,520
It's Tyler that brought you in, right?

751
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,416
You know that pig that fucked up his leg,
them locking him up like that,

752
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,960
fucking police
brutality if you ask me.

753
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,800
Think they can do what they like,
no comebacks but...

754
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,760
he don't know we got his name.

755
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,720
He don't know we got his fuckin' house.

756
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,520
So you, you're gonna make this right.

757
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,240
Okay.

758
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,640
Here you go.

759
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,760
Is...

760
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,320
that better?

761
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,280
If you get cold, you tell me

762
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,000
and I can switch this on for you.

763
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,696
Oh, I hope you're not coming down
with something.

764
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,520
- Do you feel okay?
- I'm cold.

765
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,560
I know sweetheart, I'm gonna
get you some blankets, hold on.

766
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,880
Hey Rob, what's up?

767
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,400
Kate Stenner's issued
a formal complaint.

768
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,680
<i>- Says you assaulted her.</i>
- You're kidding?

769
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,880
<i>I wish I was.</i>

770
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,160
Look, obviously I've given them
my side of the story but...

771
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,360
but they're gonna suspend you.

772
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,040
<i>Uh, pay you, I think,</i>

773
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,336
<i>just until they get it straightened out.</i>

774
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,440
I saved her son's life
and she's got no idea.

775
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,320
<i>What do you mean?</i>

776
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,600
Nothing.

777
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,360
Doesn't matter anymore.

778
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,360
Erm, thanks for telling me, Rob,
I appreciate it.

779
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,280
<i>Look we'll talk tomorrow.</i>

780
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,520
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

781
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,440
Yeah.

782
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,160
Uh, goodnight, Rob.

783
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,640
Okay, let's get you tucked up and warm...

784
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,200
Isaac, what you doing?
Don't do that, it's hot.

785
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,920
No, no, no, no, no, sweetheart!

786
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,960
- I'm cold.
- Oh, my God.

787
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,760
Why are you laughing?

788
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,360
It's not funny.
Isaac, why are you laughing?

789
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,640
Two fish in a tank,
one says to the other,

790
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,280
"Do you know how to drive this thing?"

791
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,680
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

792
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,120
I'm serious.

793
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,400
You, write a book?

794
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
Takes you about two days
to write a bloody e-mail.

795
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,240
I've got stories, you know.

796
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,240
You've got pub stories.

797
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,640
Sorry, but you'll have to do
better than that.

798
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,000
What about security?

799
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,880
Mm, they work nights
and it's dangerous.

800
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,920
Who knows.

801
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,080
Maybe I'll be a bloody taxidermist.

802
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,240
Mm, come here.

803
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,120
You know, you don't have to do anything.

804
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,240
I'm not old enough to retire.

805
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,000
And we'd have to take a hit
on the pension.

806
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,400
- Bella?
- Shh.

807
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,520
- What was that?
- What was what?

808
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,880
I don't know.

809
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,080
Did you lock the back door?

810
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,360
Probably.

811
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,760
Probably or definitely?

812
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,680
Yes. Now come on,

813
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,640
I'm tired, let's go to sleep.

814
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,440
I love you, Nick Holness.

815
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,400
I love you too.

816
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,920
Mm.
