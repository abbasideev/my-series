Isaac.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Isaac!

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
What's wrong?

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,256
- Isaac's gone.
- What?

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
Someone's been in the house.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,440
Isaac!

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
Isaac!

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,960
Standing in the road screaming his name.

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,640
You were still there?

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
I was worried about you.

44
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,160
Nothing compares to the fear
of losing a child.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,856
The questions that must thunder
through your head.

46
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
Is he alive? Is he in pain?

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,000
I wanted... I wanted to help you.

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,360
I wanted... I wanted to tell you.

49
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
Tell me what?

50
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
I never touched your son.

51
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,880
You said you would tell me the truth.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,520
You said if I came here,
you would explain everything.

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm explaining.

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
No.

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
You're full of shit.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
We know it was you.

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,920
They know it was you.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,320
Based on what evidence?

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,800
You were obsessed with Isaac.

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
You...

61
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,080
his name was all over your, uh, plans.

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,120
He's a... he's a special boy.

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,240
What the fuck does that mean?

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,976
Don't leave. Don't leave.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Please, please.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,200
Don't let him bait you.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
That's why you interrupted us?

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,136
- You need a break.
- No, I need an answer.

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
By rights, you shouldn't even be in there.

70
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,120
- If he tries something...
- He won't.

71
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,800
If something happens to you.

72
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
It won't.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Ravi, it's okay.

74
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm okay.

75
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
Take a minute.

76
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
And when you go back in there,
I'm coming with you.

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,680
He won't like that.

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Good.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,520
Ravi, thanks.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
I haven't done anything.

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,360
You trusted me.

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
Not a lot of people would have.

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,280
I'm just... I'm glad it was you.

84
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm glad you got assigned the case
and not someone else.

85
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm not.

86
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,720
Miss Chambers...

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,520
let's talk downstairs.

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you mind if I record this?

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
We've activated child rescue alert.

90
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,720
With any luck, we'll have Isaac's picture
on every front page by the morning.

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,600
We've got roadblocks,
officers going door to door.

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
And we're checking local CCTV.

93
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,081
Whoever this man is,
he's not gonna have anywhere to hide.

94
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
I can promise you that.

95
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
Is he gonna...

96
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm sorry?

97
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
Is he gonna hurt him?

98
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
It's her job, it has to be.

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Some psycho had his kid taken away
and now he's just returning the favour.

100
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Maybe, we've got people
looking into old cases.

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,480
Disputes, grievances,

102
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,880
if there's a link, we'll find it.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000
Will you?

104
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,640
'Cause her name was written on his wall
and you didn't do anything about it.

105
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,760
We were looking for Lucy Chambers.

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
That's not your name, not on paper.

107
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
It's not an excuse,
it's just an explanation.

108
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,280
We were too late.

109
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
And I can't tell you
how sorry I am for that.

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,376
But right now,
our best chance of finding Isaac

111
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,840
is to identify the man who took him.

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
You knew one of his victims.

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,640
Shane Fisher.

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,160
What about Harold Slade?

115
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
He should kill himself.

116
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm sorry?

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Harold Slade.

118
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,160
Harold Slade is dead, Miss Chambers.

119
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,840
Are you saying you knew him?

120
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,360
I don't know.

121
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,880
She's in shock and you're not helping.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,376
You should be out there looking for him.

123
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,160
We've got people looking, Mr Stevens.

124
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,760
If we ID the suspect, we can make sure
they're looking in the right places.

125
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
Do you need to take a break?

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Now, these aren't easy to read but...

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,840
Isaac's name comes up several times.

128
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
What does it say?

129
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,160
We think this one says,

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
"Isaac is unbound."

131
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,856
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

132
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,520
He might be quoting scripture.

133
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,400
In the Bible, Isaac was bound
to a sacrificial altar by his father.

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,720
That's Isaac's watch.

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,320
Why...
why has he drawn Isaac's watch?

136
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,880
You're sure this is his watch?

137
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,480
It was here, it was in this bag.

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,096
No chance
he could have been wearing it?

139
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,160
No, he never wore it, right?

140
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,880
It doesn't work anymore.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
Anything else missing?

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,840
Not that I can see.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
Why would he take his watch?

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,040
That has to mean something, doesn't it?

145
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,280
If he just wanted to hurt him,
he wouldn't take something like that.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
It's the press office again.

147
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
Okay.

148
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm gonna need a recent photo of Isaac.

149
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
Clear, high res.

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,856
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to get his face

151
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,840
on TV, social media, newspapers,

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
but everything else
stays between us for now.

153
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
What do you mean?

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Harold Slade, Shane Fisher,

155
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,616
we don't want that connection
going public, not yet.

156
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Why?

157
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,496
If we keep the story
focused on Isaac,

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,080
we have a better chance of finding him.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
You okay over there?

160
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Sylvia, is it too hot for you?

161
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,480
Shush.

162
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,640
We're watching the quiz.

163
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
These girls haven't a clue.

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
It's Henry VIII.

165
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,840
See? Told you.

166
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
You didn't know.

167
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,640
You let me know
when you're ready for your pudding.

168
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
- What's for pudding?
- Apple crumble.

169
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Nah.

170
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
I missed that one.

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,216
Is there anything else
you need me to do while I'm here?

172
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Butterfly.

173
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
Butterfly.

174
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,640
No. Oh.

175
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Oh.

176
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,360
It's butterfly.

177
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
She doesn't know.

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
I'll stick it on for you.

179
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,680
No, don't change the channel.

180
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,400
It's all right, I'm just popping it on.

181
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,600
<i>We asked which of these insects
is also the name of a swimming stroke.</i>

182
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,360
<i>You're saying mosquito?</i>

183
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,920
<i>I'm afraid the correct answer
is butterfly.</i>

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,360
<i>So that means Stacey steals the jackpot
which now stands at £720.</i>

185
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
See? Told you.

186
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
Butterfly.

187
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
She didn't know.

188
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,720
<i>Thirty-two comments,
two likes, one wow,</i>

189
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,280
fourteen sad faces.

190
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,760
Sad faces.

191
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,040
Fuck, I hate Facebook.

192
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,400
What you doing?

193
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
Working.

194
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Seriously?

195
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Come on.

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
Well, what else am I supposed to do?

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,760
You can go to bed. Come on, come on.

198
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,496
- Whatever you're doing, it can wait.
- It can't.

199
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
- Yes, it can. Come here, Lucy.
- Mike.

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,200
- Come on, come on.
- Mike.

201
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,336
- Yes, you can. Come on.
- Mike. stop it. Stop.

202
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
I don't know what to do.

203
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Hey, it's okay. All right.

204
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Okay.

205
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,280
Okay.

206
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Shh.

207
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
It's okay.

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,600
Come on. Let's just go to bed, eh?

209
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Mike.

210
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
- Mike.
- What?

211
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,280
What are you doing here?

212
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,360
Our son's missing.

213
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,720
Oh, so he's our son now?

214
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
You don't love him,
you don't spend any time with him.

215
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,240
- Okay, yeah, all right, Luce.
- No, no, no,

216
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
you don't get to do this.

217
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,440
You don't get to comfort me.

218
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,960
What happens if he walks
through that door right now?

219
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
What happens then?

220
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,416
Are you gonna wrap your arms around him?

221
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,480
- Are you gonna tell him it's okay?
- Luce,

222
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,520
I am scared just the same as you are.

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,696
No, you're not, not like me
because I love him and he's gone.

224
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,760
And it's not your place
to hold me and say,

225
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
"Oh, let's go to bed,"
like it's your bed because it's not!

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
I do not need that from you right now!

227
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay!

228
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Fuck.

229
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,936
I'll sleep in the living room.

230
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
No!

231
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,680
Just go home.

232
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Please.

233
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,640
Fucking hell.

234
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,080
Nick?

235
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
What are you doing here?

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
Working.

237
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,480
Well, trying to.
This bloody thing keeps crashing on me.

238
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,936
You left
the evidence room unlocked.

239
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah, sorry.

240
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
Everything all right?

241
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,080
Don't think I've ever seen you
in here before 8:00.

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,840
Someone took a kid.

243
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,480
We're in the first 24.
You really think I'll be having a lie in?

244
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
That's not what I meant.

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,520
You know, Bella didn't think
I'd make detective.

246
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,840
Says I couldn't spot a pattern
in a pair of curtains.

247
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,520
Sometimes I think she's right.

248
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
We're relying on your brain here.

249
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,280
So tell me, what am I missing?

250
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,080
No real link between the victims.

251
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,400
Different crimes, different motives.

252
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,400
Case could be ten years old at least.

253
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,320
There's no pattern, Nick. It's just chaos.

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,320
Well, here's someone else
to add to the chaos.

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Fly tipping report.

256
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Someone's been dumping their crap
in the ravine there.

257
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,576
Report says it's been going on for years,
they never caught the bastard.

258
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
But then a couple of weeks ago,
a ranger spotted a car and called it in.

259
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
Description's consistent
with our red Nissan.

260
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Who followed up?

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,040
Courtney and Dorse.

262
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,440
Wasn't a hell of a lot to go on but...

263
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,680
You said...

264
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,840
You said, right that some of these...

265
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
- some of these could be maps.
- Mm.

266
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Well, this one here
matches the road configuration.

267
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,896
You see that line there that sort of vein?

268
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,680
- Mm-mm.
- And the shading.

269
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Well...

270
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,720
that's the woods, isn't it?

271
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
Or am I seeing things?

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,080
If you are,
then I'm seeing them too.

273
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,240
<i>I'm sorry,
I don't know why I came here.</i>

274
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,440
Uh, I... I saw we had an appointment and...

275
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,120
I just got in the car and drove.

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,280
That's okay, it's okay.

277
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,400
You have to trust the police, okay?

278
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,760
And honestly, the best thing
you can do for Isaac right now

279
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,960
is to take care of yourself
so you can be there for him if he...

280
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,440
If they find him.

281
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,600
When.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh, um, I know something.

283
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,520
Harold Slade, I... I...

284
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,080
I read his name in the paper
and I remembered it.

285
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,880
I know that that name
means something to me.

286
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
Or maybe you just want it
to mean something.

287
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,400
Please don't do that.
I didn't come here for therapy.

288
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,320
So why are you here then?

289
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,720
You want the name Slade
to mean something so you can act.

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
You can help.

291
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,040
Being powerless in all of this
that... that is the scariest thing.

292
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,440
When you heard Slade's name,
you wanted to feel a connection.

293
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
But it's... it's more likely just déjà vu.

294
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,560
We have two ears, two eyes,
a right brain and a left brain.

295
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,560
And when one half of the brain
processes information

296
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
faster than the other.

297
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,560
We are experiencing
and remembering the moment

298
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,560
at the same time.

299
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,920
Which is why we sometimes feel like
we've done something before,

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,240
or we think we recognize a stranger.

301
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,240
Harold Slade has a violin
above his stairs in the hallway,

302
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,440
so which side of my brain
is telling me that?

303
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
It could have been something
you overheard,

304
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,760
or saw on the news,
or maybe something the police told you.

305
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I...

306
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,280
Maybe it was another memory

307
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,520
that you have linked
with the idea of Harold Slade.

308
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,320
I know him.

309
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I know that I know him.
I have to tell the police.

310
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,400
Tell them what?

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,920
Lucy, what do you think they're gonna say?

312
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
Have you slept?

313
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,920
Uh...

314
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,960
You need to go home and rest.

315
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,560
I'm here if you need me
and anything I can do to help.

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,560
Temazepam?

317
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,440
Sorry?

318
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,320
A few years ago,
I had a prescription for temazepam,

319
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,976
but it didn't, um...
didn't stop me waking up.

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,960
But it... it... it helped me
settle down again.

321
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
You're right. I, um...

322
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,560
I really need sleep.

323
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
I need to clear my head.

324
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,880
Temazepam won't help clear your head,
trust me.

325
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,560
Oh, you said you could help me.

326
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
So help me.

327
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
Some of this stuff is old.

328
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,680
Really old.

329
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,240
Serial killer, serial fly tipper.

330
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,720
It's a gateway crime.

331
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,080
See, first off,
you dump a washing machine in some woods.

332
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,456
Then you stab a couple of people.

333
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,920
And the next thing you know
you're... you're snatching kids.

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,320
Sorry.

335
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,640
I might have been wrong before
when I said there was no link.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
What if there is?

337
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,160
What if it's her?

338
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,760
Lucy Chambers?

339
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,680
She's Chloe Fisher's case worker.

340
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,880
- Yeah.
- Isaac's mother, obviously.

341
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Her name was written
on the suspect's wall.

342
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,416
And she might have known Harold Slade.

343
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh, she doesn't know what she knows.

344
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
She's unstable as you would be.

345
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,920
But if she does, if there is a link
then she connects every victim.

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Except for Jonah Taylor.

347
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,896
And what? What about this lot?

348
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,200
What are you trying to tell me
that... that that's her old fridge,

349
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,640
and that, that's a pair of
her old curling tongs?

350
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
- Nick?
- I'm just saying.

351
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,440
Can you smell that?

352
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
It's a dog.

353
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,160
Debs?

354
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
What're you doing?

355
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,840
It could have been us.

356
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,920
Did you lock the back door?

357
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,160
Nobody's getting in this house.

358
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,400
They'd have to get past me.

359
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,640
Go away.

360
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Leave me alone!

361
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,840
Oh!

362
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,040
Oh!

363
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,040
Oh.

364
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,456
Pack of cigarettes, please.

365
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
What kind?

366
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,200
Don't care.

367
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,400
- That's twelve ten, love.
- Thanks and a lighter.

368
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
You starting up again?

369
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
First time.

370
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,440
Shit.

371
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Oh.

372
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Hello?

373
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,800
Hi.

374
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Are you all right?

375
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,400
<i>Miss Chambers?</i>

376
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,160
It's been over 24 hours.

377
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,800
<i>I know.</i>

378
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
<i>We spoke to your husband earlier.</i>

379
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>I'm afraid there's been no update.
Nothing concrete.</i>

380
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,160
Mm, he's not my husband, not anymore.

381
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Okay.

382
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,560
Um, can I ask you a question?

383
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,640
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

384
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,520
Are you religious?

385
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Uh, no, not really.

386
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,920
<i>What do you believe in?</i>

387
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
I don't know.

388
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,040
Science, I guess.

389
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Logic, patterns.

390
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,040
<i>What about the other stuff?</i>

391
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,600
<i>Other stuff?</i>

392
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
Ghosts...

393
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,920
uh, fate, miracles, luck...

394
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,440
love.

395
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,720
I've never seen a ghost.

396
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,400
<i>Have you?</i>

397
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,760
I don't know.

398
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,560
Sorry, I know it's really late.

399
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
I probably woke you up.

400
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
<i>No, no, you didn't.</i>

401
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,000
<i>I wouldn't mind if you did,
but you didn't.</i>

402
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,880
Thanks.

403
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
- Detective Dhillon.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

404
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,480
<i>Can I ask you one more question?</i>

405
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
Uh-huh.

406
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
Did Harold Slade
have a violin above his stairs?

407
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,560
Sorry I'm a bit late.

408
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,000
Sylvia why is the door open?

409
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,000
Sylvia?

410
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,080
Oh, you don't have to turn it off.

411
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,560
Oh, Harold loved Tchaikovsky.

412
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,760
Well, it's very beautiful.

413
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,440
Is it?

414
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,840
I still can't hear it.

415
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,760
I was going to take him
to see <i>Swan Lake </i>for his birthday,

416
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,840
in Prague.

417
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,120
I booked the tickets without him knowing,
but I think he suspected.

418
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Couldn't get anything past him.

419
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
Well, you know what he was like.

420
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
How did you know him?

421
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,440
Sorry?

422
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,880
My husband he...
he never mentioned you.

423
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,520
The rowing club.

424
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,640
My... my son was on the team.

425
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,960
We couldn't make the funeral so I just...

426
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,480
I just wanted to pay my respects.

427
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,280
What's your son's name?

428
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,400
Isaac.

429
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,280
Isaac, and he's in the rowing club?

430
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,360
He was, he used to be.

431
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,280
- We moved.
- Really?

432
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,000
- When was that?
- Last year.

433
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,160
This is really embarrassing
could I use your loo?

434
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,640
Uh, yes, I... I suppose so.

435
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,136
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

436
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,520
Um, upstairs third on the right.

437
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,680
Okay.

438
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,400
Dogs name was Milo, a Doberman.

439
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,880
Forensics tell us
he was probably run over.

440
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,976
We've contacted the owners,
they don't know anything

441
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,480
just that he's been missing
for a few days.

442
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,160
Other than that
nothing out of the ordinary.

443
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,160
As you know we impounded the Nissan
over two weeks ago

444
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,200
with a flat tyre and a buckled wheel.

445
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,360
We have to assume the suspect
has another means of transport.

446
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,880
So, first priority

447
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,480
is to identify the new car
so that we can track it down.

448
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,601
We've hidden some cameras
in the woods where the dog was found.

449
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,600
Working theory is he comes and goes,
so he'll be back.

450
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,560
<i>Miss Chambers.</i>

451
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,280
Write this down,

452
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,040
<i>Turnpike house,
Paintmoor Lane, North Tamford.</i>

453
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,640
<i>I think Harold Slade had a pseudonym</i>

454
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,960
and he... he used it
to buy a... a property near here.

455
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm gonna send you
some pictures, um, documents.

456
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,480
What documents? Where are you?

457
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,040
<i>They were in his safe.</i>

458
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
His safe?

459
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,760
I knew the code 1812.

460
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,120
It was 1812 like the overture.

461
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,440
I'm sorry I'm not sure
what you're telling me.

462
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
He should have killed himself.

463
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,480
Who, who should have killed himself?

464
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,160
Slade had secrets.

465
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,560
Look, I don't know what this is.

466
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,880
<i>I just know it's important.</i>

467
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,880
Um, Turnpike House, Paintmoor Lane.

468
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,480
<i>I will meet you there, okay?</i>

469
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,480
<i>Hello?</i>

470
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,240
Miss Chambers, I need you
to stay away from that house.

471
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,360
Have you got the address?
Read it back to me.

472
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
Turnpike House,
Paintmoor Lane, North Tamford.

473
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,801
- Good. All right. I'm heading there now.
- No you're not.

474
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,920
Listen to me, you need to take a breath,

475
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,896
go home and let us do our jobs.

476
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,120
We can...

477
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
shit.

478
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,760
Ellen, what's up?

479
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,120
What? What do you mean? Where is she?

480
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,400
Oh, fuck.

481
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Not today.

482
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Fuck it.

483
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,320
Ellen, listen to me.

484
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,680
No, you don't need to call the police...

485
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
because I know where she's going.

486
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
Mum...

487
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,560
what are you doing here?

488
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,680
Oh, God, you're freezing.

489
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,040
We need to get you back, okay?

490
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,280
- Will you come with me?
- Mm?

491
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,680
Oh, God, I can't do this today, I can't!

492
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,640
If you can't stay put
you will have to live somewhere else.

493
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,920
Do you understand?

494
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm not chasing you up here again.

495
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,760
You look like my daughter.

496
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah, I know.

497
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You were the one on the telly.

498
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,560
Talking about those girls.

499
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
Mum, please, please
let's go back to the car.

500
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,440
I think...

501
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,800
you must be a very good person.

502
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,560
Will you sit with me?

503
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,160
And watch the ghosts.

504
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,120
Why here? Why do you come here?

505
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,640
It's beautiful.

506
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
Yeah.

507
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,360
Oh.

508
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
Oh, my darling.

509
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,440
Don't cry.

510
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,000
What's wrong?

511
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,320
You can tell me.

512
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,480
Oh, somebody took Isaac away.

513
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,440
He's gone.

514
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,160
Who's Isaac?

515
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,480
My son.

516
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,760
Mum, they've taken my boy away.

517
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
It's okay, you'll find him.

518
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,520
You haven't given up.

519
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,160
That's what you said, on the telly.

520
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,800
You remember, don't you?

521
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
I've never been on the telly, Mum.

522
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,160
I don't want to go.

523
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,760
I know.

524
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,640
But we have to.

525
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,640
I'm sorry.

526
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,760
Ready?

527
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,560
I can do it.

528
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,440
Right, let's get you warmed up.

529
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Oh, that's lovely.

530
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Are we going home?

531
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,040
Not yet.

532
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
Who'd buy a place like this?

533
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,960
Well, it's a fixer upper.

534
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,200
Could be nice.

535
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,160
Gut it, do it up.

536
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,200
If you got the time and the money
you could turn the profit.

537
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
Doesn't explain the fake name of course.

538
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,640
If this was Slade's,
no one knew about it, not even the wife.

539
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,800
I've got pictures of the deeds.

540
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,480
If we tie this to the case we can get...

541
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,040
a warrant.

542
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,760
Need a warrant anymore?

543
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Nick.

544
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,440
Premises was insecure.

545
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,520
Could be an imminent risk.

546
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,760
Reasonable grounds.

547
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,640
I'll take a look upstairs.

548
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,560
Did you find anything?

549
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,680
Flurane.

550
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,160
Flurane?

551
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,480
What's flurane?

552
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,920
Anaesthetic.

553
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,600
Anything upstairs?

554
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,080
No.

555
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,680
Just a couple of rats.

556
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,840
You know they say you're never
more than six feet away from a rat.

557
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,360
You're thinking of spiders.

558
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,320
Am I?

559
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,520
It's a common misconception.

560
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,920
Rats aren't that prolific.

561
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,360
How often do you actually see one?

562
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,880
Nick?

563
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,440
Nick?

564
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,120
It's the boy's watch.

565
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,000
I've been here before.

566
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,560
Where are we?

567
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,840
It's all right Mum, just stay in the car.

568
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,280
<i>So what do you want to do?</i>

569
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,520
Call it in.

570
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,880
Get forensics out here,
dog unit, everyone you can.

571
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,520
You sure that's a good idea?

572
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,560
I mean if he brought the boy here,
maybe he'll come back.

573
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,160
Miss Chambers.

574
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,120
What have you found?

575
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,760
You shouldn't be here.

576
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,640
Tell me what have you found?

577
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,736
Miss Chambers, I need you to get
in your car and go home.

578
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,816
- Show me!
- You can't be here right now.

579
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,240
Don't touch me!

580
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,280
Oh, my God.

581
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,360
Where is he?

582
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,840
Make the call.

583
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,120
Let's go outside.

584
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,320
Isaac.

585
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,880
Isaac!

586
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,000
- Miss Chambers.
- Isaac!

587
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,016
We've searched the place.
There's no one here.

588
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,640
What about in there?

589
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,640
Where?

590
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,920
There.

591
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,360
Help me move this.

592
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
How did you know this was here?

593
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,120
I...

594
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,576
Yeah, we're gonna need
at least two to three search teams

595
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,960
and a dog unit.

596
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,200
Looks like the boy was here.

597
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,080
Yep.

598
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,800
ASAP.

599
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,440
Oh, God.

600
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,040
Miss Chambers, go upstairs.

601
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Lucy!

602
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,320
Go upstairs, now.

603
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,880
Get Detective Holness.

604
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,480
Tell him...

605
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,720
Tell him to come down here.

606
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,160
I see you.

607
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,920
There.

608
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,120
I found you.

609
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,200
I'm not supposed to be here.

610
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,760
Well, neither am I.

611
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,800
Neither am I.

612
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,680
Come on.

613
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,880
Come on.

614
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,040
Good boy.

615
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,920
There she is.

616
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,320
Detective Dhillon, you look well.

617
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,600
How did he get away?

618
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,520
Isaac?

619
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,400
You had him and you let him escape.

620
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,160
See this is what bothers me, Mr Shepherd.

621
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,200
You told me you're very good
at what you do.

622
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,160
But if what you do is taking children...

623
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,480
It's not.

624
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,360
Not usually.

625
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,800
Not usually.

626
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Maybe every ten years or so.

627
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,360
What happened to Jonah Taylor?

628
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,720
Is he alive?

629
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,360
I certainly hope so.

630
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,720
Where did you take him?

631
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,160
You've got me on four counts of murder,

632
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,480
life in prison.

633
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,920
What good would a confession do me?

634
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,440
Clear your conscience.

635
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,600
My conscience is black.

636
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,160
Nothing's gonna change that.

637
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,600
I'm not here to tell you
what you want to know.

638
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,800
I'm here to tell you...

639
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,360
what you need to know.

640
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,080
What do we need to know?

641
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,360
I was there the day Isaac disappeared.

642
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,200
You know that.

643
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,400
I was watching you.

644
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,000
<i>I saw where you hid the spare key.</i>

645
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,560
<i>I let myself in.</i>

646
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,960
<i>Searched the boy's room.</i>

647
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,920
<i>Why?</i>

648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
<i>Research.</i>

649
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,080
<i>What were you looking for?</i>

650
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,240
<i>Confirmation.</i>

651
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,480
<i>And I found it.</i>

652
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,376
<i>Then your ex-husband showed up,</i>

653
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,280
<i>smashed the glass in the kitchen.</i>

654
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,280
I was gone before you
and Isaac arrived home.

655
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,720
But I stayed close.

656
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,560
I heard the commotion.

657
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,000
So, tell us what you saw.

658
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
What I saw...

659
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,320
If you didn't take Isaac, who did?

660
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,560
No one.

661
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,040
No one?

662
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,560
I don't think anyone took the boy.

663
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,480
Well, he didn't just vanish
into thin air, did he?

664
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,880
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

665
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,536
<i>♪ You're gonna want me for your girl ♪</i>

666
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,120
<i>♪ One fine day ♪</i>

667
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,960
<i>♪ You gonna find me good young girls... ♪</i>

668
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,720
House hasn't fallen down yet
so that's something.

669
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,360
It's not a supporting wall.

670
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,880
We'll see.

671
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,800
No, it looks great babe.

672
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,240
Cheers.

673
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,560
Start in the attic tomorrow.

674
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,400
You're not serious?

675
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,760
What?

676
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,960
Can't you sit still for one minute?

677
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,440
What do you think I'm doing now?

678
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,880
What is it love?

679
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,840
Lee, what?

680
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,560
Take Meredith downstairs.

681
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,680
Come on, love.

682
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,680
He's not supposed to be here.
