00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>I've died more times
that I can remember.</i>

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,200
Quick.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,040
Slow.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,720
Painful, peaceful.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,120
In the end it always...

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,520
always feels the same.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,360
A cold descent into nothing.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,720
I no longer exist.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,760
Then...

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,120
gradually, one sense at a time,
I come back.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You're saying you can rise from the dead.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,600
No, no one
can rise from the dead.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,360
<i>But we all return.</i>

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
<i>You were going to tell us
why you killed your father.</i>

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,000
<i>That's what I'm doing.</i>

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,280
No, you're stalling.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,856
Why don't you start at the beginning?

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
There is no beginning! No end.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,120
Life is a scratched record
looping over and over again.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,480
But you don't remember
that you've heard the song before...

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,640
so you keep on dancing...

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,000
singing along ...oblivious.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But not you...

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,480
because you're special.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
What makes you special, Gideon?

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,440
I can remember the song,

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,440
and I can move the needle.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
You're almost there.

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,280
That's it, that's it.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
You're nearly there.

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
We made a miracle.

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,320
In the name of The Father...

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,560
and of The Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Amen.

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,400
Jonah spent three days and three nights
in the belly of the whale

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,840
and all that time he prayed to God
to ask forgiveness.

38
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,240
He promised he would never try to hurt...

39
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
Oh.

40
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,120
Oh, Gideon, he's kicking.

41
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
Here.

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,360
<i>♪ Happy Birthday dear Malcolm ♪</i>

43
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Maybe Gideon
can blow the candle out for you.

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Don't touch.

46
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
Gideon!

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,240
Lawrence, stop!

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,120
Gideon, get back here.

49
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,200
Right now.

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,920
Naked I came from my mother's womb

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,240
and naked I will depart.

52
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,720
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.

53
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,640
In the name of the Lord be praised.

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the word of the Lord.

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,320
Thanks be to God.

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
When we're in church
you sit still and you show respect!

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
Hands on the table.

58
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
You made a fool of yourself.

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,520
Oh, I'm the fool?

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,800
You're the one who sat there
quoting scripture all evening.

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,280
You realise everyone was laughing at you?

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,120
No, it was just you and him.

63
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,096
Oh, so I'm not allowed
to speak to other men now?

64
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
You can speak
to whoever you want.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Just don't try to coax them into bed
in front of all of my friends.

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,480
Oh, that's what you hate isn't it?

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Your friends.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
James is my friend.

69
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,960
He wants to talk to me!

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,696
He doesn't want talk to you, Moira.

71
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,280
He wants to make you his whore!

72
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Good! Maybe I should let him!

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
See what it feels like
when it's done properly!

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
Go on then, hit me!

75
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,040
Hit me!

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,120
You boys be good
for your mother while I'm away.

77
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
Gideon, look after Malcolm.

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,640
Make sure he behaves.

79
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,320
Where are you going?

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,680
Mummy said you lost all the money.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,040
Mummy doesn't understand,
but Daddy's gonna fix it,

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,400
like he always does.

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Okay?

84
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,720
"'This is for you, ' said the kind dog."

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
'Thank you, ' said Thomas.

86
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
'Now I don't have to be sad anymore.

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,816
<i>As long as I have this</i>

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,280
<i>"I will think of you
and I will never be lonely again.'"</i>

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Read it again.

90
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Where are we goin'?

91
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,720
Daddy?

92
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,400
We have to say a prayer.

93
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Why?

94
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,120
Mummy needs us to pray for her soul.

95
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,760
For what she did.

96
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,400
What did Mummy do?

97
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,120
She did a very bad thing...

98
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
against Daddy.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Against God.

100
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
So now we have to pray.

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
All three of us.

102
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Pray with me.

103
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
Good boys.

104
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,520
Jonah spent three days
and three nights

105
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,280
in the belly of the whale,

106
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,760
and all that time he prayed to God
to ask forgiveness.

107
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Don't touch.

108
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
Gideon!

109
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,320
<i>Naked I came from my mother's womb</i>

110
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,240
and naked I will depart.

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.</i>

112
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
<i>In the name of the Lord be praised.</i>

113
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,136
Oh, so I'm not allowed to speak
to other men now?

114
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,856
You can speak
to whoever you want,

115
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
just don't try to coax them into bed
in front of all my friends.

116
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
<i>"Now I don't have to be sad anymore."</i>

117
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,000
<i>As long as I have this
I will think of you.</i>

118
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,880
<i>"And I will never be lonely again."</i>

119
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760
<i>We made a miracle.</i>

120
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Here.

121
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,080
- Don't touch.
- Gideon!

122
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,240
Lawrence stop!

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
Lawrence stop!

124
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,000
Gideon, get back here!

125
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,360
<i>He doesn't want to talk to you, Moira.</i>

126
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,200
He wants to make his whore!

127
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Good! Maybe I should let him.

128
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,680
See what it feels like
when it's done properly!

129
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,120
<i>I knew
my mother would never understand.</i>

130
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,240
<i>No one would.</i>

131
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,000
<i>So I ran away...</i>

132
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,360
<i>as far as I could get.</i>

133
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,840
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

134
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,480
<i>No one to look after me.</i>

135
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>I was alone.</i>

136
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,840
<i>I didn't understand what was happening.</i>

137
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
<i>Or why.</i>

138
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,480
<i>But every life came with its own lessons.</i>

139
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,560
<i>It was never long before they found me.</i>

140
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,736
We see him.

141
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,136
<i>But every time they did...</i>

142
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Come down, son. No, no!

143
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,240
I started again.

144
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
<i>Okay.</i>

145
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,240
<i>So you're saying that your entire defence</i>

146
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,000
<i>rests on your belief in what exactly?</i>

147
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,880
<i>- Reincarnation?
- Recurrence.</i>

148
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>Same body. The same life.</i>

149
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,920
<i>And it's not a defence,
it's an explanation. It's the truth.</i>

150
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,640
Well, thank you for clarifying.
That's very helpful.

151
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
Please don't.

152
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,080
You want to submit me
for a physiological evaluation,

153
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,680
that would be a mistake.

154
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,160
When I walked in here tonight,
you told me we'd already met.

155
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Was that in this lifetime or another?

156
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,800
If it was this lifetime,
you would have remembered me.

157
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,440
So all this has happened before?

158
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,240
No, not exactly.

159
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,240
- Lucy?
- You change things?

160
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,040
So you're saying
that's how you manage to survive.

161
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,920
Because you know
what's going to happen next?

162
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,760
For the most part.

163
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,240
I only hide where I won't be found.

164
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,840
I only steal when I won't be caught.

165
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,080
I only fight when I know I can win.

166
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,680
We searched your place by the tracks.

167
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,320
Found cash.

168
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,320
Thirteen thousand pounds give or take.

169
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
- Was that stolen?
- No.

170
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Once I can pass for 18,
I don't need to steal anymore.

171
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
And why is that?

172
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm very good at picking a winner.

173
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Evelyn!

174
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,176
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

175
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,080
<i>Halstead's Parade,
the rank outsider at 50/1</i>

176
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,920
<i>has won it by a length.</i>

177
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>Absolutely incredible!</i>

178
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>One of their tyres
blew out on a bend.</i>

179
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,640
<i>They were all dead.</i>

180
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,200
<i>Parents, two kids.</i>

181
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
<i>I couldn't help them.</i>

182
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,280
<i>Not in that life.</i>

183
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,680
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

184
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>It didn't matter because I knew,</i>

185
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
<i>I knew why this was happening to me.</i>

186
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,760
<i>I knew why I'd met
that little girl in the park.</i>

187
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,160
<i>I knew why I had witnessed her death.</i>

188
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,680
<i>Why my memories followed me
through every lifetime.</i>

189
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
<i>I remembered that family.</i>

190
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,960
<i>I took their names to my grave.</i>

191
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,280
<i>And now, in every new life,
I find them again.</i>

192
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,920
<i>I go to their house
on the morning of the crash</i>

193
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,200
<i>and I make sure
that car never leaves the driveway.</i>

194
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
You think you're saving people?

195
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560
I know I am.

196
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,040
And in every new life,

197
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,560
I learn a little more
about the nature of suffering.

198
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,160
<i>When I hear about a tragedy,
I write down what happened.</i>

199
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,560
<i>Where, when, to whom.</i>

200
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,656
<i>The fire was attributed
to an electrical fault</i>

201
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,080
<i>on a brand new tumble dryer,
causing it to overheat during the night.</i>

202
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,496
<i>The manufacturers have assured customers
that this is a rare fault...</i>

203
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,080
<i>And in my next life...</i>

204
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>I fix it.</i>

205
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,800
<i>The strange thing is,</i>

206
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,760
<i>even when I stop a fire,
I can still smell the smoke.</i>

207
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,560
House fires. Car crashes.

208
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,400
If you could really see the future,
why not stop 9-11?

209
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,680
How?

210
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,800
With a phone call?

211
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,000
It's worth a try.

212
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,640
It's not!

213
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,040
Believe me. I can't stop 9-11.

214
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Not yet.

215
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,160
But I did stop 7-12.

216
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,920
- What's 7-12?
- Exactly.

217
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,080
So you're a hero?

218
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
I never said that.

219
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
'Cause we found child pornography
on your laptop.

220
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,800
It wasn't my laptop.

221
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,320
- No?
- I stole it from Harold Slade.

222
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,680
I thought if I could get it
to the right people he'd be arrested!

223
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
Locked up before...

224
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
But that's not what you did.

225
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,640
No, because I changed my mind!

226
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,800
- Why?
- Because I saw what was on it.

227
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,560
<i>I looked into his soul
and I saw nothing but foulness.</i>

228
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,080
<i>After that, I knew he had to die.</i>

229
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,080
You went back to his house
and you murdered him.

230
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,560
Crossed his name off your list.

231
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,320
Literally, as it turns out.

232
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,440
They found this in your jacket
when they brought you in.

233
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,680
Got some names, dates, past, present.

234
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,560
Future.

235
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,240
It's barely legible,
you need to work on your hand writing.

236
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
Hey! I'm gonna keep that in mind.

237
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,720
Here's the thing.

238
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,520
When you bought this book,
the pages were blank.

239
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,360
They were.

240
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,776
You say when something happens,
you write it down.

241
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,960
So let's just say...

242
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Let's just say you really do recur.

243
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,080
In the next recurrence,
these pages are blank again.

244
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,240
Your notes can't follow you
into the next life,

245
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,400
so why bother writing anything down?

246
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Revision.

247
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,000
<i>When I reset, all I have are my memories.</i>

248
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,880
<i>So I surround myself with every detail.</i>

249
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,200
<i>And I learn the world's evils
like the lyrics of a song.</i>

250
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,920
When I buy that book,

251
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,080
I fill it with everything
I need to remember.

252
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,320
And as I discover new information,
I add to it.

253
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Turn to the last page.

254
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,880
I know you, Detective Dhillon.

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,680
I need you to understand that.

256
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,520
I know exactly what you're thinking.

257
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,040
I know what you're about to do
and what you're about to say.

258
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,040
When you presented that book,

259
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,240
I knew that you were going
to criticise my handwriting.

260
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
Is that right?

261
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,120
See for yourself.

262
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,360
Do you want one?

263
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,680
No, I want to go back in.

264
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,920
He's playing a game with us.

265
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,600
So play back.

266
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
We have to indulge him,

267
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,536
that's the only way
we're going to get to the truth, isn't it?

268
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,880
You think he's telling the truth?

269
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,720
I think he's telling the truth
as he sees it.

270
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,800
He killed his father
to stop his father killing him.

271
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,320
He killed Slade
to stop Slade killing those girls.

272
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,560
When he took my son, Ravi, did...

273
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
What?

274
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
Did he think someone
was going to hurt Isaac?

275
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,600
Gideon's deluded, but he's not sadistic.

276
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,800
He thinks his actions are...

277
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,760
are righteous.

278
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,880
That's why he takes them,
he thinks he's rescuing them.

279
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,920
If he thinks he's trying to rescue Isaac,

280
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,920
I need to know why.
I need to know what that means.

281
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
It means Janet Taylor's still alive.

282
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
You're not scared?

283
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Do you ever play hide and seek?

284
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,016
A lot of people
are gonna be looking for you.

285
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,000
You can't let them find you.

286
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm taking you somewhere to hide.

287
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,120
Somewhere safe.

288
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
Where no one will hurt you.

289
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,360
You can trust me, Jonah.

290
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,440
I know you don't know me,
but I'm a good person.

291
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,680
I am a good person.

292
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,120
You'll never find him.

293
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,680
A little louder, Mr Shepherd.

294
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,640
You'll never find him.

295
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,440
On Tuesday, the third of February 2009,

296
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,080
you drove to a house in Stevenport
where you abducted Jonah Edward Taylor

297
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
while he was playing in his back garden.

298
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,480
You say you're saving people.

299
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,720
Tell us how you saved him.

300
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,640
It's hard to do a good thing
when people call you a monster.

301
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,680
When you're the only one who understands
that the world is full of monsters.

302
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
<i>They just never look like
you imagine them.</i>

303
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,600
<i>Jonah Taylor's parents
were going to kill him</i>

304
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,440
<i>and bury him in a shallow grave.</i>

305
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,280
Where did you take him?

306
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,760
I left him with someone I trust.

307
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,160
She keeps him safe.

308
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,440
Takes care of him.

309
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,680
Why?

310
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,480
Why would she harbour a kidnapped child

311
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,600
when she knows the whole country
is looking for him?

312
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,080
I explain what will happen
if he goes home.

313
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
And she believes you?

314
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,280
- She does.
- Why?

315
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,000
Because I woke her up.

316
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,440
The lives we lead
are like tracks in the snow,

317
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
and when we live them again,

318
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,800
we're walking in the tracks
we left before.

319
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,520
But if your path changes,
there are no tracks.

320
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,080
And living is like wading
through thick powder,

321
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,560
some people find it hard.

322
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>Evelyn was supposed to die in a car crash</i>

323
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,520
<i>on the 5th of September 1977,
but she didn't.</i>

324
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Her family moved on,

325
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,640
but Evelyn,

326
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,560
she could sense something was different.

327
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,320
<i>Part of her would always remember
that crash.</i>

328
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,440
<i>She started seeing things
that weren't there.</i>

329
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,320
<i>Different patterns in the wallpaper.</i>

330
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,160
<i>Shadows without weight
passing across the room.</i>

331
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
<i>And people.</i>

332
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,920
<i>Ghosts...</i>

333
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,680
<i>drifting in and out of her reality.</i>

334
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
<i>Here one minute,</i>

335
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,160
<i>gone the next.</i>

336
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,520
I realised that she was seeing
the world as it was before.

337
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,800
The tracks that others left behind.

338
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,480
Every change causes ripples,

339
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,160
and those ripples followed her
wherever she went.

340
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,880
When she was 19 she checked herself
into a psychiatric hospital.

341
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
I got her out.

342
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,280
I helped her come to terms
with the glitches in her reality.

343
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,840
We found her an old house on the moor
where the ripples wouldn't find her,

344
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,360
and in time she was able
to make sense of her memories.

345
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
So she's like you?

346
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,240
In a lot of ways, yes.

347
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,240
In every new lifetime,
her memories return,

348
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
<i>so she knows what she has to do.</i>

349
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,520
But she never could stand the ripples.

350
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,520
That's why she always moves
to that same house,

351
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
to get away from the world.

352
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,000
To create familiar patterns
and repeat them.

353
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,920
No ghosts.

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,640
No shadows.

355
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,080
Just the company of a little lost boy.

356
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Where's the house?

357
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
You'll never find it.

358
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,720
You never have.

359
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
You enjoy it, don't you?

360
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,120
This power, this... knowledge.

361
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,880
I enjoy helping people.

362
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,320
Making the world a better place,

363
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,080
but it isn't always that simple.

364
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,520
Yo! Pack it in, man!

365
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,320
It's supposed to be low key out here.

366
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
Who's this?

367
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
This ain't a fucking drive-through.

368
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,840
Hey, back up, man.

369
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,600
Back up!

370
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,640
Aiden Stenner stabbed
a pregnant woman to death

371
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
over her boyfriend's drug debts.

372
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
If he dies she lives.

373
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,800
That's the trade.

374
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,040
Now, I know that, that is right,

375
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,080
but I still can't bring myself
to look him in the eye.

376
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
Ah! Ah! Ah!

377
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,560
Ah!

378
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,440
You didn't kill Aiden Stenner

379
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,720
and his victim wasn't a pregnant woman.

380
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,480
No, because when your friend waged war
on those dealers,

381
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,840
nothing was the same.

382
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,040
I couldn't track the chaos, I'm sorry.

383
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,160
Are you?

384
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,080
You'll see your friend again.

385
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,160
One day.

386
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
Death isn't the end of this story.

387
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,640
It's just punctuation.

388
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,920
Punctuation? That's how you see it?

389
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,120
That's how you justify the killing?

390
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,720
There is no justification.

391
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,240
Every time I take a life,

392
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
I grieve for the part of me that dies.

393
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,976
I'll be sure to tell
the victim's families,

394
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
they'll be very moved.

395
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,960
- I'm not who you think I am!
- No.

396
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,000
I understand. You hate murder.

397
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,360
It makes you sick.

398
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,480
Torture, on the other hand...

399
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,600
I saw what you did to Connor Larsen
before you shot him in the back.

400
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,800
- Connor Larsen rapes five women.
- Larsen never raped anyone.

401
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,280
Yeah, because I stopped it.

402
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,520
Because I stopped it!

403
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,640
Why the torture then?
Why not just kill him?

404
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
- It wasn't torture.
- What was it?

405
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,880
It was an experiment.

406
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,000
<i>Fear can change
a person's nature,</i>

407
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,240
<i>and fear transcends lifetimes.</i>

408
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,520
<i>Imagine if you could make a murderer
afraid of blood?</i>

409
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
<i>Or a rapist disgusted by sex?</i>

410
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
What the fuck!

411
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Hey!

412
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,200
Hey!

413
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,600
It never ends,

414
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
this eternal recurrence.

415
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,920
All the death, all the suffering.

416
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,520
Whatever I do, it comes back around.

417
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,800
But if I can change a person
on the inside,

418
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,600
flick a switch, then there's hope.

419
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Hope for their victims?

420
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,480
Hope for me.

421
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,600
<i>The only problem is
I always run out of time.</i>

422
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,800
And I always end up here.

423
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,160
This room, these handcuffs.

424
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,840
Whatever I do, wherever I go,

425
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,360
someone always finds me eventually,
and it's always the same detective.

426
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,040
Maybe I should ask for a raise?

427
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Yeah, maybe you should.

428
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,280
If we always end up here
then you've told me this story before.

429
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Yeah, I have.

430
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,800
- And have I ever believed you?
- No, you haven't.

431
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Then why bother telling it again?

432
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,200
Because I'm not trying to convince you,
Detective Dhillon.

433
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Lucy, I'm telling the truth.

434
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
And I can prove it to you.

435
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
You can prove it to yourself.

436
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,680
It's one question.

437
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,400
Lucy, think... hard.

438
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,120
What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

439
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
I stayed alive for you.

440
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,320
Incarcerated.

441
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,040
Alone for 25 years

442
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,400
waiting for you to come back.

443
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
It was the longest
25 years I've ever lived.

444
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,480
<i>They made me
share a cell with some animal</i>

445
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,640
<i>who murdered his wife and kid.</i>

446
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,520
<i>Said it wasn't his fault.</i>

447
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,800
<i>Drinking gave him a temper.</i>

448
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,040
<i>A temper.</i>

449
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,600
What the fuck are you looking at?

450
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
<i>I added his name to the list.</i>

451
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,920
<i>I added a lot of names.</i>

452
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,600
It's not hard for me to reset,

453
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,080
all I need is a piece glass
or a razor blade.

454
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,760
But I resisted. I suffered prison for you.

455
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,200
Now I need you to do something for me.

456
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Remember, Lucy, remember!

457
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,880
And answer the question.

458
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,920
What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

459
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,840
Mummy?

460
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
Lucy? What's wrong?

461
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,880
No, she didn't,
she's not... she's not...

462
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I changed it.

463
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,600
- I stopped it.
- Sit down!

464
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,760
You told me the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

465
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,320
and 30 years ago I stopped it.

466
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,760
I broke into your house,

467
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,600
<i>I removed the firing pin</i>

468
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,800
<i>from your grandfather's old shotgun.</i>

469
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,400
<i>Your mother pulled the trigger.</i>

470
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,840
<i>She reached the brink...</i>

471
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,280
<i>but you got a second chance.</i>

472
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,840
Argh!

473
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
After that,
you lead a very different life.

474
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,960
- Lucy, we need to go.
- Give her a minute.

475
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,480
Shut up!

476
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,760
Come on.

477
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,016
You're not supposed to be here.

478
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,136
You're not supposed to be
a lot of things.

479
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,360
This isn't your life.

480
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
Sorry.

481
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,160
Lucy?

482
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,440
Open the door!

483
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,960
Lucy! Open the door!

484
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,840
You said my life was different,
different to what?

485
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,960
Every life you've ever led.

486
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,160
- You're making new tracks now.
- How so?

487
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,520
I can help you remember,

488
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,496
but you'll only wake up
if you get there on your own.

489
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,440
And we've got to wake you up, Lucy,
we got to, because I made a promise.

490
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,000
The last time we met
you asked me to do this.

491
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,040
We didn't realise how different your life
was going to be.

492
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,640
You're not who you were.

493
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,520
But I was married...

494
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,760
- to Mike?
- No.

495
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,640
So, Isaac?

496
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,840
He's not supposed to be here.

497
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,880
That's why you tried to take him away.

498
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,800
No. No, no, no. I didn't. I didn't.

499
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,280
I didn't. Lucy, no, I didn't.

500
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,640
- Give me your shoelace.
- What?

501
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,880
Please. Please,
just give me your shoelace. Please!

502
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
Lucy, don't.

503
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
<i>I just...
I just want to show you something.</i>

504
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
<i>I'm not going to strangle you with it.
Please!</i>

505
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Every knot is the end of one lifetime

506
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,560
and the beginning of the next.

507
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,520
Now, I used to think
it was a straight line.

508
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,560
You live, you die.

509
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,000
You live, you die.

510
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,200
That's how I experience it.

511
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,040
But I wasn't seeing the whole picture.

512
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,120
What if, when we start a new loop,

513
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,280
that's exactly what it is?

514
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,160
A loop.

515
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,560
It's a new life,
but it's passing along the same curve.

516
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,200
I can remember my previous lives.

517
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,160
They're in my past,

518
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,760
but they're also happening in my present.

519
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,640
Simultaneous, parallel.

520
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,520
And now these loops,

521
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,360
they're so tightly wound
that they're almost touching.

522
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,640
<i>So that's why we glimpse
the world as it was before.</i>

523
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,640
<i>You wake in the night
to the sound of a shot that never fired.</i>

524
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,160
<i>You see the things
that were and the things that weren't.</i>

525
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,640
<i>You were never supposed to live
in that house, Lucy.</i>

526
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,400
<i>Neither was Isaac.</i>

527
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,040
But Isaac isn't like us.

528
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,440
<i>He's not bound to this lifetime.</i>

529
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,320
<i>Where you can see the echoes
of previous loops,</i>

530
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
<i>Isaac can reach out and touch them.</i>

531
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,200
<i>Talk to them.</i>

532
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,200
<i>But sometimes he loses his balance</i>

533
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,640
<i>and he slips from one lifetime</i>

534
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,640
into another and disappears
from our world altogether.

535
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,120
But why? Why Isaac?

536
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,000
Because he's an anomaly, Lucy.

537
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,440
He's not supposed to exist.

538
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,480
Do you want me to turn that on for you?

539
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,080
Or not.

540
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,640
Just carry on staring into space.

541
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Come here.

542
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,080
Come here. I want to tell you a story.

543
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,120
Your mum says you like stories.

544
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,080
Once upon a time I was
having dinner with a girl called Sonia.

545
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
All right, she's pretty.

546
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,320
Boring as hell.
Zero sense of humour.

547
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,400
You'd have liked her.

548
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,600
Anyway, about halfway through the meal...

549
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,320
I heard this amazing laugh.

550
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,840
This woman was drinking
with her friends and she was laughing

551
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,280
<i>so hard that she had piña colada
coming out her nose.</i>

552
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,080
Do you know what piña colada is?

553
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,280
People drink it in the sunshine.

554
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
I mean, it was raining outside
but she didn't care. She just...

555
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,080
<i>wanted a drink
with an umbrella in it...</i>

556
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,840
'cause it was fun.

557
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,040
Sonia went home in a taxi,

558
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,800
but I stayed and I spoke to the lady
with the piña colada.

559
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,040
And six months later, I married her...

560
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,360
and then for the next three years

561
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
we laughed together.

562
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,000
And they're the happiest years of my life.

563
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,480
And then...

564
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,120
you came along and it was over.

565
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,640
No more piña coladas, no more laughing.

566
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,600
You destroyed our lives.

567
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,920
Do you know that?

568
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,680
Do you even feel anything?

569
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,400
It's like there's no one in there.

570
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,320
Go play somewhere else.

571
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,520
There's something vital
in every human life

572
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,240
that crosses over
from one loop to the next.

573
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,800
Isaac doesn't have that. He can't.

574
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,320
You know what I'm talking about,
that... that... that spark of humanity,

575
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,440
a spirit.

576
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,920
A soul.

577
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,800
He came from nothing.
He will return to nothing.

578
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,800
He is a husk.

579
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,120
Devoid of life, devoid of love.

580
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,440
<i>I know you tried to love him
into existence, but that's impossible.</i>

581
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,520
<i>That's not going to work.</i>

582
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,920
<i>He is never going to love you.</i>

583
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,760
<i>He's never going to feel joy.</i>

584
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,600
<i>He's never going to be real.</i>

585
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,840
I know you care about your son...

586
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,840
but he's not the real reason
you're here.

587
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,080
You nearly had me going there.

588
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,320
But you gave yourself away.

589
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,160
How so?

590
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,080
My son loves me.

591
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,040
Has he ever said that?

592
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Have you?

593
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,760
For all your wisdom, for all these lives
you've supposedly lead,

594
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,520
have you ever been loved?

595
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,480
Have you ever loved anyone else?

596
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,120
You're the husk, Gideon.

597
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,320
My son is more real
than you could ever hope to be.

598
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,080
Goodbye, Lucy.

599
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,000
I'll see you soon.

600
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,720
Isaac?

601
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
<i>New message.</i>

602
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,360
<i>Mum, Daddy made me cold.</i>

603
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,720
<i>I want you to come home.</i>

604
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,160
<i>Please come home, Mummy.</i>

605
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
<i>I love you.</i>

606
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,360
Mike, Mike.

607
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,080
Mike, where's Isaac?

608
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,240
Mike!

609
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,040
Mike, where's Isaac?

610
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,600
Mike! Where's Isaac?

611
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

612
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,376
- Tell me where he is.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

613
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,040
I went... I went back for him.

614
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,560
What?

615
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,160
I couldn't find him.

616
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,480
I'm sorry.

617
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,560
No, Lucy. Lucy!

618
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,440
Isaac!

619
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,000
Isaac!

620
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,480
Isaac!

621
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,360
Isaac!

622
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,280
Detective Chambers.

623
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,440
Did they get everyone out?

624
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,880
Looks that way.

625
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,680
They're treating the mother for burns.

626
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,280
Is everything all right, ma'am?

627
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,640
It's nothing, just a feeling.

628
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,840
