1
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>Déjà vu.</i>

2
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,640
<i>They say it's like a short circuit
in the brain.</i>

3
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
<i>Your sense of a moment
placed in your memory centre.</i>

4
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,040
<i>Makes you feel
like you've experienced all this before.</i>

5
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
Do you know what I'm talking about?

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,560
That feeling.

7
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,880
Have we been here before?

8
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
Do we already know one another?

9
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,920
You don't know me.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,240
I know that you feel out of place.

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
Detached.

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,840
Like your life isn't your own.

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,360
I know you wake every night

14
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,200
from a painful dream you never had.

15
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,200
Jesus Christ!

16
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,120
You scared me.

17
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
What are you doing down here?

18
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
Isaac?

19
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,560
What are you doing down here?

20
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
Are you okay sweetheart?

21
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
Are you okay sweetheart?

22
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,640
Let's get you back to bed.

23
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Go back to sleep.

24
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,680
<i>And how often do these episodes occur?</i>

25
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
About once or twice a month.

26
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
So, before the move?

27
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
That's right.

28
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,240
Well sleepwalking's really quite common
in children of Isaac's age.

29
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
No, sorry.

30
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,760
This isn't sleepwalking.

31
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
This is different.

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
And it's just the two of you at home?

33
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,080
Yes.

34
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,200
Does he still see his father?

35
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Not anymore.

36
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,680
And how did he react when you told him

37
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,720
that you and your husband were separating?

38
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,240
He didn't.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,080
Isaac, would you like
to come and sit by Mummy?

40
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Thank you.

41
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,080
And how are you feeling today?

42
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Isaac?

43
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
Dr Bennett asked you a question,
sweetheart.

44
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,160
Isaac, do you remember
waking up last night and going downstairs?

45
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
And do you remember why you did that?

46
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
Meredith was crying.

47
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,200
Sometimes Isaac imagines things.

48
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
People.

49
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,840
That's quite common, isn't it?
Imaginary friends.

50
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Is that right, Isaac?
Is Meredith your friend?

51
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,840
She can't hear me.

52
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,320
She's been with us since the move.

53
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
She's not the first though, is she?

54
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
We've had, erm, Barney, Stephanie,

55
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,520
we even had an Alejandro once.

56
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
How's he at school?

57
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,520
Fine, I mean, I...
he does well.

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
No behavioural issues.

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,440
Is he always this placid?

60
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,240
He never cries.

61
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
He never laughs. He never gets mad.

62
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
He's just...

63
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,080
Did you say something, Isaac?

64
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm not supposed to be here.

65
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,560
That's okay.

66
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,480
We're going to go to school just as soon
as we finished with Dr Bennett.

67
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, Ruby, please.

68
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,360
Ruby.

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,680
And there is an instance
of schizophrenia in the family?

70
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
Er, sorry?

71
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
Your mother.

72
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,840
Er, Dr Harper ruled out schizophrenia.

73
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,976
And what about your father?

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Are there any issues
on that side of the family?

75
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Not that I know of.

76
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,520
He died when I was young.

77
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,680
Brain aneurysm.

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
It's not schizophrenia.

79
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not autism.

80
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,520
There is no easy answer here, believe me.

81
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
You're actually doctor number seven.

82
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,360
Lucky number seven, I hope.

83
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
I'll do what I can.

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Luce?

85
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,520
No, I understand. Erm.

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,400
Thing is Karen,
we're overstretched as it is.

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah? What about Mark?
When's the last time he did a home visit?

88
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
Mark?

89
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Mark doesn't use cash because he read
it's covered in vaginal bacteria.

90
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,880
He actually put that in writing.
I have got it in an email.

91
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,720
Bedwetting.

92
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes.

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,680
The mum doesn't change her sheets,
so it's disgusting.

94
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,840
Was Rob with you?

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
No, of course not.

96
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,760
Rob should come with you next time.

97
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Bedwetting could be a sign of abuse,
we need to rule that out.

98
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,880
No, Luce, it's not about
whether the kid's being abused...

99
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, it is.

100
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,280
No, what I mean is...

101
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
This is the job, Karen.

102
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Yeah?

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,840
He's here.

104
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,760
Mr Fisher, my name is Lucy Stephens.
You've already met Rob.

105
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
Yeah.

106
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,640
Rob and I have both
been working on your case.

107
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,640
As you know, he's made several visits
to your family home.

108
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
No.

109
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,040
You weren't aware of that?

110
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
No. Don't know nothing about it.

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
With respect,
the situation's been made quite clear.

112
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
What's this about?

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,600
'Cause I've got stuff to do.

114
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,040
We have several police reports
of violent incidents of assault.

115
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
Some historic.

116
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,240
You're currently on bail
for the most recent charge.

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,480
Yeah.

118
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
Chloe tells us
that you physically assaulted her

119
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
and that you threatened
the safety of your daughter.

120
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Nah. She says that, but it's not true.

121
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,840
I didn't do that.

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,240
- You didn't...
- I didn't threaten Tilly.

123
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
All right?

124
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,760
I wouldn't hurt her. That's bollocks.

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,200
She's making that up.

126
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,360
But there was an incident of assault...

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Mr Fisher.

128
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,200
She pushed me, I pushed back.

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
Are you aware that you're not permitted

130
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,480
to have any contact with your family
at this time?

131
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,760
Three days ago, you approached Chloe
outside your daughter's school.

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,400
- She was carrying your son in a...
- He's not mine.

133
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,720
Look, she's not taking her
away from me, all right?

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
That's my daughter.

135
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
I love her,
I wouldn't do nothing to hurt her.

136
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,320
I want to be very clear with you,
Mr Fisher.

137
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,840
If there are any further incidents,

138
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,640
we're going to need to consider
child protection measures.

139
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,960
Do you understand?

140
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Is that it?

141
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
This is very serious, Shane.

142
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,920
Yeah.

143
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,440
- If you approach your family...
- Yeah, I get it.

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,800
You all right, Luce?

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
Yeah.

146
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,240
It's always nice to meet new people.

147
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,720
Victim's a Mr Harold Slade.

148
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,040
Early fifties. Stabbed three times.

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,680
- Weapon?
- No, not yet.

150
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Where is he?

151
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
Upstairs office.

152
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,360
Wife came home and found him around 4:00.

153
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,800
Home from where?

154
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,840
Book club, alibi's tight.

155
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,560
How's it looking up there?

156
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Lot of spatter.

157
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Let's get this over with.

Say again?

169
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,960
I said, next door were out,
front door was unlocked.

170
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,800
Killer picked his moment.

171
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,720
Probably knew the victim.

172
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,160
Knew his schedule at least.

173
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Wife said he was well liked.

174
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,800
Volunteered at St John's,
ran the local rowing club.

175
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
Pillar of the community.

176
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,280
Is that right?

177
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
Yeah, I know.
We found some magazines in the drawer too.

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
Nothing illegal.

179
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040
Little bit of rough, you know,
bondage, S&M.

180
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,440
Do you want to step out?

181
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
No.

182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,680
They're putting us up somewhere local.

183
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,520
Christ knows where.

184
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,720
Of course, we should be getting pissed
at the King's tonight.

185
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,760
Weird time of day for fireworks.

186
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,000
Are you alright, mate?

187
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,400
Sorry, I...

188
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,000
You know when you half remember something?

189
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
It's supposed to get easier.

190
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,120
You know, the blood.

191
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,840
Most people find it hard to start with,
but they get used to it.

192
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm not criticising, I'm just saying,

193
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,840
you're the only DI I know
who still gets wobbly around the dead.

194
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm not wobbly.

195
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
There's no shame in it.

196
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
Everybody's scared of something.

197
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,800
My Bella has an irrational fear of cheese,
believe it or not.

198
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,840
This isn't irrational.

199
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,000
Blood is death.

200
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,960
It's supposed to make us uncomfortable.

201
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
You could argue
it's irrational not to fear it.

202
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,240
You could do. It won't help you much.

203
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Not when your job
involves staring at stab victims.

204
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,280
Are you gonna throw up?

205
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm fine.

206
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,560
Why do this?

207
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
A grudge?

208
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
Bad debts?

209
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,320
- Botched burglary?
- No, no, no. I mean you.

210
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,480
Why do this job, given your disposition?

211
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,080
Someone has to.

212
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,640
What do you see when you look at me?

213
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
A murderer? A monster?

214
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,440
Why did you come here?

215
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
You said you wouldn't talk to anyone else.

216
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,640
And you came.

217
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
- You didn't have to.
- Well, they want answers.

218
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,440
No, they don't.

219
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,960
They want evidence, confessions,
close the file, forget all about it.

220
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,920
Do you think I don't want to forget this?

221
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,400
I know you do.

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
But you won't.

223
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
What time is it?

224
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
You still having the nightmares?

225
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,240
I told you not to sleep over.

226
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,800
You were talking in your sleep.

227
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,400
Said something about fireworks.

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,880
- Fireworks?
- Uh-hmm.

229
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
Can I get you something?

230
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,000
No.

231
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,760
Let's go to sleep.

232
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Okay.

233
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,400
Mike?

234
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Hmm?

235
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,720
Will you hold me?

236
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah.

237
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
I know it's weird,
but I actually quite miss this time.

238
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,760
I miss waking up
and hugging you back to sleep.

239
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,320
Look, I want you gone
by the time he wakes up.

240
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,640
I don't want him thinking
you're back if you're not back.

241
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
Yeah. Sure.

242
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
Unless you want to see him...

243
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Mike?

244
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,560
Erm, I have a really early meeting.

245
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,720
You're making me too hot.

246
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
All right.

247
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm changing my name back.

248
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
I thought it was about time.

249
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
Can we talk about that?

250
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,200
No.

251
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,200
Mum...

252
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,800
has Ellen been in today?

253
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
Who?

254
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
You know, Ellen.

255
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,400
Er, she gives you a hand
with things, doesn't she?

256
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,800
Has she been in?

257
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,160
She was in this morning.

258
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,736
Did she bring any teabags,
do you know?

259
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

260
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,920
Oh, she's hidden them well.

261
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,200
Hey.

262
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Hey!

263
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,040
It's okay, it's okay.

264
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,560
It's okay.

265
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,400
Well, he'll eat the birds.

266
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
Fuck off!

267
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
There's nothing there.

268
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,800
Well, he comes and goes.

269
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,720
Nasty little bastard.

270
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,560
He's nasty.

271
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
Vicious cunt!

272
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
It's okay.

273
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
You're all right.

274
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,320
Ellen?

275
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,080
It's Lucy.

276
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,880
Lucy.

277
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, I prefer Ellen.

278
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,880
Come on, I'll get you a nice cup of tea.

279
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
So just to be clear,

280
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,240
you're saying it was parked opposite
the victim's house.

281
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,680
Two weeks it sat there.

282
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,480
The council plastered it with tickets.

283
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,841
I told them, it's no good putting
the ticket on the thing,

284
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,440
we want it towed.

285
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,520
The other day,
I had to park in the crescent.

286
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,080
I told them I shouldn't have
to do that, not with my knee.

287
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm sorry to hear that Mr Bell.

288
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,320
What sort of car was it?

289
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Red. A Nissan thing-a-mee.

290
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
It was scuffed to fuck.

291
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Dents all over it.

292
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
Nissan thing-a-mee?

293
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,240
You didn't get the model?

294
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,480
Joan took a picture of it. I'll ask her.

295
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,080
Joan?

296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
She's fucking deaf.

297
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
Well, she's not proper deaf.

298
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
She needs a hearing aid
but of course she won't listen.

299
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
Well, she can't fucking listen,
can she?

300
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Joan?

301
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,040
- I reckon she's outside.
- No, no, no, no.

302
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,040
You just stay there Mr Bell,

303
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll go.

304
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Vanette.

305
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm sorry?

306
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,440
That's what it's called.

307
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,120
Nissan Vanette.

308
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
A red Nissan Vanette,
you're absolutely sure?

309
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah, it's a big chunky thing
with, er, bull bars.

310
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, you don't see them
around much anymore, do you?

311
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,200
No, you don't.

312
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,200
<i>Oi, mate,</i>

313
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,840
out my way, you knobhead.

314
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
Well, none of us saw it happen.

315
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,776
He says it was an accident.

316
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,040
Then it was. He doesn't lie.

317
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,800
Isaac's not in trouble, Mrs Stephens.

318
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Chambers. Stephens was my married name.

319
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
Chambers, sorry.

320
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,600
I'll get reception to update your details.

321
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,400
Well, I'll pay for the damage.

322
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,280
That's not really the issue here.

323
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,320
One of those bags belonged to a boy
who was picking on Isaac.

324
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
What boy?

325
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,760
He's been disciplined.

326
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,440
We take bullying very seriously,

327
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,960
even if it is just a bit of teasing.

328
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,240
Define teasing.

329
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Name-calling. Silly things.

330
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Still, he knows it was wrong
and he apologised.

331
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Tell me his name.

332
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Archie.

333
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,520
Archie?

334
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,200
What does Archie do to you?
Does he call you names?

335
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,240
Does it upset you?

336
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,200
Is that why you weed on his bag?

337
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,080
They moved the toilets.

338
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,600
No. No sweetheart, they didn't.

339
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Isaac knows full well
where the toilets are,

340
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
don't you, Isaac?

341
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,800
Come on.

342
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,040
- Say sorry.
- Sorry.

343
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,960
We'll pay for the bags.

344
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,480
Isaac.

345
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
What are you doing?

346
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,800
Go back to bed.

347
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Isaac!

348
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,080
Go to bed.

349
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
Shut your eyes.

350
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,480
Shut your eyes.

351
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,920
Isaac?

352
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,360
Oh.

353
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
Fuck.

354
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,000
Isaac?

355
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm sorry darling.

356
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,960
Mummy's sorry she yelled at you.

357
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,120
Come here and give me a cuddle.

358
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,880
Who's that man?

359
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
What's that darling?

360
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,520
Who's that man?

361
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
What man?

362
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
What man, sweetheart?

363
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,960
He's gone now.

364
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Mummy's going to make you better.

365
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,800
I promise.

366
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,920
Go to sleep.

367
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,520
Chloe Fisher?

368
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah.

369
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,720
My name's Lucy Chambers,
I'm from children's services.

370
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,960
Can I come in?

371
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,960
As you know,
we spoke to your husband,

372
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,600
just to get his side of the story.

373
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,040
Oh, thank you very much.

374
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,120
But just to be clear,
has there been any contact

375
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,040
since the incident at school?

376
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,280
He was here this morning.

377
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,640
What, here at the house?

378
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,560
He said he wanted to see Tilly.

379
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Did you let him in?

380
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
No.

381
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,760
And what did he do then?

382
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,280
He got angry.

383
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,560
Shouting, swearing.

384
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,920
Saying he was...
he was gonna kill himself.

385
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,520
I told him, don't you say stuff
like that in front of Tilly,

386
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
I, I wasn't standing for it.

387
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,200
People was looking.

388
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
I said if he didn't go,
I'd call the police.

389
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
And did you?

390
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,880
Chloe?

391
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,520
Did you call the police?

392
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,720
Oh.

393
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,600
We made it very clear
that Shane was to have

394
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,640
no contact with you or with Tilly.

395
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,776
If he's not adhering to that,
we're going to need to consider

396
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
child protection measures.

397
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,720
Now if he turns up here again,
I want you to...

398
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,240
Look, I shoved him first.

399
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
Outside the school. I, I started it.

400
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,200
Don't let him into this house.

401
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,360
Chloe, I want you to promise me.

402
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,320
Okay, we can find you
somewhere safe to stay.

403
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
We're not leaving.

404
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,720
Erm...

405
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm going to give you my mobile number.

406
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
So, if you are worried,
I want you to call me.

407
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,560
Day or night.

408
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,680
Doesn't matter.

409
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,280
I mean it, Chloe.

410
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,480
Day or night.

411
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,280
Okay.

413
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,640
Bye Tilly.

414
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,400
Bye.

415
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,960
Hey...

416
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,520
Thanks.

417
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Fuck's sake.

418
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,040
That's every Nissan Vanette

419
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,040
still registered in the county.

420
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,440
I wish we were back in the city.

421
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,136
Honestly, I don't know how
they cope round here.

422
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Come on.

423
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,576
I thought you youngsters
were supposed to be good

424
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,680
with computers.

425
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm 35.

426
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
Really? You've got a young face.

427
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
I like your screensaver

428
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,960
- Jonah Taylor's teddy bear.
- Yeah, I know.

429
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
We all remember little Horton.

430
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,416
The day they found him
was the beginning of the end.

431
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
Hobson.

432
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,320
Bear's name was Hobson.

433
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah. Hobson, right.

434
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,440
This is all a bit
before your time, isn't it?

435
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,720
I read her blog, Miranda Taylor.

436
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,520
She still updates it, even now.

437
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Well, I never met her.

438
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,080
I know a lot of people who did though.

439
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,520
Not a very pleasant woman,
by all accounts.

440
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
She lost her son,
how pleasant would you be?

441
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,080
Yeah, but she didn't have
to blame us, did she?

442
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,400
All that rubbish about hiding
evidence from the press.

443
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,776
It was our fault we never found him.

444
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,480
- I mean, come on.
- Maybe it is.

445
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,480
Listen mate,
this case destroyed three careers.

446
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,600
Good people.

447
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,040
That kid was never gonna be found,

448
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,400
and that, that was a dead end.

449
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,840
Yes, it was. That's the point.

450
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,000
No through traffic. No access to town.

451
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,760
That road there led to five houses,

452
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,640
and this car didn't belong to any of them.

453
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,360
One hour later,
our mystery car shows up again,

454
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,680
just off the M3,
where they found the bear.

455
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
Now tell me Nick,

456
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,680
is that or is that not
a red Nissan Vanette?

457
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,056
Yeah, I'm sorry if we seem
to be going over old ground,

458
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,040
but, erm, I wanted to verify

459
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,160
some of Dr Harper's
observations for myself,

460
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,760
and to be honest with you,

461
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,200
these notes don't make
a great deal of sense to me.

462
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,920
Isaac doesn't make a great deal
of sense to anyone.

463
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,040
And the incident at school?

464
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,760
Oh, that's never happened before.

465
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
He is not vindictive, not like that.

466
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,680
Any other changes in behaviour?

467
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,080
Oh, how is, erm, the insomnia?

468
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
More frequent, I suppose.

469
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,480
He was walking around again last night.

470
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,040
And that was before
you, you went to bed?

471
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
No. I woke up.

472
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,320
I always wake up, never sleep through.

473
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,680
What sort of time was this?

474
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,080
3:33.

475
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,200
Always about that time?

476
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,160
- Half three?
- No.

477
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,360
It... sorry, no, it's not. It's...

478
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,520
I know it's strange, it's not half three.

479
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,040
It's 3:33.

480
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,920
No, it's the same every single night.

481
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,760
I wake up, I open my eyes,

482
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,400
I look at the time and it is 3:33 am.

483
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,120
Not 3:32. Not 3:34.

484
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,360
You must have
a very unique circadian rhythm.

485
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
Have you tried varying your bedtime?

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,640
Ooh... I've tried everything.

487
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
Trust me.

488
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,120
I've had this my whole life. Erm...

489
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Is there a chance
that this could be genetic?

490
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,320
Have you ever suffered
from hallucinations

491
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,520
or mood swings?

492
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,600
I... I get déjà vu sometimes.

493
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,440
But it's not,
it's... it's not... it's not real.

494
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,400
I mean, it's not a memory.

495
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
It's like I'm misremembering.

496
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,840
Oh God, I sound crazy.

497
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,640
No, you don't, trust me. I've heard crazy.

498
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,160
Lucy, if you need to speak with someone...

499
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,880
No. No. I... no, sorry.

500
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,136
I shouldn't have said anything.

501
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,840
Erm, I'm fine. Just help Isaac.

502
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,640
Please, I'm not worried about myself.

503
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,320
Well, you don't seem worried Lucy.

504
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,640
You seem afraid.

505
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,640
I looked it up. 3:33.

506
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,160
Do you know what they call it?

507
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,960
What?

508
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,640
Isaac, it's time
to go home sweetheart.

509
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Sorry.

510
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,320
Isaac?

511
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Thank you so much
for coming in to see me today.

512
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,400
Will you come again?

513
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,960
I've got you in next Tuesday
at the same time.

514
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,360
Great. Come on.

515
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,400
Self-care isn't selfish, Lucy.

516
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
Remember that.

517
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Say goodbye, Isaac.

518
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
Goodbye.

519
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,400
The devil's hour.

520
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,200
They call it the devil's hour.

521
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Mummy needs to work when we get home,
so no dinner tonight.

522
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,880
You're okay with that, right?

523
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Or, now promise me
you won't get too excited,

524
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,680
because I know what you're like,
but, um, how about...

525
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,920
<i>♪ Fish and chips? ♪</i>

526
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,640
<i>♪ Oh yeah, fish and chips and mushy peas ♪</i>

527
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
<i>♪ Now we're talking ♪</i>

528
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,160
<i>♪ Mm-hm ♪</i>

529
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,200
See, this is what I'm talking about,

530
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,160
you've gone and got yourself overexcited,
and you need to calm down.

531
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,360
Isaac, did you just...
did you just smile at me?

532
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,200
Look out, pumpkin.

533
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,880
Merry, go inside and help Mum.

534
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,600
She just ran in front of the car.

535
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,760
What?

536
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,080
Your daughter just ran into the road.

537
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,280
Oi, is that true?

538
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
Did you run in front of this lady's car?

539
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
What have I told you? Look at me.

540
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,400
What did we say about the road?

541
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,416
- It's not for playing.
- It's not for playing.

542
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,320
There's cars going up and down.
What happens if you get hit by a car?

543
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,600
- I go splat.
- You go splat.

544
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,040
Now you need to apologise
to this lady, don't you?

545
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,360
- I'm sorry.
- Right, Meredith Warren, inside.

546
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,280
Meredith, in.

547
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
Meredith?

548
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
That's a nice name.

549
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,640
Mummy?

550
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
Mummy?

551
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,680
I had a bad dream.

552
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,600
Oh, so did I.

553
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,800
It's all right.

554
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,960
Mummy's here.

555
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,440
Mummy's here. Mummy's here.

556
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,320
Mummy's not going anywhere.

557
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,480
Bad dreams can't hurt us, Lucy.

558
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,640
Can't hurt us now.

559
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,200
There you go. Nice cup of tea.

560
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,080
I want sugar.

561
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,800
It is sugared, I put two sugars in there.

562
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,120
Ugh, can't taste it.

563
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,600
Um, would you like to play a game?
I could get the cards?

564
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,480
There's no cards.

565
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,560
She stole them. Thinks I don't know.

566
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,936
Well, maybe I should look for them.
I'm sure we'll find them.

567
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Well, it's all in the wrong place.

568
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,680
Not supposed to be like this.

569
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,160
Hey!

570
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's...

571
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
It's supposed to be different.

572
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,120
It's okay Mum.

573
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,480
Look, how about a game of crib,
do you remember how to play?

574
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,360
We used to play this by candlelight

575
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,080
when there were power cuts,
do you remember?

576
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,320
Mum?

577
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,880
Maybe another time.

578
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,680
Lucy.

579
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,120
You came to see me again.

580
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,480
Of course, I did. I'm always here.

581
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,800
Oh.

582
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I...

583
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,320
Are you real?

584
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,160
Yes. I'm real.

585
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,840
I can't get warm.

586
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,720
I'm cold.

587
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,880
Why is it always so cold?

588
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,600
Oh, shut up, shut up. Shut up!

589
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Here.

590
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Here.

591
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
Hold it.

592
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,520
Here you go.

593
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,400
Squeeze it.

594
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,840
It's real.

595
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,360
You're real.

596
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
There you go.

597
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,400
Lucy.

598
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,600
It's okay.

599
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm not going anywhere.

600
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,560
It's going to be okay.

601
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,440
Not much traffic up here.

602
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,296
There's a farm up on the hill,
a couple of houses at the end of the lane.

603
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,440
One of them's empty.

604
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,400
Registration's a match.
Council confirmed it.

605
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,120
How far away is this farm?

606
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,520
- About a mile, mile and a half?
- Okay.

607
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Find out what they know.

608
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,800
We already bagged some of it.

609
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,520
Old laptop, no hard drive,

610
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,080
mobile phone, no SIM,
long life UPS, and this.

611
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,480
Show the wonder kid.

612
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,680
Dhillon.

613
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,200
Dashboard cam.

614
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,000
Just had to park at the right angle,
he's got himself a 24-hour stream.

615
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,480
That's how he knew Slade's routine.

616
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,360
Without getting too close.

617
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,680
So, he's a clever bastard.

618
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,560
Maybe not.

619
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,600
Oh.

620
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,720
He's been driving on that for a while.

621
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,000
Could have gone looking for help.

622
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,600
Or another vehicle.

623
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,360
Not many options round here.

624
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,840
Guess we go knocking on some doors.

625
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,200
We can start
with whichever one this opens.

626
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,360
Find the cheapest hotel in the area.

627
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,680
I doubt he's fussy.

628
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,640
Do you think he'll go back there?

629
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,400
Not without the key,

630
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,560
but someone took his booking,

631
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,440
which means, someone's seen his face.

632
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,720
- Mike.
- All right?

633
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,560
I was just, uh, passing by.

634
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,720
Yeah, it's not a good time, I'm working.

635
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,360
What? It's 9:30.

636
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,160
And I'm working.

637
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,560
Okay.

638
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,800
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

639
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,880
Just tired.

640
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,360
We could just talk?

641
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,200
I don't want to talk.

642
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Okay.

643
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
I didn't say go.

644
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
That's it.

645
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,760
That's what?

646
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,800
Do we have sex because you love me,
or because you love sex?

647
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,160
Sorry.

648
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Hello?

649
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,040
<i>You said I could call any time.</i>

650
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,760
Chloe?

651
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,360
Okay.

652
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,280
Okay.

653
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,080
Have you phoned the police?

654
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,760
- Chloe, open this fucking door!
- No, I...

655
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,440
I don't want to get him in trouble.

656
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,200
Chloe, listen to me,
you need to call the police.

657
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,640
- It's not safe.
- He's been drinking.

658
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,000
Chloe, listen!

659
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,520
He's not normally this bad.

660
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,160
You are afraid of him,
you would not have called if you weren't.

661
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,600
Chloe?

662
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,080
I love you.

663
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,480
Chloe?

664
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,920
Open the door.

665
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,720
I'm being stupid.

666
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,800
- No, you're not, you're not, you're not.
- Sorry. I shouldn't have called.

667
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,240
Chloe, please.

668
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,400
Who was that?

669
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,960
Lucy?

670
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,680
Stay with Isaac.

671
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,680
What? Uh...

672
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,000
Hold on.

673
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,760
Just stay here.

674
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,600
He comes and goes.

675
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,920
Sometimes I don't see him for months.

676
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,360
- How long has he been staying here?
- He don't stay.

677
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,880
Not often.

678
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,440
He's had the lodge about nine, ten years.

679
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,000
That doesn't strike you as odd?

680
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,560
He pays cash.

681
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,480
A year in advance.

682
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,400
As far as I'm concerned,
he can stay as long as he wants.

683
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,240
Fair enough.
And I assume you asked for his name?

684
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,960
Asked for one, didn't get one.

685
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,760
Like I said, he pays cash.

686
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Didn't look like he was
going to get a lot of post.

687
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,640
What did he look like?

688
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,960
Serious. Scruffy.

689
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,200
Maybe 50's, 60's.

690
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,120
But skinny, you know.

691
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Grey hair.

692
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,040
Spoke with an accent.

693
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,320
- What sort of accent?
- Irish?

694
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,320
Scottish?

695
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,440
Same difference.

696
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,920
When was the last time you saw him?

697
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,320
Two, three months ago.

698
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,600
I'd had to check.

699
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,720
And, uh...

700
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,560
Nah, that tapes over itself.

701
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,160
Can you show us his lodge?

702
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,920
If you can show me a warrant.

703
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,080
Please Mrs Jones, this is very important.

704
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,480
My guests have the right to privacy.

705
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,080
Not that you'd know much about that,
filming us all the time,

706
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,720
tracking our phone calls,
watching what we do on the internet.

707
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
Do a lot of nasty stuff on the internet,
do you Mrs Jones?

708
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,680
I'd like you to leave.

709
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,880
Now.

710
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,160
What breed of dog is that?

711
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,440
Well, he's all right.

712
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,200
That's just Spud.

713
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,840
I didn't ask his name, I asked his breed.

714
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,840
- Looks like a pit bull terrier to me.
- So what?

715
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,240
It's a banned breed.

716
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,480
Sorry, I'm sure you know that.

717
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,840
As I'm sure you can provide us
a certificate of exemption.

718
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,680
Now, you can show us the room,

719
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,800
or we can sit and we can
talk about Spud a bit longer.

720
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,920
Maybe seize him under section 19
of the police and criminal evidence act?

721
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,960
Your choice.

722
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,240
You okay, Dhillon?

723
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,600
I'm fine.

724
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,840
Probably best if I go in first, eh?

725
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,440
Yeah.

726
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,960
Is there a key
for that padlock on here?

727
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,560
That's not supposed to be there.

728
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,960
Allow me.

729
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,440
You didn't know I could do that, did you?

730
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,280
<i>Do you feel it now?</i>

731
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,840
<i>The dissonance.</i>

732
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,880
Like something wasn't meant to be.

733
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,280
Something changed.

734
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,720
Changed from what?

735
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,000
This is today.

736
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,240
Dhillon.

737
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,520
Do you remember
this conversation?

738
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,840
How would I?

739
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,520
Well, maybe you dreamt it?

740
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,320
Maybe it's in there somewhere.

741
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,680
<i>Back of your mind.</i>

742
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,280
Ladies and gents,
can we keep back please? Back.

743
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
Will you answer a question for me?

744
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,960
It might sound strange.

745
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,560
What's the worst thing
you've ever experienced?

746
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,120
This.

747
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,160
All of this.

748
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,600
You.

749
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,480
I'm sorry Lucy.

750
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,600
I'm sorry but you've suffered
far worse than me.

751
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,960
<i>You just don't know it yet.</i>
