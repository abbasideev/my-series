1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,720
Why are you doing this?

2
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,000
I didn't do anything.

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,320
I know you didn't...

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,440
but you will
if we don't make you better.

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,440
We can change it.

6
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
We can change you, Connor,

7
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,400
but I need you to help me.

8
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't like killing...

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,040
but I've done it before,

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,200
and I will do it again if I have to,
do you understand?

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,520
Now get in the chair.

12
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,440
Just had word from St Michael's.

13
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
A 17-year-old kid
tried to kill himself last night.

14
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
Overdose.

15
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
He confessed this morning.

16
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
You were right.

17
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,840
This was retaliation.

18
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,640
Just one kid?

19
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
Seems that way.

20
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,440
One other dealer stepping up,
Aiden Stenner.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Stenner?

22
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,800
You know the name?

23
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
Yeah.

24
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,800
Yeah, I know the name.

25
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,840
Fuck.

26
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
You don't have to do this.

27
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,640
Yes, I do.

Can you see them?

37
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,560
The birds.

38
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,440
Well, they're not real.

39
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,720
You can see them, you can hear them

40
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
but you can't touch them,

41
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,080
don't bother trying.

42
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh, don't mind him.

43
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,120
That's just Roger.

44
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,040
He can't see you or me,

45
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
but he keeps me company, don't you?

46
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,880
You old shit.

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh, love, you're holding on, aren't you?

48
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,640
I lost my grip...
a long time ago.

49
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,600
You wait. Wait, wait there.

50
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,320
This is real.

51
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,160
Squeeze it.

52
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
See?

53
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
No more birds.

54
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,560
Okay. Mum,

55
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,800
it's time to put your shoes on, come on.

56
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,800
Lovely manners, your boy.

57
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,160
- What's his name?
- Isaac.

58
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,480
Mum, he's your grandson.

59
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
He didn't cry
when he was born, did he?

60
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,560
Er, come on. Let's get you in the car.

61
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Where's Ellen?

62
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,440
She's in the other room.
Do you wanna say goodbye?

63
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Oh, no, no, no, no.

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll see her later.

65
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
She brings me dinner.

66
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh, no,
you won't be here for dinner.

67
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,720
You're gonna live somewhere else now,
do you remember?

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
What? What are you saying?

69
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,480
Shush, shush.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,160
Can't hear myself think.

71
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
Are you off Sylvia?

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
Well I don't smell off.

73
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Oh, I'll have macaroni cheese for dinner.

74
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
Is that all right?

75
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll see what I can do.

76
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
See what you can do?

77
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
All right. Come on, Mum.

78
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Isaac.

79
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
Hypnotic, isn't it?

80
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,440
I had hypnosis once.

81
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,640
Didn't work.

82
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,760
They think all brains are susceptible.

83
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
You know?

84
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
How familiar are you with psychotherapy?

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,760
Not at all.

86
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
Never needed it.

87
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,160
Well, it's a team sport.

88
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,000
So I'm very glad you're here for Isaac.

89
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
Yeah.

90
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,480
I didn't abandon him
if that's what you're thinking.

91
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
She kicked me out.

92
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,120
You know, I said some things
that I didn't mean.

93
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,520
Maybe I did mean, um...
at the time.

94
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,840
How long have you been separated?

95
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,160
Nine months.

96
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,416
It wasn't supposed to be
a permanent thing but, you know,

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
it's hard when your kid is, erm...

98
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,480
well, like he is.

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
She ever talk about me?

100
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
These sessions are about Isaac.

101
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,960
No, no. I know.

102
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
I know, I know.
But I'm his dad, you know.

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Sorry, I know... I know you have...

104
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,040
you have doctor-patient confidentiality

105
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,880
or whatever you call it.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
We do.

107
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,736
Sorry. We're late, sorry.

108
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
Sorry, we're late. Sorry.

109
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,320
That's okay.
We were just getting to know each other.

110
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,640
Oh, it's okay.

112
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh. God.

113
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

114
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay.

115
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,960
So I thought we could start today
with a bit of a game, all four of us.

116
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
What do you think, Isaac?

117
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,520
All right, let's have a look,
shall we?

118
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>Escape from Anxiety Island.</i>

119
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,880
Are you okay, Isaac?

120
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,440
<i>Dr Play Bunny's Stress Maze.</i>

121
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,520
Isaac?

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Hey, what have you got there?

123
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
Where did you get this?

124
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
Grandma.

125
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, you shouldn't have this,
it's not yours.

126
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Give it back.

127
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,160
Well, it doesn't belong to you,
sweetheart.

128
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
I want it.

129
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,160
Why do you want it, Isaac?

130
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,656
- Give it back!
- Okay.

131
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,640
Don't talk like that.

132
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,760
You never talk like that.

133
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,280
Okay. Give me a cuddle, it's all right,
it's all right.

134
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay.

135
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,840

You all right?

145
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,280
Meredith ran out
in front of the car again.

146
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,240
Oh, you are joking.
Meredith Warren, get here now.

147
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
Oh, no, she's not here, she...

148
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,480
Did you run in front of Lucy's car?

149
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
Don't lie, when was this?

150
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
It was...

151
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm sorry. I think I made a mistake.

152
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,640
- What?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

153
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,000
Lucy.

154
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
You saw her, right?

155
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
Ravi.

156
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
Hey, can you give this
to Detective Dhillon?

157
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Careful it's hot.

158
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,320
Thank you.

159
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,400
You're sad.

160
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
Yeah.

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah, I am.

162
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm very sad.

163
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,560
Do you wanna go and play for a minute?

164
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,800
Come on, go and play on your trampoline.

165
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,760
I need to talk to Detective Dhillon.

166
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh.

167
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
Is this my fault?

168
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,576
- How could it be?
- I asked you

169
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,120
to find Aiden Stenner.

170
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,880
I should've just left it alone.

171
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,040
- But you were doing your job.
- Was I?

172
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,600
The night of the storm...

173
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,880
that man
was going to kill Aiden Stenner.

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,576
- You don't know that.
- I remember it.

175
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,040
I know it didn't happen,
but I remember it.

176
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,560
And it's just as real as any other memory.

177
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
You think I'm nuts?

178
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
No, I don't.

179
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
I think you're...

180
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,440
What? Clairvoyant?

181
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,840
Lots of people claim to know the future.

182
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
Make a lot of money from it.

183
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,640
No. This is not like that.

184
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,640
I can still see his body lying...

185
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,440
his eyes staring at nothing.

186
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
I didn't know
I was trading one life for another.

187
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
You weren't.

188
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,800
There were no trades or bargains.

189
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,160
It's just chaos.

190
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
Maybe some people
understand the chaos.

191
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,200
And we stopped him
from killing Aiden Stenner,

192
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,120
and then he told
you someone else was going to die.

193
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,880
It wasn't just someone.

194
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Where did you get that?

195
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
Isaac gave it to me.

196
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
He's a sweet kid.

197
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,680
They think I should take
compassionate leave.

198
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,440
And what do you think?

199
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,840
I think I should do my job.

200
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,280
Whatever that man is, he's a murderer

201
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,240
and a kidnapper and God knows what else.

202
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,480
He thinks he's righteous.

203
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,360
What makes you say that?

204
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,280
I know him.

205
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,600
I've never met him.
I have never seen his face,

206
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,840
but I know him, Ravi.

207
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,440
Gideon Shepherd?

208
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,160
Hello, Gideon.

209
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,160
Oh, my God.

210
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,040
- Lucy?
- Gideon Shepherd.

211
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,720
- What?
<i>- That's his name.</i>

212
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,720
<i>I just woke up and it was there
in my head, like, I always knew it.</i>

213
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,240
Hold on. Who are you talking about?

214
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,760
The man we're looking for,
his name is Gideon Shepherd.

215
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,680
<i>Ravi?</i>

216
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,776
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're telling me.

217
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,040
<i>He's real.</i>

218
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
I looked him up.

219
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,560
Gideon Shepherd disappeared in 1967,

220
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,080
<i>age nine,</i>

221
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
after stabbing his father to death.

222
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,400
What makes you think this is him?

223
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't think. I know.

224
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,800
I remember,

225
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,880
<i>like I remembered Slade and Aiden Stenner.</i>

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,280
- Lucy.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

227
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>His mother died five years ago
in Sterling,</i>

228
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>but he's got a younger brother, Malcolm.</i>

229
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,520
He's a surgeon and Facebook says
he lives in Cheltenham.

230
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
Do you think you could get me his address?

231
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,960
You can't just harass some nobody
because of a cold case from 50 years ago.

232
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,320
But he's not a nobody.

233
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,000
He's the... he's the brother of the man
who abducted my son.

234
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,800
And I didn't call to ask your permission.

235
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
Then why did you call?

236
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,400
To see if you wanted to come with me.

237
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,800
Put some music on if you want.

238
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
It's a long drive.

239
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,400
We shouldn't be doing this.

240
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,200
Well, nobody asked you to come.

241
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,560
You literally asked me to come.

242
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,480
No, I didn't. I just gave you the option.

243
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,640
That's not what Nick would say.

244
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,680
Sorry. 10:00 and 2:00,
I forgot you're a policeman.

245
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,440
It's okay.

246
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,240
I'll let you off with a caution.

247
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,680
Oi!

248
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,200
What are you doing?
Nobody wants a smoky bride.

249
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,480
- I'm nervous.
- You're addicted.

250
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,600
Oh, come on. You don't even smoke.

251
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Today's a very big day for me.
I'll have you know.

252
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
Lots of pressure.

253
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,320
Come on.

254
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,560
No more smoking.

255
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
Time to get married.

256
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,720
You okay?

257
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Yeah. Sorry.

258
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,520
- Eyes on the road, Chambers.
- Uh-hmm.

259
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,480
<i>Why couldn't Mum take me out?</i>

260
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,120
Because she's busy
and she's a terrible driver.

261
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
- I'll tell her you said that.
- Fine.

262
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,720
Then you'll have to teach yourself
to drive, because I'll be dead.

263
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,840
Now, focus.

264
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,240
Cockpit drill.

265
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,040
- Hmm.
- What's first?

266
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,480
Make sure it's in neutral.

267
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,920
Before that?

268
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Eat a jelly baby.

269
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,920
- Why?
- Sugar.

270
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Helps you concentrate.

271
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay.

272
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's try that.

273
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
Oh, great.

274
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,920
Who is this?

275
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,040
Malcolm Shepherd?

276
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,760
That's me.

277
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,480
DI Ravi Dhillon.

278
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,080
My friend and I would like to ask you
some questions, if that's okay with you.

279
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
What's this about?

280
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
Can we talk in private?

281
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
<i>Do you paint?</i>

282
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,080
Er, my daughter.

283
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,040
As in my daughter paints.
I don't paint my daughter.

284
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,840
You know what I mean.

285
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,480
Is there anywhere to sit down?

286
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,720
No.

287
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,200
You could have that stool.

288
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,400
I meant for you.

289
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,800
He's dead, isn't he?

290
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm sorry?

291
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
My brother,
you're going to tell me he's dead.

292
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,520
No.

293
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
Not as far as I know.

294
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,280
What's this about then?

295
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,840
Are you still in contact
with your brother?

296
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,600
Not exactly.

297
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,600
What do you mean not exactly?

298
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,360
Well, I haven't seen him,

299
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,000
not since he disappeared.

300
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
But a few years ago he started calling,

301
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,160
leaving messages,

302
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,520
and I think he was watching us.

303
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,120
What makes you say that?

304
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,880
Same car, out in the lanes,
into the drive.

305
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,120
We told the police but they said
there was nothing to go on.

306
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,000
Was it a red Nissan?

307
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,240
- How do you know that?
- Lucky guess.

308
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
When's the last time you heard from him?

309
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,760
My birthday.

310
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,920
When was your birthday?

311
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
Three weeks ago.

312
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,000
1:23 AM?

313
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,416
He only ever calls
in the middle of the night

314
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760
because he knows I won't answer.

315
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
<i>Hi, pal.</i>

316
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
<i>I don't know if you even listen
to these messages,</i>

317
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,840
<i>I must've left you a hundred by now.</i>

318
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,440
<i>I don't know if you'll hear
from me next year.</i>

319
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,400
I hope so.

320
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,440
I hope one day you'll pick up the phone
and talk to me.

321
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,920
<i>Tell me that you understand.</i>

322
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
<i>But I know you never will.</i>

323
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,720
<i>It looks like you've got a good life and
that's... that's... good enough for me.</i>

324
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,040
That's why I did it.

325
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,440
So you could live.

326
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,760
You were the first one I saved.

327
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,280
<i>If you are listening,
then happy birthday,</i>

328
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,000
<i>enjoy 58.</i>

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,040
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

330
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm gonna need to hear that again.

331
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,640
Hello?

332
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,440
Isaac.

333
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,800
Waiting for my mummy.

334
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Ms Rogers.

335
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,720
We can't go outside on our own.

336
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Isaac?

337
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Who are you talking to?

338
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
The man with the glasses.

339
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,080
Knock, knock.

340
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
Hello?

341
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Er, Mike.

342
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,000
Isaac's dad.

343
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
Oh. Right. sorry.

344
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm Ms Rogers.

345
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah. His mum asked me
to come pick him up.

346
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,960
She said that she called the office.

347
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,520
Did she?

348
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,280
Let me just check that.
They probably sent an email.

349
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,976
Sorry. I know it's awkward,
but it's policy.

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Yeah, that's... I understand.

351
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,120
Ah, here we go. Mike. Sorry.

352
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,320
- Can you confirm your surname?
- Stevens.

353
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,240
That's the one.
Sorry about that. Had to be sure.

354
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
It's no problem.

355
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,040
Will Isaac's mum be dropping him off
in the morning?

356
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,360
It's just I'd like a word.

357
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,120
You can talk to me, if it's about him.

358
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
It is.

359
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
It's nothing,

360
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
just that he's been drifting more.

361
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,720
I know that's understandable
after what happened but it's...

362
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
it's...

363
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,560
He freaks you out, don't he?

364
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,120
No. God, no. I'm not saying that.

365
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,840
No. But he has been having conversations.

366
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,736
- Uh-hmm.
- Talking to people who aren't there.

367
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Yeah. Yeah. He does that, yeah.

368
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,520
Yeah, Lucy's mum's got schizophrenia,
for what it's worth.

369
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,736
Of course, that don't explain
why he can't feel any pain.

370
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,880
You know, he burnt his hand?

371
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,040
- Uh-hmm.
- Yeah?

372
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,040
Apparently, you're not allowed
to call a child a psychopath.

373
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
That's what I read.

374
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,280
Neurodiversity can be hard to diagnose
at a young age.

375
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
Neurodiversity?

376
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,960
Ah. Well, I guess we'll just...

377
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,000
see what happens
when he gets older, eh?

378
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,240
He may surprise you.

379
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,760
Or murder me in my sleep.

380
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
Sorry. That's... that was a bad joke.

381
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,400
Erm, nice to meet you, Ms Rogers.

382
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,240
Yeah. Yeah. You too.

383
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
Could you send me that recording?

384
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,520
I really can't.

385
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,680
It's evidence.

386
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,520
Are you serious?

387
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,240
I could be in a lot of trouble already.

388
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,280
Well, can I listen to it
one last time?

389
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
<i>Hi, pal.</i>

390
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,320
<i>I don't know if you even listen
to these messages.</i>

391
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>I must've left you a hundred by now.</i>

392
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
<i>I hope...</i>

393
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,976
<i>one day you'll pick up the phone...</i>

394
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Stop, stop, stop.

395
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,640
Back.

396
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,080
<i>Hi, pal.</i>

397
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
What is it?

398
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,056
- There's a train close by.
<i>- I don't know if you listen</i>

399
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,440
<i>to these messages.
I must've left you a hundred by now.</i>

400
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,760
<i>I hope one day you'll pick up the phone.</i>

401
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,040
- Maybe.
- No. I used to live by a train line.

402
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,600
Trust me, I know that sound.

403
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,120
So he's by the tracks.

404
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,376
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.

405
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,520
No. There's not many places
a train sounds its horn.

406
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Tunnels, level crossings.

407
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,240
If we assume he's still in the area, say,

408
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,200
a hundred mile radius,

409
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,320
not many trains passing those points
at 1:23 in the morning,

410
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
give or take a couple of minutes.

411
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,600
It's worth a try, I guess.

412
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,640
All we need is a railway map
and a train schedule.

413
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,480
That's some good work, Detective Chambers.

414
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,560
Sorry.

415
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,400
It's okay.

416
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
I'll, erm, I'll send you the recording.

417
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,400
Amazing.

418
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Hello?

419
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,320
Hey.

420
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,880
Having fun?

421
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,600
Yeah. Learned all about football,
haven't you, mate?

422
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
Hey.

423
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Cuddle for Mummy.

424
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,680
Where were you?

425
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,200
Lost track of time. Sorry.

426
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah? Lost, er,
lost track of time where?

427
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,800
Just had some errands to run.

428
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
What does it matter?

429
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,640
It doesn't. Why is it secret?

430
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
It's not a secret.
I just don't want to tell you.

431
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,360
That's what a secret is.

432
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Has Isaac had dinner?

433
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,080
Er, yes, yes.

434
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
Eaten like a prince, this boy.

435
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,520
He's had sausage pasta,
just like we used to make.

436
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,000
There's, erm, there's some left
in the pot if you want some.

437
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,720
Yeah. And then I gave him some ice cream.

438
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
Hope that's okay.

439
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
We don't have any ice cream.

440
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,280
Er, I bought him
some strawberry ice cream.

441
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
That's his favourite, is that right?

442
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,920
What?

443
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,560
I was in Cheltenham.

444
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,880
In Cheltenham?

445
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,560
With Ravi... DI Dhillon. We...

446
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,000
er, we're working
on something together.

447
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,560
You... you're working on something
with the police?

448
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,760
The man that took Isaac...

449
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,720
is called Gideon Shepherd.

450
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,400
We spoke with his brother today.

451
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm sorry. What?

452
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,920
He gave us a lead.

453
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
A lead?

454
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,800
Lucy, this guy's... this guy...
this guy's a serial killer.

455
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,720
What are you thinking?

456
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,680
I'm thinking I need this to end.

457
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,120
- I need it to be over.
- It is over.

458
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,720
We've got our son back.

459
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,040
He's safe.

460
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,560
That's all that matters.

461
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
What?

462
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
Nothing.

463
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,240
Just... tell me what it is
that would make this better.

464
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,880
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

465
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,880
You want me to, erm,
hunt him down on the street?

466
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,440
'Cause I will.

467
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,320
I've got an old BB gun in my garage.

468
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,120
I just want everything
to be normal again, Mike.

469
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,720
Can you do that? Can you make it normal?

470
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,160
You're not normal, Lucy Stevens.

471
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,760
That's why I love you.

472
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,480
But if that's what you want,

473
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,040
I will try.

474
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Great.

475
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
Sausage pasta it is.

476
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
If your mum asks,

477
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,000
I gave you strawberry ice cream, okay?

478
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Okay.

479
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,480
Good boy.

480
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,640
Oh, my God.

481
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,280
Take me through it again.

482
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,680
Look, I know it's flimsy.

483
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,520
Take me through it again.
I just want you to hear yourself.

484
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,200
The logic is sound.

485
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Best-case scenario,

486
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,320
this is the man that murdered
Shane Fisher and Harold Slade.

487
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,440
This is the man
who abducted Isaac Stephens,

488
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,880
and Jonah Taylor,
and fuck knows how many other kids.

489
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,440
Worst-case, it's not him...

490
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,296
but you catch a murderer
who's evaded arrest

491
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,840
for more than 50 years.

492
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,160
It's win-win.

493
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,040
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

494
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,280
Okay. I'll pass it up to MCS.

495
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,736
So it gets buried in someone's in-tray?

496
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
I'll mark it as urgent, okay?

497
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,400
But I need you to get out of here.

498
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,920
- Nick wouldn't have wanted this for you.
- Oh, fuck you.

499
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Slam the door on the way out
if it makes you feel better.

501
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Hi.

502
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,000
I think I found him.

503
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,520
There's an abandoned repair yard
outside Melwood.

504
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,976
Fits with the timings on the message.

505
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,680
<i>You were right.</i>

506
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,840
So what now?

507
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,360
<i>My boss said he'll pass it on
to Major Crimes.</i>

508
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
What does that mean?

509
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
It means we're on our own.

510
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,520
<i>You're gonna do something?</i>

511
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,080
He kills people, Lucy.

512
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,320
He kills people and I know where he is.

513
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,440
I can stop him.

514
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,840
No. You... you can't.

515
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,360
You're gonna get hurt.

516
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,080
People are already getting hurt.

517
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,200
No one's gonna act on this unless I do.

518
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,040
<i>- Ravi.</i>
- I'll keep you updated.

519
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,680
Ravi, please listen...

520
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,520
Come on. Come on. Come on. Please.

521
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,280
Are you okay?

522
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,400
This is so stupid. Why am I nervous?

523
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,680
I have to walk into a room,

524
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,080
say some words, kiss him,
and then walk back out.

525
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
- I mean...
- Gross.

526
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,440
What could go wrong?

527
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,040
Well, you could fart.

528
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,240
My aunt farted at the altar.
Apparently, it's all anyone remembers.

529
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,880
Thanks, Rhia.

530
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,680
Are you sure you still want to marry him?

531
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,576
I mean, he did wet the bed
until he was eight.

532
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,880
Yes, you have mentioned that.

533
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,736
And his favourite film
is <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

534
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,040
He says it's <i>Goodfellas</i>
but it's <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

535
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,600
Save it for the speech.

536
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,120
Your funeral.

537
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,520
For the record,
I think you're making a huge mistake.

538
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,920
Thanks, mate.

539
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Love you.

540
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,640
Gross.

541
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,640
- Okay.
- Uh-hmm.

542
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,000
Turn it off please.

543
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,800
What's your name?

544
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,040
Connor.

545
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Connor what?

546
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,480
Connor Lawson.

547
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,840
How long have you been here,
Connor Lawson?

548
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,200
I don't know.

549
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,720
We have to go. Come on. Quickly.

550
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,960
Get as far away from here as possible.

551
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,720
Go. Now.

552
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,160
You in here, Dhillon?

553
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,240
I wasn't gonna kill him.

554
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,720
That wasn't the plan.

555
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,480
But you shouldn't have come.

556
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,840
I've had this fight before.

557
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,360
You won't win.

558
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,200
Dhillon, listen to me.

559
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,520
I can't let you stop me
but I can let you live.

560
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,440
Just stay down. Stay down.

561
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,760
Leave me alone!

562
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,640
I'm sorry.

563
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,360
Ambulance.

564
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,720
- Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. Ow.
- Are you okay?

565
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,600
Yeah. That is hot. Don't touch that.

566
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,880
That's because it's been in the oven
for eight hours.

567
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,680
It's because you need new oven gloves.

568
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,080
We need new oven gloves.

569
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,480
Do you need a hand?

570
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,120
Er, no, no.
You stay there. I got it covered.

571
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,240
Hi.

572
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,160
What are you doing tonight?

573
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,320
<i>Mike's cooking dinner.</i>

574
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,240
Why?

575
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,440
<i>He's still refusing a lawyer.</i>

576
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,600
- Has he said anything?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

577
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,320
<i>Three days and hardly a word.</i>

578
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,720
Er, are you still in hospital?

579
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
<i>They let me out. Good behaviour.</i>

580
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,080
He asked to see me.

581
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,720
He said he'd explain everything,
but not to me, not to my colleagues.

582
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,280
He said he only wants to talk
to Lucy Chambers.

583
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,720
<i>Lucy?</i>

584
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Yeah.

585
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,040
<i>How quickly can you eat dinner?</i>

586
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,840
Are you gonna sit down?

587
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,280
What's funny?

588
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,080
Nothing. Sorry. Nothing.

589
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,880
You ever been in this room before?

590
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,120
No.

591
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,400
But you feel like you have?

592
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,200
Why would I?

593
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
Déjà vu.

594
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,360
They say it's like a short circuit
in the brain.

595
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,640
Your sense of a moment plays
through your memory centre.

596
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,400
<i>Makes you feel
like you've experienced all this before.</i>

597
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,360
Jesus.

598
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,920
What the fuck do you want?

599
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,520
<i>You should have listened.</i>

600
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,280
<i>I wish you'd listened.</i>

601
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,080
<i>I could have stopped the chaos.</i>

602
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,760
But now you blame me.

603
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,400
You blame me because that's easier
than blaming yourself.

604
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,600
Blaming myself for what?

605
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,280
What happened after the storm.

606
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,080
I never met your partner
but I read his obituary.

607
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,280
He seemed like a good man.

608
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,360
I'm not trying to goad you.

609
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,520
We all have people we care about.

610
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,640
Who do you care about?

611
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,960
Your brother maybe?

612
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,800
We spoke to Malcolm. Did you know that?

613
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,200
He seems like a good man too.
Makes me wonder how you ended up this way.

614
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,600
Same upbringing, same mother, same father.

615
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,440
You left your brother messages.

616
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,560
Malcolm's got nothing to do with this.

617
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,976
You leave him alone. You understand?

618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,880
- You leave him alone.
- You said you did it for him.

619
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,880
Was Malcolm the reason
you murdered your father?

620
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,240
My father was the reason
I murdered my father.

621
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,576
Did he do something to Malcolm?

622
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,216
- Did he hurt him? Was he cruel?
- You've got absolutely no fucking idea...

623
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,976
- what you are talking about?
- Why did you murder him, Gideon?

624
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,080
Because he murdered me first.

625
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
What did you say?

626
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
All right.

627
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,880
You might want to record this.
