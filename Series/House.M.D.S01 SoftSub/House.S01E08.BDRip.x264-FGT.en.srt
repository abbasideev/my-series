1
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,830
You.

2
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Give me that.

3
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,500
What are you talking about?

4
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,030
Mrs. Miller?

5
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,990
Your phone, young lady.

6
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:12,650
I was just switching into silent
in case someone called.

7
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,440
No. You were cheating.

8
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,300
Please.

9
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,599
- Like I have to...
- Lady?

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,170
I said wait.

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,090
- Give it here.
- Sure.

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,090
Love the blouse.

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,120
I need to use the bunk room.

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,100
The bathroom? Sure.

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,050
- In 19 minutes.
- Can't do it.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,180
You got a friend in the bathroom
with the answers?

17
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,930
Fine. I'll get you an escort.

18
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,800
Don't stink up 'til I kill you.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,700
Don't stand up.

20
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,330
D-X...

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,890
D-T...

22
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,940
Hey. He's really sick.

23
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,390
- Eyes on your work.
- Are you all right?

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,800
- What is going on?
- Get some help.

25
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,959
The kid was just taking
his AP Calculus exam...

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,879
when all of a sudden he got
nauseous and disoriented.

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,580
That's the way calculus presents.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,019
Severe bradycardia.

29
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,100
Heart rate's down to 48 and falling fast.

30
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,220
- You know the kid?
- No, he just came in.

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,980
Mom real good-looking?

32
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,740
I didn't notice.

33
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,710
Then it's a mystery.

34
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,300
Not why he's sick,
but why you care so much.

35
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,420
Gift shop's open.
Buy him a card.

36
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,189
He's not responding to atropine.

37
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,789
Boys love fart jokes.

38
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,840
Find one with a good fart joke.

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,639
Tell those ER geniuses
to give him charcoal and naloxone.

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,610
- And stop following me.
- His tox screen was negative.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,340
And he's still whacked out.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,070
You don't care about the kid.

43
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,240
- You just find his illness intriguing.
- Kid's CAT scan was clean.

44
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,539
There's no sign of infection,
it's not diabetes...

45
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,090
And you don't care about him.

46
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,390
That's what you want to hear,
not in the slightest.

47
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Me neither.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,550
Means we'll be objective.

49
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,960
Maybe it's shigellosis.

50
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,441
Wouldn't account for the bradycardia.

51
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,259
Viral myocarditis?

52
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,740
Wouldn't account for the whacked out.

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,310
So, what's the differential
for a negative tox screen?

54
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,260
He was clean.

55
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,970
Unless someone screwed up the test.

56
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,240
That never happens.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
Or he O.D.'d on something
we didn't test for.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,210
One-four butanediol
would give you these symptoms.

59
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,230
- That's a new one.
- Copy machine toner.

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,760
Same punch as GHB.

61
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
A little pricier.

62
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,720
Way more dangerous.

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,890
But on the the hand, it is legal.

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
I want you to go to his house
and find his stash.

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,950
I'll bet you know all
the good hiding spots.

66
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,040
Actually, I never did drugs.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,070
Better go with him.
In case he gets high.

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,816
How much atropine is the kid getting?

69
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,200
- One ml.
- Make it two.

70
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,590
In case he needs his heart later on.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,080
Matt, did you
take any drugs this morning?

72
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,570
Pencils down.

73
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,240
Will you squeeze my fingers for me?

74
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,580
Did anyone give you anything
to help with the math test?

75
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,720
Matt?

76
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,490
I told you.
He doesn't take drugs.

77
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,980
Ms. Davis, all parents
think that about their children.

78
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,970
And they're usually wrong.

79
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,250
I gave my mom a little trouble
when I was his age.

80
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,090
I turned out okay.

81
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,410
- Even she thought so.
- I know my kid.

82
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,330
The fact that you did drugs
doesn't mean he did.

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,250
Did he go anywhere last night?

84
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
No.

85
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,339
He was home, studying.

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,230
- Any friends come over to help him?
- And bring him drugs?

87
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,730
Is that what your friends did?

88
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,360
- Ms. Davis...
- Look.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,980
I tested him myself.

90
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,700
With a home kit,
I took some hair off his brush.

91
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,370
I didn't want him to know about it,
because I do trust him.

92
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,180
Then why did you test him?

93
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,590
All he did last night was study
and argue about his college interviews.

94
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,690
He wants to be himself.

95
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,180
No haircut, ratty old clothes.
And that'll go over big.

96
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,990
Then we both gave up
and went to bed, that's it.

97
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,490
Has he ever had any
problems like this before?

98
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,580
- Any family history?
- No.

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,609
It's just me and Matt.

100
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,580
Diazepam.10 milligrams, stat.

101
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,530
What's going on?

102
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,691
Just taking some precautions.

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
He's seizing.

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Help me hold him.

105
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,250
Stay cool, Matt.
We're gonna calm you down.

106
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,250
This room is way too
clean for a teenage boy.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,140
You know why House
thinks I'm a druggie?

108
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,050
This is gonna be
a racial thing, isn't it?

109
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,300
Same reason he thinks
this kid overdosed.

110
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,250
When you're a drug addict,
you want to believe everyone else is too.

111
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,000
He's not addicted.
He has to take drugs.

112
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,040
The definition of an addict.

113
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,590
- He's in pain.
- And addicted to pain killers.

114
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,120
What a coincidence.

115
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,040
You really never did any drugs?

116
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,210
Now, this is gonna be a racial thing.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,239
Deflecting a personal question with a joke.

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Gee, who do I know that does that?

119
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,830
Yeah. I'm just like him.

120
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,930
Except for the angry, bitter,
pompous cripple part.

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,350
Maybe we should all pitch in
and get you a nice cane.

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,060
You already have
the matching gym shoes.

123
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
Check this out!

124
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,370
Mom's not too careful
with the homemade tomato sauce.

125
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,990
When the top sticks out like that,
it's a sign of bacterial contamination.

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
This one's open.

127
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,870
I am extremely disappointed.

128
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,339
I send you out for exciting
new designer drugs,

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,100
and you come back with tomato sauce.

130
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,149
Bet you paid twice as much.

131
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,380
I got mine online.

132
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,989
Matt decided to make himself
a homemade pizza for a bed time snack.

133
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,979
Source of botulism as well as a million
other toxins that cause gastroenteritis,

134
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,559
cardiac symptoms, and mental confusion.

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,729
It's not so sure about gastroenteritis.

136
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,000
But mental confusion, bring it on.

137
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Don't... what...

138
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,220
Delicious.

139
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,679
What, do you have a death wish?

140
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,069
I notice you didn't try to save me.

141
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,359
I figured you were trying
to make some kind of subtle point.

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,540
I was. Kid just started seizing.

143
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,720
Not a symptom of food-borne toxins.

144
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,070
Also not a symptom of drug use.

145
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,530
Not two hours after admission.

146
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,259
So, what would make him seize?

147
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,370
In addition to all his
other delightful symptoms.

148
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,830
Pesticide poisoning.

149
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,320
Carbamates?

150
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,169
Or organophosphates, organochlorines...

151
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,640
Inhalation or absorption?

152
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,270
Too soon to tell.

153
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,300
We should wash him down.
The poison could still be on his skin.

154
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,760
I already told the nurses.

155
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,500
I feel... good.

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
That's your complaint.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,899
Your major symptom.

158
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,370
I told her this was a waste of time.

159
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
I notice colors more.

160
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,320
And music.
I'm really hearing music.

161
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,310
I'm 82.

162
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,519
And I'm supposed to be playing canasta
with the other old ladies.

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,830
But now...

164
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,560
When I see a guy with a cute butt,

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,760
I can't stop looking at him.

166
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,870
Or a sexy beard.

167
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,900
And you figure that enjoying
cute butts is a sign of disease.

168
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,459
It all started a month ago when Mark

169
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,460
rented Gone With the Wind for me,

170
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,619
but it had the wrong DVD in it.

171
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,950
Oh, right, I forgot.
This is all my fault.

172
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,849
Of course, he was too
busy to bring it back...

173
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,906
Yeah, like I don't have a life.

174
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,400
So I watched it.

175
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,750
And it had this actor in it.

176
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,490
This kid called Ashton Kutcher.

177
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
Now...

178
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,720
I think about Ashton...
All the time.

179
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,380
All the time.

180
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,010
You remind me of him.

181
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,360
Same bedroom eyes.

182
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,460
People are always mixing us up.

183
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,519
I suppose you...
you need to check my heart...

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,859
No. No, no.
That won't be necessary.

185
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I told you.

186
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,219
But I am gonna admit you
to the hospital for tests.

187
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,250
What tests? She's just old.

188
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,850
And you're just insufferable.

189
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,149
Your mother has had
a sudden personality change.

190
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,790
She should be checked out.
I'll have a nurse come in and admit her.

191
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,190
I'm too handsome to do paperwork.

192
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,590
He's been on this medication
for over an hour.

193
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,720
Pralidoxime is very effective, it just
takes a little time for it to kick in.

194
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,419
And maybe you're wrong.
Maybe it's not a pesticide.

195
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,110
The blood work was pretty conclusive.

196
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,920
It's an organophosphate.

197
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,090
Oh, my God.

198
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,090
Move back.

199
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,470
Ms. Davis. Move back, please.

200
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,170
We're at 30.

201
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,920
Ready cardiac arrest.
Get me the pads.

202
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,230
What are you doing?

203
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,340
We're going to beat his heart for him.

204
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,830
Set it to 60.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,150
I can't stand this anymore.

206
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,369
We'll keep him on the pads
for another hour.

207
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,600
Then what?

208
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,310
Let's see what happens.

209
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,110
Well, that's not my philosophy.

210
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,750
Especially when it comes to my son.

211
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,770
And if something bad might happen,

212
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,860
I'd like to know what our options are.

213
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,916
The pralidoxime isn't doing him any good.
We're gonna have to wire his heart.

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,459
Maybe we're wrong
about the pesticides.

215
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,839
I ran his plasma again twice.

216
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,259
Are there any stronger treatments
for the organophosphate poisoning?

217
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh, damn it, you caught me.

218
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,656
We went with the weak stuff.
Just trying to save a little money.

219
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,379
Actually, one of my professors at Columbia

220
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,369
developed an experimental
treatment for the Army.

221
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,389
What's the success rate?

222
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,309
They're targeted. There's a different
hydrolase treatment for each poison.

223
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,809
We need to know if Matt got hit
with orthene or malathion...

224
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,810
What's the success rate?

225
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,970
Excellent, I'm sure.

226
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,010
It's the U.S. Army.
Be all you can be.

227
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
The point is, what are the kid's
chances without it?

228
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,979
Minimal at best, the poison's broken
the blood-brain barrier.

229
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,497
I assume "minimal at best"
is your stiff-upper-lip.

230
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,619
British way of saying
"no chance in hell."

231
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
I'm Australian.

232
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,800
You put the Queen on your money.
You're British.

233
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,250
Call your professor.

234
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,139
If we don't know what kind of
organophosphate we're targeting,

235
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,979
we don't know which hydrolase to ask for.

236
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,280
- There's over 40 organophosphates...
- Get all of them.

237
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,630
Great minds think alike.

238
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,459
By the time they get here,
we'd better know which one we need.

239
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,369
If we figure out how he got exposed,
we'll figure out what he was exposed to.

240
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,359
Well, the mom had homemade tomato sauce.

241
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,530
Call me crazy, but I'm thinking maybe...
homemade tomatoes?

242
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,139
Front yard vegetable garden.

243
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,740
Kid's out there spraying.

244
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,020
Sees a pretty girl.
Hormones raging.

245
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,270
Spray can goes off in his face.

246
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll check into it.

247
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,310
- I'll make the call.
- I'll keep the kid alive.

248
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,170
For a while, at least.

249
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,110
I'll have lunch.

250
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,310
Through the superior vena cava.

251
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,090
Into the right atrium.

252
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,260
Through the tricuspid valve.

253
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,170
Lodging into the wall
of the right ventricle.

254
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,840
Can you turn off the pads?

255
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Capturing?

256
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,939
Getting a native heart rate of 36.

257
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,070
That won't do.
Let's get him to 50.

258
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,750
"The healer with his magic powers."

259
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,810
"I could rub his gentle brow for hours."

260
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,380
"His manly chest, his stubbled jaw."

261
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,900
"Everything about him leaves me raw."

262
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,200
Psych ward's upstairs.

263
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,470
"With joy."

264
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,140
"O House, your very name
will never leave this girl the same."

265
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,600
It's not bad for an 82-year-old.

266
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,820
She asked me to give that
to her true love.

267
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,880
What can I say?
Chicks with no teeth turn me on.

268
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,990
That's... fairly disgusting.

269
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,419
And that's ageism.

270
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,230
You better watch yourself
around this babe.

271
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,740
Here are her test results.

272
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Impressive.

273
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,350
Yeah.

274
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,170
I found the pesticide.
It's disulfoton.

275
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,340
And it's empty, he used up the whole can.

276
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,390
Okay, I'll get Chase on it.

277
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,960
The poison is called disulfoton.

278
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,490
This should bond with it
and neutralize the poison.

279
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,216
Then his nervous system will start sending
the correct signals to the rest of his body.

280
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,280
But there was no disul...
well, that stuff in that can.

281
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,380
The label says disulfoton.
I can show you.

282
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,590
But you didn't test it.

283
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,249
You said Matt sprayed with it
this morning before school.

284
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,359
Matt started that garden himself
for environmental science class.

285
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,920
They weren't allowed to use pesticides.

286
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,319
Apparently, he cheated a little.

287
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,029
It was orange peel oil.
Totally organic.

288
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,659
He dumped that other stuff last winter.

289
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,089
The symptoms fit.

290
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,809
There must have been
some left in the can.

291
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,120
If you're wrong, what will
this treatment do to him?

292
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,740
Well, theoretically, it could
increase the toxicity and...

293
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,520
- But we're not wrong.
- Don't.

294
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,840
- We're not wrong.
- I can't let you do this.

295
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,510
Get a court order.

296
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,580
Unless you want to see someone killed
by sheer irrationality.

297
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,950
Maternal instinct is always irrational.
Doesn't mean it's wrong.

298
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,160
Actually, that's the definition.

299
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,809
It doesn't make hermentally incompetent.

300
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,539
She is risking her son's life

301
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,589
based on a
teenager's claim that he washed something.

302
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,579
How mentally incompetent can you get?

303
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,810
That's a brilliant legal argument.

304
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,999
Listen, have your Harvard Law dog

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,409
whip up some
high-grade, legal-sounding psychobabble...

306
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,190
"Temporary insanity brought on
by acute panic distress syndrome."

307
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,369
I don't care, we have to
give him the hydrolase.

308
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,560
Her only sign of mental illness
is that she disagrees with you.

309
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,719
Some would consider that a sign of sanity.

310
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
Not the kid. Let's ask him.

311
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,960
Oh, no, I forgot.
We can't, he's dying.

312
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,540
Get the mother to sign off
that she's refusing this treatment.

313
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
Goodbye.

314
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,589
"I, Margo Davis, have been informed of the
risks which may arise from my refusal...

315
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,230
- "... of advised medical care. I hereby release..."
- Who are you?

316
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,270
I work for the hospital.

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,919
"The Princeton Plainsboro
Teaching Hospital"

318
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,599
and its employees, agents, and other...

319
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,799
"wise from any adverse medical
conditions resulting from my refusal.

320
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,329
It is not the hospital's fault
if my son kicks off."

321
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,330
"Kicks off"?

322
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,630
I punched up the language.

323
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,780
Mostly for clarification.

324
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,019
"I understand my doctors consider
my decision to be completely idiotic..."

325
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,169
- Why are you doing this?
- "But I am convinced I know more than they do."

326
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,910
" I took a biology course in high school."
I assume that's... yeah.

327
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,470
"Besides, I enjoy controlling
every single aspect of my son's life,

328
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,710
even if it means his death."

329
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,270
Sign here, please.

330
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I brought a pen.

331
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,150
Who are you?

332
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,510
I'm the doctor who's
trying to save your son.

333
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,600
You're the mom who's letting him die.

334
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,950
Clarification.
It's a beautiful thing.

335
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,870
She rethought her position.

336
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,850
- Start him on the hydrolase.
- No.

337
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,580
We've got a problem.

338
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,090
On three. One, two, three.

339
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,390
Heart rate's 49.

340
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,109
O2 stat, 84 and falling.

341
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,200
Saline, atropine, and diazepam now.

342
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
His name's Chi Ling.

343
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,820
He was admitted 12 minutes ago.

344
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,389
Identical symptoms as Matt.

345
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,830
Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.

346
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Bag.

347
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,750
Matt's next door neighbor, by any chance?

348
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,180
They live ten miles apart.

349
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
Apparently, they don't
even know each other.

350
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,290
We live in an apartment.

351
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,650
We have two bamboo trees.
No pesticides.

352
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,290
Just dried seaweed for fertilizer.

353
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,119
The second kid's heart
is almost as weak as Matt's.

354
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,700
We may need to get it wired up too.

355
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,719
And I don't know how long
Matt's brain will hold up.

356
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,059
His heart's not pumping enough oxygen.

357
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,719
- How much are you giving him?
- 80%.

358
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Make it 90.

359
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,249
We're risking damage to his retina.

360
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,610
What the heck, do it anyway.

361
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,410
He's a calculus student.
Probably likes having a brain.

362
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,800
I'll have Foreman take care of it.

363
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,650
I'm the primary.

364
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah, but the mom wants to get rid of you.

365
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,990
And you know me.
I'm a people-pleasing kinda guy.

366
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
What, she complained?

367
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,579
- About me?
- She went to the principal.

368
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,530
Told Cuddy you took drugs in high school.

369
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,199
This is gonna go
on your permanent record.

370
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,629
I was trying to get information.
It was a strategy.

371
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,360
She also used the word "slacker."

372
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,540
You want to come in, smoke a little weed?

373
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,010
Watch some MTV?

374
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,266
The high school has no idea
what could've happened.

375
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,790
You're sure that Chi
didn't sneak onto Matt's tomato patch?

376
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,729
Maybe they sniffed
disulfoton together to get high.

377
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,079
Same school, different grades,

378
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,509
different cliques. Different everything.

379
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,016
Managed to get poisoned together.
They must have something in common.

380
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,826
Their classes aren't even
in the same building.

381
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,730
They don't even eat lunch
in the same lunchroom.

382
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,300
How do they get to school?

383
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,890
Unless you're with the board, the police,
or the union, I don't care who you are.

384
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,049
Sir, we need to test the bus
for chemical residue.

385
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,730
And I need to pick up the basketball team.

386
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,090
You got a problem with that?
Call my supervisor.

387
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,239
Two kids were poisoned
on your bus this morning.

388
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,400
They're dying.

389
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
My God.

390
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,410
The things he said.

391
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,490
Dr. House wanted your son
to get the medicine he needed.

392
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,259
And he was willing to do whatever it took
to make that happen.

393
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,900
The wrong kind of medicine.

394
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,830
He didn't know that.

395
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,139
At the time, it was our only choice.

396
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,110
He would've known
if he had listened to me.

397
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
He listened.

398
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,420
He just assumed you were wrong.

399
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,220
But to be honest, that's true
of most of our patients.

400
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,870
You're just as pompous
and superior as he is.

401
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,820
Matt is back row right. The Asian
kid, uh, first or second row left.

402
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,800
Look, I got this rash in
kind of my groin region.

403
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,900
It's not a symptom.

404
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,780
Neither is being obnoxious.
Looks like you're in the clear.

405
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,100
So who poisoned him?

406
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,809
We're not sure yet
if it was done on purpose.

407
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,859
Oh, yeah? You oughta see
these little bastards

408
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,859
screaming and punching
each other all day long...

409
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,900
Did you happen to notice if anyone
was doing any spraying near the bus route?

410
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,550
Oh, yeah, there was this truck down by
the pond doing something or other,

411
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,460
smelled kinda funny too.

412
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,790
Oh! Dr. House.

413
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,660
Well, it took ya long enough.

414
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,239
- We've been waiting here...
- Mr. Adams.

415
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,970
Would you step outside for a moment?

416
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
Why?

417
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,860
Because you irritate me.

418
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
He is my son, Doctor.

419
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,770
He's just a little cranky from not eating.

420
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Fine.

421
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,830
Mrs. Adams, have you had
any recent sexual activity?

422
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
What?

423
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,250
I don't suppose fantasies count.

424
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,720
Oh, my God.

425
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,250
Unfortunately, I've hit
kind of a dry spell.

426
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,779
Only for the last...
oh, I don't know, 15 years.

427
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,740
See, she's confused.

428
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,479
My father died eight years ago.
Heart attack.

429
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,900
Not in bed, dear.

430
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Why do you ask?

431
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,599
Because you have tested
positive for syphilis.

432
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,230
That's impossible.

433
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,030
And insulting.

434
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,910
I don't think it's the first time
that Mom has heard this diagnosis.

435
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,180
"Cupid's Disease."

436
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,530
That's what we used to call it.

437
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,800
When did you get it?

438
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,820
1939.

439
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,600
Prom night, I think.

440
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,630
He had a Chevrolet.

441
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,910
It was before I met your father.

442
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,210
You said that...

443
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,960
You said Dad was your first love.

444
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,250
He was.

445
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,140
We're talking about sex.

446
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,270
- But I was treated.
- Which suppressed it.

447
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,480
In your case, for 60 years.
But now, it's back.

448
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,860
And the spirochetes that cause syphilis
are eating away at your brain cells.

449
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,080
Oh.That's revolting.

450
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,770
It's not as revolting as Chlamydia.

451
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,580
That's got seepage.

452
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,260
And it's the 21st century.

453
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,740
We got flying cars, robot dogs.
And Penicillin.

454
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
High dose regime for two
weeks, you're cured.

455
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,729
I can't believe this.

456
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,390
Yeah, well, pinch yourself.

457
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,250
I guess for the next two weeks,
I'd better practice safe sex.

458
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,020
You'll be fine.

459
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Just feed that cranky kid.

460
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,959
The county's worried about West Nile,

461
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,500
so they sprayed ethyl-parathion
right next to the bus route.

462
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,530
Do you have the hydrolase
for ethyl-parathion?

463
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,880
Yeah. Only one problem.

464
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,009
Matt's mother faxed his records to the CDC.

465
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,570
She refuses to let us do anything
until she hears back from them.

466
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,739
Well, you're getting good
at this god-like doctor racket.

467
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,560
Why don't you talk her out of this lunacy?

468
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,140
She's not really a big fan of mine.

469
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,210
Or mine.

470
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,790
Well, only one man left in the bullpen.

471
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,650
And he throws like a girl.

472
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,480
I hate sports metaphors.

473
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,230
Give her the high, hard one.

474
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,759
We really think the
hydrolase is the only...

475
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,419
I'm thinking about
transferring Matt out of here.

476
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,439
Miss Davis, your son is very sick.

477
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,859
He won't survive a transfer.

478
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,460
I'm getting a second opinion
from the Center for Disease Control.

479
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,830
Right.

480
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,419
Look, when my grandmother got sick...

481
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,950
What, you're gonna tell me some
tough decision you had to make?

482
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,489
I know how hard this is for you.

483
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,990
Maybe embroider the story
a little, make it fit?

484
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,659
I can't imagine being in your position.

485
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,920
Honesty. A kind
of vulnerable honesty.

486
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,859
That's your thing. And the looks.

487
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Oh, boy.

488
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,290
They send a single woman
to hustle the single mom.

489
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,090
Actually, they sent a doctor.

490
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,679
To tell you that if your son
doesn't get this treatment,

491
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,230
there's a good chance he'll die.

492
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,250
That what House said about
a treatment that would've killed Matt.

493
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,379
You've gotta do better than that.

494
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,380
No.

495
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,730
It's on you.
You need to do better.

496
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,240
Right now, yes or no.

497
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,700
I don't know.

498
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,610
Figure it out.

499
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Wait.

500
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Nurse!

501
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,610
- Help!
- OK. Coming.

502
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,840
He's seizing. Suction.

503
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,210
My son!

504
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
Coming.

505
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Diazepam.

506
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,610
Ten milligrams.

507
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,370
He's not responding.
Another ten milligrams.

508
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,470
You're killing him!

509
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
You're killing him!

510
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,679
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here!

511
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,560
Come on, M'dame.

512
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,269
Their hearts are barely pumping.

513
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,300
Their lungs are shot.

514
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,080
Now they're showing liver toxicity.

515
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,930
I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us
for any Doctor of the Year awards.

516
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,540
Only explanation is they got poisoned
by something besides ethyl-parathion.

517
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,739
Then the hydrolase
would release the neurotoxins

518
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,710
instead of bonding with them.

519
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,600
The only thing they have
in common is the bus.

520
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,200
Except their symptoms.

521
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,726
Given their severity and the fact
their cardiac symptoms...

522
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,739
are getting worse much
faster that their other ones,

523
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,650
what does that tell us?

524
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,709
The poison was probably
absorbed through the skin.

525
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,020
They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00.

526
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,486
- When were they poisoned?
- Absorption through the skin,

527
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,179
anywhere from three to eight hours.

528
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,189
In a case that bad,
more like one-and-a-half to four.

529
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,600
So Matt was poisoned before 7:15.

530
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,290
Before he got on the bus.

531
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,340
You're thinking each kid
got poisoned in his own house?

532
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,350
- Two separate exposures?
- What do teenage boys doing the morning?

533
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,220
Besides... the obvious.

534
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,330
Wake up. Go to the bathroom.

535
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,230
Then... the obvious.

536
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,876
Then check their zits in the mirror.

537
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,380
Do they both use the same acne cream?

538
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,199
Because acne cream contains lanolin,
which could have pesticides.

539
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,139
And you're thinking
they both bought the same product...

540
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,249
It was contaminated.
Shaving cream.

541
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,579
Chi doesn't look like he shaves.

542
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
- But he sweats.
- Deodorant could contain lanolin.

543
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,990
Do these people have animals?

544
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,580
Chi has a dog, Matt has a cat.

545
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,079
Fleas, flea powder...

546
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,590
Okay,

547
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,269
go to their houses, check for anything
that might've touched their skin

548
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,710
between the time they got up
and the time they went to school.

549
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,310
And I'm running low on tomato sauce.

550
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,670
Oh! Dr. House!

551
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Hello.

552
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,320
I sent you home.

553
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
Well, I came back.

554
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,770
I took a cab,

555
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,979
so my son wouldn't try
to chaperone us this time.

556
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm sorry, but...

557
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,199
the fact that the sexual
pleasure center of your cerebral

558
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,560
cortex has been overstimulated
by spirochetes...

559
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,450
It's a poor basis for a relationship.

560
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,310
I learned that one the hard way.

561
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Doctor,

562
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,090
these feelings that I've been having,

563
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,410
is it all because of the syphilis?

564
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Yes.

565
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,560
Here's the prescription you gave me.

566
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,740
Well, it's not likely
I'm going to infect anyone.

567
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
No.

568
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,810
But it'll kill you.

569
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,380
Well, gotta go sometime. And...

570
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,900
I really don't want to play canasta
for the rest of my life.

571
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,750
I like feeling sexy again.

572
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,940
And making a fool out of myself
with handsome young doctors.

573
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,770
Do you think that I would've given you this
if it would stop you from flirting with me?

574
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,929
Well, but if I'm cured...

575
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,530
Then all the spirochetes will die off.

576
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,260
But the little pieces of your cerebral
cortex that have been destroyed...

577
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,730
won't grow back.

578
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,490
You're brain-damaged.

579
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,300
Doomed to feeling good
for the rest of your life.

580
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Really?

581
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,990
- Well, thank you...
- Georgia.

582
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,900
When I stop being contagious,

583
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,940
I'll come by for a checkup.

584
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,210
Yeah.

585
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Matt uses Sure.

586
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,310
Chi uses Old Spice.

587
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,520
- No zit cream.
- Lucky kid.

588
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,770
- Floral air freshener.
- Doesn't matter.

589
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,870
When's the last time you heard
of a teenage boy using air freshener?

590
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Pert shampoo.

591
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,010
Johnson's over here.

592
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,849
Matt's mom would make
him use air freshener.

593
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,870
There are limits to a mother's power.

594
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,090
Even hers.

595
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,650
Just check.

596
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Negative on the floral.

597
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,290
Matt's A.L.T.s are up to 800.

598
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,350
If they get any higher,
we can toss his liver.

599
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,060
Yeah.

600
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,339
No matches on flea powder
or underarm deodorant.

601
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,750
- Or any other kind of deodorant.
- What about shampoo?

602
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,639
No to shampoo, bar soap,
dish soap, dish detergent...

603
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,010
How about laundry detergent?

604
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,936
Maybe they both washed
their clothes this morning.

605
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,650
I'll check.

606
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,039
You know, if we cure Matt,

607
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,080
he can use his close brush
with death on his college essays.

608
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,810
Admission guys love that stuff.

609
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,260
That's how you got in, right?

610
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,840
Jailhouse diary.

611
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,120
- TKO.
- TKO.

612
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,480
- Liquid?
- Liquid, 128 ounces.

613
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,829
128.

614
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,190
- Yellow jug, "Special...
- environmentally safe formula."

615
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,260
- It's the same.
- Bring in the detergent.

616
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,759
The detergent was
contaminated with pesticides?

617
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,540
Which soaked into their clothes
and got absorbed into their skin.

618
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,560
Hi.

619
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,399
Listen, the clothes
your son wore today,

620
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,860
he washed them this morning, right?

621
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,150
What?

622
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,770
Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.

623
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,040
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE.)

624
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,320
My wife said he didn't.

625
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,739
Well, then I'm betting he washed them
last night without you knowing.

626
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,509
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE.)

627
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,690
He doesn't even know how
to turn on the machine.

628
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,450
And those clothes were new.
Nobody washed them.

629
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,880
His clothes are all new?

630
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,350
The ones he wore today, yes.
Never washed.

631
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Now what?

632
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,970
What about Matt's clothes?
Were they new?

633
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,590
They're ratty old jeans, I think.

634
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,670
They've been bagged and taken downstairs.

635
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,530
- Davis.
- Yes, they're Matt's.

636
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
And they're old.

637
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,290
And yet the label isn't faded
in the slightest.

638
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,340
Fake old.

639
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,580
Hundred dollars for the homeless look.

640
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,860
What, kids aren't pretentious in England?

641
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,239
Chi was wearing a different brand.

642
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,960
How could they both have been contaminated?

643
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,759
That is a question for the ages.

644
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,100
Meantime, get these tested.

645
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,320
I never bother to wash new clothes
before I wear them.

646
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,980
Right. Your wife does.

647
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,139
She likes you feeling
nice and comfortable.

648
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,130
Hey, I'm a man.
I don't have time for laundry.

649
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,340
I'm savin' lives here.

650
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,060
No, she doesn't wash them either.

651
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,800
So your skin absorbs a little dye,

652
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,160
- the odd chemical here and there...
- You know me.

653
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,119
Mr. Livin' on the Edge.

654
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,259
And judging by the
self-importance of your strut,

655
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,259
you have identified the
chemical in question.

656
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Phosdrin.

657
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,419
- Hit him with the hydrolase.
- Chi's parents said yes, but...

658
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,930
Mighty Mom said no.

659
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,350
She's gonna feel like a million bucks
when Chi lives and her son dies.

660
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
Send Cameron.

661
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,406
She's the only one of you
who's managed to talk her into anything.

662
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,519
Not this time.

663
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Matt's mom won't make a move
until she gets that opinion from the CDC.

664
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,140
And Godot would be faster.

665
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
What is this?

666
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,840
Thought I'd hang out.

667
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,590
In case you change your mind.

668
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,550
Then I could give Matt
the medicine right away.

669
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,680
Don't worry, I've got time.

670
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,410
The CDC promised they'd call.

671
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,910
And I'm sure they will.

672
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Maybe tomorrow.

673
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,770
Maybe the day after.

674
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,300
Takes time to review faxed records.

675
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,720
Then they'll probably tell you they can't
make a decision based on faxed records.

676
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,140
This is Suzy.

677
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,790
She's never gonna marry him.

678
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
No money.

679
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,480
What makes you think
you're right this time?

680
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,600
Same reason as last time.

681
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,660
If you wanna see how the other
kid does first, that's okay.

682
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,370
Might help you.

683
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,980
Although, there's a real good chance...

684
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
What?

685
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,620
Matt might "kick off"?

686
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,830
That's a little blunt.

687
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,990
I was gonna say "run out of time", or...

688
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,180
just kind of let my voice trail off.

689
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,070
Hello?

690
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,530
Yes, this is Margo Davis.

691
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,200
But you have his records.
I sent them.

692
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,140
Yes, I understand.

693
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,390
They can't help me.

694
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,240
They haven't seen him.

695
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,870
- They can't make a decision...
- Give it to him.

696
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,470
"The CDC is unable to give
an opinion at this time, ma'am."

697
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,330
"We're gonna have a doctor
in your area next week."

698
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,960
You fooled her with that?

699
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
House!

700
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,460
So I'm gonna be cured?

701
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,810
As long as you don't wear
any more poisoned pants.

702
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,020
I'm sorry, Mom.

703
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,990
I knew the pants were stolen.

704
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,150
They were only five bucks.

705
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,156
You're gonna give me hell, aren't you?

706
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,840
Oh, Honey,
I'm just glad you're alive.

707
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,890
Let's get you home so you can rest.

708
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,880
Maybe I am too hard on you.

709
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,770
You don't have to make up
that test 'til next week.

710
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,770
You can stay in bed and
work on your applications.

711
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,580
Some guy was selling pants
off the back of his truck near the school.

712
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,499
When he wasn't busy as a
clothing entrepreneur,

713
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,620
he did day labor at a
cornfield out on Route 1.

714
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,860
Used the same truck for both jobs.

715
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,970
He spilled pesticide on the pants
and was too lazy to clean up.

716
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,150
The real question is,
why are you still here?

717
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,840
Why aren't you out there
making up with the joyful mother?

718
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,990
- Why would I do that?
- No reason at all.

719
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,320
If you don't care about her.

720
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,010
Or her son.

721
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,130
Oh, Dr. House.

722
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,840
The CDC called.

723
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Again.

724
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:45,990
Who are those guys?

725
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,570
Oh, they're the arrogant jerks
that saved your life.
