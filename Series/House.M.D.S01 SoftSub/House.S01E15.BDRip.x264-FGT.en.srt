1
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,660
If you testify,
no one can protect you.

2
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:16,729
Especially the Feds.

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,659
- We'll keep you safe, Joey.
- Right. Witness Protection.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,280
This great new life he's giving you?

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,360
You're sacking groceries at some
goat-town Stop and Shop

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,209
when one of the Talli guys comes up
and puts two in the back of your skull.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,569
Counselor, are you advising a witness

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,410
to withhold evidence from
a federal grand jury?

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,170
He came forward. He volunteered.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,190
I'm advising him not to testify
until I'm satisfied you can protect him.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,890
Hey, you guys mind?
I got money on this.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,839
What do you want?
We gave you everything you asked for.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,959
I asked for pasta.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,380
You got steak, enjoy it.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
What are you doing?

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,430
Where's your quit candy?
I just gave you a pack.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,310
Yeah, sorry, I forgot.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,109
Joey, whatever they give
us, what they tell you,

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,270
you get popped, what am I going to do?
Sue them?

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,520
That's not what this is about.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
You're gonna miss me.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,390
- I'm your lawyer, Joey.
- You're my brother.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,850
And I do this, you know,
I go into Witness Protection,

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,640
we're never gonna see each other again.

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,530
That doesn't bother you?

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Kills me.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,870
Hey, I gotta take a leak.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
You all right?

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,010
Yeah, yeah,
just, little dizzy...

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,180
Get some air.

31
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,370
And hot.

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:52,990
Joey!

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,990
What did you say to him?

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,870
Yeah, nice try.

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,440
Come on.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,819
Let go of me! Let go of me,
can't you see he's sick?

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,440
Joey! Joey!

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,930
Something's wrong with him!

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,200
Come on, you're not
getting out of this that easy!

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,890
Either you're dead,
or you're testifying.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Don't have it.

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Budget?

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,560
House has been very busy.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,189
Saving New Jersey
from leprosy, yes, I know.

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,140
Getting me his numbers,
that's your job.

46
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,980
We're in a meeting.

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,160
Need the lawyer.

48
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,540
Who'd you kill?

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,349
Nobody, but it's not even lunch.
Got served with a federal court order.

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,300
Some witness went into a coma and
they want me to take a look at it.

51
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
What?

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,190
They want you to examine a sick person?

53
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,650
This is a public relations nightmare.

54
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,840
Folks think our staff do
that kind of thing around here...

55
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,850
this place would be
crawling with sick people!

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,950
I'm a doctor, I'm not a lapdog for
the feds. I don't play fetch.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,060
Nobody tells you what to do.
Am I right, Dr. Cuddy?

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,730
You have three choices:
Hire a lawyer to fight the order,

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,320
treat the guy, or go to jail for contempt.
Up to you.

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,760
Jail. You'd like that.
No more naughty schoolgirl.

61
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,550
Conjugal visit,
that's her new fantasy.

62
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,050
We're not leaving until he's gone or you
show me one good reason for keeping him.

63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,050
He's really out of it, huh?

64
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,030
Causes of coma:
Metabolic, structural...

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,610
He had his stomach pumped!
Why would they do that?

66
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,910
Rule out poisoning.

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,679
Huh. Not the typical first guess.

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,490
No, the first guess was faking it.

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,310
Patient's a federal witness,
reluctant, I'm assuming.

70
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,050
He's also an 8 on the Glasgow coma scale.

71
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,580
That's barely alive.
Pretty tough to fake it.

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,489
Any recent history of head trauma?
Bad car accident, fall?

73
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,919
They tell me no,
but do an MRI to be sure.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,149
Metabolic causes.
Liver, kidney, diabetes...

75
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,110
Check for everything,
feds are paying.

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,580
We're gonna turn a profit
on this one, boys.

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,220
Dr. House, Bill Arnello.

78
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm a lawyer,
I represent Mr. Smith.

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
What's wrong with him?

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,630
Do I come to you with my problems?

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,790
He's also my brother.

82
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,960
What, you changed your name?

83
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,609
"Smith" wasn't good enough for you?

84
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,570
His name's Joey,
he's my only brother.

85
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,340
He's important to you, got it.

86
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,130
So, no placebos for him,
we'll use the real medicine.

87
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,610
Well, this was fun,
let's do it again soon.

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,290
Brother in the Mafia?

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,700
So, just Joey?

90
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,100
I was hoping for a nickname.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,340
Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench.

92
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,890
People know where I am.

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,520
I want you to do your job.

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,660
Diagnose him, fix him,
and keep him here.

95
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,169
We're a bit of a specialized hospital.

96
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,160
We generally only deal with patients
when they're actually sick.

97
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,729
If you release my brother
to the government, and he

98
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,030
does what they want, even
if you fix him, he's dead.

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,020
I need time to convince him of that.

100
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Good news is,

101
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,990
if you screw up you don't have to
worry about a malpractice suit.

102
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,390
If he's dead, one by one,

103
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,460
I'll take away the things you love
'till there's nothing left.

104
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,190
So, on the Mafia thing, that's a yes.

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,910
Did House seem weird to you?

106
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,940
Are you expecting him to be weird?

107
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,890
We spoke about how we felt.

108
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,449
- You told him you liked him?
- No, of course not.

109
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,829
What are you talking about, then?

110
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,850
I asked him if he liked me.

111
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,610
Why would you do that?

112
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,130
Because... I like him.

113
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,289
You like him, like him?

114
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,700
Doesn't matter, he doesn't like me.

115
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey, he doesn't like anybody.

116
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,010
And nobody likes him.

117
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,990
MRI showed a subdural hematoma.

118
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,790
Bleeding around his brain caused pressure
inside his head which caused the coma.

119
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,380
These look like pseudomembranes.
Those take time to form.

120
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,180
If it was an old injury
it wouldn't have caused the coma.

121
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,490
Patient history indicates
he was hit with a tire iron in 1996.

122
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,889
Brother says he was
changing a tire and it slipped.

123
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,150
Subdural hematoma placed where this one is,
it could have caused his coma.

124
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,320
What about his liver?

125
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,860
LFTs are slightly elevated.

126
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,319
Key word is slightly. As in, not high enough
to cause the coma. It's the subdural.

127
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,480
I say we evacuate the cavity,
see if he wakes up.

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,880
The neurologist thinks it's his brain, wants
to open up his head. Frankly, I'm shocked!

129
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,939
You get to use the big boy drill
and Daddy's big red toolbox.

130
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
No drilling.

131
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Hi.

132
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,690
Mr. Smith!

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Call me Joe.

134
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,710
Can you not do that?

135
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,380
So, we're clear about the no drilling?

136
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,410
He's okay now, he can leave.

137
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,860
I'm not releasing him.

138
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,830
Because the brother doesn't want you to?

139
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,060
Or because he had an unexplained
coma, which sounds better?

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,089
The hematoma caused the coma.

141
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,090
That's a catchy diagnosis,
you could dance to that.

142
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,630
I think Chase is right.

143
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,830
It still should be evacuated,
but it's not an immediate threat.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,810
Cameron's my girl.

145
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
I'd release him.

146
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,109
Are you disagreeing with me because...

147
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,610
I'm disagreeing because
that's my medical opinion.

148
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Of course it is.

149
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,849
But unless I've been
named as the fourth part of

150
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,079
the Axis of Evil,
invaded and occupied,

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,190
this is still not a democracy.
He's staying.

152
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,430
Send for Hepatitis serologies
and an autoimmune panel.

153
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,820
Hey. I'm with you.

154
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,629
Old enough to drink,

155
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,369
old enough to do something
really stupid and make yourself a baby.

156
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,010
He's my brother. I'm watching him
while my parents are in Barbados.

157
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,190
He's having trouble breathing
and there's a lot of wheezing.

158
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,130
Whistling, technically.
Upper airways, nose.

159
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,789
If he's got the croup,
that could become meningitis, right?

160
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,590
Absolutely.

161
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:47,570
I was just studying and all of a sudden
I hear him crying and sounding all weird.

162
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,170
My parents are going to kill me.

163
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,610
I doubt it.

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
You don't know them.

165
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,410
No, I doubt you were studying
while your parents were away.

166
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,820
Hello, officer.

167
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,280
You might want to rinse this off
before you let him play with it again.

168
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,480
What happened? Where is he?

169
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,280
Vogler called admitting, admitting called
Justice, Justice came and took him away.

170
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,550
And who called Vogler?

171
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,020
He loses money.

172
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,370
So does ophthalmology.
Who cares, this is a hospital.

173
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,620
You can't just cut a department!

174
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,970
You can't control him.

175
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,670
I am the only one that can control him.

176
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,040
Dr. House in the House!

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,909
Impeccable timing as always.

178
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,349
You had no authority
to release my patient.

179
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,820
My colleague has just informed me
that she has a singular talent.

180
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,890
You are just in time
for a demonstration.

181
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,869
Dr. House, from what I understand, your...

182
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,519
From what you understand?

183
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,549
He's not your patient.

184
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,479
How the hell do you understand anything?

185
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
That's sad.

186
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,929
You're not even a doctor.

187
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,570
John Smith is here only
because of court order.

188
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,129
I had the records faxed to the judge;
She recinded the order.

189
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,810
Why bother, just to piss me off?

190
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,760
- Keeping the government off our ass.
- Hmm. Yeah.

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,020
That makes no sense for
a public institution.

192
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,760
Okay.

193
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Okay what?

194
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,760
Okay, sir. Carry on.

195
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,799
He really cares about his patients.

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,670
Yeah, and he just walked out of here
with nothing. Something's up.

197
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,500
He just started vomiting and passed out.

198
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,600
35-year-old male,
vital signs are stable now.

199
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,400
Gave him 2 liters en route.

200
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,040
He's just released
from here two hours ago.

201
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,190
You said he was good to go.

202
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,980
So, your junior G-man badge
isn't looking so good.

203
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,240
His liver's worse.

204
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,810
Comatose?

205
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,931
No, completely different symptoms
than the first time.

206
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,189
Serology tests came back
positive for Hep-C.

207
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,750
Hep-C is a chronic condition.

208
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,039
You don't think
this is an acute situation?

209
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,270
Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain,
Hep-C explains everything.

210
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,220
Except for the suddenness of the onset.

211
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,840
What's wrong with the timing?

212
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,280
You get home one night.
Your wife hits you with a baseball bat.

213
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,529
Likely cause is the fact you haven't
thanked her for dinner in eight years,

214
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,450
or the receipt for fur handcuffs
she found in your pants.

215
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,709
Sudden onset equals proximate cause.

216
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,979
He also has high estrogen
levels in his blood.

217
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,260
That's indicative of
a chronic condition, not acute.

218
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,509
One test.
What do his other liver tests tell us?

219
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,500
Normal albumen levels point toward acute.

220
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,210
And why is her test better than mine?

221
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,430
Because she's cuter.
Though it's close.

222
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,779
Do a liver biopsy. When the results come
back we'll know what we're looking at.

223
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,110
Why wait to treat the Hep-C?

224
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,159
If I'm right,
Joey gets better that much faster.

225
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,850
Right. Then he gets to testify,
and you get a gold star from Cuddy.

226
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,140
Then what's the downside?
Or is that the downside.

227
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,430
Do I have a reason for
not wanting you to get any stars?

228
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,200
Fine, start the treatment.

229
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,700
It's all your idea.
Don't even mention my name.

230
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,730
There's nothing wrong
with your theory, go.

231
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,800
But in the "humor me" department,
get a biopsy while you're at it.

232
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,650
Foreman, we need to talk.

233
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,190
You're off the case.

234
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,819
What? Why?

235
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,870
Somebody told Vogler that
I lied to the transplant committee.

236
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,410
You think I did?

237
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,410
You're too careful.

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
You wouldn't jump ship
unless you knew what was in the water.

239
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,559
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

240
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,290
But I want Vogler to
think I think it's you.

241
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,969
And I want Cameron and Chase and
Cuddy and Wilson and the nursing

242
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,760
staff and the cashier in the
parking lot to think that, too.

243
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
Right.

244
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,180
The bloodtests show
you have Hepatitis C.

245
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,400
It's a virus that infects the liver.

246
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,250
No way.

247
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,810
Well, it's not all bad news.
It can often be cured,

248
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,469
and even if not, it's manageable.

249
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,729
How'd my brother get this?

250
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,589
Usually it involves the exchange
of bodily fluids, the...

251
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,319
Bodily fluids, what are you talking about?

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,049
There are many ways
the virus can be transmitted.

253
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,209
Sharing needles,
blood transfusions...

254
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,210
Hey!

255
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,680
Nobody talks to my brother like this, okay?

256
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,479
Fine. I've no idea how he got it.
But he has Hepatitis-C.

257
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,120
We're going to start him on Interferon...

258
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,250
He doesn't have it, don't mention
it again, don't treat him for it.

259
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,700
House has some directed donations,
foundation support...

260
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
It's around here...

261
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,490
He makes you miserable.

262
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,689
Eight years he's worked here, never made
a dime for you, never listened to you.

263
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,690
He can changed, he's...

264
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,710
He hasn't changed in eight years.

265
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,870
Either he can't change,
or you can't change him.

266
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,460
You have no idea
how many times he's lied to you,

267
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,770
undercut your authority,
made you look like crap to other doctors.

268
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,260
Yes, I hate him, and here I am,
desperately trying to protect his job.

269
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
What does that tell you?

270
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,290
That you don't hate him.

271
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,629
I do not protect people I like.

272
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,269
I protect people who are
assets to this hospital.

273
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,710
No. That's me.

274
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,420
You, you're softer.

275
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,623
Right. There are three female
Chiefs of Medicine at major hospitals

276
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:21,159
in this country and we all got
there using our feminine wiles.

277
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,079
It's human nature to
wanna protect people we like.

278
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,189
I don't like him!

279
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,529
We think if we can just
form the right team,

280
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,089
we'll all get along, be
able to pull the boat...

281
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,859
I don't get along with him!

282
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,120
Well, this is not a team, it's not a boat,

283
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,301
it's not a machine that has a lot of parts
that have to work together.

284
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,110
The metaphors are all crap.
This is a business. That's all it is.

285
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,830
You like him,
that's bad for business.

286
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,780
Ah, this is all my fault.

287
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,760
Took another homework break with Betty Lou?

288
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,910
No, last week I showed him a magic trick.

289
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,560
Pulled a quarter out of his nose.

290
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,150
It's a classic.

291
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,130
Yeah, now he won't stop
shoving stuff up there.

292
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,310
Dr. House.

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,080
Got a crisis here!

294
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
It's okay.

295
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Stop!

296
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,220
It's a neat trick.

297
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,730
You have to believe
you'll actually hurt them.

298
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,770
Your people insulted my brother.

299
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,229
What, they put romano
in the parmesan cheese shaker again?

300
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,970
Said he was a crackhead
or a homo or something.

301
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Those idiots.

302
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,710
How many times am I going to have to
send them through sensitivity training?

303
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,250
Nobody's saying he's a homo,
that would be really, really bad.

304
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,540
So let's put a nice,
friendly spin on it.

305
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,610
Let's go with:
He got raped in prison.

306
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,830
I saw the jailhouse tats,
put it together with the blood tests...

307
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,950
There were rumors, but
Joey never said anything about it.

308
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,410
If people find out
he's being treated for Hep-C?

309
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,220
Feds get that chart, someone says
something to somebody, word'll get out.

310
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,300
And then Joey's manhood,
his rep is destroyed.

311
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,179
You're worried about how his coworkers
will react in the Walmart in Demoyne.

312
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,150
He's not going into Witness Protection,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

313
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,689
Listen, I don't know
if you know about this,

314
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,540
but mob businesses sometimes
keep two sets of books.

315
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,910
One legit, one not.

316
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Exactly.

317
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,270
You jerking my chain?

318
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,800
Doctors are busy, sometimes they forget to
write things down, it happens all the time.

319
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Thanks.

320
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,950
Oh, and...

321
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,590
whatever you're not giving him
for whatever he doesn't have,

322
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,690
is that going to fix him?

323
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
I doubt it.

324
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,630
On your way to polish Vogler's car?

325
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,489
Gone are the days of the grumpy
old docs seeing patients

326
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,320
in the basement of his house,
getting paid a few chickens.

327
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,570
How will I eat?

328
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
You know what Cuddy has been locked in with
Vogler about all day today, and yesterday?

329
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,100
Floor polish costs through the roof?

330
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,130
You. Her secretary's been to the
photocopier all day with your records.

331
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
It's all they're looking at in there.

332
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,590
My car has been stolen.

333
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,230
Or rein-CAR-nated.

334
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,790
Pink slip.
"A gift from the Arnello brothers."

335
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,390
You know, they're gangsters, sure,
but they're thoughtful, too.

336
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,299
You can't keep it. It's graft.

337
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,560
No, no, no, no.

338
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,789
Graft is if I tell them I'll only make
it better if he slips me a couple bucks.

339
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,860
A payoff for something
I'm not supposed to do.

340
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
If I'd asked for the
payoff, which I didn't.

341
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
I would have done the bad thing anyway.

342
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,410
So there's nothing wrong with this.

343
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,080
Right.

344
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,730
Damn. '65. Perfectly restored.

345
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,110
What do you think a guy like Joey would do
if someone turned down a gift?

346
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,970
That's kind of an insult, isn't it?

347
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,250
He might hurt you.
It's definitely possible.

348
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,220
I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.

349
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,500
Did you see House's new car?

350
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,630
From Joey.
He obviously can't keep it.

351
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,049
You don't mind the hospital
taking money from Vogler?

352
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,770
That's different, Vogler's legit.

353
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,200
That's worse.
Vogler's money came with strings.

354
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,370
Vogler doesn't set me up to have
a mobster take a swing at me.

355
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,909
I'm sure House didn't know...

356
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,050
Joey's pressure dropped.

357
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,540
Pushed IV fluids,
now he's holding 100 systolic.

358
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Septic?

359
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,859
No, looks like he's
bleeding into his liver.

360
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Varices.

361
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,670
You see it with chronic Hep-C all the time.

362
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,539
Biopsy's back. Two findings.

363
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,590
Number one: Lymphoctic infiltrate
and no bridging fibrosis.

364
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,310
Well, whatever's killing him
is not Hep-C. It's acute.

365
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,840
Who said that? I forget.

366
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,730
What are you doing here?
I told you you were off the case.

367
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,969
Right. Your diabolic plan to
convince the evil genius

368
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,580
he's in the clear so he'll let his guard
down and make a fatal mistake, sure.

369
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,040
Well, it's clearly not going to work now.

370
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,330
What evil genius?

371
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,970
If we knew that, then we wouldn't
need a diabolic plan now, would we?

372
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,580
House thinks someone
ratted him out to Vogler.

373
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,940
Oh, what? One of us?

374
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
No, you guys love me too much.

375
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,679
All right, look, if it's not the Hep-C,
then what's the problem?

376
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,010
What's causing the liver failure?

377
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,580
Finding number two: Toxins.

378
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,689
No. He's only 30 years old and

379
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,779
his job doesn't expose him
to heavy metals or environmental...

380
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,670
He's a 30-year-old mobster.

381
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,029
He doesn't have a job that results
in accidental exposure to toxins,

382
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,460
he has a job that results
in intentional exposure to toxins.

383
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,830
Someone's poisoned him.

384
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,600
Whatever this toxin is,
it's doing its job and fast.

385
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,216
How long do we have until
the next round of test results?

386
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,249
About four hours.

387
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,250
Too bad his liver's only
going to last another two.

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,926
We're going to have to
get him a new one.

389
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,120
What, in two hours?

390
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,000
There is another way.

391
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,760
Relax, it's kosher.

392
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,950
This is so bizarre.

393
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,580
Not really. We just take the blood out
of Joey's body and run it through a pig.

394
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,029
The pig's liver does what
Joey's can't, cleans

395
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,920
the blood, which we
send right back to him.

396
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,350
And the pig makes him better?

397
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,670
No, just buys us some time to figure
out what's poisoning your brother.

398
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,630
Like nothing.
Like you do this all the time?

399
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,410
Oh, we've basically got
a barn in the basement.

400
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,930
Cross off hemlock.

401
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,030
You thought he was being
poisoned by hemlock?

402
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,329
Dr. Euripides tell you
to check for that?

403
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,990
It grows wild
by the highways out here.

404
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
So...

405
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,210
How much do you like House?

406
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,239
Chase has a big mouth.

407
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,370
Yeah. He's probably
the one who ratted to Vogler.

408
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,540
I don't think that he would...

409
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,280
Does it hurt when you're with House?

410
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,169
Little pain in the tummy,
but it sort of feels good, too?

411
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,149
I don't have the right to show
interest in someone?

412
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,040
You absolutely do, and I absolutely
have the right to humiliate you for it.

413
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Anything?

414
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,639
White blood count's low;
Probably a result of

415
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,400
the illness, nothing to
connect to the liver.

416
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,110
Is he a smoker?

417
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,110
Let me check.

418
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,080
Early signs of emphysema.
He's been smoking at least a dozen years.

419
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,069
18. You got that from the white count?

420
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,890
Nope, got that from the chest x-ray.
White count just tells me he's quitting.

421
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Two weeks ago.

422
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,620
How's your tummy?

423
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,330
Flat and taut.

424
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,110
I've been on the job for 12 years.

425
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,420
You put $3,000 in your wife's
checking account this morning.

426
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,086
I want to know where it came from.

427
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,719
I got a perfect record.

428
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,310
Where did you get the money.

429
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,850
Cancel the thumb screws,
I've got our culprit.

430
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,750
Who?

431
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,310
Not who, Hu.

432
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Huh?

433
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,740
Thanks for playing along. Chai Hu, a
Chinese herb in his quit smoking candy.

434
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,800
Reduces cravings, also
reduces his white blood count.

435
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,530
Oh yeah, he also took enough
of them to poison himself.

436
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,860
We'll keep him on the pig
for a few more hours,

437
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,680
then take him off the
candy, he'll be fine.

438
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,710
Pig won't be. Oh no.

439
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Hey.

440
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,970
Hey, you feeling better?

441
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm famished.

442
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,880
I think they've got
fish sticks on the menu.

443
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,410
Ah, yeah. Makes me miss prison.

444
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,460
So, the mobster's good to go?

445
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,149
I'll keep him over night,
then let the fed's

446
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,020
know he's good to rat
out whoever he wants.

447
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Brother won't be happy.

448
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,740
Maybe have to give back the car.

449
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,500
You should let Vogler tell the feds.

450
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Why?

451
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,220
Because it matters to him.

452
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,039
Because you humiliated him
the first time Joey was released.

453
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,849
You think you should still
be in third there, ace?

454
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,000
He humiliated himself.

455
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,409
And because your job depends
on the kind of mood.

456
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,940
Vogler's in at the end of
his marathon with Cuddy.

457
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,639
Seriously, man, have you ever
driven an automobile before?

458
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,880
There are four gears, you know.

459
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,540
The '66 came with a Shut Up button.

460
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,180
It is my medical opinion that the
patient is healthy and can be released.

461
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
Thanks for letting us know.

462
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,570
Give me the U.S. Attorney's office.

463
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,210
I see you've found out
what we're meeting about.

464
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
You're having a meeting?

465
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,810
Well, whatever the reason,
the coat looks good on you.

466
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,460
Chai Hu lozenges cause
this kind of liver failure, no way!

467
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,690
Not by themselves, but in combination with
the Interferon it's like gas to a flame.

468
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
What Interferon?

469
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
For the Hep-C.

470
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,610
What Hep-C?

471
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,370
Oops.

472
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,390
Is hiding a mobster's
Hep-C that important?

473
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,749
Is letting the feds know everything
that important?

474
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,269
You know, you are
a piece of work, even now.

475
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,270
Ed!

476
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Edward.

477
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,400
Joey's back in a coma.

478
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,520
He's stable, but comatose.

479
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,689
Worse than before,
he's on a ventilator.

480
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,910
Question is, why?

481
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,110
It's not his brain, it's not a toxin.

482
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,510
Our friend Babe
helped with that one.

483
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,910
So what else?

484
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
The Hep-C.

485
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,579
We never really treated
it, we stopped the.

486
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
Interferon when it started
poisoning his liver.

487
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,510
Am I going to have to
write a song about it?

488
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,399
His chronic Hep-C was not bad enough
to produce these symptoms.

489
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,429
The estrogen level indicates it is.

490
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,969
Indicates something else entirely.

491
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,290
We can't give him Interferon now.

492
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,049
There's still traces of the
lozenges in his system.

493
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,409
It'll just poison him again.

494
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,830
Genetics. We don't just treat
the virus, we change it.

495
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,759
A non-nucleoside allosteric inhibitor.

496
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,859
It's never been tried on a human being.
It could kill him.

497
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Well, what's the difference?
He's dead without it.

498
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,390
They're running a trial on dogs
at St. Sebastians in Philadelphia.

499
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
I'll make the call.

500
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,970
What else could cause
his estrogen level to be that high?

501
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,070
Nothing.

502
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,330
We're going to put the medicine here.

503
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
We don't want it to burn
his veins when it goes in.

504
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,530
You have no idea if it will work.

505
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,310
It's shown promise in testing.

506
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,411
Maybe there's nothing up there,
I watched him like a hawk.

507
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,050
Pretty sure you didn't.

508
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,430
I didn't let him play
with any more little toys.

509
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,730
Thus forcing him to shove
a big one up there.

510
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,540
Stop or I snap your nose off!

511
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,550
He's not too smart.

512
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,640
Genetics is a powerful force.

513
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,260
On the other hand, maybe
he's smarter than you think.

514
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,970
What's going on?

515
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Just give me a second.

516
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,140
Always wanted to use one of these.

517
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,730
Tilt his head back.

518
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,029
I don't know. I don't...

519
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,310
Just tilt his head back.

520
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:51,070
Nice grasp of concepts,
relationships. Very smart, very cool.

521
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,560
First the policeman, fireman, fire truck.

522
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,400
Your brother was sending
in teams to save the cat.

523
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Wow.

524
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,800
Sometimes the simplest answer...

525
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,500
What types of comas
do you just snap out of?

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,630
He's not snapping out of this one,
he's not improving.

527
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,470
You crossed out estrogen,
you've got an explanation?

528
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,050
Yes, I have. A very simple one.

529
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,290
And?

530
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
It's private.

531
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,670
You think I'm the one
running to Vogler.

532
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,570
You're currently top of the list.

533
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,720
Toxic comas, person's away from the
cause long enough and they recover.

534
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,530
The feds checked for poisons,
we checked for poisons.

535
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I didn't do it.

536
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,790
It's not a poison, then.

537
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,130
An allergy, then.
Did you hear me?

538
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,539
How about a food sensitivity?

539
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,309
All of his food is strictly controlled.

540
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,840
There's no correlation between
his meals and his condition.

541
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,340
He had steak and potatoes
before the first coma,

542
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,960
and the hospital served fish sticks
before the second one.

543
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,250
You can trust me.

544
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,969
Problem is,

545
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,870
if I can't trust you, I can't trust
your statement that I can trust you.

546
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,910
But thanks anyway,
you've been a big help.

547
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,220
So where did you get the money?

548
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,560
What?

549
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,250
Someone paid you off.

550
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,649
What are you talking about?
It wasn't poison, you told us that it...

551
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,980
You're talking about poison.
I'm talking about payoff. Graft.

552
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,670
Leave him alone.

553
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,630
You paid the Marshall off.

554
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,350
I didn't pay him
to poison my brother.

555
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,910
No, it just worked out that way.

556
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,340
I gave the guy some money to
get him some decent food.

557
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,120
Better than fish sticks?
I'm thinking steak.

558
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,179
We asked for pasta.
Those stupid feds could care less...

559
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,150
He had steak before both comas.

560
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,020
Your brother has
Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency.

561
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,510
You want me to write it down?

562
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,340
Good, because it takes a while.

563
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,570
It's genetic, it can present at any time.

564
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,280
The patient eats a large amount of protein,
especially if he's not used to it.

565
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,550
That's it?

566
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,110
He stays off the red meat
and he's going to be fine?

567
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,769
Yes. If I'm right, and we stop
the current treatment, he gets better.

568
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,520
If we stop the current treatment
and I'm wrong, he dies.

569
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,980
Why would you be wrong?

570
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,280
His estrogen level.
OTD doesn't explain his estrogen level.

571
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,360
But I have a theory.

572
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,220
There is one chemical that, if ingested,

573
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,460
can cause a person's estrogen
level to increase dramatically.

574
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:30,860
What is it?

575
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,900
It's called estrogen.

576
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,219
Joey's taking estrogen?
What, he wants a sex change?

577
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,630
No, nothing like that.
It's called Male Flame.

578
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,870
It's probably more consumer
friendly in the original Chinese.

579
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,889
It's an herbal aphrodisiac
marketed to gay men.

580
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,710
Oh, here we go.

581
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:54,880
And sold on the same website
that sells his Chai Hu lozenges.

582
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,270
Guess what's in it?
Starts with an "e".

583
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,870
You want to get hit, too?

584
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,130
That would be quite a trick.

585
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,810
"He slapped me so hard
his brother turned straight."

586
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,860
Joey's a big-time mobster.
Guys like that don't get raped in prison.

587
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:14,550
They get gifts, they get food,
drugs, cigarettes, cable TV...

588
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,210
Joey is not gay.

589
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,420
Well, maybe not gay,
but certainly delightful.

590
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,660
You, on the other hand, hitting a doctor,

591
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,609
even if it was only Chase...
and asking another one

592
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,800
to keep his chart
fresh and homo-free.

593
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,556
Well, that's a bit of an overreaction,
wouldn't you say?

594
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,660
It's almost like you're scared
that it might be true.

595
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,090
You're wrong.

596
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,540
Okay. Then don't stop the treatment.

597
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,350
But if you're wrong, he dies.

598
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Okay.

599
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,680
He never said anything
to me about it, not once.

600
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,280
That's what I love
about you mob guys:

601
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,990
So tolerant of others, so accepting.

602
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,110
Only way he was coming
out was way, way out.

603
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,620
Lose the tattoos, change his name,
move to another town...

604
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,250
how's a guy like him going to do that?

605
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,160
Witness protection.
It's not just for witnesses any more.

606
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,030
You can go in now,
sit with him if you want.

607
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
How much longer?

608
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,859
It's only been three hours.
If it's the OTD...

609
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,850
If it's the OTD?
What if House is wrong, huh?

610
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,509
That severe a reaction,
it'll take some time...

611
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,979
He makes assumptions about people,
talks you into things.

612
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,690
Mr. Arnello. He's awake.
He wants to see you.

613
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,270
You look like crap.

614
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,519
That's a joke, see. I'm sick,
I said you look like crap...

615
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,720
You have no idea
what I just went through out there.

616
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,950
You kept getting worse, and
Dr. House kept saying all this crap.

617
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,639
If I think you're normal,
then he's going to keep

618
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,500
giving you the medicine,
and if you weren't...

619
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Weren't what?

620
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
Normal?

621
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Yeah.

622
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,670
He said you were a fag.

623
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,460
Witness protection,
that's your big chance to be one.

624
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,030
You believe him?

625
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,870
I don't know what to believe.
You were sick.

626
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,420
I had to make a decision.
I thought you were gonna die.

627
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,980
You believed him.
He stopped the medicine.

628
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
Here I am.

629
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,900
- I wanted to talk to you about this...
- There's nothing to talk about.

630
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,880
You ordered some
Chinese internet health crap,

631
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,520
they sent the wrong pills,
you took 'em.

632
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,400
Yeah, yeah, that,
that must be it.

633
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,350
You want to testify, go ahead.

634
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,640
I told the doc,
he said it's okay.

635
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,759
I don't expect you to understand...

636
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
I don't.

637
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,850
All I need to know is
you're my brother, Joey.

638
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:19,230
If you think this thing, whatever,
is going to make you happy,

639
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,110
I think you should do it.

640
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
You should.

641
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,400
Vogler wants to fire you.

642
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,320
Lose the whole department.

643
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,720
Good thing you fought
for me, though, right?

644
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,810
The dress was a nice move,
but you've got to follow it up.

645
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,009
Nasty weekend in Vegas,

646
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,920
something that
shows off your real administrative skills.

647
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,500
He threatened to fire me.

648
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,650
I'm sorry.

649
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,410
So, how long do I have?

650
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,500
I've a lot of personal stuff to pack up.

651
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,630
I assume you're going
to want to throw a party.

652
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,559
I told him I know where the
bodies are buried,

653
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,546
the stuff he needs to know
that's not in the books.

654
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,650
Told him he can't ditch me.

655
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,850
He's only keeping you on because
you know the secret handshakes.

656
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,879
He's a quick study.
Six months, he'll

657
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,359
have the moves down.
Then he won't need you any more.

658
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
I'll deal with that then.

659
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,230
So I stay.

660
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Yes.

661
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,140
But some things are going to change.

662
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,710
Profits. New world order.

663
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,379
Everything's about profits.

664
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,520
Yeah, that's real new.

665
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,660
You could rent out the Corvette every
once in a while, or lend it to a friend.

666
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,449
That would be easy,
and it would be wrong.

667
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,650
But Cuddy stood up for you.

668
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
To a point.

669
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
To what point?

670
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,740
I gotta do six more clinic hours a month.

671
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,290
So do two of them.

672
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,510
Why only two?

673
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,360
'Cause one of them's gone.

674
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,010
I gotta fire somebody.

675
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,140
Good morning.
