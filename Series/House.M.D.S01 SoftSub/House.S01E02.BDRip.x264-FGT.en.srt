1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,260
On your right.
On your right. On your right.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:09,132
Back, back, back.
Come on, buddy.

3
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,077
Yeah, Dan! Yeah!

4
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:16,661
Yeah!

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,749
Back, back, back.
Watch the winger!

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,260
Yeah!

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,953
You okay?

8
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,831
Dan? Dan, talk to me.

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,920
Dan. Dan.

10
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:06,920
Get a doctor!

11
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,547
- Hey.
- Close the door.

12
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,756
Close the door.

13
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:57,500
Is Cuddy down the hall
counting to 50?

14
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,679
She knows I'm in here,
in the clinic, as she commanded.

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,980
- She just doesn't know I'm alone.
- Well, you've got a full waiting room.

16
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,719
How long do you think you can ignore them?

17
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:07,981
I'm off at 4:00.

18
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,790
You're doing this
to avoid five minutes of work?

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,939
If I go out there, I get assigned
a kid with a runny nose.

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,179
That's 30 seconds looking at the nose,
25 minutes talking to a worried mom...

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,699
who won't leave until she's sure
it's not meningitis or a tumor.

22
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,120
Yes. Concerned parents
can be so annoying.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,739
Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent
case. You had to leave early.

24
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,800
That would be lying.

25
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,360
And that would be wrong. But luckily
the definition of "urgent" is fungible.

26
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,000
Not the definition
of "case" though.

27
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,200
You have no cases?

28
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:43,239
You have no cases?

29
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,640
You've got handpicked
doctors, specialists...

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,960
working for you,
and they're sitting on their hands?

31
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,480
- Cameron's answering my mail.
- Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

32
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,000
Foreman and Chase?

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,447
Research?

34
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,309
Nine letters.
Iodine deficiency in children.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,208
Cretinism.

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,899
So, 4:03PM,
Dr. House checks out.

37
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,056
Please write that down.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,019
Dr. House.
Sorry. Done for the day.

39
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,660
Plenty of docs here to take care of you.
But we had an appointment.

40
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,199
Nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic,
which means there are no appointments.

41
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,449
You walk in, sign the chart,
and a doctor will see you.

42
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,020
- Just not me.
- Your letter says that we'd see you.

43
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,019
Not a big letter writer.

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,616
Here.

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,180
When did my signature get so girlie?

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,166
- I can explain.
- See that "G"?

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,490
See how it makes a big loop on top?

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,950
Doesn't even look like my handwriting.
Think I have something?

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,450
What's the differential diagnosis for
writing G's like a junior high school girl?

50
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,370
It's impossible to get to you
through normal channels. They have called,

51
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,290
- ...e-mailed.
- Perseverance does not equal worthiness.

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,730
Next time you want to get my
attention, wear something fun.

53
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,268
Low-rider jeans are hot.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,650
Sixteen-year-old male.
Sudden onset of double

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,010
vision and night terrors,
with no apparent cause.

56
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:15,100
The kid's been to two neurologists,

57
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,180
- and he...
- Night terrors?

58
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,654
- As in big scary monsters?
- Yes.

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,240
- And where are you going?
- To see the family.

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,310
You're going to
examine a patient?

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,870
Nine times out of 10, there's
no reason to talk to a patient.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,100
But night terrors in a 16-year-old is a
very good reason to talk to this family.

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,420
Good work.

64
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,800
Margins are fine.

65
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,719
No lesions.

66
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,263
Color is good.

67
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,330
How long have you been having
night terrors?

68
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,800
Three weeks.

69
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,820
He's afraid to go to bed. He's
exhausted, can barely function.

70
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,120
What does that tell you?

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,800
Nothing. It's just fun
watching him blink.

72
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,350
Name as many animals as you can
that begin with the letter "B". Go.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
- Baby elephant?
- Baby elephant is actually a good answer.

74
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,470
- "B" is a bear of a letter.
- What does that tell you?

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,910
Proves two things: No
neurological damage, and

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,120
your son is never gonna
be chief fry cook.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,980
In teens, there are two
likely causes of night terrors.

78
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,970
Post-traumatic stress. Any recent
shoot-outs at your high school?

79
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,340
No.

80
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,140
- Well, then, Dave...
- Dan.

81
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,144
If there's no trauma,
the other cause is, sexual abuse.

82
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,340
So who's molesting you? Teacher?

83
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,140
Extra-friendly neighbor?

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,612
I'd ask if either of you were
involved, but you'd deny it.

85
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:44,390
No. We would never do anything to hurt Dan.

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,880
I say it here,
it comes out there.

87
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,190
This lack of response
is consistent with abuse.

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
There's no one, okay?
I swear.

89
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,310
There was trauma. I got hit in
the head during a lacrosse game.

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,620
Did you know
that he got hit in the head?

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,760
- They didn't mention it. No.
- Yeah. Why bother?

92
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,530
No, no. We took him
to the E.R. after the game.

93
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:12,225
He was scanned. They tested him.
They said he was fine.

94
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,560
No concussion.
It's gotta be something else.

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,562
You hound me for my opinion,
and then you question my diagnosis.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,760
Cool. E.R. obviously screwed up.
Kid's got a concussion.

97
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,900
- I had double vision before I was hit.
- Well, that changes everything.

98
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,030
You need glasses.
That's why you had double vision,

99
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,610
which is why you got hit,
which is why you have a

100
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,119
concussion, which is why
you have night terrors.

101
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,913
You need to see an
ophthalmologist, which I am not.

102
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,860
You enjoyed that. I brought
a reasonable case to your

103
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,070
attention, and you shoved it in
my face just to humiliate me.

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,250
- You're an only child, aren't you?
- Why would you say that?

105
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,258
Because everything is about you.

106
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,840
This may seem incredibly controversial,
but I think sexual abuse is bad.

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,630
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't
being diddled by Daddy, or Mommy.

108
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,540
Anything else is just a bonus.

109
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,940
- I'm not an only child.
- Interesting.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,320
- What?
- Don't move.

111
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:17,230
- Did I bore you in there?
- What? Uh, no. No, not really.

112
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,082
Are you tired?

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,650
- Sometimes.
- He never sleeps. Of course he's tired.

114
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,850
- Right now. At this moment. Are you tired?
- No. No.

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,299
That twitch in your leg.
Did you feel that?

116
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,550
- It didn't hurt.
- His leg twitched. I don't see what...

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,170
It's called a myoclonic jerk. It's very
common when you're falling asleep.

118
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,770
Respiration rate falls, and the
brain sometimes interprets

119
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,270
this as the body dying, so it
sends a pulse to wake it up.

120
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,120
- So?
- So, he's not asleep.

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
He's awake.

122
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,651
Admit him.

123
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,074
I recognize that loopy "G".

124
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:54,920
So, what does the jerk tell us?

125
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,580
Nothing good.
The brain's losing control of the body.

126
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,850
Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate
sleep patterns or control muscles.

127
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,370
A movement disorder
or a degenerative brain disease.

128
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,290
Either way, this kid's gonna be picking up
his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.

129
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,660
Maybe not that bad.
Could be an infection.

130
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,740
You wish.
No fever, no white count.

131
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,250
Anyone think this differential
diagnosis might be compromised

132
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,470
because we don't have an
accurate family history?

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,061
- I took an accurate family history.
- You didn't even take an accurate family.

134
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,690
- His father's not his father.
- Why would you say that?

135
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,190
Thirty percent of all dads out there

136
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,990
don't realize they're
raising someone else's kid.

137
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,570
- What I've read, false paternity's more like 10%.
- That's what our moms would like us to believe.

138
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,960
Who cares? If he got it from his
parents, they'd both be dead by now.

139
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,700
Can we get on with the
differential diagnosis?

140
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,880
Fifty bucks says I'm right.

141
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,660
- I'll take your money.
- Hit a nerve?

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,220
Don't worry, Foreman.

143
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm sure the guy
who tucked you in at night was your daddy.

144
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,998
Make it a hundred.

145
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,870
What about leukoencephalopathy
in a 16-year-old?

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,010
It doesn't necessarily
have to be that bad.

147
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,310
If we exclude the night terrors,
it could be something systemic.

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,770
His liver, kidneys.
Something outside the brain.

149
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,510
Yes.

150
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,470
Feel free to exclude any symptom
if it makes your job easier.

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
The night terrors were anecdotal.

152
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,750
He could've had a bad dream.

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,670
No. Parents said he
was conscious during the event

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,280
and didn't remember anything afterwards.

155
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,470
- That's a night terror.
- Parents said?

156
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:04,960
That's a good point.

157
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,770
Before we condemn this kid, maybe we
should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.

158
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,580
I want a detailed polysomnograph. If he's
having night terrors, I want to see them.

159
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,040
I usually don't move
during night terrors.

160
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm not restraining you for them.

161
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:46,790
E.E.G. revealed abnormalities
in your brain...

162
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:50,318
caused nerve damage in your toes.

163
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,140
What are you doing?

164
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,280
- Fixing it.
- Can I talk to my parents?

165
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,290
Oh, they know all about this.

166
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
I'd really like to see them.

167
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:19,055
Please. I'd really like them here.

168
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:22,620
This is gonna hurt, Dan.

169
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,690
Oh. Oh, God.

170
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,953
That's a night terror.

171
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,990
We did a C.T., M.R.I., C.B.C.,
CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.

172
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,639
All the tests came back normal.
There's nothing to explain his symptoms.

173
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,700
Okay, but let's pretend
there's something and go

174
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,220
from there. Who sees
something on this M.R.I.?

175
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:11,524
- No lesions in the white matter.
- No structural abnormalities.

176
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,060
No space-occupying tumors.

177
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,430
He's 16, so he should
have an absolutely

178
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,364
pristine brain. The
smallest thing is abnormal.

179
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,920
Meningeal enhancement.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,453
- My bet is viral meningitis.
- Excellent.

181
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,380
Do you see what he did there?

182
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,370
Took a small clue that there's a neurological
problem and wasn't afraid to run with it.

183
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,810
There's no evidence
of meningitis on that M.R.I.

184
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,047
No, there's not.
He's completely wrong.

185
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:36,880
Then what clue
are you talking about?

186
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,160
He knew that I saw something
on the M.R.I., so he

187
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,220
figured there must be something
there and took a guess.

188
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,516
- Clever, but also pathetic.
- So what did you find?

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
Take a close look at the corpus callosum.

190
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,870
- Looks okay.
- Are we all looking at the same thing?

191
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,210
Two hundred million
interhemispheric nerve fibers.

192
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,531
The George Washington Bridge between
the left and right side of the brain.

193
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,867
It's subtle.

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,414
There's some bowing. There.

195
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,292
An upward arch.
Are you guessing?

196
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,252
Yes.

197
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,380
- Too bad. You're right.
- He probably just moved.

198
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,650
Nobody stays perfectly still
for the entire M.R.I.

199
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,110
Yeah. Probably got restless
and shifted one hemisphere

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,240
of his brain to a more
comfortable position.

201
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,310
Something is pushing on it. If there
was bowing, could be a tumor.

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,030
Do you see a tumor on this M.R.I.?

203
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:32,030
No, but I don't
see any bowing either.

204
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,430
There's no tumor. Just a blockage
causing pressure causing symptoms.

205
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,220
Today, night terrors. Tomorrow,
he's bleeding out of his eyes.

206
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,460
Get him a radionucleotide cisternogram.
I guarantee you'll see a blockage.

207
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:50,915
Okay.

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,544
Easy.

209
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,260
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

210
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,080
Alright. Squeeze hard.

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,973
Alright.

212
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,660
Now I'm injecting a material
that's tagged with a radioisotope.

213
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:22,300
It's gonna enter your spine
and travel up to your brain.

214
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,220
It'll make you able to
think deep thoughts,

215
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,160
run a hundred miles an hour.

216
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,746
Easy.

217
00:13:45,427 --> 00:13:48,264
Their eyes aren't the same color,
but that fleck in the eyes...

218
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,891
That's maybe a one-in-10 chance
if they're not related?

219
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,660
No. House isn't gonna pay you
based on that.

220
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,590
Any excuse we can give the folks
to justify a D.N.A. test?

221
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,390
We could tell them he's
got Huntington's...

222
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,750
whole family should be tested
or they'll all die.

223
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,823
Hey.

224
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,494
There's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.

225
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,710
We're gonna put a shunt
into one of the ventricles

226
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,710
to give the
cerebrospinal fluid an out.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,940
No more pressure,
everything goes back to normal.

228
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,740
He's lucky to have you
as his doctors.

229
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,850
No formula. Just Mommy's
healthy, natural breast milk.

230
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:34,476
Yummy.

231
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,313
Her whole face just got
swollen like this overnight.

232
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
No fever.

233
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:46,000
Glands normal.
Missing her vaccination dates.

234
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,531
We're not vaccinating.

235
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,243
Gribbet! Gribbet!

236
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,037
Gribbet!

237
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,560
Think they don't work?

238
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,850
I think some
multinational pharmaceutical company

239
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,290
wants me to think they work...

240
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
pad their bottom line.

241
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,120
- May I?
- Sure.

242
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,010
Gribbet. Gribbet.

243
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,178
Gribbet.

244
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,710
Yeah. All-natural,
no dyes is a good business.

245
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,710
All-natural children's toys.

246
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,650
Toy companies. They don't
arbitrarily mark up their frogs.

247
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,690
They don't lie about how much they
spend on research and development.

248
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,760
The worst that a toy company could be
accused of is making a really boring frog.

249
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,406
Gribbet, gribbet, gribbet.

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,659
You know another
really good business?

251
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,329
Teeny, tiny baby coffins.

252
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,610
You can get 'em in frog green,

253
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,720
fire-engine red, really.

254
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:45,730
The antibodies in yummy mummy
only protect the kid for six months,

255
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,425
which is why these companies
think they can gouge you.

256
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,595
They think that you'll spend whatever
they ask to keep your kid alive.

257
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,931
Want to change things?
Prove 'em wrong.

258
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,910
Few hundred parents like you
decide they'd rather

259
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,700
let their kid die than cough up
40 bucks for a vaccination,

260
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,397
believe me,
prices will drop really fast.

261
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,260
Gribbet, gribbet, gribbet,
gribbet, gribbet.

262
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:04,942
Gribbet.

263
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,945
Tell me what she has.

264
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,824
A cold.

265
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:14,994
There's a problem.

266
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:18,590
Complications in surgery? Surgery
went fine. He's in recovery.

267
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,570
But we took a vial of C.S.F.
and tested it.

268
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,160
Really?

269
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,180
Turns out the bowing wasn't the cause
of his problems. It was a symptom.

270
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,910
Oligoclonal bands
and increased intrathecal IGG.

271
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:31,140
Which means multiple sclerosis. And the
reason it takes three of you to tell me this?

272
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,490
Because we're having a disagreement
about whether or not it is M.S.

273
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,610
No lesions on the M.R.I.

274
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,600
It's early. He's
had the disease for maybe two weeks.

275
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,530
McDonald criteria requires six
months to make a definitive diagnosis.

276
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,130
Who cares about MacPhearson?

277
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,070
- I hear he tortured kittens.
- McDonald.

278
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, McDonald.
Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.

279
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,550
The V.E.P. indicates slowing of the brain.

280
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,290
Without the lesions,
we can't be sure.

281
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,770
Well, if it is, it's gone from
zero to 60 in three weeks,

282
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,120
which would indicate
rapidly progressive M.S.

283
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,950
Not the fun M.S. with the balloons and the
bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs.

284
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,539
- We should wait until...
- Start treating him now,

285
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:04,043
maybe he can walk for another couple
of years, maybe live for another five.

286
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,754
Break it to the family.
I'm going home.

287
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,090
It'll take months
for a definitive diagnosis.

288
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,633
What'll happen to me?

289
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:16,170
M.S. is an incredibly variable disease.

290
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,210
If it is M.S., and we're not
a hundred percent sure.

291
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,700
What do you think is gonna happen?

292
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,210
There are some medications
to manage the symptoms,

293
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,778
but as the disease progresses,
the problems will become more severe.

294
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,360
Bowel and bladder dysfunction,

295
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,650
loss of cognitive function, pain...

296
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,742
It's gonna hurt?

297
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,580
The brain's like a big jumble of wires.

298
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,625
M.S. strips them of the insulation,
and the nerves die.

299
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,020
Brain interprets it as pain.

300
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:50,339
But by starting treatment, we're gonna
prevent that for as long as possible.

301
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,170
We're looking into
a couple of specialists,

302
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,595
and until we get you squared away,
you'll stay here, okay?

303
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,202
Security checked the videotapes
from all perimeter cameras.

304
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,160
He's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?

305
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,140
Main floor.

306
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,310
Okay. You take the
cafeteria and administration.

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,520
I'll hit the research annex
and work my way back to you.

308
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:05,914
Dan?

309
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,631
I'm not here. Leave a message.

310
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,160
Dr. Cuddy. Great outfit.

311
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,260
What are you doing
back here? Patient?

312
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,438
No. Hooker. Went to my office
instead of my home.

313
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:40,699
Dr. House.

314
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,150
- Dan's missing.
- Yeah. I got that part from the message.

315
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,350
You said I was needed immediately. He
shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.

316
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,720
I agree. He's gonna have
a very nasty headache.

317
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,560
That would also be my opinion
if consulted tomorrow morning.

318
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,000
We wanted to keep you informed.
He heard some pretty heavy news.

319
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,890
This is not a toddler wandering
around a department store.

320
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,420
He's 16. You'll find him.

321
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm going home.

322
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:10,050
So when you say, "Call me if you
need anything", you mean don't call?

323
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,272
No, I mean call me
if I could do something.

324
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm bad at search
parties, and I'm bad at

325
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,080
sitting around looking
nervous, doing nothing.

326
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,695
What about his parents?
Should we call them?

327
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,200
Why? Do you think
they're hiding him?

328
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,784
Make sure someone
checks the roof.

329
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:27,360
Some of the orderlies keep the door
propped open so they can grab a smoke.

330
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,075
Dan. You okay?

331
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:16,170
There are experimental treatments.
Ongoing research.

332
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,714
Who knows what they'll discover
in a year or two.

333
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,924
This is where I dropped the ball.

334
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,343
Dan, we're standing
on the roof of the hospital.

335
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:26,722
Dan.

336
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,725
Dan, you're not on the field.

337
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,150
He doesn't know where he is.

338
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,520
- Dan.
- Foreman.

339
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,148
Dan.

340
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:39,818
- Dan?
- Dan, no!

341
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:52,331
Dr. Foreman.

342
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,220
I assume you found the kid.

343
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,040
He almost walked off the roof.

344
00:21:58,587 --> 00:21:59,320
Suicidal?

345
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,040
No, he thought he was
on his lacrosse field.

346
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,590
Look, I was just gonna run
home, shower, change...

347
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,385
Conscious? Yeah.

348
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,250
How'd you talk him down?
Actually, Chase tackled him.

349
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,520
How come you didn't do it?

350
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,685
Right. Well, I am black,
but he was closer.

351
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,970
Come on.
You can ride up with me.

352
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:26,670
Anybody tell the family
that their boy almost

353
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,500
stepped off a roof?
They must be thrilled.

354
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,100
They're not suing, but I think
only because Chase asked them...

355
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,420
Why does everybody
always think I'm being sarcastic?

356
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,370
This is great news.
He doesn't have M.S.

357
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,450
Parents should be thrilled. Well, the mom anyway.

358
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,045
Of course, the dad probably doesn't know...

359
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,671
Why doesn't he have M.S.?

360
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:43,740
He was on the roof, thinking
he was on a lacrosse field.

361
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,380
Conscious, and therefore not a
night terror. You want some of this?

362
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:47,760
Yeah, sure.

363
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,330
He was in an acute
confusional state,

364
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,770
which doesn't fit with
a demyelinating disease like M.S.

365
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,680
- Oligoclonal bands...
- Were real.

366
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,540
They just mean something other than M.S.
So, what are they telling us?

367
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:00,290
That the immune system is working?

368
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:00,982
Right.

369
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:02,930
He has an infection in his brain.

370
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,160
What about sex?

371
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,910
Well, it might get complicated.
I mean, we work together.

372
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,530
I'm older, certainly,
but maybe you like that.

373
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,700
I meant maybe he
has neurosyphilis.

374
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,590
- Nice cover.
- Sorry. R.P.R. was negative.

375
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,550
We don't need a definitive
test to confirm this.

376
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,330
Sure. Didn't need one to confirm M.S.

377
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,830
Okay. Let's wait for you
to run titers on 1,400

378
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,950
viruses while this kid's
brain turns to mush.

379
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,250
So the fact that he doesn't have M.S.,
it's really not good news after all.

380
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,885
Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis.

381
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:32,090
The likelihood of a false negative
on an R.P.R. test: 30%.

382
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,770
Likelihood of a 16-year-old having sex:
roughly 120%.

383
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,330
- I'll start him on I.V. penicillin.
- No, we're not gonna wait for that.

384
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,350
The most effective way to deliver the drug
is right into his brain via the spine.

385
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,510
We can't.
In a cramped space like the brain,

386
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,570
increased intracranial
pressure from a high-volume

387
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,470
drug like penicillin could
herniate his brain stem.

388
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,620
It would kill him. No neurologist in his
right mind would recommend that.

389
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:53,285
Show of hands. Who thinks
I'm not in my right mind?

390
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:57,831
And who thinks I forget this
fairly basic neurological fact?

391
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,250
Who thinks there's a third option?

392
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,900
Very good. What's
the third choice?

393
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:06,047
No idea. You just asked
if I thought there was one.

394
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:12,970
Patient has a shunt in his brain.
There'll be no increased pressure.

395
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,390
We can put as much penicillin
into his body as we want.

396
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:18,185
Excellent. Inject him through
a lumbar puncture.

397
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:24,630
One of us is gonna do this to you
twice a day for the next two weeks.

398
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,270
- I'm ready. Go.
- He could get syphilis...

399
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,865
even if he's not sexually active?

400
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:37,204
Well, it's, it's unusual,
but it's possible.

401
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,956
Okay. Relax.

402
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,470
It's infected,
with a really big hole,

403
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,830
like you stuck a nail in it
to relieve the pressure.

404
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,250
I wouldn't do that. Although
the wound is irregular.

405
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,640
It's not cylindrical. It's shaped
like a triangle. So, not a nail.

406
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:07,450
- Steak knife?
- Wife's nail file.

407
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:08,450
Nail file.

408
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,080
Yeah. Pain will make you
do stupid things.

409
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,992
- Something to take the edge off?
- Yeah.

410
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:19,287
Cheers.

411
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,500
So, you have family here
in Princeton?

412
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,923
- No.
- Here on work?

413
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,250
- No. Why are you...
- Does your penis hurt?

414
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,469
No. What? Should it?

415
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:37,960
No. Just thought I'd toss you
a really inappropriate question.

416
00:25:38,348 --> 00:25:39,620
Your lawyer's gonna love it.

417
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,850
Why would I want to sue you?
I want you to treat me.

418
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,280
- You're from Maplewood, New Jersey, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,898
Now, why would you
drive 70 miles...

420
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,318
to get treatment for a condition
that a nine-year-old could diagnose?

421
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:54,560
It's the free-flowing pus
that's the tip-off.

422
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,420
- I was in town.
- Not for family. Not for work.

423
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,160
You drove 70 miles to a walk-in clinic.
You passed two hospitals on the road.

424
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,390
Now, either you've got
a problem with those hospitals,

425
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,590
or they have a problem with you.

426
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,250
My guess is you've sued
half the doctors in Maplewood,

427
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:09,462
and the rest are now
refusing to help you.

428
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,280
It's ironic, isn't it?
Sort of like the boy who sued wolf.

429
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:16,220
You know, I bet we have
a doctor here named Wolf.

430
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,760
How perfect would that be?

431
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,070
- I'm gonna page him.
- Okay. You know what? Thank you.

432
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm gonna find a doctor
to take care of this.

433
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,060
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.

434
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,200
We'll drain your knee, run
some lab work. Fix you right up.

435
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,190
Why would you do that?

436
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:30,692
I'm a people person.

437
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,380
You actually treated him?

438
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,370
All I know is he sued some doctors.

439
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,500
Who am I to assume they didn't
have it coming to them?

440
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,830
The cutest little tennis outfit.

441
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,661
My God, I thought I
was gonna have a heart attack.

442
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,790
Oh, my. I didn't see you
there. That is so embarrassing.

443
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,956
How's your hooker doing?

444
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,070
Sweet of you to ask.
Funny story.

445
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,670
She was gonna be hospital
administrator,

446
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,960
but just hated having to
screw people like that.

447
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,530
- I heard you found her on the roof.
- You have very acute hearing.

448
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,230
You notify the parents?

449
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,510
In due course, of course.

450
00:26:56,551 --> 00:27:00,950
And is there a paternity bet
on the father of the patient?

451
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,820
Doesn't sound like me.

452
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,930
Well, it does,
actually, but doesn't mean you're guilty.

453
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,394
- You think?
- I saw the parents in the lobby.

454
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,050
Smart money's obviously
on the father.

455
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,510
My guy knows a guy who can
get you in for 50 bucks.

456
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,320
Fine. Tell your guy, if I win, you attend
the faculty symposium, and you wear a tie.

457
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:18,031
And if I win,
no clinic hours for a week.

458
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,367
My guy will call your guy.

459
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,412
She's very good at her job.

460
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,200
The treatments should
start helping soon.

461
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:35,006
Let us know if it gets easier to
focus on things, remember stuff.

462
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:40,303
Hey, Dan. Isn't Dr. Cameron's
necklace a beauty?

463
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,472
Something South American, I think.

464
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:44,660
Yeah. Guatemalan.

465
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,435
It's a cool necklace.

466
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,065
- Thank you so much.
- The kid's in pain.

467
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:55,950
Don't fight it. Just let it happen.

468
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:56,778
No.

469
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,250
- You 'll be dead in two days.
- No what?

470
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,750
I give it a day. Dan? You okay?

471
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,440
Dan?

472
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,750
- Night terrors.
- Body decomposition once he's in the grave.

473
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,480
- Say good-bye to your mother and father.
- He's hearing voices.

474
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,030
You're dying.
It's all over, Dan.

475
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,421
You're dying. Dying. Dead!

476
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,270
Push two milligrams
I.V. Ativan, stat.

477
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,553
- It's all over.
- Come on, Dan.

478
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:23,170
Get out of my head!

479
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,610
Auditory hallucination shows
further brain degeneration.

480
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,850
Penicillin's not working. So either
it's a bad batch of penicillin,

481
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,190
or our diagnosis is wrong.

482
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,527
Square one.

483
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:42,730
- Midnite.
- L.F.T.'s, B.U.N. and creatinine are all normal.

484
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,270
- Diabetes is out, and no gap.
- There goes metabolic.

485
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,000
- M.R.A. rules out vasculitis.
- "I" for inflammation.

486
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,710
- Too young for anything degenerative.
- "D", see ya.

487
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,460
"N" for neoplastic.
M.R.I. was clean.

488
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,720
- "I" for inflammation.
- We already did that.

489
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,180
Stupid to have two I's in one mnemonic.
What's the other one?

490
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,841
Infection.

491
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,620
Oligoclonal bands still
have to mean something.

492
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,300
But no fevers. White count's
elevated, but within range.

493
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,130
We've tested for anything remotely
possible. Everything's negative.

494
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,477
- C.T. scan rules out subdural.
- Trauma. Later much.

495
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,140
You know the problem? "Midnight" is
actually spelled with a "G" and an "H".

496
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:23,540
Just figure out
what those letters stand for.

497
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:31,400
It's a sick brain, having fun,

498
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,627
torturing him, talking to him.

499
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,440
Scaring the hell out of him.

500
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:49,380
Get him an E.E.G., left and right E.O.G.,
esophageal microphones.

501
00:29:50,225 --> 00:29:53,895
If this thing wants to talk,
let's listen.

502
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:59,820
We're missing something.
This is screwed-up.

503
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:03,880
That's why you came up with
the brain talking to the virus thing?

504
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:05,460
I panicked, okay?

505
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,326
Sounded cool though.
They bought it.

506
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,414
Oh, crap.

507
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,180
Another reason I don't like
meeting patients.

508
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,378
If they don't know what you look like,
they can't yell at you.

509
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:20,171
Here we go.

510
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,178
How can you just sit there?

511
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:30,140
If I eat standing up, I spill.

512
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,393
Our son is dying,
and you could care less.

513
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,272
We're going through hell.
You're doing nothing?

514
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:40,570
I'm sorry. You need to vent.
I understand.

515
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,250
Don't be condescending.

516
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:45,029
You haven't checked
in on him once.

517
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:48,100
Blood pressure is 110 over 70.

518
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,400
His shunt is patent, well-placed
in the right lateral ventricle.

519
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,890
The E.K.G. shows a normal Q.R.S.
with deep-wave

520
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,230
inversions throughout both
limb and precordial leads.

521
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,877
L.F.T.'s are elevated,
but only twice the normal range.

522
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,629
Oh, yeah. And he's hearing voices.

523
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,850
Go hold his hand.

524
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,098
Go on. I'll bus your tray.

525
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,115
- Got any sample bags on you?
- I don't believe you.

526
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,710
- You're gonna run D.N.A. tests?
- Their son is deathly ill.

527
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,050
I know. It's terrible.
But the fact is,

528
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,250
if I don't keep busy with
trivial things like this,

529
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,320
- I'm afraid I might start to cry.
- You're an ass.

530
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,045
Yeah? You want to double the bet?

531
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:55,391
General Hospital is on channel 6.

532
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,853
Dan's brain's not showing
channel 6 right now. Only mush.

533
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:00,855
No epileptiform activity.

534
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,840
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for C.B.C. and CHEM-7.

535
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:08,154
Good. Run D.N.A. on these.

536
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,825
- What's this?
- Parents' coffee cups.

537
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,140
- I can't believe you.
- I've had this conversation once already.

538
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:19,415
If you've got something else to do, do it.
Otherwise, do this.

539
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:31,344
- Dr. House.
- Hey. Mr. Funsten.

540
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,013
I was wondering when you'd be back.
You got some papers for me?

541
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,790
You've caused me
considerable mental distress.

542
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,184
I certainly hope so.

543
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,020
What? Too cheap to get
your lawyer to serve

544
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,850
it for you, or is it
just more fun this way?

545
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,941
I'm obviously prepared
to consider a settlement.

546
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,693
You have gonorrhea.

547
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:50,571
No, I don't.

548
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:53,282
Well, maybe you're right,
but I have the lab result says you do.

549
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,100
Could be a false positive,
and normally I'd run a second test,

550
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,870
- ...but since you're here, I'll just go with the first.
- You're just trying to scare me.

551
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,990
It's reportable,
you know. Public health issue.

552
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,542
Well, I'll be sure to let my wife know.

553
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,070
Don't bother yourself.
The state will call for you.

554
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:08,130
Look, if you're clean, I'm sure
it'll all blow over. No big deal.

555
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,220
There's an easy way to find out.
Get one of your doctors to run a test.

556
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:18,391
These are mine now.
I'll see you in court.

557
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,720
West Nile negative. Not
surprising since not too

558
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,830
many mosquitoes passing
through Jersey in December.

559
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,470
- No eastern equine encephalitis.
- You guys aren't gonna believe this.

560
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,028
What's that?

561
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,739
House is right.
The father's not the father.

562
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,700
Dude doubled up on me.

563
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:38,536
You're not gonna believe this.

564
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,455
The mother's not the mother either.

565
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,220
It's not a good idea
to move your son in his condition.

566
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,810
- We just want a second opinion.
- We need an answer.

567
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,134
You idiots. You lied to me.

568
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,480
We didn't lie about anything.

569
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,597
You, on the other hand, accused
us of molesting our son.

570
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,540
Perfect.

571
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,142
Can we get off my screw ups
and focus on theirs?

572
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,800
Theirs is bigger.
You're not Dan's parents.

573
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:04,740
We're his parents.

574
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,630
He was adopted. He doesn't need to know.

575
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,050
- I do.
- Adoption makes us just as much...

576
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,029
Listen. When we were taking
his medical history, were you confused?

577
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:15,630
Did you think we were looking for
a genetic clue to his condition,

578
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,430
or did you think we were
trying to ascertain who

579
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,786
loves him the most in
the whole wide world?

580
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,287
How did you find out about this?

581
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,930
- I sampled their D.N.A.
- We didn't give you any D.N.A.

582
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,710
Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.

583
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,440
You can't do that.

584
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,020
Again, why are we getting
hung up on what I did?

585
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,610
Your medical history is useless.

586
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,660
No. We gave you a detailed
history of his biological mother.

587
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,099
Her history.
Non-smoker, good health,

588
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,910
low cholesterol,
no blood pressure problems.

589
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:46,030
Dan was adopted two weeks
after he was born.

590
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,590
You have his history. There's nothing
you need to know that we didn't tell you.

591
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,524
Sounds reasonable.

592
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,110
Well, if you want to transfer
your boy, that is your choice.

593
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,656
- I still think it's the wrong...
- Was she vaccinated?

594
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:01,470
The biological mother. When she was a
baby, did she get her vaccinations?

595
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,040
Dan was vaccinated.
At six months.

596
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,543
Do you know why kids
get vaccinated at six months?

597
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,870
Because before that
they are protected...

598
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,464
by their biological mother's
immune system.

599
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,259
So, was she vaccinated?

600
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,000
An infant picks up
a regular old measles virus.

601
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,517
Gets a rash.

602
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,690
He's extremely uncomfortable,
has a wicked fever, but he lives.

603
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,340
Here's the kicker.
Once every million or so times,

604
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:33,980
the virus mutates.

605
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:37,196
Instead of Dan having
a fever and a rash,

606
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:39,991
the virus travels
to his brain and hides,

607
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:41,660
like a time bomb.

608
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:45,037
In this case, for 16 years.

609
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,620
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

610
00:35:48,499 --> 00:35:52,250
I know. There's only been 20 cases in
the United States in the last 30 years.

611
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,839
I suppose you could make
an argument the kid's still in stage I.

612
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,610
Once S.S.P.E. moves
to stage II, it's...

613
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,386
Boom. Stage II is universally fatal.

614
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,620
I assume its impossible to know
when he might move into stage II.

615
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,643
He's already started showing symptoms.
Could be a month. Could be tonight.

616
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,470
Can we treat it?
Ask the neurologist.

617
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,231
Intraventricular interferon.

618
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:14,590
Not gonna shove a spike
into his brain and drip

619
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,770
interferon without
confirming this diagnosis.

620
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,653
Tap him.

621
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:20,730
We won't get a reliable result for
measles antibodies in his C.S.F.

622
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,020
Not after everything
we've given him.

623
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,250
So the wrong treatment kills
any hope of the right diagnosis.

624
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,913
Why do people lie to me?

625
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,541
Could also kill him.

626
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,503
Your ball, Foreman. Tell me I
don't have to biopsy his brain.

627
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:38,382
Well, there is one other way.

628
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,510
You sure this isn't gonna hurt?

629
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:44,096
Yeah. It's just scary as hell.

630
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,940
See, we go through the pupil.

631
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:48,726
But you won't feel it.
The eye's been paralyzed.

632
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,561
The needle travels
to the back of the eye,

633
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:53,105
which is where we'll perform
the biopsy on your retina.

634
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,320
So we've confirmed that
the problem is this mutated virus.

635
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,960
The treatment for S.S.P.E.
is intraventricular interferon.

636
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:08,660
We implant an ommaya reservoir
under the scalp,

637
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:10,880
which is connected to
a ventricular catheter...

638
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,920
that delivers the antiviral
directly to the left hemisphere.

639
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,170
You want us to consent to this? I don't
even understand what you're talking about.

640
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,257
Well, the antiviral...

641
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,844
Look. I'm sorry.

642
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,580
I can explain this as best
I can, but the notion that

643
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,700
you're gonna fully understand
your son's treatment...

644
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,000
and make an informed decision is...
is kind of insane.

645
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,524
Here's what you need to know.

646
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,193
It's dangerous.

647
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,028
It could kill him.

648
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,781
You should do it.

649
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,970
Did you need something else?

650
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:20,050
You can't order a $3,200
D.N.A. test to win a bet.

651
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,777
It's not an actual cost.

652
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,070
I don't know if you know this, but the
hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.

653
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,615
I'm serious.

654
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:28,850
Well. Tell the parents to submit
the bill to insurance.

655
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,980
Insurance is not gonna
pay for a bet.

656
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,140
Should. We don't make that bet,
the kid dies.

657
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,400
Not for the paternity bet,
I never would have taken their D.N.A.

658
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,960
Without their D.N.A., we
never would have discovered

659
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,339
that Dan was adopted, which
was the key to this case.

660
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:44,884
You just don't want to pay your end.

661
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,230
Big mistake. My guy knows a guy.

662
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:51,390
Fine. I will let you out of
clinic duty for one week,

663
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:54,852
after you pay the 3,200
for the P.C.R. test.

664
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,906
Well, now, there's
the hundred you owe me.

665
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:10,284
Here's a hundred
I won from Cameron.

666
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:13,204
200 I took off of Foreman.

667
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,999
And 600...

668
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,250
I got from Wilson.

669
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,796
Very bitter.

670
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,280
Hey. Good morning.

671
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,679
Good news on your E.E.G.
Treatment is working.

672
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,015
And your immune system is responding.

673
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,580
I know it's early,
but I just want to take a look.

674
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:41,482
Alright. Let's see what
that brain of yours can do.

675
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:45,319
Name as many animals as you can
that start with the letter "O".

676
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,321
Ostrich.

677
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:51,130
Ox. Old elephant.

678
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,619
Well, that's two better
than last time.

679
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,705
How you doing with
the whole adoption thing?

680
00:39:57,581 --> 00:40:00,500
- I knew since fifth grade.
- How's that?

681
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,044
Cleft chin.

682
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,382
I have one. My dad doesn't.

683
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,678
Looked it up on the Internet.
It's one of those trait things.

684
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,972
That's right. It's autosomal dominant.

685
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:16,016
Since neither of your
parents have cleft chins,

686
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,519
it's highly unlikely you're
biologically related.

687
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:24,733
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I've got no problems with being adopted.

688
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:27,820
I love my parents.

689
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,120
- How's he doing?
- He's doing pretty well.

690
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:34,785
He's a smart kid.

691
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:37,246
I think he's gonna be fine.

692
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,350
- Hey.
- Thanks.

693
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:20,789
Wheels, 18. Wheels.
