1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,115
Cat got your tongue?

2
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:09,416
Nah, you killed the cat.

3
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:10,626
Cut off its head.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,212
Need to take a look at this.

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:17,627
Mom?
Mom. Mom! It's OK.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,789
Just a couple of
questions before I can authorize

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,790
extending her disability benefits...

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,550
I don't like her. She's fat.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,970
I could lose a little weight.

10
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:39,987
You all right?

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,569
Actually, before she signs...

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,331
I killed the cat, lots of blood.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,030
It's OK.

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,671
I have a couple of questions
about some of these dates.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,621
The first diagnosis...

16
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:54,688
Schizophrenia.

17
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,168
Dr. Walters, May 11th, last year.
The letter's in the medical file.

18
00:00:58,444 --> 00:00:59,544
And April 6th?

19
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,342
That was the last day she worked.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,289
But she received unemployment
benefits for that week.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,810
We fixed that, I know we
did, we returned the money.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,834
That's the canceled check.

23
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,922
Not the real one,
you know, it's a copy.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,370
And you're the dependent?

25
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:20,840
No, that's my little brother.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,270
I'm eighteen. Just helpin' out.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,010
You're all set.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,769
Just need a signature.

29
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,810
Hey! I'm talking to you.

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,989
The cat's first.

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,710
Now it's your turn, Lucy.

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,530
Shhhhh. Shut up,
shut up, shut up!

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,310
It's OK, she just, she just
needs a little water, is all...

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,610
I'll go get it.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,180
Just hold on, OK, just...

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,179
when she comes back, sign
it and we're gonna be done.

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,180
We need this, OK? Please?

38
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,830
OK.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,620
The voices...

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,040
The voices aren't real.

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,290
Mom? Mom!

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,030
Dr. Gregory House,
please call Dr. Cuddy at extension 3731.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,780
This is a good hospital?

44
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
Depends what you mean by "good."

45
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,280
I like these chairs.

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,090
How is she?

47
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,550
Stable. OK. Your mom had a
small pulmonary embolism;

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,290
Blood clot that got stuck in
her lungs, blocked the oxygen.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,570
But the pain started in her leg.

50
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,349
Where the clot started. Her calf.

51
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,239
It's called a deep vein thrombosis.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,380
Basically a bigger clot.

53
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,079
It never hurt there before.
I would have noticed.

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,069
Piece of that broke off, went
up the vein, through the heart,

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,270
blocked the blood flow to her lungs.
No blood flow, no oxygen.

56
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,370
OK...

57
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,929
Is your dad here? I have some
things I need to talk to him about.

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,330
Uh, my dad's running a little late.

59
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,230
He's dead. Just talk to me?
I take care of her.

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,279
All right. Your mom's blood alcohol
was .12. Ten thirty in the morning.

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,229
I gave it to her. Two ounces of vodka.
It cools her out.

62
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,429
But that's the first since Monday.
That was three days ago.

63
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,620
I've been real careful.

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,719
She hears voices.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,930
She's schizophrenic?
Explains the DVT.

66
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,809
The alcohol makes her pass out,
she's immobile for long periods of time...

67
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,759
That doesn't happen.
She's not an alcoholic.

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,360
She only drinks when you give it to her.

69
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,189
We put her on blood thinners.
You can probably take her home tomorrow.

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,530
It's not the alcohol, it's
gotta be something else.

71
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,820
Of course it's the alcohol.

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Hello!

73
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,220
This guy's a professional doctor.

74
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,970
Plays golf and everything, I bet.

75
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,820
He's not gonna tell you your mom's
an alcoholic without proof.

76
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm sure he scoped for varices, checked her
esophagus, ran all kinds of blood tests.

77
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,030
Doctors like this, they don't make
assumptions, they do the work!

78
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,350
I'd be happy to refer you
the case, Dr. House.

79
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,310
You seem so interested.

80
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,520
What case? It's over.
You're sending her home.

81
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,100
How old is she?

82
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,230
You're a doctor?

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,380
Own my own stethoscope.

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,320
Did I ask you how
old she was? I forget.

85
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,389
Thirty eight year old woman
with no previous symptoms

86
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,749
or history presents with
deep vein thrombosis.

87
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,570
How did she get it?

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,730
Oral contraceptives, smoking, diabetes,
obesity, and what's the point here?

89
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,400
A DVT's a DVT.

90
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,750
Put her on IV heparin to
prevent future clots.

91
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,850
What's the big mystery?

92
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:35,310
Fine. You're all sleeping.
You need a clue.

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,310
She's 38 years old!

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,969
She's 20 years too young to
get a deep vein thrombosis!

95
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,909
I treated a 12 year old girl once,

96
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,569
soccer player,
she got kicked in the leg...

97
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,500
There was no trauma,
none of the risk factors.

98
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,440
You took a history?

99
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,190
I... have some notes.

100
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,040
They're not mine, but they're reliable,
I think, for purposes of this discussion.

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,270
As for the immobility, well, she's
real active right now, of course.

102
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,179
Paranoia keeps her limber.

103
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,940
Paranoia?

104
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh yeah? She's schizophrenic.

105
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,900
And her kid wrote this,
so it might be a little biased.

106
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,360
Having to take care of
his nutso mom and all.

107
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,030
You think there's a connection?

108
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,679
Do we include schizophrenia
in the differential for DVT?

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,110
Well...

110
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:15,430
The answer is no.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,669
Abnormal dopaminergic pathways
in the brain do not cause blood clots.

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,850
Schizophrenia is not the cause of DVT.

113
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,929
On the other hand, we don't
really know anything

114
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,839
about schizophrenia, so
maybe it is connected.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,369
Well, the schizophrenia
explains one mystery.

116
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,709
Why you're so fascinated by a
woman with a bump in her leg?

117
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,799
It's like Picasso deciding
to whitewash a fence.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,780
Thanks. I'm more of a Leroy Neiman man.

119
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,799
And it is only about the DVT.

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,989
- She's 38 years old, she should be...
- Right. Solve this one

121
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,269
and you're on your way to Stockholm.

122
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,739
We don't even know how to treat it!

123
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,590
Come on! Fumigation of the vagina?

124
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,079
A little louder... I don't
think everyone heard you.

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,990
Two thousand years ago, that's how
Galen treated schizophrenics.

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,989
The Marcus Welby of ancient Greece.

127
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,169
Clearly you're not interested.

128
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,060
I'm interested.

129
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,849
I'm interested in how voices in the head

130
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,849
could be caused by
malposition of the uterus.

131
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,859
There's a better place for it?

132
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,510
And now what have we got?

133
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,069
We've got lobotomies, rubber rooms,

134
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,329
electric shock - my -
Galen was so primitive.

135
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,330
Where are you going?

136
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,840
Going to see the patient.

137
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,860
That all-important human connection.
Thought I'd give it a whirl.

138
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,979
You won't talk to patients
because they lie, but

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,069
give you patient with no
concept of reality...

140
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,499
If it wasn't for Socrates, that
raving untreated schizophrenic,

141
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,189
we wouldn't have the Socratic method
the best way of teaching everything,

142
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,870
apart from juggling chainsaws.

143
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,299
Without Isaac Newton, we'd
be floating on the ceiling.

144
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,769
Dodging chainsaws, no doubt.

145
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,740
And that guitar player in that
English band, he was great.

146
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,490
You think I'm interested
because of the schizophrenia.

147
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,350
Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

148
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,110
Galen was pretty sure about
the fumigation thing.

149
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Pink Floyd.

150
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,009
Mom, this is Dr...

151
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,920
Gregory House, nice to meet you.

152
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,360
Be all right if we spoke alone for awhile?

153
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,530
Well, you're gonna need me to...

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,520
Got your case notes... doctor.

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,619
There's a cafeteria downstairs.

156
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,709
Get yourself whatever you want
as long as there's enough left

157
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,500
over for a reuben sandwich, dry,
no fries, hold the pickles.

158
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,350
Should run you about $5.80 with tax.

159
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,910
I'll page you when we're done.

160
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,830
No... pickles.

161
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,020
Nice kid.

162
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,930
How much do you really drink?

163
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,390
He's really talking to a patient?

164
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,450
I don't know who I am anymore.

165
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,350
It's a blood clot. What's
so fascinating about that?

166
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,310
He likes crazy people.
Likes the way they think.

167
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,279
They think... badly.

168
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,359
That's the definition of crazy.
Why would he like...

169
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,940
They're not boring. He likes that.

170
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,020
And the meds...

171
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,720
Baseball! I like baseball.

172
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,590
- Very nice.
- Very sad.

173
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,760
My boy and me.
we went to see a game.

174
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,960
Not "Mets"? Meds. Medicine.

175
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,460
You take what he tells you to take.

176
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,570
No one believes me.

177
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,990
I do.

178
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,440
I thought he liked rationality.

179
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,820
He likes puzzles.

180
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,370
Patients are puzzles?

181
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
You don't think so?

182
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,190
I think they're people.

183
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah. Well, he hates them,
and he's fascinated by them.

184
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,690
Tell me you can't relate to that symptom.

185
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,329
You told Luke it never hurt before.

186
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,000
Just rough. They didn't hurt.

187
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,290
Didn't?

188
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,890
Don't lie to him, Limpie.

189
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,820
Lively Lucy never lies to Lucas.
Look what I do to him.

190
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,420
Learn anything from the "human connection"?

191
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,570
Yeah. The Mets suck.

192
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,860
Also, for the last two months,
she hasn't shaved her legs.

193
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,029
Because of the tremors.
She cuts herself.

194
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,389
The tremors aren't new
she must always cut herself.

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,719
Exactly. Something changed
in the last two months.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,699
I'm thinking the amount of
blood when she cut herself.

197
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
So let's start with some bloodwork.

198
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,659
Collect and send for
clotting studies, PT, PTT,

199
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,090
factor 5, protein, CNS,
the whole shebang.

200
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
Good luck.

201
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,130
No pickles, and it's cold now.

202
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,946
If it's a reuben, that's
the way he likes it.

203
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,270
Everyone, this is Luke.

204
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,079
Allison Cameron, it's
nice to finally meet...

205
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,460
Yeah, save it, we're busy.

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,530
Luke, give us another half hour with
your mom. We need to do some tests.

207
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,470
Nice kid.

208
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,299
Take her off the psych meds,

209
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,149
that way we'll know what's
what on the physical side,

210
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,870
and who knows, we might
get more out of her.

211
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,750
Don't worry? No pickles.

212
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Happy birthday.

213
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,990
OK. Whose?

214
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,820
I was going through your mail,
and it was on a form.

215
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Happy birthday.

216
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Oh.

217
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,650
No, no blood, not mine!

218
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,550
For the test, Dr. House told you...

219
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,150
You're gonna steal it,
sell it, no, no blood,

220
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,390
No, no blood, no, no blood, no!

221
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,149
Haldol, 5 milligrams, stat.

222
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:14,050
No...

223
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,700
Well, good news, the lab says
it's not strep, so we're done.

224
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Wait a second...

225
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:39,220
No, really, not strep.

226
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,346
Boys in the lab, sure, they're hard
drinkers, but they're pros, you know.

227
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,629
Plus, your kid actually has
none of the symptoms of strep,

228
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,739
I just figured it was quicker running
the test than arguing with you.

229
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,019
My point is? Go!

230
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,050
I just wanted to ask your opinion, doctor.

231
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,909
She's having a birthday party next week

232
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,009
and she's upset that I'm
getting a sugarless cake.

233
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,290
The other kids hate it!

234
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,739
This is why you're here.

235
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,069
Sugar is the leading cause
of obesity in America.

236
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,689
You want a doctor to scare her
about the dangers of sugar.

237
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,430
She needs to get her weight under control.

238
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,840
Well, you know...

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,749
I feel sorry for those other kids,
Wendy, who don't have a mom like yours

240
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,829
a mom who knows that

241
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,159
sugar causes heart disease,
appendicitis, and athlete's foot.

242
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,229
That's not fair.

243
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,740
Oh, yes it is. No, I get it.

244
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,509
You want her to slim down a little, so
she can wear pretty clothes like yours.

245
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,930
Love the bracelets.

246
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,010
Hey! What about matching outfits?

247
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,690
You could be twins!

248
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,120
She can't be your daughter, it's
impossible, you look way too young!

249
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,610
Happy birthday.

250
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,550
Get the kid a damned ice cream cake.

251
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
You drugged her.

252
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,009
Actually, I didn't. I've taken
her off all medications.

253
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,900
Your guy, Foreman, gave her Haldol.

254
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,189
We needed blood for some tests.

255
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,749
I assume that was the only way to get it.

256
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,750
He knocked her out.

257
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,270
Look! I have a cane, and
I know how to use it.

258
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,360
I hired you. You work for me.

259
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,170
OK, can I go now?

260
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,390
Boss?

261
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,070
The Haldol changes her.

262
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,830
She says it makes her soul numb.

263
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,090
Don't give it to her.

264
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,650
If there be rags enough,
he will know her name.

265
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,910
And be well pleased remembering it.

266
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,190
You OK?

267
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,350
Old... days...

268
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,959
For in the old days,

269
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,510
Though she had young men's
praise and old men's blame,

270
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,600
Among the poor, both old
and young gave her praise.

271
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,570
Help! Somebody, help!

272
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,310
So, when I said, "no psych meds",

273
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm just curious,

274
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,589
which word didn't you understand?

275
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,010
The Haldol had nothing to do
with the bleed. You know that.

276
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,389
I used it purely as a chemical restraint.

277
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,150
Oh, great, well, that's good to hear.

278
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,969
So she won't experience
any of those pesky little

279
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,200
side effects you get when
your motives aren't pure.

280
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,650
Those side effects are so rare!

281
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,299
Passing out, increased confusion,
depression, that's not gonna happen.

282
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,689
That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis,
'cause you just used it to restrain her.

283
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,690
I'm so relieved!

284
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,310
She spit in my face!

285
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,390
It must have been so frightening for you.

286
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,179
What was I supposed to do? Tie her down?

287
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,550
Yeah! Anything but give her drugs.
That's basically my point!

288
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,110
The clotting studies.

289
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,280
Pretty fast, you promise
to date the entire lab?

290
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,360
No. I save that for emergencies.

291
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,980
I told them she bled out two units
and if it happened again, she'd die.

292
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,040
If it'd happened at home,
she would have died.

293
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,910
That ER doc,
he was gonna send her home.

294
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,069
It turns out your best
judgment is not good enough.

295
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,740
Here's an idea.
Next time, use mine.

296
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,500
I think they're choosing a movie.

297
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,180
Why did the patient bleed out?

298
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,300
The clotting studies so far are normal.

299
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,560
Well, cover your ears if you don't
want me to spoil the ending.

300
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,250
Everything was normal,
except for prolonged PT time,

301
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,350
which means what?

302
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,730
Usually it means, whoever drew
the blood didn't do it right.

303
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,990
Oh, that's right. 'Cause...
you drew the blood.

304
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,129
But you were precise, because you knew
the tube was purely for the PT study.

305
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,700
That's right.

306
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
And I'm right with you.

307
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,240
I trust this result.

308
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,560
For two reasons. A, because
you are a good doctor,

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,260
and b, because five
milligrams of IV Haldol

310
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,760
makes for a spectacularly
cooperative patient.

311
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,270
The prolonged PT time makes me think
she's got a vitamin K deficiency.

312
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,339
Vitamin K would explain the
bleed but not the clot.

313
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,060
Without vitamin K, protein C doesn't work.
Without protein C, she clots.

314
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,349
Clotting and thinning,
all at the same time.

315
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,450
What about another drug
interacting with heparin,

316
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,649
an antibiotic like ampicillin?
That would...

317
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,050
Clever, but she's not on ampicillin.

318
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,869
Two months ago, she complained of a
sore throat. And he got her ampicillin.

319
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,949
Which she refused to take.

320
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,159
He just said she didn't take it.

321
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,979
What is it, everybody lies, except for
schizophrenics and their children?

322
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,750
It's more likely than malnourishment.

323
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,830
Why not scurvy or the plague?

324
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,740
Gee, I wish my idea was as
cool and with it as yours.

325
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,940
What is yours, by the way?
Do you have one?

326
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,390
Alcohol. Simple.

327
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,109
It causes immobility,
which explains the DVT.

328
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,280
It also causes cirrhosis which explains
the bleed and the prolonged PT time.

329
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,160
Let's ultrasound the liver.

330
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,170
Three theories.

331
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,340
Check out her place for ampicillin
and diet, then ultrasound her liver.

332
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,140
Let's find out who's right
before she bleeds to death.

333
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
101.

334
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,130
So House says the kid's sensitive.

335
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,810
Thinks he takes good care of her.

336
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,899
If we don't find anything, why let him
know we did it in the first place?

337
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
What's the point?

338
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,370
Why not just make old Foreman lift
the key from the kid's backpack?

339
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,420
Looks like Luke sleeps in the living room.

340
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Nothing in there.

341
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,350
He lays out her clothes?

342
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,800
Enough organization, enough lists, you
think you can control the uncontrollable.

343
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,980
Fix her meds, fix her clothes,
maybe you can even fix her.

344
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,430
Pick that up on your psych rotation?

345
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,780
Trifluo perazine, Thorazine,
Foziril. They tried everything.

346
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,750
The ampicillin... never touched it.

347
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,409
There goes Cameron's theory.

348
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,260
Oh, God, I hope it's not
a vitamin K deficiency.

349
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,350
Oh. Damn.

350
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,600
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

351
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
House was right.

352
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,990
That's the only thing she'll eat.

353
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,260
Problem is, you can't
actually live on this stuff.

354
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,230
I checked it out, I looked on the box,
all the nutritional values were solid.

355
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,409
There's plenty of protein, and calories...

356
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,900
Yeah, vitamin A and C, but no K.

357
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,400
That's why your mom got sick.

358
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,420
So, what's the plan?

359
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,280
Load her up with vitamin K.

360
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,550
That's it?

361
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,440
If it all checks out, you can take
her home in a couple of days.

362
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,790
Oh God, you're upset about something.

363
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,999
You're gonna open to me now, aren't you?

364
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,120
It's all my fault.

365
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
Here we go...

366
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,510
OK, I'm gonna say this once.

367
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,360
You have done a very good job
taking care of your mother.

368
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,830
If this was all she'd eat,
then what else could you do?

369
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,049
Gosh, just being a kid
is a full-time job...

370
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,840
Shut up! I'm 18, I should be
able to take care of my mom!

371
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,970
I almost killed her.

372
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,090
Good example.

373
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,670
Just the time it takes to express those
ridiculous self-centered teenage ideas...

374
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't envy your schedule.

375
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,850
No pickles.

376
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,490
My mom doesn't like them either.

377
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Smart woman.

378
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,200
Before she got sick,
I didn't like how bossy she was,

379
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,090
always telling me what to do,
the right way to do it.

380
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,800
Never thought I'd miss that.

381
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,060
You should get that looked at.

382
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,750
I still don't buy a vitamin K deficiency.

383
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,150
House was right.

384
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,400
That usually makes you happy.
Less work for us.

385
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,429
The kid feeds his mum a steady diet of
booze and the problem is too many burgers?

386
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,750
The kid's in a tough situation.

387
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,440
You do what you've gotta do to survive.

388
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,770
Feeding alcohol to an alcoholic
is not a survival technique.

389
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,739
Where I come from, if it works...

390
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,190
Yeah, right. I'm rich,

391
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,210
I couldn't possibly understand
what this kid is going through.

392
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,170
Just because you're drinking pricier stuff
doesn't mean you don't have a problem.

393
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,100
You've seen someone stagger down that road?

394
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
No way vitamin K's the whole story.

395
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
It's not broken.

396
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,150
See this right here?

397
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,120
It's the epiphyseal plate,
otherwise known as the growth plate.

398
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,530
What's wrong with it?

399
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,210
Amazing thing, this bone.

400
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,761
If you know how to read it, it can
tell you how old someone really is.

401
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,510
Exactly how old.

402
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,410
Great.

403
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,490
Not even fifteen. Almost, though.

404
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,520
Two weeks away, maybe a month.

405
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,510
Last week.

406
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,640
I was fifteen last week.

407
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,360
Happy birthday to both of us.

408
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,660
If you're gonna lie though, go big, go 21.

409
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,460
That way you won't need your
crazy mom to help you buy vodka.

410
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,550
Great. Thanks for the tip.

411
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,809
Now, when I bring my mom home,

412
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,300
is there anything I need to
know about taking care of her?

413
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,900
I suppose your biggest
worry isn't the booze.

414
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,670
You're 15, basically no mom.

415
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,249
Child Welfare let kids get away with that,

416
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,986
well, they wouldn't need
those nice foster homes,

417
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,459
and that would make them sad.

418
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,840
They'd put her someplace too.

419
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,430
My life is working.

420
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,500
Not the word I'd use.

421
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,280
Most 15 year old kids are doing
what they're supposed to be doing,

422
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,179
you know, they're huffing
glue, catching crabs...

423
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,520
If you turn me in, I'll sue you.
That's privileged information.

424
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,830
Oh, relax. It's not even your x-ray.

425
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,060
She's awfully calm.

426
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,520
House write new orders?

427
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,589
There's a little bit of scarring,
not much, not enough to con...

428
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,610
It's cirrhosis. But she doesn't drink!

429
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,690
Congratulations, you win.

430
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,150
Actually...

431
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,250
no one wins.

432
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,310
A tumor. Cystic?

433
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,590
Solid mass.

434
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Cancer.

435
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,750
The vitamin K caused the DVT,
and aggravated the liver.

436
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,810
But the tumor's the real
reason for the bleed.

437
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,260
The tumor's the problem.

438
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,720
Mrs. Palmeiro, I'm Dr Wilson.

439
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,810
I'm afraid I have some bad
news from your ultrasound.

440
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,230
You have cancer.

441
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,549
It's big. Five point eight centimeters.

442
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,449
We do nothing, she dies from
liver failure within 60 days.

443
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,400
She needs a transplant.

444
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,230
That's gonna happen.

445
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,609
She's a 38 years old, she's a mother...

446
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,689
She's a schizophrenic mother, with
no money, on the public dole,

447
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,599
in fact, who knocks back vodka
every time a breeze blows her way.

448
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,869
Mickey Mantle had a whole
bar named after him.

449
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,899
He got a transplant.

450
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit.

451
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,859
Plan B. Surgery to resect the tumor.

452
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,630
Joe Bergen does the knife thing...

453
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,319
laser cauterizes while it
cuts, saves more liver.

454
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,699
The tumor's way too big.
He won't even consider it.

455
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,169
Not a big risk taker, Bergen. He won't
even drink milk on its expiration date.

456
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,170
He has no discretion.

457
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,800
Would he do it at 4.6?

458
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,306
Why don't we just say it's zero,
then we don't need him at all.

459
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,880
Tumors grow, they don't shrink.

460
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,810
This one does.

461
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,690
Ninety five percent ethanol.

462
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,760
The ethanol dehydrates the tumor cells,
literally sucks them dry.

463
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,140
Shrinks the tumor temporarily.

464
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,720
How temporarily?

465
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,590
Well, if we're lucky,

466
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,820
just long enough to fool the surgeon.

467
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,150
Good morning, Dr. House!

468
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,940
Good morning, Dr. Cuddy!

469
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,730
Love that outfit.

470
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,330
Says, I'm professional,
but I'm still a woman.

471
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,960
Actually, it sorta yells the second part.

472
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,870
Yeah, and your big cane is real subtle too.

473
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Gotta go.

474
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,580
Those running noses aren't just
gonna start walking on their own.

475
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,970
The clinic can wait.

476
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,920
How long? Maybe we could catch a movie.

477
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,850
You should know by now my doctors
have no secrets from me.

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I don't believe it.

479
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,410
Who came running to Mommy?

480
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,450
It doesn't matter who. The point is,
I know exactly what you did.

481
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,750
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

482
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,470
Somebody knows about a bad thing
you did. That's a big field.

483
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,060
But somebody you think might have told
me, that narrows it down quite a bit.

484
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,999
Someone who views me as a
maternal authority figure.

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,850
A young person,
perhaps... How am I doing?

486
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,150
You think I'm gonna get there?

487
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,549
Presumably hospital business.
How many patients...

488
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,239
It's Cameron. She... found
out about my birthday.

489
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,949
I thought she told you, and
I'd have to stand here and

490
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,870
smile while you gave me a
sweatshirt or a fruit basket,

491
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,800
you know, made me feel that
deep sense of belonging.

492
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,280
Actually, I was just gonna remind you,
you owe me six clinic hours this week.

493
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Oops.

494
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,409
Hi, this is Dr. Cuddy.

495
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,700
I need all the charts
on Dr. House's current patients.

496
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,230
I've tried everything.

497
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,050
Pulling the tongue, icepacks
on the throat, hitting yourself...

498
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,050
the groin pinch.

499
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Well, you've certainly covered
all the normal medical bases.

500
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,089
How are you hitting yourself, though?

501
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,929
Is it open hand or fist?

502
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,930
Open hand.

503
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,329
Well, that's how they
teach it at Harvard Med.

504
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,330
How hard though?

505
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,290
I'm sorry, I missed that. Could...
could you do that again?

506
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,120
That's very good. Hiccups.

507
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,510
I need to speak with you. Now.

508
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,140
I need to go peepee.

509
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,520
Just dial it up a notch and repeat.
I'll be back.

510
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,329
Oh, girl in the boys' bathroom.

511
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,330
Very dramatic.

512
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,870
Must be very important what
you have to say to me.

513
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,709
Yesterday your patient's tumor was
5.8 centimeters. Today it's 4.6.

514
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,710
How did that happen?

515
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
At a guess, I'd say,

516
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,160
"Dr. House must be really really good.
why am I wasting him on hiccups?"

517
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,930
I wash before and after.

518
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,730
You also requisitioned 20cc of ethanol.

519
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,609
What patient was that for?
Or are you planning a party?

520
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,610
Do me a favor...?

521
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,370
I was gonna say "leave," but that works.

522
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,169
You shrunk the tumor!

523
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:08,870
Only way to get the

524
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:09,979
- guy to do the surgery...
- Fraud!

525
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,730
Fraud was the only way.

526
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,949
There is a reason that we
have these guidelines.

527
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,380
I know, to save lives.

528
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,340
Specifically doctors' lives, and not
just their lives but their lifestyles.

529
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,929
Wouldn't wanna operate
on anyone really sick.

530
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,489
They might die and spoil our stats.

531
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,989
Bergen has a right to know
what he is operating on.

532
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,689
True. I got all focused on her
right to live, and forgot.

533
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,930
You do what you think is right.

534
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,710
You really didn't know.

535
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,950
No. I didn't.

536
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,750
And frankly I'm angry.

537
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,949
Which I'm guessing is the correct response.

538
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,839
'Cause I'll know better once you
tell me what you're talking about.

539
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Your birthday.

540
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,570
Oh. Anger was a bad guess.

541
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,449
Well, normally I'd put on a
festive hat and celebrate the

542
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,900
fact that the earth has circled
the sun one more time.

543
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,969
I really didn't think it was gonna
make it this year, but darnit,

544
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,540
if it wasn't the Little Planet
That Could all over again.

545
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,780
It's a birthday.

546
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,650
It's an excuse to be happy.

547
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
You think that's lame?

548
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,210
Why are you here?

549
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,610
To buy me a pony?

550
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,360
I'm just waiting for the surgery.

551
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,540
Yeah well, go scrub in.

552
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,660
All right, done. Close her up.

553
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,770
That tumor didn't just
walk itself into a bar

554
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,930
and order up a double shot of ethanol.

555
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,260
Someone shrunk it down.

556
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,910
I'm sorry.
It was very, very wrong.

557
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,230
House is lucky I didn't just close her up.

558
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,740
He tries again, that's what happens.

559
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,900
I'll pass it on.

560
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,509
It looks like the surgeon got it all,

561
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,070
but she's gonna have
to have some chemotherapy.

562
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,390
What kind is it?

563
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,440
Luke, stop writing.

564
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,860
If you stop for a second,
it's not all gonna fall apart.

565
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,759
Give yourself a break once in a while.

566
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,459
The fact is, your mum's gonna have
an extra drink every now and then.

567
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,200
No. No, she won't, she doesn't.

568
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,910
Fine.

569
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,650
There are some things you just
can't fix, that's all I'm saying.

570
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,770
That's how you'd handle
it, something like this?

571
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,630
You'd just give up?

572
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,310
No.

573
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,000
I'd do it just like you.

574
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,570
It's an infusion.

575
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,180
She's gonna have a drain in her abdomen,

576
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,830
you're gonna have to check
for possible infections.

577
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,620
Lucas Palmeiro?

578
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,310
Trina Wyeth,

579
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,739
Child Services, State of New Jersey.

580
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,859
Can I help you?
This is a private room.

581
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,330
He's only 15 years old, a minor,

582
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,120
he's in a tough living situation.
We're just here to help.

583
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,329
I don't need your help.

584
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,330
15?

585
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,570
Lucas, you're gonna have
to come with us. Right Now.

586
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,150
Where are you taking him?

587
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:31,669
Until the determination had been made
he'll be housed at Children's Services.

588
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,140
I don't wanna be housed,
I live with my mom.

589
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,210
Not for the next few days.

590
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,030
Come on, let's not make
this difficult, huh?

591
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,610
Mom?

592
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Mom?

593
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
I love you.

594
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,760
The Mets lost. You remember?

595
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,850
Yeah. I remember.

596
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,830
I love you.

597
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,069
Cuddy didn't say anything about
pushing Bergen to finish the surgery?

598
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,089
Not a word. Some kind of mind game.
She's waiting for me to crack.

599
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,080
Well, either that, or
she's just being nice.

600
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,290
Yeah, right...

601
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,740
You said you wouldn't call.

602
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,420
You're a real bastard, you know?

603
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,100
Yeah. I get that a lot.

604
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,360
I don't think Mom's crazy.

605
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,349
For in the old days,

606
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,330
Though she had young men's
praise and old men's blame,

607
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,150
Among the poor both old and
young gave her praise.

608
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,990
You called Social Services.

609
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
It was you.

610
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,349
No, no. No.

611
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,440
It's OK, it's OK, I get it.

612
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,980
He'll have an easier time
dealing with the system.

613
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,130
Sure, he won't be with his real mother,
but his real mother's sick.

614
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,350
Someone needs to take care of him.

615
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm not gonna live here.

616
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,490
What would his future have been?

617
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,010
Taking you to chemo
and back on the bus...

618
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,320
and even if the cancer's
in complete remission,

619
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,830
he'll still have a mother who hears voices.

620
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,960
Talk no more, talk... no more.

621
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,140
"Look what I do to him, limpie."
You said that.

622
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,920
I checked the phone records.

623
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,180
Only one call from this room.

624
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,730
Smart. They charge you two bucks a call.

625
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,940
It was to Social Services
of the State of New Jersey.

626
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,030
You're his mother.

627
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,850
Couldn't do it to him anymore.

628
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,910
Good for you.

629
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,820
Schizophrenics can make rational decisions.

630
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,549
On the small stuff, yeah, when to
sleep, what to drink, you know,

631
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,970
no lemonade but I'll take some
hemlock if you've got it.

632
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,459
Your man Socrates.

633
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,239
But giving up your son,
because it's better for him.

634
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,630
It's so sane, so rational.

635
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,680
Self-sacrifice is not a symptom of
schizophrenia... it excludes the diagnosis.

636
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,439
She's not schizophrenic?

637
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,609
She's 36 years old when
she first presents...

638
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,409
It's a little late, but
within the parameters.

639
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,869
The internist sends her to a shrink,
one shrink sends her to the next,

640
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,949
she tells them all she's
not crazy, the drugs don't

641
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,870
work and why would they
if she's not a head case?

642
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,450
She got clearer when I took
her off the psych meds.

643
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,119
You think I'm crazy.

644
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,980
Well, yeah, but that's not the problem.

645
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,740
Didn't we just leave your office?

646
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I like to walk.

647
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,470
Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters?

648
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,920
Hi. My name is Greg House, I'm a doctor...

649
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,250
Oh, is that the time? Yeah, I'm sorry,
my watch must have stopped.

650
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,979
Listen, you treated a
patient about eighteen

651
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,299
months ago, a woman
named Lucille Palmeiro,

652
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,310
I wondered if you recalled
running any tests...

653
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,150
at all.

654
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,050
Oh, how terribly foolish of
me, doctor, is it that late?

655
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,730
Yes, I'm calling from London, you see,
must have got my times mixed up so...

656
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,909
I have a headache.
It's my only symptom.

657
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,110
I go to see three doctors.

658
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,629
The neurologist tells me it's an aneurysm,

659
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,849
the immunologist says I got hay fever,

660
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,860
the intensivist... can't be
bothered, sends me to a shrink,

661
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,139
who tells me that I'm punishing myself
'cause I wanna sleep with my mommy.

662
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,059
Maybe you're just not getting enough sleep.

663
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,910
Pick your specialist,
you pick your disease.

664
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,539
If it's not schizophrenia, what
else presents with psych symptoms?

665
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,240
Prophyria.

666
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,419
The madness of King George.

667
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,260
What about that copper thing?
What's it called?

668
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,330
It's genetic... the body
accumulates too much copper.

669
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,129
Oh, uh, Wilson's disease?

670
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,910
Yeah.

671
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:24,039
Very rare. Nice. I like it.

672
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
If any of us did this, you'd fire us.

673
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,869
Well, that's funny, I thought I
encouraged you to question...

674
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,160
You're not questioning, you're hoping,

675
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,450
you want it to be Wilson's, boom!
Give her a couple of drugs, she's OK!

676
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,409
July 17, an appointment with a Dr. Carne.

677
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,169
She didn't keep it. She
never kept another

678
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,836
appointment with a shrink
he made after that.

679
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,319
Carne is not a shrink.

680
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,330
I looked him up, he's an ophthalmologist.

681
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,229
Now why would she want her eyes checked?

682
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,910
Wilson's presents with cataracts, I think.

683
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
Yes, it does.

684
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,590
It also causes slight cirrhosis, which Dr.
Chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol.

685
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,500
So what are we still doing here?

686
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Lucy!

687
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,390
I don't think you're crazy.

688
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,130
Neither do I, but I'm crazy...

689
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,230
Come on.

690
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:18,550
Put your hands on the bar here,
and your chin in here. Thank you.

691
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,560
You're gonna see a bright light, OK?

692
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,430
Your body might be
accumulating too much copper.

693
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,530
If it is, this should help us see
something called Kaiser-Fleischer rings,

694
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,830
copper-colored circles around your corneas.

695
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,870
Well, I guess we should start
treating her for Wilson's.

696
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,580
It's what I'd do.

697
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,470
I will talk no more of
books or the long war.

698
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:00,680
But walk by the dry thorn until I have found
Some beggar sheltering from the wind,

699
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,020
and there, manage the talk
until her name come round.

700
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,910
If there be rags enough
he will know her name.

701
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,570
And be well pleased remembering it,

702
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,570
For in the old days, though she had
young men's praise and old men's blame,

703
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,670
Among the poor both old and
young gave her praise.

704
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,410
Hi, Mrs. Palmeiro, ready to go home?

705
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,590
Almost.

706
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,770
Mom?

707
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
How are you?

708
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,310
I'm good.

709
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,410
Oh, you really need a haircut.

710
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,040
Dr. House!

711
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,460
Luke, you're making Dr. House wait!

712
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,080
That's OK, we're just here for the music.

713
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,160
Luke, come on.

714
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,130
I'm being discharged.

715
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,960
I heard a rumor.

716
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,070
Thank God I had cancer, huh?

717
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,660
It's terrible having everybody
think you're nuts...

718
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,940
Really?

719
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,509
I called to thank you,
did you get my message?

720
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,110
Yes. You're welcome.

721
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,240
I'm never thanking you.
You turned me in.

722
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,899
I told you we were doing OK,
it was none of your business.

723
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,530
Look. I don't care how you were living.
I just wanted you out of my life.

724
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,820
That's why I had Dr. Cuddy
call Social Services.

725
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,810
You OK?

726
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,790
You were right. It wasn't the DVT.

727
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,310
It was the schizophrenia.

728
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,410
I know.

729
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,070
She's not nearly as interesting any more.

730
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,590
Isn't it your birthday around now?
