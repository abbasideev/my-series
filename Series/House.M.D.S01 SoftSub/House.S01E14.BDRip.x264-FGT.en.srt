1
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,548
Where are those projections?

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,812
3, 6, and 9 are in your folders.

3
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:12,539
- Can I have some more...
- Tea's at your seat.

4
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:13,563
- Excellent.
- Hello?

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
Oh, hold on.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,595
Ben Federman again.
Another pre-call.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,597
We did the pre-call.
This is the post-pre-call-call?

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:26,559
The Board's gonna want some specifics
for the push into the Asian market.

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,602
Ben, there are no specifics about Asia.

10
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:30,923
We came up with that as a
Hail Mary at three in the morning

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,060
to placate the
board about International!

12
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,581
Carly, I'm just giving you
a heads-up about Asia.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,360
There is no Asia.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,320
Let's talk about Asia.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,679
We're in the preliminary stages of

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,382
forming a strategic
alliance with Credit Lyonnais.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,182
Within three months you won't be able to
walk four feet in Kyung Hong, South Korea,

18
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,739
without seeing one of our
beautiful models smiling at you

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,112
from billboards and drugstore
windows inviting you in.

20
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,808
That's incredible news, Carly.

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,633
We'd hoped to hear something about Asia,

22
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:02,729
but had no idea plans were so far along.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,249
Well, you know Asia.
Nothing's done until it's done.

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,899
Carly, I was wondering,
could you walk us through

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,394
what you were thinking for
other Asian territories?

26
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:16,009
Absolutely. India has over
half a billion women.

27
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,139
In terms of spending power

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,096
it's the single largest
potential market in the world.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,299
We have retained a
local firm to ensure

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,208
that cultural
differences are respected,

31
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,613
however, I can't go into the specifics
of my plan with you until tomorrow;

32
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:39,802
Right now I have a meeting
and I need the room.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,036
We were just getting started.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,306
I know, and I do apologize.

35
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:46,673
It's last minute, but the
meeting is with three State.

36
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,841
Department officials to
smooth the way for China.

37
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,272
China? This is just incredible.

38
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:53,197
We'll be in touch.

39
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,198
Thank you.

40
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:56,896
What is it?

41
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,185
I need a doctor. I can't move my leg!

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,779
32-year-old female, paralysis and
severe pain in her right quad. Go.

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,000
How'd she get to you?

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,369
Who da man? I da man.
I always suspected.

45
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,090
Dr. House, I know
the chances are very slim, but

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,870
I'm sure you recognize that she may
have what you had: A clot in her thigh.

47
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,870
A bit of a long shot.

48
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,860
What about a disc herniation?

49
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,549
I don't know, Eric.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,199
If her disc were herniated,

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
she'd present
with pain elsewhere, wouldn't she?

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,380
Yeah, I suppose.

53
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:16,100
You're right, a clot's also the
most deadly, right, Robert?

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,000
True. The clot breaks off,
she could stroke and die.

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,369
Dr. House, I believe that
they're right, and...

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
Stop talking.

57
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
What?

58
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,390
You read one of those
negotiating books, didn't you?

59
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,279
"Getting to Yes: Fifty
Ways to Win an Argument."

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,269
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal."

61
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,279
In five seconds you
just manipulated these two

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,249
into agreeing with your point of view.

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,700
Fellas, this is known as
"soft positional bargaining."

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
It's not gonna work.

65
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,319
Dr. House, are you saying that
she doesn't have a clot

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,499
or are you saying that if
she does have a clot she

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,960
doesn't need blood
thinners and an angiogram?

68
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,140
Chase, put her on blood
thinners, do an angiogram.

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,339
When that comes back
negative, MRI the spine.

70
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,770
If that's clean, cut her
open and biopsy the leg.

71
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,020
Excellent suggestion.

72
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,300
Read less, more TV.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,339
It's rare for an individual to
make a donation significant enough

74
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,710
to impact an organization as large
and unwieldy as a hospital.

75
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,760
This donation does come with one string:

76
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,340
That he be made Chairman of the Board.

77
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,460
I think that's a reasonable request.

78
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,300
I think he should have the right to know
what it is we do with his $100 million.

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,130
Please welcome our new Chairman
of the Board, Edward Vogler.

80
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,910
Thank you, thank you.

81
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,529
When I was eighteen, my dad loaned
me $20, 000 for a college tuition

82
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,650
which he would have known was a mistake had
he known that I wasn't actually in college.

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,450
I took his money and invested
in a friend who had a little business,

84
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,670
and when my dad found out
what I had done with his money,

85
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,710
he and I didn't talk much after that.

86
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,900
But my friend's business took off,

87
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,700
and I used the profits from that
to buy another company,

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,609
and another, and I must have been
pretty good at it, had a good eye,

89
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,660
because before I knew it
people were making offers for my company.

90
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,610
And, about a year ago I went public and
overnight I was worth a billion dollars.

91
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,130
So I went to see my dad.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,730
I'll admit, I wanted a little payback, you
know, kind of shove the wind in his face,

93
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,359
so I drove upstate and
sat in the kitchen I grew up in

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
and, he had no reaction.

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,990
It wasn't his fault,
he didn't even know who I was.

96
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,030
Because his Alzheimer's had
taken a turn for the worse,

97
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,120
despite the best drugs and care out there,

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,300
and that is why I'm here.

99
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,179
What if my contribution
to this hospital is the

100
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,080
difference between no cure
and a cure for cancer?

101
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,490
The difference between a man
not recognizing his wife

102
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,360
of 35 years and being able
to look at her and say,

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,180
"Good morning, honey. I love you."

104
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,159
If there's a disease out
there killing people,

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,400
I am writing you a blank
check to fight back.

106
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,530
So, things are going to change, a lot.

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm gonna have to ask
you for the cell phone?

108
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,710
Do what you need to do, I'm okay.

109
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,380
Pretty sure my x-ray machine can
take your phone in a fight.

110
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,160
It'll fry it.

111
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,210
Fine.

112
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,900
How old is she?

113
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
32.

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,499
Wow. She's already the
CEO of a public company.

115
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,820
She's a workaholic.

116
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,360
Okay Carly, hold still. The x-ray
machine is gonna pass over your leg.

117
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
Okay.

118
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,020
What'd you do with your time off?

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,200
Snowboarding in Stadt.

120
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Switzerland!

121
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,220
Do you ski or board? You can
come with, if you like.

122
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,200
Maybe we should start with a drink
before we go 'round the world.

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,820
Oh, you want to have a drink with me?

124
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,980
Oh, very aggressive!
I like that.

125
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,590
I want to run this place like a business.

126
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,810
What, you want to put more
vending machines in the hallway?

127
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,960
Maybe a roulette wheel?

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,190
Nice one. But I'm serious.

129
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,226
The product that you're selling is good
health, it shouldn't be a tough sell.

130
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,940
You don't want to sell,

131
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,061
it means you don't care
where people get your product.

132
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,240
You care if people are healthy,
or are you too proud for that?

133
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,050
Who's that?

134
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,860
That's, just one of our doctors.

135
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,709
Aren't doctors supposed to wear lab coats.

136
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,930
He's... different.

137
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,060
Everyone's buddy.

138
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,850
No, not exactly.

139
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,440
Then why does he get away with it?

140
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,480
It's just a coat.

141
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,580
He's very good.

142
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,309
Say "ah".

143
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,990
Ah.

144
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,440
No, really belt it out,
like you're gonna throw up.

145
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,670
Ah!

146
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,360
Perfect. Okay, that's it.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,750
We should know in a couple of days
what's growing in your son's throat.

148
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,990
Hello?

149
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,080
He can't talk.

150
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,690
Excuse me?

151
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,670
He had knee surgery.

152
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,670
Right...

153
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,400
About a year ago,
and then he couldn't talk.

154
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,010
Right, yeah, well, that happens.
You know, it's...

155
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,190
it's very dangerous operating
so close to the vocal chords.

156
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,410
Okay, well, we'll send your kid's culture
to the lab and somebody will call you.

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,520
Just wanted to see if your dad, sorry.

158
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,790
I need you to wear your lab coat.

159
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,299
I need two days of outrageous sex
with someone obscenely younger than you.

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,510
Like half your age.

161
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
Wear the coat.

162
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,059
Man oh man. Someone got spanked
real good this morning.

163
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,549
Guy gives $100 million to cure cancer,

164
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,140
pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.

165
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,930
Cure cancer.

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,860
Is the hospital getting out of
the dull business of treating patients?

167
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,216
You know that's not what he's doing.

168
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,540
I know exactly what he's doing.

169
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,419
He's using us to run clinical trials.

170
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,249
Oh, shame on him!
Saving lives like that!

171
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,670
It's unethical.

172
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,469
Oh, are you coming in, too?
I thought I had you convinced.

173
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,860
Clinical trials save thousands of lives.

174
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,289
He's using patients as guinea pigs.

175
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,320
Pharmaceutical companies do that every day.

176
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,310
Are we a pharmaceutical company?

177
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,369
We're gonna wind up
pressuring desperate patients

178
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,279
into choices that are bad
for them, good for us.

179
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,959
You're gonna compromise patient care.

180
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,509
Who the hell am I talking to?

181
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,090
Suddenly ethical lapses are
a major concern for you?

182
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,750
What's interesting is it
suddenly doesn't bother you.

183
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,109
So, if you ignore ethics to
save one person it's admirable,

184
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,439
but if you do it to save a
thousand you're a bastard.

185
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,780
All he's done is taken
your game and gone pro.

186
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,460
He's not going to kill a few patients.

187
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,510
He's going to kill this hospital.

188
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,510
It took him three seconds to size you up,
and surprise? He doesn't like you.

189
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,450
Wear the damn coat.

190
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,530
Hello. I'm Dr. Foreman,
I work with Dr. House.

191
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,570
Our initial tests say you're fine.

192
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,560
We think you may have had a clot
but it resolved on its own,

193
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,119
so we're gonna keep you overnight to be
safe and you can go back home tomorrow.

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,280
Or, back to work.

195
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,790
Hey, you okay.

196
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,540
Get in here!

197
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,730
I need a line in her,
IV morphine, stat!

198
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,929
Get any read on the new
Chairman of the Board?

199
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,590
Yeah, he took your parking space.

200
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,830
It's not necessarily bad news.

201
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,559
Do you ever watch "Gilligan's
Island" reruns and

202
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,080
really, really think they're
gonna get off the island this time?

203
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,119
We should introduce ourselves.
It couldn't hurt.

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,470
Make him a bundt cake.

205
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,860
Patient hit a ten on the pain scale.

206
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,140
What would explain that?

207
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,830
There was no clot in her leg,
the angio was totally clean.

208
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,520
What about the muscle biopsy?

209
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,090
No neurogenic or myopathic abnormalities.

210
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,600
She's also negative for trichinosis,
no toxoplasmosis or polyarteritis nodosa.

211
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,210
Robert, what was
her sedimentation rate?

212
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,779
Normal, Allison,

213
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,039
therefore no inflammation,
no immunologic response.

214
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,740
Do you mind
sharing that number with me?

215
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,070
Fifteen, Allison.

216
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,860
Are you mocking me?

217
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,210
Duh, Allison.

218
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,099
I'm just suggesting we
look outside the box.

219
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,520
What if her sed rate is elevated?

220
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,319
Well, let's go further outside the box.
Let's say the angio revealed a clot,

221
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,630
and let's say we treated that clot,
and now she's all better,

222
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,119
and personally thanked me by performing...

223
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,000
My Aunt Elisa lives in Philiadelphia.

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Oh, it's storytime!
Let me get my baba.

225
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,930
Her normal temperature is 96.2,
not 98.6 like you and me.

226
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,880
If her temperature were
98.6, she'd have a fever.

227
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,190
I'm just wondering if you think we could
apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.

228
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,440
That's absurd.

229
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
I love it.

230
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,150
If 15 is high for Carly,
then she has inflammation.

231
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,830
Which could,
in turn, mean cancer.

232
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,360
I'll talk to Wilson.

233
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,460
Next time, skip Aunt Elisa.

234
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,250
You're probably talking about
a primary bone cancer.

235
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,759
Can be tricky to detect,
you'll need a bone scan...

236
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,890
That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.

237
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,880
Sure, I've nothing better to do besides
departmental meetings and budget reports...

238
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,550
new Chairman of the Board, you know.

239
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,800
Oh! I hadn't heard.

240
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,419
Right. Clinical trials...

241
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,580
Completely unethical.

242
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,500
And a very bad omen for you.

243
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,919
There's not much money in curing
African sleeping sickness.

244
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,859
No, I have seen every
scary movie ever made.

245
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,770
Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator
of blood, boys' choirs: Those are bad omens.

246
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,310
This is much more mundane:
A billionaire wants to get laid.

247
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,170
Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid.

248
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,799
They buy hospitals to get respect.

249
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,460
And the reason you want respect?

250
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,389
To... get laid.

251
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,750
Okay then. You've just gotta
think like a billionaire.

252
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,489
Let's see, big scary changes, and then,

253
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,850
"Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to
discuss your future on my G-5 private jet."

254
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,940
Oh, come on. You know how
good you have it here.

255
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,310
Yes, I'm the big poobah,
the big cheese, the go-to guy.

256
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,059
You do the cases you want to do,

257
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,126
when you want to do them.
You're not going to get that anywhere else.

258
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,819
Relax, I've been through
three regime changes in this hospital.

259
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,289
Every time, same story.

260
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,790
Just keep your head down, that's all
I'm saying. And put on your coat.

261
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,310
It itches.

262
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,110
So, are you going to do this
bone scan for me or what?

263
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Yes.

264
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,340
Dr. Simpson!
Did you hear? New management.

265
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,300
I'm thinking about
switching to orthopedics.

266
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,659
How much do you guys get for massage now,
without the happy ending?

267
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,650
Dr. House, what do you want?

268
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,870
You remember a guy named Van Der Meer?

269
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,180
Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.

270
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,760
Well, not according to my
medical malpractice premiums.

271
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,370
Didn't get hypertensive during surgery?

272
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,360
No strokes? Maybe
some connectivity loss?

273
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,016
What, you're going to get involved now?

274
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,099
I'm not involved.
Guy brought his son into the clinic.

275
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
I didn't touch the son.

276
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,979
I'm not taking any responsibility there.

277
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,870
The son's fine.
Can't shut him up.

278
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,120
The dad show any signs of
cortical disease? Wernicke's?

279
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,140
No. Nothing.

280
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,350
And that's why we settled.
Because we couldn't find anything.

281
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,730
The guy got over a million dollars,
don't tell me he's complaining.

282
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,650
He's not saying "boo".

283
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,596
Your father wants to know
when you'll be back from your trip.

284
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,310
Email back.
"It's taking longer than I thought."

285
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,760
He doesn't need to see me like this.

286
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,190
What about your brother?

287
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
No.

288
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,840
Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was...

289
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,540
Robin, I'm going to need a minute.

290
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh.

291
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Thank you.

292
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,840
There are two Dr. Wilsons in the hospital.

293
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,170
One in ophthalmology and one in cancer.

294
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,670
My eyes are fine, so I'm guessing
you're here to tell me I have cancer.

295
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,170
There's no cancer in your bone.

296
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,650
You're not smiling.

297
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,710
There's something called referred pain.

298
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,810
You could have cancer in one part of
your body that presents in another.

299
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,300
Given your age and your family history,
I'm thinking your colon.

300
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,430
Great.

301
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,130
I was at Columbia when my mom died.

302
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,750
Now there's a blast. Cleaning up her
vomit and running to my econ final.

303
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,900
Look, if I'm a short-timer give me drugs,
I'll go back to work, I'll die there.

304
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,230
Whoa. There's a quick test to see
if you even have it, a colonoscopy.

305
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,920
I know how you do that test.

306
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,340
If you have colon cancer,
we can treat it, it's early.

307
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,340
That's what they told my mom.
She was dead six months later.

308
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,250
You're a smart person about
to make a very bad decision.

309
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,119
You know, cancer treatment's
come a long way in

310
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,346
twelve years, but if you
don't do this now...

311
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,070
I don't want to be looked at!

312
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:18,759
There is another way.
We could do a virtual colonoscopy.

313
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,770
Basically, we do a CT scan of your colon.

314
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,579
It's non-evasive,
but it's very expensive.

315
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,350
I assume that's not a problem.

316
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Say yes.

317
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,990
Mr. Van Der Meer.

318
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
What?

319
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,890
Relax, Ricky's going to be just "finkf".

320
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
Strep throat, here's a
prescription for an antibiotic.

321
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,270
He should be all
better in a few days. Although,

322
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,330
this might sting a little.

323
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,440
I want to see you again real soon.

324
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,440
Virtual colonoscopy was clean.
No colon cancer.

325
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,359
What happened to a regular
old-fashioned colonoscopy?

326
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,770
She was uncomfortable doing any more tests!
I had to convince her to do that one!

327
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,470
Do you get that often?

328
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,040
Women would rather die
than get naked with you?

329
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,730
She's scared.

330
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,980
But not of tests.
Just embarrassing ones.

331
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Yeah.

332
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,710
It's not an inflammatory process, it's not
a clot because Chase's angio says so,

333
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,900
and it's not cancer because
her toosh is perfect.

334
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Anybody else got an Aunt
Elisa with weird stuff?

335
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,559
Maybe it's worth looking into...

336
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,860
I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.

337
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
It was clean.

338
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,870
You guys see the problem here?

339
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,710
There's no indication of any abnormalities.

340
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,899
No lesions, no spurs, no masses...

341
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,620
Her toes are screwed up.
They're backwards.

342
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,680
Do you guys know how much surgery
it's going to take to swap them back?

343
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,500
What are you talking about?

344
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,180
Either she literally has two left
feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.

345
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,199
That's impossible.
It can't be the wrong...

346
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,510
Or maybe it was Jenny!

347
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,030
How come some resident signed
this radiology report?

348
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,220
Were you even in the room?

349
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,580
- I'll redo her angio straight away...
- You'll do nothing!

350
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,280
Foreman, you do the angiogram.

351
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,330
I can't believe I did that.

352
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,780
Why do we have to redo the angiogram?

353
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,050
There was a shadow on
the first test result.

354
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,270
A shadow?

355
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,310
A shadow means there could
be a blood clot, right?

356
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,130
I read Colin's current therapy.

357
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,010
Real page turner.
No, it's not that kind of shadow.

358
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,270
My chest hurts.

359
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,500
It's from the tracer I injected.

360
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Might also get a little nauseous,
or have a metallic taste, all normal.

361
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,470
I'm a runner.
I shouldn't feel like this.

362
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,179
Carly, I'm looking at your
vitals right now, and...

363
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,420
I can't breathe.

364
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,950
Carly?

365
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,830
My chest...

366
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,450
My chest.

367
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,710
Respiratory arrest, call the code.

368
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,660
What've you got?

369
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:16,740
She's drowning.

370
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,430
Foreman did a thoracentesis to
drain the fluid from her lungs.

371
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,350
She's stable. They sent the fluid to
the lab, it'll be back in a few hours.

372
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,810
You'll be happy to know that
Chase's mistake didn't cost her.

373
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,760
Angio revealed no clot.

374
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,720
I'm thrilled.

375
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,900
Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn.

376
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,340
It's cold, perfectly good
excuse to wear your lab coat.

377
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,400
Carly needs a heart transplant.

378
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,260
Thoracentesis revealed a transudate?

379
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,230
Haven't gotten it back yet.

380
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,337
Her MUGA scan,
what was the ejection fracture?

381
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:53,980
Maybe you could treat it, surgically.

382
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,160
Haven't done the MUGA.

383
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,490
How do you know she needs
a heart transplant?

384
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,350
I got my aura read today.

385
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,779
It said someone close to
me had a broken heart.

386
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,499
Since when do I need the secret
pass code to talk to you?

387
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,270
I can't tell you anything.
Professional responsibility.

388
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,889
Like that matters to you.

389
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,530
Not my professional
responsibility, yours.

390
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,009
New regime, you gotta
keep your head down, too.

391
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,016
Now, that's good thinking,
because I was going to go right

392
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,016
to Cuddy and rat you out as
soon as you were done talking.

393
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm not saying you want to,
I'm saying you'd be obligated to.

394
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,880
Because of my position on the Board?

395
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,480
Because of my position on
the transplant committee?

396
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,080
Hey, you brought this up for a reason.
You need to talk to me.

397
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,110
I can't.

398
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,620
You sure you're doing the right thing?

399
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,970
I've come up with a few really
great rationalizations.

400
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,840
Sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

401
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,380
Thoracentesis revealed a transudate.

402
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,720
We did an echo.
She's in severe congestive heart failure.

403
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,700
She needs a heart transplant.

404
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,239
We'll get her on the list immediately...

405
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,050
She's already on the list.

406
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,950
Come in.

407
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,790
Thanks.

408
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,090
What is a "Department of
Diagnostic Medicine"?

409
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,650
That's Dr. House's department.

410
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,450
They deal with cases that other
doctors can't figure out.

411
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,480
It's a financial black hole.

412
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,610
Department costs us $3 million a
year, treat one patient a week.

413
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,330
He saves one patient per week.

414
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,719
What about everyone else?

415
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,300
His department's not going to
find the cure for breast cancer.

416
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,090
Maybe not, but...

417
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:47,430
Are you sleeping with House?

418
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,800
What? No.

419
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,130
But you did, right?
A long time ago?

420
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,100
That's an incredibly
inappropriate question.

421
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,884
If your judgment is compromised
by prior or current relationship,

422
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:00,790
that is my business.

423
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,140
I respect him, that is
all you need to know.

424
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,540
He's still not wearing a coat.

425
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,750
Well, I told him...

426
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:10,210
I'm sure you did.
And yet, he's not wearing it.

427
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,980
I'm just wondering if that's a
reflection on him, or on you.

428
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,340
You're Dr. House.

429
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,669
I found a picture of you
online at a conference...

430
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,440
You need a heart transplant.

431
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,009
I run, I work out, I...

432
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,400
You cut yourself.

433
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,530
Probably highly ritualized.

434
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,620
You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin
song over and over while

435
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,440
you do it, probably works
better than anti-depressants.

436
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,909
I don't understand how that has to...

437
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,340
You're a high-powered bulimic.

438
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,910
You make yourself throw up.

439
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,840
You have to find the most
efficient way to vomit

440
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,319
without revealing the
tell-tale signs of bulimia,

441
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,990
which is all. Very
unseemly, for a CEO.

442
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
So,

443
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,380
you found a common antidote for
accidental poisoning to do the job: Ipecac.

444
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,739
Which is great, if your kid's
just swallowed a bottle

445
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,910
of aspirin, but really,
really bad if it's a habit.

446
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,170
It causes muscle damage.

447
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,720
It caused the pain in your leg.

448
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,590
And it destroyed your heart.

449
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,360
How often do you do it?

450
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,590
Three times a week.

451
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,519
In about an hour, there's
going to be an emergency

452
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,650
meeting of the transplant
committee to discuss

453
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,730
where you fall on the list should
a new heart become available.

454
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,530
Problem is, I am required
to tell the committee

455
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,420
of your bulimia, it's a
major psychiatric condition.

456
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,240
Ranks right up there with suicidal,
makes you a very bad risk.

457
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,200
So you're here to tell me
I have just a few hours to live?

458
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,340
Unless I lie to the committee.

459
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,300
But if they find out, I
lose my medical license.

460
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,160
This would be a very good
time to offer me a bribe.

461
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,599
How much is your life worth,
how much is my job worth...

462
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,280
Why are you here doing this to me?

463
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,650
What do you want?

464
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,980
I want to know what's right.

465
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,920
Am I worth it?

466
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,300
You think I'm pathetic.

467
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,599
Has a good job, everything
in the world,

468
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,039
but she just doesn't like the
way that she looks...

469
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,480
Oh, stop hiding!

470
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,579
I'm asking you if you want to live or die,

471
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,839
you can't even say that!

472
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,669
What do you want me to do? Cry?

473
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,760
Yes! I want you to tell me that your life
is important to you, because I don't know!

474
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,260
Because that's what's
on the table right now:

475
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
Your life.

476
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
I don't want to die.

477
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
I don't.

478
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,719
This 32-year-old female
was admitted by my staff

479
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,749
because of paralysis and
pain in her right thigh.

480
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,140
Patient rapidly deteriorated and now
has severe congestive heart failure.

481
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,800
Pressers and vasodilators have not
improved her conditions whatsoever.

482
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,299
Pulmonary function tests
show an FVC of over 3 liters

483
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,180
with EDD-1 of at
least 90% of predicted.

484
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,090
And preserved FEB/FEC ratio
and preserved DLCO as well.

485
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,190
Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19%
with no focal wall or motion abnormalities.

486
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,839
Heart catheterization revealed
clean left, right and circumflex arteries,

487
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,230
and subsequent biopsy revealed
irreversible cardial myopathy.

488
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
Which is why we're here.

489
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,940
Dr. House, I'm confused
by your time and date stamps.

490
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,480
It appears that you put Carly on the
transplant list before you did these tests.

491
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,140
I had a hunch.

492
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,620
You don't have hunches. You know.

493
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,090
Look, if the tests had come
back differently, obviously I

494
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,550
would have taken her off the
lists, but on the long shot...

495
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,950
On the long shot I was right,
I didn't want to waste time.

496
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,740
Is there any exclusion
criteria we should know about?

497
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,340
CAT scan revealed no tumors and
Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.

498
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,360
What about any other criteria?

499
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,069
No atherosclerotic vascular disease...

500
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,700
Are there any...

501
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,220
No pneumonia, no bacteriemia,
no Hep-B or C or any other letters.

502
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,079
Substance abuse?

503
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,520
- Any history of...
- No alcohol, no drugs.

504
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,949
Any psychiatric conditions,
history of depression...

505
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,300
She's a little blue, but turns out
she needs a heart transplant.

506
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,079
Dr. House, if you subvert
or mislead this committee,

507
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,550
you will be subject to
disciplinary action.

508
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,400
Dr. Cuddy, do you have any
reason to think that I would lie?

509
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,060
I simply want you to answer the question!

510
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,599
Is there anything on the
recipient exclusion criteria

511
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,560
that would disqualify your
patient from getting a heart?

512
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,730
No.

513
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,390
Beautiful organ donor weather.

514
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,510
You lied, didn't you?

515
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,960
I never lie.

516
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,050
Big mistake.

517
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,580
Then you should have voted
against putting her on the list.

518
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
You're my friend.

519
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,730
Oh, jeez. Have some backbone.

520
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,920
If you think I'm wrong, do something.

521
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,300
Wait, you're getting mad at me
for sticking up for you?

522
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,129
You value our friendship more than
your ethical responsibilities.

523
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,430
Our friendship is an
ethical responsibility.

524
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
What is it?

525
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,950
My patient's getting a heart.

526
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,990
He's not gonna fire you.

527
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,910
I'd fire you. Bye bye.

528
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,240
If I screw up, the patient dies,
I'll never get another job.

529
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,170
So go stick your head between your legs
and lick your wounds in Stadt.

530
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,330
Well, I like it here.

531
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,639
You guys don't think it's
weird House knew the patient

532
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,580
needed a heart transplant
before we did any heart tests?

533
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,009
That's House. He knows things.

534
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,079
But usually, he's putting it in our face,
telling us how cleverly he figured it out.

535
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,720
This time, nothing.
Just "I had a hunch".

536
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,030
It is weird.

537
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,700
Okay, ready for the donor heart.

538
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,739
They just stopped Carly's heart.
And your dumb patient...

539
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,950
They're all?
Oh, the guy who can't talk.

540
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,650
Mr. Van Der Meer, he scheduled
an appointment to see you.

541
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,060
Oh, goody.

542
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,060
I wanted you to know Chase is
worried you're going to fire him.

543
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,840
It's bad enough
that screw-ups cost lives.

544
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,590
Now we've got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs.

545
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,249
I want Chase scared.

546
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,750
I want him doing everything
he can to protect his job.

547
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,999
Dr. House, if you were in his
position wouldn't you be

548
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,039
more likely to perform well
if you were reassured and...

549
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,390
Oh, will you stop it with the book!

550
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,480
Why are you doing this?

551
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,979
I'm not doing anything.

552
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,690
You're manipulating everyone.

553
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,020
People... dismiss me.

554
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:34,260
Because I'm a woman, because I'm pretty,
because I'm not aggressive.

555
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,650
My opinions shouldn't be rejected
just because people don't like me.

556
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,740
They like you.
Everyone likes you.

557
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,790
Do you?

558
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,170
I have to know.

559
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
No.

560
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,570
Okay.

561
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
5 hours, 23 minutes, that's fast.

562
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,010
Is that good or bad?

563
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,180
It depends. Either surgery went really
well, or it ended really abruptly.

564
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,940
Textbook. She'll outlive us all.

565
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,130
Thank you.

566
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,290
So, sing for me.

567
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,060
Oh, no, no, no... come on, look.

568
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,570
When you had your surgery, you were intubated.
Surgeon stuck a tube down your throat.

569
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,599
Now, it never happens, and
it's never caught, but it happens.

570
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,099
Your vocal chords were paralyzed.

571
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,910
I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox.

572
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,690
Ironically, a substance
that tightens every other

573
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,890
corner of your face actually
loosens the tongue.

574
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,530
I have healed you. You can talk.

575
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Oh, well.

576
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay, you don't have to say anything,
it can be our little secret.

577
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,110
If you can talk, blink twice.

578
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,919
But you're not going to,
because you think you won't be

579
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,880
entitled to the money you won
in the settlement with Simpson.

580
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,900
Yesterday I would have said
you'd have to give the money back.

581
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:21,620
Today... hospital's come into a
lot of money, mum's the word.

582
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,850
Hey.

583
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Hey.

584
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,610
I know the cardiologist has
given you some guidelines,

585
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,080
schedule of medications, and a strict diet:

586
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,130
Just what someone with an
eating disorder needs.

587
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,360
So, I thought I'd get you started.

588
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,200
Fried chicken from the Carnegie Deli.

589
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,810
You're kidding.

590
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,740
Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs.

591
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,620
Why did you fight for me?

592
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,560
You risked so much,
and you hardly know me.

593
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,340
You're my patient.

594
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,660
Don't screw it up.

595
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,900
Love this part!

596
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,140
Okay. He ruined it.

597
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,159
Just wanted to stop by
and introduce myself.

598
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,270
I'm Edward Vogler, new
Chairman of the Board.

599
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,770
In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.

600
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,160
I am sorry about the lab coat thing.

601
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,810
The dry cleaners just destroyed it.

602
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,430
That was my very first heart transplant
committee meeting, very exciting.

603
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,930
Trust me. Six Flags, way more exciting.

604
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,790
Patient's very lucky to
have such a passionate

605
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,870
doctor who stands up for
what he believes in.

606
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,640
Sweet of you to say.

607
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,460
Yeah. 'Fraid you've been duped, though.

608
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,500
The nurse found this in
the patient's purse.

609
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,080
Oh, my. If only I'd known.

610
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,380
Tough being a doctor.

611
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,840
You've got all that power.
The power to play God.

612
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,850
Yes, I don't envy the transplant
committee their responsibility.

613
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,390
They basically would have been
forced to kill that poor girl.

614
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,580
I'm not sure I could have done that.

615
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,990
This is not a game to me, Dr. House.

616
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,930
No. This is actually more
like we're dancing right now.

617
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,050
So let's get to the point.
You don't like me.

618
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,490
I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like you.

619
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,030
It's nothing personal,
I don't like anybody.

620
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,190
But none of that really
matters, does it,

621
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,150
because you've got money,
and I've got tenure.

622
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,749
You need full board approval to
get rid of me. I've got Cuddy.

623
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,220
Right.

624
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,760
And Wilson.

625
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,500
So, as long as we're stuck with each other,

626
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,260
we might as well ignore each other.

627
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,640
That wasn't nearly as
dramatic as I was hoping.

628
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,580
I looked into that tenure
thing, and you're right.

629
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,119
It's actually easier for me
to get rid of a board member

630
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,220
like Cuddy or Wilson than
to get rid of a doctor.

631
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,090
That's interesting, isn't it?
