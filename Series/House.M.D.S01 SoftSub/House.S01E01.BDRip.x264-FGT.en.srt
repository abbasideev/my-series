1
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,490
Why are you late?

2
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,834
You're not going to like the answer.

3
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,293
I already know the answer.

4
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,380
I missed the bus.

5
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,890
I don't doubt it.
 No bus stops near Brad's.

6
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,790
You spent the night,
the alarm didn't work

7
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,800
or maybe it did.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,427
I didn't sleep with him.

9
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,387
- Girl, either there's something...
- I missed the bus!

10
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,013
There's something
either very wrong with you

11
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,932
or something very wrong with him.

12
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,267
There's nothing wrong with him.

13
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,935
Please tell me
you know that for a fact.

14
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,478
Melanie, I gotta go.

15
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:09,688
You're lying, aren't you?

16
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,064
I wouldn't lie to you.

17
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:13,024
Good morning, guys!

18
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,980
Good morning, Miss Rebecca!

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,740
- Everybody's in their seats?
- Yes.

20
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,073
Okay.

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,367
Sydney,

22
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,995
why don't you tell us
what you did this weekend?

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,039
Come on, Sydney.
 We know you're not shy.

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,580
How come we always have
to tell you what we did,

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,544
and you never tell us what you did?

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,005
Okay.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,133
I had a really great weekend.

28
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,570
But you can't tell Miss Melanie, okay?

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,803
What did you do?

30
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,306
I made a new friend.

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,892
It's so much fun to
make new friends, isn't it?

32
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:48,769
Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,730
Did you tell your mom and
dad about your new friend?

34
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:54,250
Absolutely.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,340
You should never keep
anything from your parents.

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,571
And I told mine...

37
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:03,950
Wha...

38
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,039
happening...

39
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,582
Wha...

40
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,808
C...

41
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,768
A...

42
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,561
L...

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,605
H, E...

44
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:34,773
"The"!

45
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,067
We know that word, "the"!

46
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,412
(Call the nurse)

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
29-year old female.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,720
First seizure one month ago.

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,932
Lost the ability to speak.
Babbled like a baby.

50
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:11,142
Progressive deterioration
of mental status.

51
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,102
You see that?

52
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:14,590
They all assume that I'm
a patient because of this cane.

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,314
So put on a white
coat like the rest of us.

54
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,191
I don't want them
to think I'm a doctor.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,152
You see where the administration
might have a problem with that attitude?

56
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,071
People don't want a sick doctor.

57
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,532
That's fair enough.
I don't like healthy patients.

58
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,033
The 29-year old female...

59
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,286
The one who can't talk?
I like that part.

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,538
She's my cousin.

61
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,650
And your cousin
doesn't like the diagnosis.

62
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,850
I wouldn't either.

63
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,296
Brain tumor.
She's going to die. Boring.

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,967
No wonder you're such
a renowned diagnostician.

65
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,303
You don't need to actually know
anything to figure out what's wrong.

66
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:49,639
You're the oncologist. I'm just a
lowly infectious disease guy.

67
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,808
Yes. Just a simple country doctor.

68
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,768
Brain tumors at her
age are highly unlikely.

69
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:56,605
She's 29. Whatever
she's got is highly unlikely.

70
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,106
The protein markers
for the three most

71
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:59,900
prevalent brain cancers
came up negative.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,200
That's an HMO lab.

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,770
Might as well have sent it to a
high school kid with a chemistry set.

74
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,280
No family history.

75
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,480
Thought your uncle died of cancer.

76
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,743
Other side.
No environmental factors.

77
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:10,520
That you know of.

78
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,550
And she's not responding
to radiation treatment.

79
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,090
None of which is
even close to dispositive.

80
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,167
All it does is raise one question.

81
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,190
Your cousin goes to an HMO?

82
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,463
Come on...

83
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,830
Why leave all the fun for the coroner?

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,760
What's the point of putting together
a team if you're not gonna use them?

85
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:32,265
You've got three overqualified doctors
 working for you, getting bored.

86
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,246
It's a lesion.

87
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,570
And the big green thing in the middle
of the bigger blue thing on a map...

88
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,752
is an island.

89
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,540
I was hoping for something
a bit more creative.

90
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,466
Shouldn't we be speaking to the
patient before we start diagnosing?

91
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,385
Is she a doctor?

92
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:52,429
- No, but...
- Everybody lies.

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,514
Dr. House doesn't like
dealing with patients.

94
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,090
Isn't treating patients
why we became doctors?

95
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,769
No. Treating illnesses is
why we became doctors.

96
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,647
Treating patients is what
makes most doctors miserable.

97
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,859
So you're trying to eliminate the
humanity from the practice of medicine?

98
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:08,111
If we don't talk to them,
 they can't lie to us,

99
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,654
and we can't lie to them.

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,823
Humanity's overrated.

101
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:13,491
I don't think it's a tumor.

102
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,620
First year at medical school,
 if you hear hoofbeats,

103
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,995
you think horses, not zebras.

104
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,830
Are you in first year medical school?

105
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,291
No.

106
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,480
First of all, there's
nothing on the CAT scan.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,919
Second of all, if this is a horse,

108
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,214
then her kindly family doctor in
Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis,

109
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:29,716
and it never gets near this office.

110
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,070
Differential diagnosis, people.

111
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,220
If it's not a tumor,
what are the suspects?

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,930
Why couldn't she talk?

113
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,434
Aneurysm, stroke or
some other ischemic syndrome.

114
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,062
- Give her a contrast MRI.
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

115
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,230
- Mad cow?
- Mad zebra.

116
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,815
Wernicke's encephalopathy.

117
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,230
No. Blood thiamine level was normal.

118
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,570
The lab in Trenton could
have screwed up the blood tests.

119
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,010
I assume it's a corollary if
"people lie" that "people screw up."

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,202
Redraw the blood tests

121
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,100
and get her scheduled
for that contrast MRI ASAP.

122
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,749
Let's find out what kind
of zebra we're treating here.

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,473
"Radiology, please call the page."

124
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,190
I was expecting you in
my office 20 minutes ago.

125
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,066
Really?

126
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:28,691
Well, that's odd

127
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,920
because I had no intention of
being in your office 20 minutes ago.

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,250
You think we have nothing to talk about?

129
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,405
No. I just can't think of anything I'd be interested in.

130
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:36,616
- I sign your paychecks.
- I have tenure.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,371
Are you gonna grab my
cane now, stop me from leaving?

132
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:42,820
That would be juvenile.

133
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,230
I can still fire you
if you're not doing your job.

134
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,340
I'm here from 9:00 to 5:00.

135
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,383
Your billings are practically nonexistent.

136
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,750
- Rough year.
- You ignore requests for consults.

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,930
I call back. Sometimes I misdial.

138
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,430
You're six years behind on
your obligations to the clinic.

139
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,480
See? I was right.
This doesn't interest me.

140
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,310
Six years times three weeks

141
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,020
you owe me better than four months.

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,240
It's 5:00.
I'm going home.

143
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,060
To what?

144
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,110
Nice.

145
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:15,446
Look...

146
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,115
Dr. House,

147
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:19,300
the only reason why
I don't fire you is because...

148
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,390
your reputation is still worth
something to this hospital.

149
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,413
Excellent. We have a point of agreement.

150
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,540
You're not gonna fire me.

151
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,292
Your reputation won't last
 if you don't do your job.

152
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,335
The clinic is part of your job.

153
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,080
I want you to do your job.

154
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,240
But, as the philosopher
Jagger once said,

155
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,250
"You can't always get what you want."

156
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,070
You're not my doctor.
Are you Dr. House?

157
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,729
Thankfully, no. I'm Dr. Chase.

158
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,939
Dr. House is the
head of diagnostic medicine.

159
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,940
He's very busy, but he has taken
a keen interest in your case.

160
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,325
We inject gadolinium into a vein.

161
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,035
It distributes itself
throughout your brain

162
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:05,413
and acts as a contrast material
for the magnetic resonance imaging.

163
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,417
Basically, whatever's in your head lights up like a Christmas tree.

164
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,169
It might make you
feel a little light-headed.

165
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,378
Dr. Cameron.

166
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,130
I'm sorry. I have to stop you.

167
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,840
There is a problem.

168
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,636
You pulled my authorization!

169
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,179
Yes. Why are you yelling?

170
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,790
No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.

171
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,558
You also can't make long distance phone calls.

172
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,769
If you're going to fire me,
have the guts to face me.

173
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,620
Or photocopies.
You're still yelling.

174
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,356
I'm angry!

175
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,980
You're risking a patient's life.

176
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,442
I assume those are two separate points.

177
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,778
You showed me disrespect.
You embarrassed me.

178
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,150
- As long as I work here, you have no...
- Is the yelling designed to scare me?

179
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,368
Because I'm not sure what it is
I'm supposed to be scared of.

180
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,660
More yelling? That's not scary.

181
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,498
That you're going to
hurt me? That's scary.

182
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,230
But I'm pretty sure I can outrun you.

183
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,462
Oh, I looked into that
philosopher you quoted.

184
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:55,300
Jagger.

185
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,140
And you're right, you can't
always get what you want, but...

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,384
As it turns out,

187
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:02,387
"If you try sometimes,
you get what you need."

188
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,474
So, because you want
me to treat patients,

189
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,977
you're not letting me treat patients?

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,104
I need you to do your job.

191
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,865
Do the MRI. She folded.

192
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,870
I've got to do four hours
a week in this clinic

193
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,999
until I make up the time I've missed.

194
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,210
2054.

195
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,210
I'll be caught up in 2054.

196
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,632
You better love this cousin a whole lot.

197
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,209
Alright, Rebecca,

198
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,450
I know you may feel
a little claustrophobic in there,

199
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,680
but we need you to remain still.

200
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,134
Okay, we're going to begin.

201
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:35,063
I don't feel so good.

202
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,440
It's alright. Just try to relax.

203
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,300
Rebecca?

204
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:50,161
Rebecca?

205
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,170
Rebecca?

206
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,250
- Get her out of there.
- Oh, she probably fell asleep.

207
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,512
- She's exhausted.
- She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago.

208
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:09,730
- She's not sleeping.
- It will just be another minute.

209
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,400
If she's having allergic
reaction to gadolinium,

210
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,900
she'll be dead in two minutes.

211
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,481
- Hold her neck.
- Alright.

212
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,024
Oh, she's ashen.

213
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,110
She's not breathing.
Epi, .5.

214
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,960
Come on.

215
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,448
I can't ventilate.

216
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,203
Too much edema.
Where's the surgical airway kit?

217
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:33,496
Yep. Coming.

218
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,993
Good call.

219
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,380
We'll get that tube out
of your throat later today.

220
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,602
Just get some rest for now, okay?

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,400
Told you.
You can't trust people.

222
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
She probably knew
she was allergic to gadolinium.

223
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,613
Figured it was an easy way to get
someone to cut a hole in her throat.

224
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,448
Can't get a picture.

225
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:51,908
Gonna have to get a thousand words.

226
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:55,453
You actually want me to
talk to the patient, get a history?

227
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,040
We need to know if there's some...

228
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,640
genetic or environmental cause that's
 triggering an inflammatory response.

229
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,340
I thought everybody lied.

230
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,213
Truth begins in lies.

231
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,797
Think about it.

232
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,980
That doesn't mean anything, does it?

233
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,599
12:52 PM.

234
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,726
Dr. House checks in.
Please write that down.

235
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,530
Do you have cable TV here somewhere?

236
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,021
General Hospital starts in eight minutes.

237
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,232
No TV, but we've got patients.

238
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,650
Can't you give out
the aspirin yourself?

239
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,230
- I'll do paperwork.
- I made sure your first

240
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,610
case was an interesting one.

241
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,821
Cough just won't go away?
 Runny nose looks a funny color?

242
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,407
Patient admitted
complaining of back spasms.

243
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,992
I think I read about
something like that in the

244
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,280
- New England Journal of Medicine.
- Patient is orange.

245
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,372
- The color?
- No, the fruit.

246
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:40,665
You mean yellow. It's jaundice.

247
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,124
I mean orange.

248
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,293
- Well, how orange? It's probably...
- Exam room one.

249
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,570
"Dr. Kahn, you're needed in pediatrics."

250
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,480
I was playing golf
and my cleats got stuck.

251
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,593
I mean, it hurt a little,
but I kept playing.

252
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,887
The next morning,
I could barely stand up.

253
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,516
Well, you're smiling, so I take
it that means this isn't serious.

254
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,687
What's that? What are you doing?

255
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:03,896
Painkillers.

256
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, for you. For your leg.

257
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,600
No, 'cause they're yummy.

258
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,870
You want one?
Make your back feel better.

259
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,032
Unfortunately, you
have a deeper problem.

260
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,493
Your wife is having an affair.

261
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,621
- What?
- You're orange, you moron.

262
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,350
It's one thing for you not to notice,

263
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,874
but if your wife hasn't
picked up on the fact

264
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,140
that her husband has changed colors,

265
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,544
she's just not paying attention.

266
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:27,980
By the way, did you consume just

267
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,990
a ridiculous amount of
carrots and mega-dose vitamins?

268
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,030
Carrots turn you yellow,
the niacin turns you red.

269
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,890
Find some finger paint and do the math.

270
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,400
And get a good lawyer.

271
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,870
Deep breath.

272
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,604
It's cold.

273
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,815
He's been using his inhaler?

274
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,420
Not in the past few days.
He's, um, only 10.

275
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,650
I worry about children taking
such strong medicine so frequently.

276
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,949
What happened to your leg?

277
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:00,286
Your doctor probably was concerned
about the strength of the medicine too.

278
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:03,414
She probably weighed that danger
against the danger of not breathing.

279
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,250
Oxygen is so important
during those prepubescent years.

280
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,400
Don't you think?

281
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,297
Okay, I'm gonna assume nobody
has ever told you what asthma is.

282
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,650
Or if they have, you had
other things on your mind.

283
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,220
A stimulant triggers
cells in your child's airways...

284
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,429
to release substances

285
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,931
that inflame the air passages
and cause them to contract.

286
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,290
Mucus production increases,
the cell lining starts to shed.

287
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,978
But the steroids...

288
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,750
The steroids stop the inflammation.

289
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,653
The more often this happens...

290
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:37,031
What? The more often
this happens, what?

291
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,742
Forget it. If you don't trust steroids,
 you shouldn't trust doctors.

292
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,190
My mother passed away four years ago.

293
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,623
She had a heart attack,

294
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:48,918
and my father broke
his back doing construction.

295
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,250
It's House. It's urgent. I'm sorry.

296
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,020
You couldn't have knocked?

297
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,306
Steroids.

298
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:05,309
Give her steroids.
High doses of prednisone.

299
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,590
You're looking for support for
a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis?

300
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,864
Inflammation of blood vessels
in the brain is awfully rare,

301
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:20,032
especially for someone her age.

302
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,075
So is a tumor.

303
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,785
- Her sed rate is elevated.
- Mildly.

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,140
That could mean anything. Or nothing.

305
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,550
Yeah, I know. I have no reason
to think that it's vasculitis.

306
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,050
Except that it could be.

307
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,730
If the blood vessels are inflamed,
that's gonna look exactly like

308
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,550
what we saw on the
MRI from Trenton County,

309
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,430
and the pressure is gonna
cause neurological symptoms.

310
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,230
We can't diagnose that without a biopsy.

311
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,130
Yes, we can.

312
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,290
We treat her.

313
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,595
If she gets better, we know we're right.

314
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,930
And if we're wrong?

315
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,240
Then we learn something else.

316
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,330
Why steroids?

317
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,857
Just part of your treatment.

318
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,234
You haven't had many visitors.

319
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,236
- No boyfriend?
- Three dates.

320
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,610
I wouldn't have stood by him
if he were vomiting all day.

321
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,840
What about work? You must
have friends from work.

322
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,288
Pretty much everybody
I like is five years old.

323
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,950
The nurse said you're stopping my radiation.

324
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,670
We're just trying some alternative medication.

325
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,880
So where's your family from then?

326
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,700
Steroids aren't
an alternative to radiation.

327
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,260
The tests weren't really conclusive.

328
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,270
We're treating you for vasculitis.

329
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,890
It's the inflammation
of blood vessels in the brain.

330
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,350
It's not a tumor?

331
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,228
I don't have a tumor?

332
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,280
You shouldn't have told her
the truth. It's a long shot guess.

333
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,770
Thank you.

334
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,000
If House is right, no harm.

335
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,531
If he's wrong, I've given a dying
woman a couple days' hope.

336
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:43,783
False hope.

337
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:46,452
If there was any other type
available, I would have given her that.

338
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,920
Why are you smelling Billy's pants?

339
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,740
- I'm not.
- Looked like you were.

340
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,593
I was smelling the floor.

341
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,846
Do you have any pets in this class?

342
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,681
No. But we used to have a gerbil,

343
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,433
but Carly L. dropped a book on it.

344
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:11,750
Careless.

345
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,187
Do you need to smell it?

346
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,689
No. I'm smelling for mold.

347
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,130
I don't need to smell it.

348
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,651
You could smell our parrot.

349
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,870
You said you didn't have
any pets in this class.

350
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,760
A parrot is a bird.

351
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,324
"Listen, Jackson's not the father..."

352
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,690
Parrots are the
primary source of psittacosis.

353
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,670
It's not the parrot.

354
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,580
And psittacosis can lead to...

355
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:34,500
nerve problems
and neurological complications.

356
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,001
How many kids were in the class?

357
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:36,690
Twenty.

358
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:36,794
How many are home sick?
Twenty.

359
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,087
How many are home sick?

360
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:39,120
None...

361
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,150
None. But you figured
that five-year-olds

362
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,520
are more serious about
bird hygiene than their teacher?

363
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,429
- Been through her home?
- She lives in Trenton.

364
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:50,182
I can go up to her room
tomorrow morning, ask her for the key.

365
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,790
Would the police call for permission

366
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,770
before dropping by
to check out a crime scene?

367
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,760
It's not a crime scene.

368
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,524
As far as I know, she's running
a meth lab out of her basement.

369
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,109
She's a kindergarten teacher.

370
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,736
And if I were a kindergarten
student I would trust her implicitly.

371
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Okay.

372
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:08,400
I'll give you a "for instance."

373
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,702
Lady back there...

374
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,830
who made your
egg salad sandwich.

375
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,541
Her eyes look glassy.
Did you notice that?

376
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,560
Now, hospital policy is
to stay home if you're sick.

377
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,840
But if you're making
$8 an hour, then...

378
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
you kind of need the
$8.00 an hour, right?

379
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,925
And the sign in the bathroom says

380
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,310
that employees must wash
after using the facilities,

381
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,320
but I figure that somebody
who wipes snot on a sleeve

382
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,740
isn't hyper concerned
about sanitary conditions.

383
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,660
So what do you think,
should I trust her?

384
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,939
I want you to check the
patient's home for contaminants,

385
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:42,109
- ...garbage, medication.
- I can't just break into someone's house.

386
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:44,153
Isn't that how you
got into the Felkers' home?

387
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,243
Yeah, I know.

388
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,953
Court records are sealed.

389
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,955
You were 16. It was a stupid mistake.

390
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,220
But your old gym
teacher has a big mouth.

391
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,840
Should write a thank-you note.

392
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,378
I should thank him?

393
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:02,379
Well...

394
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,092
I needed somebody
around here with street smarts.

395
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,920
Okay? Who knows when they're
 being conned, knows how to con.

396
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,433
I should sue you.

397
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,720
Pretty sure you can't
sue somebody for wrongful hiring.

398
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,500
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you

399
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,066
fire me for not breaking
into some lady's house.

400
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,700
Doing research.
People are fascinating, aren't they?

401
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,334
Why are you giving Adler steroids?

402
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:42,650
Because she's my patient.

403
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,750
That's what you do with
patients, you give them medicine.

404
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,750
You don't prescribe
medicine based on guesses.

405
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,380
At least we don't
since Tuskegee and Mengele.

406
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,280
You're comparing
me to a Nazi? Nice.

407
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,790
I'm stopping the treatment.

408
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,563
- She's my patient.
- It's my hospital.

409
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,150
I did not get her sick.

410
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,250
She is not an experiment.

411
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,810
I have a legitimate theory
about what's wrong with her.

412
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,946
With no proof.

413
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,489
There's never any proof.

414
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,908
Five different doctors come
up with five different diagnoses

415
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,118
based on the same evidence.

416
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:15,536
You don't have any evidence.

417
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,500
And nobody knows anything, huh?

418
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,333
Then how is it you
always think you're right?

419
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,501
I don't. I...

420
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,129
just find it hard to operate
on the opposite assumption.

421
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,140
And why are you so
afraid of making a mistake?

422
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,590
Because I'm a doctor.

423
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:31,385
Because when we make
mistakes, people die.

424
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,780
Oh, come on.

425
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:38,980
People used to have more
respect for cripples, you know.

426
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,420
They didn't really.

427
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,195
- So how you feeling?
- Much better, thanks.

428
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,450
Are you Dr. House?
I thought he was a he, but...

429
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
No.

430
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,828
Don't eat too much, too fast.

431
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,706
Thank him for me.

432
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,080
Right.

433
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,347
Should I discontinue
the treatment, boss?

434
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,599
You got lucky.

435
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,510
Cool, huh?

436
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,817
Okay, once again.

437
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,360
Good.

438
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,824
Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?

439
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,370
Well, you might run into him
at the movies or on the bus.

440
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,620
Is he a good man?

441
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,126
He's a good doctor.

442
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,837
Can you be one without the other?

443
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,350
Don't you have to care about people?

444
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,258
Caring is a good motivator.

445
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,261
He's found something else.

446
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,160
Feel this, both sides?

447
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,850
Okay, squeeze.

448
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,102
Harder.

449
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:04,394
Alright.

450
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,880
He's your friend, huh?

451
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,441
Yeah.

452
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,693
Does he care about you?

453
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,988
- I think so.
- You don't know?

454
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
As Dr. House likes
to say, "Everybody lies."

455
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,430
It's not what people
say. It's what they do.

456
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,544
Yeah. He cares about me.

457
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,049
I can't see.

458
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,805
I can't... see.

459
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,040
A little help in here!

460
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,040
Your chest will be sore for a while.

461
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,294
We needed to shock you
to get your heart going.

462
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,964
Okay...

463
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,218
can you arrange
these to tell a story?

464
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,942
She couldn't put them in order.

465
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,690
Could the damage have been caused
by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?

466
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,115
No. I gave her the same
test five minutes later.

467
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:41,140
She did just fine.

468
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,870
The altered mental status is
intermittent, just like the verbal skills.

469
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,622
So what now?

470
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:49,791
Given the latest symptoms, it's clearly
growing deeper into the brain stem.

471
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,960
Soon, she won't be able to walk.

472
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,629
She'll go blind permanently,

473
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,215
and then the
respiratory center will fail.

474
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,758
How long do we have?

475
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,660
If it's a tumor, we're
talking a month or two.

476
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,345
If it's infectious, a few weeks.

477
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,596
If it's vascular,

478
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,910
that'll probably be fastest
of all. Maybe a week.

479
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,101
We're gonna stop all treatment.

480
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,313
I still think it's a tumor.

481
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,023
I think we should
go back to the radiation.

482
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:14,775
She didn't respond to the radiation.

483
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,240
Well, maybe we didn't see the effect

484
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,611
until after we started steroids.

485
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,196
No, it's not a tumor.

486
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:21,198
Those steroids did something.

487
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,366
I just don't know what.

488
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,243
So we're just gonna do nothing?

489
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:25,661
We're just gonna watch her die?

490
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:28,163
Yeah, we're gonna watch her die.

491
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,890
Specifically, we're gonna
watch how fast she's dying.

492
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,000
You just told us.

493
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,790
Each diagnosis has its own time frame.

494
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,171
When we see how fast
it's killing her, we'll know what it is.

495
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,841
And by then, maybe there's
nothing we can do about it.

496
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,052
There's got to be something we can do.

497
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,054
Something better than watching her die.

498
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,723
Well, I got nothing.

499
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,642
How about you?

500
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,570
Bastard.

501
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,350
Oh, Cameron. I need you
for a couple of hours.

502
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,985
What's up?

503
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:59,403
When you break into someone's house,

504
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:01,321
it's always better to
have a white chick with you.

505
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,447
Adler's house?

506
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:04,030
Why don't we just
ask her for her keys?

507
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,868
For all we know, she'll be running
a meth lab out of her basement.

508
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,328
I'm tired a lot.

509
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,292
Any other reason why you think you
might have chronic fatigue syndrome?

510
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,794
It's kind of the definition, isn't it?

511
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:17,421
It's kind of the definition of getting older.

512
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,964
I had a couple headaches last month,

513
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,424
mild fever.

514
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,260
Sometimes I can't sleep,
and I have trouble concentrating.

515
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,763
Apparently not while
researching this stuff on the Internet.

516
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,726
I was thinking it also
might be fibromyalgia.

517
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,620
Excellent diagnosis.

518
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,024
Is there anything for that?

519
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,571
You know, I think there just might be.

520
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:45,824
I need 36 Vicodin
and change for a dollar.

521
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,080
Exam room two.

522
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,190
House doesn't believe in pretense.

523
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
Figures life's too short and too painful.

524
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,691
So he just says what he thinks.

525
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,486
Nothing interesting in the garbage.

526
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,890
"I say what I think"

527
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,520
is just another way
of saying "I'm an assho..."

528
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,453
Well, if you wanted to be judged
for your medical prowess only,

529
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:33,760
maybe you shouldn't have
broken into someone's home.

530
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,040
I was 16.

531
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,753
Don't know about ticks,
 but her dog's definitely got fleas.

532
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,540
I managed to make it to
17 without a criminal record.

533
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,410
Yeah?

534
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,642
Well, you obviously didn't
grow up in my neighborhood.

535
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,562
That's right. You stole a loaf of bread
to feed your starving family. Right?

536
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,315
You always eat during break-ins?

537
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:03,485
Am I supposed to respect their food
more than I respect their DVD players?

538
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,737
- You want some?
- No.

539
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,697
You gonna go hungry until she dies?

540
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:09,116
- No.
- You know what?

541
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,201
After centuries of slavery,

542
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,161
decades of civil rights marches and...

543
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,260
more significantly, living like a monk,

544
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,460
never getting less than a 4.0 GPA,

545
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,700
you don't think it's
kind of disgusting I get

546
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,212
one of the top jobs in the
country because I'm a delinquent?

547
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,174
We'll eat, then we'll tear up the carpet.

548
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,262
You went to Hopkins, right?

549
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,570
Yep.

550
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,870
So you went to
a better school than I did.

551
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,892
You got better grades than I did.

552
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,311
So how did you get the job?

553
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,230
You stab a guy in a bar fight?

554
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,532
Nothing.

555
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,910
It's not a tumor.
She's getting worse too fast.

556
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,290
- She can't stand up.
- No toxins? No medications?

557
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,040
Nothing that would explain these symptoms.

558
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,940
Family history of neurological problems?

559
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,240
Not that I could tell
from her underwear drawer.

560
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,800
You said "Nothing that
would explain these symptoms."

561
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,175
What did you find that
doesn't explain these symptoms?

562
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,264
Dr. Wilson convinced you to
treat this patient under false pretenses.

563
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,433
Adler's not his cousin.

564
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,935
That's ridiculous. You can ask her yourself.

565
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:20,854
- Okay, why, can we get Ba...
- She's not Jewish.

566
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,063
Rachel Adler's not Jewish?

567
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,523
I had ham at her apartment.

568
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,777
Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews
have non-Jewish relatives,

569
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,362
and most of us don't keep kosher.

570
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,615
I can see getting through high school

571
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,867
without learning a thing
about Jews, but medical school?

572
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,340
Okay, maybe she's Jewish,

573
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,120
But she's definitely not your cousin.

574
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,956
Really? This guy is...

575
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,416
You don't even know her name.

576
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,543
You called her Rachel.
Her name is Rebecca.

577
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,546
Yes. Yes, her name is Rebecca.

578
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:49,382
I-I call her Rachel.

579
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,259
You idiot!

580
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,720
Listen, he's...

581
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,590
Not you. Him.

582
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,220
You said you didn't find anything.

583
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,851
- Everything I found was in my...
- You found ham.

584
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:01,810
So?

585
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,813
Where there's ham, there's pork.

586
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,330
Where there's pork, there's neurocysticercosis.

587
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,330
Tapeworm?

588
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,860
You think she's got a worm in her brain?

589
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,694
It fits.

590
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,250
Could've been living there for years.

591
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,540
- Never occurred to me that...
- Millions of people eat ham every day.

592
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,784
It's quite a leap to think
that's she's got a tapeworm.

593
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:18,700
Okay, Mr. Neurologist, what happens...

594
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,081
when you give steroids to
a person who has a tapeworm?

595
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,751
T-They get a little better, and...
and then they get worse.

596
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,381
Just like Rebecca Adler did.

597
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,190
In a typical case, if you don't
cook pork well enough,

598
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,064
you digest live tapeworm larvae.

599
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,890
They've got these little hooks,

600
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,160
they grab onto your bowel,

601
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,130
they live, they grow up, they reproduce.

602
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,113
Reproduce?

603
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:55,900
There's only one lesion,
 and it's nowhere near her bowel.

604
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,535
That's because this is not a typical case.

605
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,320
Tapeworm can produce
20,000 to 30,000 eggs a day.

606
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,374
- Guess where they go?
- Out.

607
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,251
Not all of them.

608
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,990
Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right

609
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,110
through the walls of the
intestines into the bloodstream.

610
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,758
And where does the bloodstream go?

611
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:15,093
Everywhere.

612
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,300
As long as it's healthy,

613
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,139
the immune system
doesn't even know it's there.

614
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,730
The worm builds a
wall, uses secretions to

615
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,561
shut down the body's immune
response and control fluid flow.

616
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,980
It's really very beautiful.

617
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,356
As long as it's healthy.

618
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:29,870
So, what do we do?

619
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,190
Call a vet, nurse the
little guy back to health?

620
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,571
It's too late for that. It's dying.

621
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,990
And as it dies, this parasite

622
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,951
loses the ability to
control the host's defenses.

623
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,430
The immune system
wakes up, attacks the worm,

624
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,160
and everything starts to swell.

625
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,833
And that is very bad for the brain.

626
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,752
It could still be a hundred other things.

627
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,180
The eosinophil count was normal.

628
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,257
It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.

629
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:55,520
Proving nothing.

630
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,135
No, no, no, no. It...

631
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,390
Don't you see? It fits.
It's perfect. It explains everything.

632
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,570
But it proves nothing.

633
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,180
- I can prove it by treating it.
- No, you can't.

634
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,855
I was just with her. She doesn't
want any more treatments.

635
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:10,610
She doesn't want any more experiments.

636
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,192
She wants to go home and die.

637
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,592
Would you excuse us, please?

638
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,683
I'm Dr. House.

639
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,394
It's good to meet you.

640
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,483
You're being an idiot.

641
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,116
You have a tapeworm in your brain.

642
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:03,785
It's not pleasant, but...

643
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:05,662
if we don't do anything,
you'll be dead by the weekend.

644
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,872
Have you actually seen the worm?

645
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:10,583
When you're all better,
I'll show you my diplomas.

646
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,440
You were sure I had vasculitis too.

647
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:17,173
Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a diaper.

648
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,634
What's this treatment gonna do for me?

649
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:22,137
I'm not talking about a
treatment. I'm talking about a cure.

650
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,590
But because I might be
wrong, you want to die.

651
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,728
What made you a cripple?

652
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,150
I had an infarction.

653
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,234
A heart attack?

654
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,930
It's what happens when
blood flow is obstructed.

655
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,070
If it's in the heart,
it's a heart attack.

656
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,280
If it's in the lungs,
it's a pulmonary embolism.

657
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,786
If it's in the brain, it's a stroke.
I had it in my thigh muscles.

658
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,788
Wasn't there something they could do?

659
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,650
There was plenty they could do,

660
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,208
if they'd made the right diagnosis.

661
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,794
But the only symptom was pain.

662
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,910
Not many people get
to experience muscle death.

663
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,700
Did you think you were dying?

664
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,160
I hoped I was dying.

665
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,740
So you hide in your office,
refuse to see patients...

666
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,250
because you don't like
the way people look at you.

667
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,440
You feel cheated by life, so now
you're gonna get even with the world.

668
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,568
But you want me to fight this.

669
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Why?

670
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,360
What makes you think
I'm so much better than you?

671
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:27,510
What, you're scared
you'll turn into me?

672
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,080
I just want to die with a little dignity.

673
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,081
There's no such thing.

674
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,280
Our bodies break down.

675
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,418
Sometimes when we're 90.

676
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:37,650
Sometimes before we're even born.
But it always happens,

677
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,589
and there's never any dignity in it.

678
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,480
I don't care if you can
walk, see, wipe your own ass.

679
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,320
It's always ugly. Always.

680
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,226
We can live with dignity.
We can't die with it.

681
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,660
No treatment.

682
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,470
Maybe we can get a court order...

683
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,200
override her wishes, claim she doesn't
have the capacity to make this decision.

684
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,530
But she does.

685
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,140
But we could claim that the illness
 made her mentally incompetent, right?

686
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,219
- A pretty common result.
- That didn't happen here.

687
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,637
He's not gonna do it.

688
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,020
She's not just a file
to him anymore.

689
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,570
He respects her.

690
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,936
So because you respect her,
you're going to let her die?

691
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,816
I solved the case.
My work is done.

692
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,100
Patients always want proof.

693
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:47,782
We're not making cars here.
 We don't give guarantees.

694
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,495
I think we can prove it's a worm.

695
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,040
It's noninvasive. It's safe.

696
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,876
I'm not completely sure, but...

697
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's the damn idea?

698
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,950
Have you ever seen a worm under an X-ray?

699
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,133
A regular, old, no contrast,
 hundred-year-old-technology X-ray?

700
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,790
They light up like shotgun pellets,

701
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:09,010
just like on a contrast MRI.

702
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,920
Which is the same thing as a CT scan,

703
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,390
which we did, which proved nothing.

704
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,260
The worm's cyst is the same
density as the cerebrospinal fluid.

705
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,145
We're not gonna see anything in her head.

706
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,397
But Chase is right.

707
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,000
He's right. We should X-ray her.

708
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,610
But we don't X-ray her brain. We X-ray her leg.

709
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,945
Worms love thigh muscle.

710
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,198
If she's got one in her head,
 I guarantee you there's one in her leg.

711
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,530
Hold still, Rebecca.

712
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,370
This here...

713
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,420
is a worm larva.

714
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:00,190
So, if it's in my leg,
it's in my brain?

715
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,398
Are you looking for a guarantee?

716
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,944
It's there. Probably been
there six to ten years.

717
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,960
- Do I have more?
- Probably.

718
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,951
It's good news.

719
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:15,870
- What do we do now?
- Now we get you better.

720
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,832
Albendazole.

721
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,960
Two pills?

722
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,170
Yeah. Every day, for at
least a month, with a meal.

723
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:28,967
- Two pills?
 - Yeah.

724
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,990
Possible side effects include...

725
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,139
abdominal pain, nausea,
headaches, dizziness, fever and...

726
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:36,057
hair loss.

727
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,020
We'll probably make
you keep taking the pills

728
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,811
even if you get every one of those.

729
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,081
Why did you hire me?

730
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,126
Does it matter?

731
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:05,150
Kinda hard to work for a
guy who doesn't respect you.

732
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,713
- Why?
- Is that rhetorical?

733
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:10,049
No. It just seems that way
'cause you can't think of an answer.

734
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,760
Does it make a difference what I think?

735
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,830
I'm a jerk.

736
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,681
The only thing that
matters is what you think.

737
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,599
Can you do the job?

738
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,893
You hired a black guy
because he had a juvenile record.

739
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,020
No.

740
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:23,730
Wasn't a racial thing.

741
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,730
I didn't see a black guy.

742
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,692
I just saw a doctor...

743
00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:29,902
with a juvenile record.

744
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,780
I hired Chase 'cause
his dad made a phone call.

745
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:34,991
I hired you...

746
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,460
because you are extremely pretty.

747
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,329
You hired me to get into my pants?

748
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,700
I can't believe that
that would shock you.

749
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,340
It's also not what I said.

750
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,086
No, I hired you
because you look good.

751
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,660
It's like having a nice
piece of art in the lobby.

752
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,091
- I was in the top of my class.
- But not the top.

753
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,135
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.

754
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:55,490
You were a very good applicant.

755
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,570
But not the best.

756
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,431
Would that upset you? Really?

757
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,840
To think that you were hired
because of some genetic gift

758
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,050
of beauty instead of
some genetic gift of intelligence?

759
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,021
I worked very hard to get where I am.

760
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:06,731
But you didn't have to.

761
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,194
People choose the paths
 that gain them the greatest rewards

762
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:13,150
for the least amount of effort.
 That's a law of nature,

763
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,197
and you defied it.

764
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,782
That's why I hired you.

765
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:18,550
You could have married rich.
You could have been a model.

766
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,950
You could have just shown up and
 people would have given you stuff.

767
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,030
Lots of stuff.

768
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:26,160
But you didn't. You worked
your stunning little ass off.

769
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,794
Am I supposed to be flattered?

770
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:30,050
Gorgeous women do
not go to medical school...

771
00:40:30,546 --> 00:40:33,966
unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful.

772
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,280
Were you abused by a family member?

773
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,980
- No.
- Sexually assaulted?

774
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,230
No!

775
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:41,849
But you are damaged, aren't you?

776
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,316
I have to go.

777
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,404
I followed her.

778
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,575
I couldn't stop thinking
about what that doctor said.

779
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:01,410
I told you not to listen
to him. He's an idiot.

780
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,703
I was orange!

781
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,456
I don't want to know
what you found out.

782
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:06,940
You don't care?

783
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm your doctor.

784
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,003
You've been good to me
and good to this hospital.

785
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:12,463
Of course I care.

786
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:15,258
But I don't see how this
conversation can end well for me.

787
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,350
Either your wife is having an affair,
or she's not having an affair, and...

788
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,806
you have come here because
you rightly think I should fire him.

789
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,300
But I can't. Even if
it costs me your money.

790
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,396
The son of a bitch is
the best doctor we have.

791
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,170
Feeling any better?

792
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,410
I can't complain.

793
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,868
As you know, the hospital
has certain rules, and...

794
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,704
As you also know,
we tend to ignore them.

795
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,914
But I think this one's
gonna be a little obvious

796
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:48,249
unless we get your help.

797
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,836
If anyone asks, you have 11
daughters and five sons.

798
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,047
Hi! Look who's here!

799
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,510
It's so good to see
you guys. I missed you.

800
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,095
Is this for me?

801
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,056
It's beautiful.

802
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,561
Oh, I love you guys.

803
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,856
I wanted to thank Dr. House,
 but he never visited again.

804
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,525
He cured you.
You didn't cure him.

805
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,820
Okay, I want a hug and a kiss

806
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,448
from every single one of
you! Get up here right now!

807
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,076
"There."

808
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:26,070
"Hold on."

809
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,090
"She's converted."

810
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,126
You said she was your cousin.

811
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,600
Why would you lie?

812
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,131
It got you to take the case.

813
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,730
You lied to a friend
to save a stranger.

814
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,570
You don't think that's kind of screwed up?

815
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,650
You've never lied to me?

816
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,974
I never lie.

817
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,018
Oh. Right.

818
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,800
- "Why do we do this?"
- "Because we're doctors."

819
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,982
"If we make mistakes, people die."

820
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,110
Dr. House?

821
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,490
You have a patient.

822
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,580
He says he needs a refill.

823
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,961
Got change for a dollar?
