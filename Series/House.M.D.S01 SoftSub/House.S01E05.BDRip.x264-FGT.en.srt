1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,780
We are condemned to useless labor.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,340
Fourth circle of hell.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,470
Charting goes a lot faster when
you eliminate all classic poetry.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,930
Writing down what we already know
to be read by nobody.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,830
I'm pretty sure Dante would agree
that qualifies as useless.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,276
You're over two weeks behind in your charting.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,840
Oops. I missed.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,380
-What are you, eight?
-Could an eight-year-old do this?

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,078
You'd better stop, or it'll stick that way.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,956
You have a patient in Exam One.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,870
Yeah, but, see, I'm off at 12:00
and it's already five off.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,100
She's been waiting for you since 11:00.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,133
Melancholy without hope.

14
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,761
Which circle is that?

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,185
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,855
-What seems to be the problem?
-Show him your hands, Augustine.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,534
-It looks like stigmata.
-Shh. Pius.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,300
You must be all the talk
around the "holy water" cooler.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,940
Washing a lot of dishes recently?

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,260
I help out in the kitchen.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,570
Anything new in the kitchen?

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,630
We just got a donation
of saucepans and pots this week.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,110
I unpacked and washed them.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
Should have spent your time saving souls.
It's easier on the hands.

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,870
This is contact dermatitis.
You're allergic to dish soap.

26
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,270
Nonsense. We've always used that soap.
Why is there a problem now?

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,490
I've been a doctor for years.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,790
Why do I have to keep assuring
people that I know what I'm doing?

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,490
A person can become allergic to substances...

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,040
that they've had repeated
and prolonged exposure to.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,830
The good news is... free samples.

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,640
Diphenhydramine.
It's an antihistamine.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,660
It'll stop the allergic reaction.

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,110
Take one every eight hours.
It might make you feel a little sleepy.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,930
And get some of that
over-the-counter cortisone cream.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,920
Thank you, Doctor.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
-You want some water?
-I have some tea.

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,820
Well, you just relax for a few minutes.
That stuff works pretty fast.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,410
Still out by 12:00.

40
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,980
How do you solve a problem like dermatitis?

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,938
-What?
-Doctor?

42
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:26,816
I want to thank you for your patience.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,569
She talkin' to you?

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,870
I don't know.
She's certainly looking at me.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,070
Ah, it's good to get a secular diagnosis.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
The sisters tend to interpret
their illnesses as divine intervention.

47
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,040
And you don't?
Then you're wearing an awfully funny hat.

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,340
Oh, boy. Excuse me.

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,020
If I break my leg,
I believe it happened for a reason.

50
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,240
I believe God wanted me to break my leg.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,550
I also believe he wants me to put a cast on it.

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,720
Doctor! Something's wrong.

53
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,660
Lift up your chin.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,440
Sister, you're having an asthma attack.
I need you to relax.

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Roll up her sleeve, please.
I'm gonna give you epinephrine.

56
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,280
Open your lungs and help you breathe.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,515
-What happened?
-Did she take the pill?

58
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,550
-Yes.
-It's probably an allergic reaction.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,380
She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?

60
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,080
You figure somebody's out to get her?

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,380
-How are you feeling?
-Better.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,500
I'll put you on some steroids instead.

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,450
Is my heart supposed
to be feeling so funny?

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
It's called adrenaline.

65
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,180
It makes your heart beat fast.

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,180
But not this fast.

67
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,420
Get a nurse, please. Hold on.

68
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,419
Help! Somebody help us!

69
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,360
Somebody get in here!

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,080
Call a code and charge up a defibrillator.
She's got no pulse.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,320
You diagnosed the patient with allergies
and prescribed antihistamine.

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,250
She went into respiratory distress...

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,120
...and you injected her with epinephrine.

74
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:30,375
Presumably 1cc.

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,830
.1cc. That is the standard dose.
That is what I gave her.

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,630
People don't go into cardiac arrest
from .1cc epinephrine.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,050
She must have a preexisting heart condition
that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

78
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,136
It's too bad you didn't
make a notation in the chart.

79
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,770
I can make it up right now.

80
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,556
The drawer has syringes with both dosages.

81
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,070
You could have easily reached for the wrong...

82
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,851
-But I didn't.
-Everyone makes mistakes.

83
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,730
This is why doctors pay through the nose
for malpractice insurance.

84
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,500
Relax. They're not gonna sue.

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,150
Worst they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler.

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,530
And the discipline board...
are they gonna whack your hand too?

87
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,947
-You're gonna report me?
-What choice do I have?

88
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,741
How about not report me?

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,940
I can justify keeping her here
for a 24-hour observation.

90
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,000
If you haven't found an underlying cause
for the cardiac arrest by then,

91
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,830
I will have to notify our attorneys.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,050
Her hands were red and swollen.

93
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,930
Maybe she has a skin infection. Cellulitis?

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,350
That could manifest with tachycardia.

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
There's no history of fever.

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,890
Results from the CBC
didn't indicate an infection.

97
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,070
The eosinophils are mildly elevated.
Sed rate's up a bit.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,870
Could we be looking at
a systemic allergic response?

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,610
It's not allergic.
Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this.

100
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,190
Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.

101
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,190
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you
an elevated eosinophil count.

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,990
Churg-Strauss vasculitis would.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,890
The blood vessels of the heart,
lungs and skin become inflamed,

104
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,160
causing the asthma, rash and heart problems...

105
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,890
Covers all her symptoms.

106
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,210
You need a biopsy to diagnose.

107
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,260
Chest CT would be quicker.

108
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,380
The lady just came in with a rash.

109
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,600
What the hell are those?

110
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Candy canes.

111
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,000
Candy canes?

112
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you mocking me?

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,380
No.

114
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,800
I-It's Christmas and I...

115
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,140
-I thought...
-Relax.

116
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,220
It's a joke.

117
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,810
Isn't the prognosis
for Churg-Strauss a bit grim?

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,930
Yeah.

119
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,160
Untreated, only 33% of patients
survive past a year.

120
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,940
-Treated, five years.
-Then I definitely suggest treatment.

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,320
If it was any other attending doctor,
I'd say that he made a mistake...

122
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,170
...and gave her too much epinephrine.

123
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,870
Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake...

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,070
...is saying it was my mistake.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
Everyone screws up. Your rule.

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,700
I think you fit within the subset of "everyone".

127
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
I didn't screw up.

128
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,010
Order a chest CT and
start the sister on prednisone...

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,490
40 milligrams TID.

130
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
The sister?

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,780
Oh, didn't I mention?
The patient's a nun...

132
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,440
Sister Augustine.

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,520
I hate nuns.

134
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
Who doesn't?

135
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,560
Sister Augustine?

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
We weren't watching.

137
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,570
We were trying to see
if this is the bed control.

138
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,340
Oh. This one's the bed control.

139
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,940
And that's the TV control.

140
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm Dr. Cameron.
This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Foreman.

141
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,300
I haven't seen television in over 20 years.

142
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,170
Do you consider it the work of the devil,
or do you just not get cable where you live?

143
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,780
How are you feeling, Sister?

144
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,510
I seem to be a little better.
They gave me some medication.

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,390
Prednisone. It's a steroid
to help with the inflammation.

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,670
Has Dr. House figured out what I have?

147
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,770
-Will I be okay?
-We're not sure what's wrong yet.

148
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,850
You'll have a chest CT scan this afternoon
that'll help with the diagnosis.

149
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,210
Dr. House is giving her medication,
and he doesn't know what she has yet?

150
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,180
-Trust, Sister Pius.
-It all happens for a reason.

151
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,750
He doesn't know what he's doing.

152
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,710
The only problem that woman has
is that House grabbed the wrong syringe.

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
You don't trust him?

154
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,820
I don't trust a man who
won't admit he might be wrong.

155
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,880
I notice you weren't so quick
to tell her she's got...

156
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,750
-Churg-Strauss and only has a couple years left.
-I don't tell patients bad news unless...

157
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,590
...it's conclusive.

158
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,300
Because you know he might be wrong.

159
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,920
About Churg-Strauss.
Not about what happened in the clinic.

160
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,180
What about you, Chase?
You think he's infallible too?

161
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,670
All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake...

162
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,630
...and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss,

163
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,460
he'll be self-satisfied and
our lives will be good for a few weeks.

164
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,210
If House did make a mistake,

165
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,900
he'll be upset and
our lives will be miserable for months.

166
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,920
There is that.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,050
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake,
the least she could...

168
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,990
...do is suspend me from clinic duty.

169
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,700
She doesn't confuse making
a mistake with being incompetent.

170
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,950
Oh, here we go... lesson time.

171
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,260
I recognize that confidence is not my short suit.

172
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,040
I also recognize that I am human
and capable of error.

173
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,660
So you might have screwed this up?

174
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,050
No.

175
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,380
So it's merely a theoretical capacity for error.

176
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Good point.

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,590
Maybe there isn't one.
Maybe that's my error.

178
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,888
You know, most people who think as much of...

179
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,480
...themselves as you do
like to talk about themselves.

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,420
Most people don't like to listen.
So, what's wrong with you?

181
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,610
Let me guess...

182
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,074
Inflammatory bowel.

183
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,940
Wow. Yeah. Is it that bad?

184
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,070
Yes.

185
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,840
It's also written on your chart.

186
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,620
"Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain."

187
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,170
"Took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work".

188
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,880
-No. Then I...
-"Next, tried steroid enemas."

189
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,550
"Oral corticosteroids... 5-ASA,
6-mercaptopurine".

190
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,660
-I'm impressed.
-By my medical history?

191
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,780
By how well your last doctor charted.

192
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,470
It's one thing to have to go
to the bathroom every hour,

193
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,760
but when the kids sit on my lap, it's...

194
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,340
The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.

195
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,970
Can't you put me back on 5-ASA?
Maybe it'll work this time.

196
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,860
Not likely.

197
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,230
I'm giving you a prescription.

198
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,850
It's cheap, which is good, because
your insurance company won't pay for it.

199
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,610
"Cogaritis"?

200
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,280
Cigarettes.

201
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,810
One twice a day.
No more, no less.

202
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,750
Studies have shown that cigarette smoking...

203
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,740
...is one of the most effective ways
to control inflammatory bowel.

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,180
Plus it's been well established
that you look 30% cooler.

205
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,380
-Are you kidding me?
-About the looking cooler, yeah.

206
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,260
-The rest is true.
-Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe
are addictive and dangerous.

208
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
The only difference with this one
is it's completely illegal.

209
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Merry Christmas.

210
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,190
I was talking to the nurse...

211
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,200
Arsenio. Do you know him?

212
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,780
-Not really.
-He can take pictures with his phone.

213
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Cool.

214
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,550
That woman from the lab was interesting too.

215
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,340
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

216
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,340
-You know the staff better than I do.
-I love to hear all about people.

217
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,890
Yet you live in a monastery.

218
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,480
It's where I serve our Lord and the world best.

219
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,090
Our Lord maybe.

220
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
The rest of the world, on the other hand...

221
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,610
...probably get more out of feeding
the homeless or...

222
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,640
Healing the sick?

223
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,880
-As an example, yeah.
-Did you always want to be a doctor?

224
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Always.

225
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,810
-You always want to be a nun?
-My parents died when I was six.

226
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,320
I was raised in a foster home
run by the Church.

227
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,280
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,
where they let me take my vows.

228
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,220
I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.

229
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay, Sister, we need you
to lie as still as possible.

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,440
If you get scared, just let us know.

231
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,060
As Jonah said from inside the whale,

232
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,120
"When I had lost all hope,
I turned my thoughts to the Lord."

233
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,790
-Well, she's got God on her side.
-I don't believe in God.

234
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,800
You're not even a little agnostic?

235
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,970
Is it supposed to smell funny?

236
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,560
Someone ralphed in there this morning.
We cleaned it up, but...

237
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,600
It's normal, Sister.
It's just a few more minutes.

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,510
I believe in a higher order
that's in control of what happens,

239
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,300
but not one anthropomorphic entity
called "God"...

240
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,550
that's concerned with
the everyday workings of you and me.

241
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,390
What else is there to control
but the everyday workings of you and me?

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
It's always about you, Foreman.

243
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,290
What are you talking about...
the trees, the fish?

244
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,460
Should they be the ones that think
it's all about them?

245
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,480
What about you, Chase?
You believe in God?

246
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,420
I believe Sister Augustine
has no vascular pathology,

247
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,200
which means no Churg-Strauss.

248
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,570
-Which means House made a mistake.
-No, not necessarily.

249
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,610
It could be something else.
Thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid.

250
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,630
I don't get you.
You don't believe in God,

251
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,170
but you're willing to put
complete faith in one man?

252
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,240
Please. The smell.

253
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,600
Let's get her out of there.

254
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm coming, Sister.

255
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,420
-I got you. Coming.
-I'm gonna be sick.

256
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,858
The smell. I'm gonna be sick.

257
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,000
-There's no smell. It's okay.
-Oh, God!

258
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,406
Oh, it's Jesus. It's Jesus.

259
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,575
He's coming for me!

260
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,536
He's burning me with his touch!

261
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,060
Let's get her on some Ativan.

262
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,780
Please!

263
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,041
Smells, religious visions,
symptomatic type of lobe swelling.

264
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
We don't... want her to...

265
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,230
She's seizing.

266
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,337
Jaw block.

267
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,750
Help me get her on her side.

268
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,720
-Religious visions?
-Yeah.

269
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,636
And next comes...

270
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,310
Patient tested positive
for herpetic encephalitis.

271
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,899
-So what's that tell us?
-Her immune system is severely compromised.

272
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,120
Oh, I know. Prednisone compromises
the immune system.

273
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,660
Isn't that the medicine that you gave her
for that thing she doesn't have?

274
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,880
Yeah, the...

275
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
Hey.

276
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm thinking that's a trick question.

277
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,290
Her immune system is severely compromised.

278
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,122
Two doses of prednisone wouldn't do that.

279
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,650
Are you hanging
your diagnosis on an adverb?

280
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,587
In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce that
I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.

281
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,048
-You're gonna admit negligence?
-Unless you leave the room.

282
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,133
If you stay, you'll have to testify.

283
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,223
Five, four, three, two...

284
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,650
So there I was in the clinic, drunk.
I open the drawer,

285
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,480
close my eyes,
take the first syringe I can find...

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,235
So, what are the options
for compromised immune system?

287
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,153
Mixed connective tissue disease.

288
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,800
It'd explain why she was
feeling better on the prednisone.

289
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,680
Sure she was feeling better right up to
the moment when it almost killed her.

290
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,610
On the other hand,
it explains the symptoms.

291
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,070
Swollen hands, pulmonary problems,
cardiac problems, it all fits.

292
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,500
-Except her ANA was normal.
-So redraw the blood.

293
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,840
But the treatment is
corticosteroids, prednisone.

294
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,839
And we can't go there
because of the encephalitis.

295
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,270
Well, treat it with something...

296
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,700
...that modulates the immune system,
but doesn't suppress it.

297
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,553
Hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

298
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,130
There's no protocol for putting a patient
in a high-pressure oxygen room...

299
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,540
-to treat autoimmune problems.
-Oh, you people, always with the protocols.

300
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,770
Prep the nun.

301
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,830
And discontinue the prednisone.

302
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,530
I am both amused and annoyed...

303
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,020
that you think I should
be less stubborn than you are.

304
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,220
You are aware of the Hippocratic oath, right?

305
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,110
The one that starts "First, do no harm,"...

306
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,350
...and then goes on
to tell us no abortions, no seductions,

307
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,922
and definitely no cutting of
those who labor beneath the stone?

308
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,750
Yeah, I took a read once, wasn't impressed.

309
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,012
Hyperbaric treatments could cause
oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage.

310
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,470
Every treatment has its dangers.

311
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,764
Which is why we only treat

312
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,726
if we're convinced the patient
actually needs the treatment.

313
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm convinced. You're not.

314
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,939
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

315
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,640
I have an opening Thursday at 3:00.
Do you have a fourth?

316
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,890
Is he any good?

317
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,340
Can I call you right back? Okay.

318
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,550
What's up?

319
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,950
The pressure will force the oxygen
into your system, and saturate your blood.

320
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,220
It will enhance white cell activity,
reduce the inflammation.

321
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,650
And that will help with
this mixed connective tissue disease?

322
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,513
We'll be doing about 10 treatments,
and then we'll reevaluate.

323
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,960
The last treatment with prednisone
caused the seizures, right?

324
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,330
How confident is Dr. House about this?

325
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,110
That you reacted so strongly to the Prednisone...

326
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,010
let us know that you had an underlying problem
with your immune system.

327
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,028
Then I guess it was a blessing.

328
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,990
Of sorts.

329
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,120
<i>So who's your favorite reindeer, Nurse Arnold?</i>

330
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,590
<i>-Rudolph.
-I would have thought it was Vixen.</i>

331
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,874
<i>-What are you implying?
-Nothing.</i>

332
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,590
<i>But I saw you at the Christmas party...</i>

333
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,190
...<i>with Dr. Miles and
Dr. Jargons and Nurse Crandall.</i>

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,240
<i>I was just doing some Christmas dancing.</i>

335
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,676
This is a chapel.

336
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,490
A house of prayer.

337
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,950
A house of prayer. Huh.

338
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,140
Well, that explains the good reception.

339
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,210
Also why nobody's ever here.

340
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,250
I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

341
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,390
Sister Augustine believes
in things that aren't real.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,155
I thought that was
a job requirement for you people.

343
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,700
She's been known to lie.

344
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,400
To get sympathy.
She's a hypochondriac.

345
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,000
So you're warning me that
I may be treating a non-existent ailment.

346
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,640
Sore throats, joint pains.

347
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,300
There's always something wrong.

348
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,672
And there's never a reason for it.

349
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,660
Mother Superior plays right into it.

350
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,400
Lets Augustine off work duties.

351
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,900
Treating her as...
fragile. Special.

352
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,220
That must make you angry.

353
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
It bothers me.

354
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,900
It's not really in Augustine's best interest.

355
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Want some?

356
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,790
I shouldn't.

357
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,960
I guess you gotta be good at reading
people to be a good infirmarian, huh?

358
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,128
So we got pride, anger, envy, gluttony.

359
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,960
That four out of seven deadly sins
in under two minutes.

360
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,890
Do you people keep records of these things?

361
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,177
Is there a Cath-lympics?

362
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,350
-They say you have a gift.
-They like to talk.

363
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,184
You hide behind your intelligence.

364
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,560
Yeah, that's pretty stupid.

365
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,530
And you make jokes because you're afraid
to take anything seriously.

366
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,690
Because if you take things seriously...

367
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:07,690
...they matter.

368
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,410
-And if they matter...
-Then when things go wrong, I get hurt.

369
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,240
-I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable.
-I barely know you.

370
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,720
And I don't know if I'm right.
I just hope I am.

371
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
Because the alternative is,

372
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,160
you really are as miserable as you seem to be.

373
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,870
You know, from the way
you're looking at me right now,

374
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,060
I'd say you just hit number five.

375
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,470
Lust.

376
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,760
<i>Dr. Brown, I love you too.</i>

377
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
How you feeling?

378
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,890
-A little weak.
-That's from the oxygen.

379
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,380
My mouth is dry.

380
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,730
Okay, well, uh,
I'll get you some of your tea.

381
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,430
Mixed connective tissue disease?
Her ANA is barely elevated.

382
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,960
Well, thanks for checking up on her.
Good to know you got my back.

383
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,670
O2 stats down to 83.
Pulmonary problems, breathing problems...

384
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,720
Irritation from the oxygen is typical.

385
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,530
She comes in with a rash,
and you put her into cardiac arrest.

386
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,854
That well just never runs dry, does it?

387
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,482
If there was no underlying problem,
why is she still having the rapid heart rate?

388
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,210
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her prednisone.

389
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,520
Her reaction is a symptom, not an error.

390
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,920
-There's always an explanation, isn't there?
-Yes, there is,

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,410
and if this one doesn't
work, we'll find another.

392
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,617
But never one involving you screwing up.

393
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,730
One that fits all the facts.

394
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,040
Look, we obviously have
a difference of opinion, and that's fine.

395
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,708
But unfortunately, I've used up all the time...

396
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,210
...I budgeted today
for banging my head against a wall.

397
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,030
I am gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do for another.

398
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,770
I am gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

399
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,460
You're off the case.

400
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,620
We're gonna treat the symptoms.

401
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,310
-Not the underlying condition?
-There is no underlying condition.

402
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,310
What's her status?

403
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,203
The sister's breathing is labored.

404
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,090
Pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber.

405
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,750
Put her on 40% oxygen until
her O2 stats increase.

406
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,570
BUN and creatinine's rising.
ALT and AST twice the normal range.

407
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,546
Could be from the hypotensive episode.

408
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,510
Let's follow them with labs.

409
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,480
She still has the rash and
joint pain she came in with.

410
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,750
Order a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.

411
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
When we're looking at
the differential diagnosis with Dr. House,

412
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,766
-we were considering...
-I don't need to hear what Dr. House...

413
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,975
...was considering.

414
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,570
All of this woman's symptoms can
be traced to Dr. House's considerations.

415
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,200
Okay.

416
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,560
Let's just get this patient healthy.

417
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,090
I want her going out the front door
and not the back.

418
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
Hey, it's not like I betrayed him.

419
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,840
Cuddy would've found out about
the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

420
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,300
You did what you felt you had to.

421
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,120
Can't get enough of this place, huh?

422
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,240
I came for my stethoscope.

423
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,670
So I shouldn't read too much into the fact...

424
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
that you were looking for it in
the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?

425
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,905
Okay. Yeah.
I'd like to cure my reputation.

426
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,930
Oh, right, I forgot how much
you care about what people think.

427
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,460
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

428
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,380
They cause lung cancer, you know.

429
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,020
You know why they have
ribbons for breast cancer,

430
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,420
colorectal cancer, prostate cancer,
and not for lung cancer?

431
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,010
They... ran out of colors?

432
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,530
It's because people blame lung cancer patients.

433
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,630
They smoke, they screwed up, they deserve to die.

434
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
The reason people die from
lung cancer is guilt.

435
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,340
Well, guilt does a lot of damage.

436
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,520
You said that with great significance.

437
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,660
You're not here to find your stethoscope.

438
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,774
You're not here to clear your reputation.

439
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,950
You're here because you're having doubts.

440
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,150
You might've screwed up.

441
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,032
I'm here because if I'm right,
Cuddy is killing that patient.

442
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

443
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,200
But if you're wrong?

444
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,040
-Then she's saving her.
-Fine.

445
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,250
You're gonna have to go through
every record of every patient...

446
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,580
...who's been through
this clinic in the last two days.

447
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,330
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

448
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,090
Which, by the way, yours can't.

449
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,937
These pills will help your kidneys
function a little better, Sister.

450
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,440
Get your wrist.

451
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,710
What's it at?

452
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,770
104.

453
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,710
Is that good?

454
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,790
It's fine.

455
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,250
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

456
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,423
CALL MOM
END MESSAGE

457
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,330
I have to get this. Excuse me.

458
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,120
My mother's been dead for ten years.

459
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,500
But she's always with you in spirit.

460
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,960
-What do you know about the nun?
-Which one?

461
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,810
The cute one.
I think she likes me.

462
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,240
The sick one, obviously.

463
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,890
Her parents died when she was a child.
And she's been with the Church ever since.

464
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,780
-What's she lying about?
-Why do you say that?

465
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,150
I always say that.

466
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,496
And the old nun thinks
the sick nun is a big, fat nun liar.

467
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,890
-You know nuns. What do you think?
-I don't know nuns.

468
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,250
You hate nuns.

469
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,252
You can't hate someone
if you don't know them.

470
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,740
Know any Nazis?
Maybe I hate them on principle.

471
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,740
I have a theory about
what makes good boys good.

472
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,261
It's not because of some moral imperative.

473
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,190
Good boys have the fear of God put into them.

474
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,400
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training.

475
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,870
To make good boys afraid
of divine retribution.

476
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,890
So they'll do what their daddies tell'em.

477
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,990
Like, for example, going into medical school
when it's the last thing they want to do.

478
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,830
What do you think?

479
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,120
I think if she did have a secret,
her boss would know.

480
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,920
Did you paint or put in new carpets recently?

481
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,876
No.

482
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,544
Any way she could've got access to drugs?

483
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,120
Well, we lock all
our medications in the infirmary,

484
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,190
and we don't keep prescription drugs here.

485
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,830
Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine
about these things directly?

486
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,130
I found that when you want
to know the truth about someone,

487
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,060
that someone is probably
the last person you should ask.

488
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,310
And have you been speaking
to Sister Eucharist?

489
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,210
She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly.

490
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,040
If I were you, I'd have her
repeat a year of nun school.

491
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,050
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.

492
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,010
Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.

493
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,450
And just because we live in a monastery

494
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,170
and we spend most of our time in prayer...

495
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,180
...doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.

496
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,123
So what is the sick one's drama?

497
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,044
Sister Augustine lived
in Catholic foster care...

498
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,690
...until she came to us.

499
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
Tea?

500
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,050
Sure.

501
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,730
Do all of you lie?

502
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,690
It's a good strategy.

503
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,642
It's simpler when you tell the same lie.

504
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,700
But she does not spend her
entire life as a good Catholic.

505
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,400
When she had a cardiac arrest,
I had to open her blouse to do CPR.

506
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,740
And I learned two things.

507
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,810
Nuns can have nice breasts.

508
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,980
And she has a tattoo on her shoulder.

509
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,460
Of a skunk.

510
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,770
Now, maybe this was
the sacred skunk of Joseph,

511
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,450
but as far as I know,

512
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,770
Catholic foster care and monasteries...

513
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,291
...do not keep tattoo parlors
in their refectories.

514
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,740
We consider that our life begins...

515
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,630
when we put on our habits
and take our vows.

516
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,710
What happens before then...

517
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,344
It's irrelevant to you.
But it's relevant to me.

518
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,910
Sister Augustine went into foster care
when she was six years old.

519
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,040
But she left when she was 12.

520
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,330
She lived on the streets,
she got into drugs.

521
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,970
When she was 15,
she became pregnant.

522
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,590
Tried to self-abort.

523
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,780
She lost the child,
she became ill.

524
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,870
We took her in when she came back.

525
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,750
If we had thought that it was
medically relevant, we would have told you.

526
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,680
It's not.

527
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,290
This tea is delicious.

528
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,700
Local herbs?

529
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,090
Any change with the medication?

530
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,310
Yeah, she's getting worse.
Lung functions deteriorating,

531
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
BUN and creatinine continuing to rise.

532
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,730
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

533
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,480
At this rate,

534
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,470
-she's not gonna make Christmas.
-Maybe House was right.

535
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,486
Maybe there is an underlying condition
that explains the symptoms.

536
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,946
Something we haven't considered.

537
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,910
Like what?

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,580
It could be a metabolic disorder.

539
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,280
-Specifically?
-Might be genetic.

540
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,510
Specifically?

541
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,000
-I'm just saying that...
-You're just saying you think House is right.

542
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:24,414
Might be right.

543
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,875
Of course he might be right.
It might be the hand of God at work.

544
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,794
Don't say it's something else unless
you've got something concrete to offer.

545
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,860
What's this? Hemlock?

546
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do another.

547
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,480
I'm gonna stop you from
killing your patient.

548
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,880
It's figwort tea.

549
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,690
Great for that little pick-me-up
we're all looking for in the morning.

550
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,010
Opens the lungs,

551
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,360
increases the blood pressure,
stimulates the heart.

552
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,440
Unfortunately, if you then get injected with...

553
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,040
...even .1cc of epinephrine,

554
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,100
instant cardiac arrest.

555
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,480
Still, what the hell, it tastes great.

556
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,610
Sister Augustine...

557
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,100
Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak.

558
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,230
And if you take the cardiac arrest
out of the equation...

559
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,500
All the rest of the symptoms can be explained
by a severe long-term allergic reaction.

560
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,544
Well, that's what Cameron
said in the beginning.

561
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,320
Yes. She did.

562
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,490
Well done.

563
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,290
But your unwillingness to stick by
your diagnosis almost killed this woman.

564
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,560
Take a lesson from Foreman
and stand up for what you believe.

565
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,880
Okay. Let's go figure out how to save a nun.

566
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,220
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

567
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,310
'Cause it's been untreated for so long,

568
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,210
it's gone from a simple watery eyes,

569
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,560
scratchy throat allergy to
a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy.

570
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,930
Compromising her immune system,

571
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,550
diminishing her ability to heal, and
breaking down her organ systems.

572
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,450
So what's the source?

573
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
The dish soap.

574
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,300
No, symptoms persisted days
after the dish washing episode.

575
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,510
Gotta be something she's been exposed to

576
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,390
here in the hospital,
as well as the monastery.

577
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,588
Well, what about the tea?
It caused her arrhythmia.

578
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,470
Could be, but it's not \definitive.

579
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,490
-We'll skin test for allergies.
-Not yet, she's too reactive.

580
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,630
She'll test positive to everything.
We need to stabilize her.

581
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,850
Isolate her from all possible allergens,
give her system a rest.

582
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,960
Get her in the clean room.

583
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,450
Okay, then we'll gradually introduce
allergens to see how she responds.

584
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,100
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

585
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,152
There you go.
No television, no books.

586
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Not even my Bible?

587
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,750
I'm afraid not. This room has
filtered air, filtered water.

588
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,400
You even have silk sheets.

589
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,618
Very decadent and hypoallergenic.

590
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,600
You should be feeling better here.

591
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,980
We'll be back to check on
you in a little while.

592
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,350
Can the other sisters come in
and pray with me?

593
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,940
It'd be better if you don't have any visitors.

594
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,880
Once we isolate what's causing your allergy,
then we can be a little more lax.

595
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,400
I can pray with you.

596
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,090
I don't want to die.

597
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,260
Why has He left me?

598
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,310
I was in seminary school.

599
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,090
They asked us once what our favorite passage was.

600
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,300
I chose 1 Peter 1:7.

601
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,640
"These trials only test your faith to see
whether or not it is strong and pure."

602
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,760
"Your faith is being tested."

603
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,660
"As fire tests gold and purifies it."

604
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,820
"And your faith is far more precious
to the Lord than mere gold."

605
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,450
So if your faith remains strong
after being tested, it will bring you...

606
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,300
...much praise and glory and honor...

607
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,470
...on the day of His return.

608
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,920
He hasn't left you.

609
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,100
The only thing in the way of you
knowing He's there is your fear.

610
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,589
You have a choice.

611
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,580
Faith or fear.

612
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,640
That's the test.

613
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,137
Choosing faith doesn't mean I won't die.

614
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,300
But it will affect how
you will experience your death.

615
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,934
And therefore your life.

616
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
It's up to you.

617
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,390
Why did you leave seminary school?

618
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,460
That test...

619
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,240
You passed.

620
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
I didn't.

621
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,950
We'll call you if anything changes.

622
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,530
Will she be alright?

623
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,550
As long as she's not exposed to anything
that can aggravate her allergy,

624
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
she'll be fine.

625
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,210
Need some help in here.

626
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,740
Screw the procedure.
She's in anaphylactic shock.

627
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,051
-No way, she's in the damn clean room!
-Are you kidding me?

628
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,130
Get in here!

629
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,680
.1cc of epi.

630
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,520
We've got to intubate.

631
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,184
I got it. Get the ambu bag.

632
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,449
I'm in.

633
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,910
Breathing stabilized.

634
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,480
It's a clean room.

635
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,920
How do you get an allergic reaction
in a clean room?

636
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,310
Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV.

637
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Checked that.

638
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,779
-Latex tubing?
-Checked that. Checked everything.

639
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,650
Well, it could be mast cell leukemia.
It can cause anaphylaxis.

640
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,868
We checked the blood levels.

641
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,122
And it's not
eosinophilic idiopathic anaphylaxis.

642
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,820
Maybe it's just divine will.

643
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,040
It's not my will.

644
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,360
You do realize, if you're wrong...

645
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,100
...about the big picture, that is...

646
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,640
...you're going to burn, right?

647
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,340
What do you want me to do?
Just accept it, pack it in?

648
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,145
I want you to accept that
sometimes patients die against all reason.

649
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,870
And sometimes they get
better against all reason.

650
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,732
No, they don't.
We just don't know the reason.

651
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,200
I think the nuns would agree with you on that.

652
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,270
I just wanted to say that I know
you did everything you could.

653
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

654
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,160
That's your problem, not mine.

655
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,680
I was just being nice.

656
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that.

657
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,130
Merry Christmas.

658
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,810
Sister Augustine's been extubated.

659
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,610
Good.

660
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,460
She's requested to check out
against medical advice.

661
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,270
She wants to go back to the monastery.

662
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,410
Well, talk her out of it.

663
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
I think I may have talked her into it.

664
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,870
Room's paid up for the rest of the week.

665
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,120
Might as well stick around.

666
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,105
This illness is a test of my faith.

667
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,080
If it's His will to take me,

668
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,230
it doesn't matter where I am.

669
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,700
I can accept that.

670
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,320
Does anybody believe anything you say?

671
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
You're not accepting.

672
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,247
You're running away.

673
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,040
Just like you always do.

674
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,050
You ran away from the monastery to get laid.

675
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,730
You ran away from the real world
when getting laid didn't work out so good.

676
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,230
Now things aren't working out again, so off you go.

677
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,760
Why is it so difficult for you to believe in God?

678
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,770
What I have difficulty with
is the whole concept of belief.

679
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,898
Faith isn't based on logic and experience.

680
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,818
I experience God on a daily basis.

681
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,400
And the miracle of life all around.

682
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,560
The miracle of birth.

683
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,742
The miracle of love.

684
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,580
He is always with me.

685
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,791
Where is the miracle in delivering
a crack-addicted baby?

686
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,005
And watching her mother abandon her
'cause she needs another score.

687
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,830
Miracle of love.

688
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,070
You are over twice as likely to be killed
by the person you love than by a stranger.

689
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,170
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?

690
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,330
You can have all the faith you want
in spirits and the afterlife,

691
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,280
heaven and hell.

692
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,100
But when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot.

693
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,640
'Cause you can tell me that you put
your faith in God to get you through the day.

694
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,826
But when it comes time to cross the road,
I know you look both ways.

695
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,310
I don't believe He is inside me
and is going to save me.

696
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,550
I believe He is inside me whether I live or die.

697
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,820
Then you might as well live.

698
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,700
You got a better shot betting on me than on Him.

699
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,960
When I was 15,

700
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,440
I was on every kind of birth control known to man.

701
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,630
And I still got pregnant.

702
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,680
I blamed God.

703
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,840
I hated Him for ruining my life.

704
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,060
But then I realized something.

705
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,500
You can't be angry with God
and not believe in Him at the same time.

706
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,360
No one can.

707
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,860
Not even you, Dr. House.

708
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
How'd it go?

709
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,460
She has God inside her.

710
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,960
Would've been easier to deal with a tumor.

711
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,960
Maybe she's allergic to God.

712
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,410
We've looked everywhere for an allergen...

713
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,740
that could be causing
this reaction except one place.

714
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,687
Inside her.

715
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,990
On her medical history,
she didn't mention any surgery.

716
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
She had one.

717
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,810
Can we get her records?
What hospital was it at?

718
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,140
She didn't have it at a hospital.

719
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,154
Order a full body scan.

720
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,810
What if she refuses?

721
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,630
Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.

722
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,980
No piercings. No fillings.

723
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,080
No surgical pins in the arm.

724
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,630
-No implants.
-It's clean as a whistle.

725
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,000
What's House looking for?

726
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,380
What is that?

727
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
Don't know.

728
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,928
Lock on it.
Get a 3D representation.

729
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
Oh, my God.

730
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,450
The copper cross.

731
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,420
A form of birth control
pulled off the market in the '80s.

732
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,380
So she's allergic to copper?

733
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,281
Rare, but it happens.

734
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,210
Didn't she know she had an IUD?

735
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,390
She had an abortion.

736
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,770
IUD must have been left in,

737
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,640
embedded in the endometrial tissue
where it couldn't be detected.

738
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,170
So all we have to do is remove the IUD.

739
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,890
Then the symptoms should subside.

740
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,040
I got this IUD when I was 15.

741
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,170
It's been more than 20 years.

742
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,070
Well, prolonged exposure to an allergen
with minimal symptoms.

743
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,870
But at some point, all it takes is one last contact
to cause a full-blown reaction.

744
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,400
It's like a balloon filled with air.
One last breath, it explodes.

745
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:57,106
The first time I got the rash
was when I was washing the copper cookware.

746
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,484
And all your subsequent symptoms
came from ingesting food prepared in it.

747
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:03,720
Dr. House found his miracle.

748
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,210
I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

749
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,619
You told me your favorite passage.

750
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,460
Would you like to hear mine?

751
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,870
"Celebrate and be glad,"

752
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,870
"because your brother was
dead and is alive again."

753
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,030
The prodigal son.

754
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,750
He'll be waiting for you when you're ready.

755
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,270
We'll schedule your surgery for tomorrow.

756
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,160
The sixth circle of hell.

757
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,670
Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose,

758
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,430
and all the tissues are soggy.

759
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,930
I think that's the seventh.

760
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,490
-No, the seventh is...
-God, you must be fun at parties.

761
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,540
I think we both know the flaw in that theory.

762
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
How's the sister?

763
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,090
Heart rate is normal,
kidney is functioning.

764
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,650
You know how it is with nuns, you take out
their IUDs, they just bounce right back.

765
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
-Great.
-Told you I didn't screw up.

766
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,710
You screwed up.

767
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,923
I gave her .1cc of epinephrine.

768
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,592
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you
off the case, you would've killed her.

769
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,750
You wanna come over for Christmas dinner?

770
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,460
You're Jewish.

771
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,690
Yeah, Hanukkah dinner.

772
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,630
What do you care? It's food, it's people.

773
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
No thanks.

774
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,060
Maybe I'll come to your place.

775
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,150
Your wife doesn't mind being alone at Christmas?

776
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,196
I'm a doctor, she's used to being alone.

777
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,760
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Neither do I.

778
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,100
You did good. With the nun.

779
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,230
Congratulations.

780
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Thank you.

781
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,190
Merry Christmas, Dr. House.

782
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,140
Dr. Wilson.

783
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
Good night.

784
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,430
That was sweet.
