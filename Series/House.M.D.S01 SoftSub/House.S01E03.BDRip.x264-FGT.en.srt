1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,486
I didn't sleep well last night,
and I woke up with a scratchy throat.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,114
I just don't feel so good.

3
00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:12,866
Uh, cough.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,730
Yeah, I have a bit of an upset stomach
too, and I think I'm running a fever.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm just worried
I might be contagious.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,420
Inventory. Tomorrow. I'm yeah, I'm
sure I'll be feeling better by then.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,900
I cannot believe you just did that.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,490
I really do have a cough.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,380
Oh. So you weren't lying.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,460
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup...

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,070
even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,260
Yes. Because I really do...
Hey.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,078
- I really do have a cough.
- You also have a little rash.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,450
I'm not sure
we should be kissing.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,750
Oh. It's okay. Because I have
almost no interest in kissing you.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,940
- Perfect.
- Good.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,810
Oh, baby.

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,060
Oh, Brandon.

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,900
Brandon.

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,100
I know I'm good, but come on.

22
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,060
Brandon?

23
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,440
Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,560
Brandon! Brandon!

25
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,420
<i>Any additional R.N. to Surgical.</i>

26
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,340
Why do you want me to treat this guy?

27
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,090
Blood pressure's not responding
to I.V. fluids.

28
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,020
No, no. I didn't ask how you plan to
con me into treating him.

29
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,960
I asked you why
you want me to treat him.

30
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,440
He's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.

31
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,170
There are about a billion sick people
on the planet. Why this one?

32
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,100
Because this one's in our emergency room.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
Ah, so it's a proximity issue.

34
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,300
If somebody was sick in the third-floor
stairwell, that's who'd we be talking about.

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,520
Yes. I checked the stairwell.
It's clear.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,050
Okay, then.
Emergency room guy it is.

37
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,190
Wait. Why was that so easy?

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
You know why.

39
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,540
Blood pressure's not
responding to I.V. fluids?

40
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Yeah.

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,460
That's just weird.

42
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,840
C.B.C. was unremarkable.
Abdominal C.T. scan didn't show anything.

43
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,570
So, people, differential diagnosis.
What's wrong with her?

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
- Him.
- Him. Her. Does it matter?

45
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,520
Does anyone think
it's a testicular problem?

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,210
No. So, Chase?

47
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,420
- Yersinia infection?
- No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.

48
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,110
What about arthritis? Accompanying
vasculitis causes nerve damage...

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,720
No. It wouldn't cause the blood
pressure problems. Allergy?

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
The kid's got abdominal pain.

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,500
- Maybe carcinoid?
- No. But then you wouldn't get the...

52
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,230
Foreman, if you're going to
list all the things it's not,

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,120
it might be quicker
to do it alphabetically.

54
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,900
Let's see, now. "Absidia". Excellent.
Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

55
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,230
No condition accounts
for all these symptoms.

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh, good.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,190
Because I thought maybe he was sick.
But, apparently, he's not.

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,060
Who wants to do up
the discharge papers?

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay. Unless we control
the blood pressure,

60
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,130
he's gonna start circling the drain before
we can figure out what's wrong with him.

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Treat him for sepsis,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,810
and I want a Cort-stim test
and an echocardiogram.

63
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,540
- You alright?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,130
The Cort-stim test will
tell us if your pituitary

65
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,860
and adrenal glands are
working properly.

66
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,140
- His glands? What does that mean?
- We have a few theories we're working on.

67
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,454
You mean you don't know.

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,660
Mindy.

69
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,490
I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't
be testing you, they'd be treating you.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,270
Yeah, well, that's the way it works.

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,140
First we find out what it is,
then we get you better.

72
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,490
- You're half an hour late.
- Busy caseload.

73
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,101
One case is not a load.

74
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,140
So how are we doing on
cotton swabs today?

75
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,690
If there's an acute shortage,
I could run home...

76
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,700
No, you couldn't.

77
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,100
Nice.

78
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,140
Hello, sick people
and their loved ones.

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,430
In the interest of saving
time and avoiding a lot

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,970
of boring chitchat later,
I'm Dr. Gregory House.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,170
You can call me Greg. I'm one of three
doctors staffing this clinic this morning.

82
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,630
Short. Sweet. Grab a file.

83
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,430
This ray of sunshine
is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,290
Dr. Cuddy runs this
whole hospital, so,

85
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,340
unfortunately, she's much
too busy to deal with you.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,860
I am a board-certified diagnostician,

87
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,260
with a double specialty of
infectious disease and nephrology.

88
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,270
I'm also the only doctor
currently employed at this

89
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,340
clinic who is forced to
be here against his will.

90
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,940
That is true, isn't it? But not to worry.

91
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,710
Because for most of you, this job could be
done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,880
Speaking of which, if you're particularly
annoying, you may see me reach for this.

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,380
This is Vicodin. It's mine.
You can't have any.

94
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,320
And, no, I do not have a pain management
problem. I have a pain problem.

95
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,501
But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

96
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,711
So, who wants me?

97
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,260
And who would rather wait
for one of the other two guys?

98
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,900
Okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room One
if you change your mind.

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,640
Jodi Matthews?

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,340
Please accompany Dr. House
to Exam Room One.

101
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Dr. Chase.

102
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,670
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend
is the best medicine for him right now.

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,460
I know. I get stupid when I'm scared.

104
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,070
Don't go rock climbing.

105
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,160
Look, I was wondering.
Before this happened, we were having sex.

106
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,740
What? You're wondering if
whatever he has, you might've gotten it?

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,940
It's unlikely.
We ran a complete S.T.D. panel, so...

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,460
No. I'm wondering if maybe
I did this to him. I was kind of rough.

109
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,680
It was yellow.

110
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,260
It was?

111
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
It's not anymore.

112
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,580
Well, that's a shame.

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,180
I thought that might be a problem,
so I brought you this.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,770
Your mucus was "pale goldenrod".

115
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,290
Last week, yes. Should I be worried?

116
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,840
Oh, yes. Very.

117
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,120
Really?
I thought it was okay now.

118
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,010
And yet, here you are.
What happened?

119
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,580
Paramedics took a week
to respond to your 911 call?

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,550
You're not a very nice doctor,
are you?

121
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,350
And you are very bad at
whatever it is you do.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,720
- You don't even know me.
- I know you're gonna get fired.

123
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,660
That's why you got the new glasses.
That's why your teeth are sparkly white.

124
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,940
You're getting the most of
your health insurance while you still can.

125
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,420
I might be quitting.

126
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,570
If you were quitting, you'd
have known that last week when

127
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,180
your snot was still pale goldenrod.
You're getting fired.

128
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,540
I just don't like being told what to do.

129
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,220
I can get you in
for a full body scan later this week.

130
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Thanks.

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,390
It's got to be viral.
We should start running gels and titers.

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,360
Maybe we should
look into the girlfriend's theory.

133
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,830
She thinks she rode him to death.

134
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
What'd you tell her?

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,970
I told her 22-year-old men
don't die of sex.

136
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,970
- What'd you ask her?
- What do you mean?

137
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,700
I mean, I hope you got some specifics
on exactly what was going on.

138
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,160
If the girl thinks it could kill you,
it's worth knowing about.

139
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,410
Have you ever taken a life?

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,990
We should stop the antibiotics.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,960
It's too soon to say
they're not having an effect.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,388
They're having an effect.

143
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,600
His B.P.'s falling fast.
There's fluid filling his lungs.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,420
His creatinine is rising.

145
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,300
His kidneys are shutting down.

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,520
Our treatment isn't making him better.

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's killing him.

148
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
So, we had six symptoms
that didn't add up

149
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,790
to anything. Now we got seven.
Who's excited?

150
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,630
I don't think it complicates things. The
kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.

151
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,140
Maybe.

152
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,280
Typically, low blood pressure and
abdominal pain means an infection.

153
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,510
An abdominal infection causes sepsis,
low blood pressure.

154
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,810
Except we checked for
abdominal infections.

155
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,090
I know. But what if it's
the other way around? What if the

156
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,040
low blood pressure's causing
the abdominal pain?

157
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,710
Viral heart infection. The
intestines aren't getting

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
enough blood, and the
result is belly pain.

159
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,860
I know it's not the
standard presentation.

160
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,330
It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.

161
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,580
I thought that's what we dealt with here.

162
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,380
It explains the cardiomyopathy, the pain,
the low B.P., the fever.

163
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,041
You read the book.

164
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,460
Impressive.

165
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,270
It's a ludicrously long shot
that explains every one of

166
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,660
those symptoms, except for
the cough and the rash.

167
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,710
- Should we just erase those?
- Well, anything can cause a rash.

168
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,933
Okay. Cardiac infection.

169
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,228
Cameron, you thought allergy.

170
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,775
Chase, what was it you thought?
Carcinoid?

171
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:15,660
Then there's hypothyroidism.

172
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,130
Could be parasites.

173
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,370
Finally, sinus infection.

174
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,670
If you're gonna list all the things it
can't be, you're gonna need more colors.

175
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,080
Cameron was right.
No condition explains all these symptoms.

176
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,780
- But orange and green covers everything.
- Orange and green?

177
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,090
Two conditions contracted simultaneously?

178
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,450
Occam's Razor. The simplest
explanation is always the best.

179
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,811
- And you think one is simpler than two?
- Pretty sure it is, yeah.

180
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,370
Baby shows up. Chase tells you that two
people exchanged fluids to create this being.

181
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,220
I tell you that one stork
dropped the little tyke off

182
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,070
in a diaper. Are you gonna
go with the two or the one?

183
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,033
- I think your argument is specious.
- I think your tie is ugly.

184
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,840
Why is one simpler than two?
It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,390
Each one of these conditions
is about a thousand-to-one shot.

186
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,630
That means that any two of them happening
at the same time is a million-to-one shot.

187
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Chase says the cardiac infection
is a 10 million-to-1 shot,

188
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,520
which makes my idea
10 times better than yours.

189
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,890
Get a calculator. Run the numbers.

190
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,810
- We'll run the tests.
- Tests take time.

191
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,560
Treatment's quicker. Start the kid
on Unasyn for the sinus infection,

192
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,460
- and, what was orange?
- Hypothyroidism.

193
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
- My uncle has hypothyroidism.
- Not like this.

194
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,630
Intravenous Levothyroxin
is an artificial

195
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,480
thyroid medication that
should take care of it.

196
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,030
Also, the nurses are going to start you on
Unasyn. It's a more targeted antibiotic.

197
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,750
- For the sinus infection?
- Yes.

198
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,910
The other stuff is for
something else entirely.

199
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Bad luck, huh?

200
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,980
Don't worry. He should be
back to ditching work in no time.

201
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Brandon?

202
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Hey, Mom.

203
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,610
We're his parents.
How's he doing?

204
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,530
Um, Brandon is...

205
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,103
Mom. Dad...
This is Mindy.

206
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,180
I was gonna bring her home for Christmas.

207
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
We're engaged.

208
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,620
<i>Dr. Hall to the recovery room.
Dr. Hall...</i>

209
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,370
Did you tell the family House's theory?

210
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,500
Two odd conditions striking completely
coincidentally at the exact same time?

211
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,490
- I didn't phrase it quite that way.
- They agree to treatment?

212
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course they did. We're doctors.
They believe whatever we tell them.

213
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,720
So, is that our job?
House's puppets?

214
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,550
He comes up with an insane idea,
we get to pretend it's not?

215
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,850
His insane ideas are usually right.
We've been here long enough to...

216
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,020
We've been here long enough
to have Stockholm syndrome.

217
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,026
What, because we don't hate him? He
thinks outside the box. Is that so evil?

218
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,200
He has no idea where the box is.

219
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,280
If you guys think he's right, go home. Relax.
Just wait for the kid to get all better.

220
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm going to the lab
to test for viral infections.

221
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,180
Negative for Coxsackie "B" virus.

222
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,719
Seven down, about 5,000 to go.

223
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,890
You really think we're gonna
come up with your mystery

224
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,980
virus just by running gels
till we guess it right?

225
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,062
No. I think we're gonna do it by standing
around watching other people work.

226
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,065
I'm waiting for
the Epstein-Barr virus.

227
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,531
- She's weird, isn't she?
- Bad idea.

228
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,790
- What?
- Bad idea. You work with her.

229
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
What did I say?

230
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,666
Is weird some new ghetto euphemism for
sexy, like bad is good and phat is good?

231
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,980
- Then what the hell does "good" mean?
- "Ghetto euphemism"?

232
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,006
You don't think she's hot?

233
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
No.

234
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,510
Wow. Then you're brilliant.
And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.

235
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,040
Obviously, the girl is hot.
You're not talking about her aesthetics.

236
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,936
You're talking about
if I want to jump her. I don't.

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Brilliant.

238
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,070
Your Epstein-Barr is ready.

239
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,640
- What are you doing?
- Level four.

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,270
- No, no. I mean...
- I know what you meant. We're waiting.

241
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,001
- My throat hurts.
- So you said.

242
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,600
How long are we waiting?

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,464
Two minutes less
than when you asked me two minutes ago.

244
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Hi.

245
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,013
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.

246
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:57,476
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult.
His throat seems to have some condition.

247
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,439
- Say "Ah".
- Ah.

248
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,361
He has a sore throat.

249
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,740
Of course. Yes, why didn't I...

250
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,120
I mean, because he said that it hurt, and I
should have deduced that meant it was sore.

251
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,330
- I was in a board meeting.
- Patients come first, right?

252
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,250
Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if
there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?

253
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,377
You once asked me why
I think I'm always right,

254
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,660
and I realized that you're right.

255
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,280
At least, I think you're right.
I don't really know, now do I?

256
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,971
- Hey. I'm here.
- Go home. Drink some hot tea.

257
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,140
Excellent counsel.

258
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,231
Negative on parvovirus B-19.

259
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm impressed.

260
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,860
Thank you.
I was born to run gels.

261
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,697
- I meant about Chase.
- What about Chase?

262
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,050
Well, the man has no
physical interest in you.

263
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,590
He has a completely
professional relationship with

264
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,120
you, respects you as a
colleague and a doctor.

265
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,084
And yet, he can't look at you
without thinking sex.

266
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,590
Because I asked
what kind of sex could kill you?

267
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,757
You now have total control
over your relationship with him.

268
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,650
So, a woman can't express
her interest in sex

269
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,650
without it being some
professional power play?

270
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,557
No. If you look the way you do
and you say what you said,

271
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:21,020
you have to be aware of the effect
that it's going to have on men.

272
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,670
Men should grow up.

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,180
Yeah, and dogs should
stop licking themselves.

274
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,780
- It's not gonna happen.
- What's going on?

275
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,650
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you guys.

276
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,072
- Why didn't you page us?
- 'Cause I knew you'd be here.

277
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,020
- Did you tell him?
- No one.

278
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,740
I assume you're trying to
prove my crazy, two-illness

279
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,030
theory wrong, so, obviously,
you're gonna be in the lab.

280
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,289
- You spin the urine?
- Not yet.

281
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,100
Talk to me when you have.

282
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,260
What'd you find out?

283
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,200
Kidney failure.
It's acute interstitial nephritis.

284
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,320
I wonder if that's significant.

285
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,180
It means the antibiotics
didn't cause the kidney failure.

286
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,780
How'd you know?

287
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,170
Well, if you guys hadn't been so
busy trying to prove me

288
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,060
wrong, you might've checked
in on the poor kid.

289
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,430
You visited a patient?

290
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,720
I was sitting by his bed all morning,

291
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,470
just so he'd know someone
was there for him.

292
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,430
I looked in on him.
He's much better.

293
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Ergo, the treatment's working.
Ergo, me right, you wrong.

294
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,560
Hey, I'm glad for the kid.

295
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,510
That smugness of yours really is
an attractive quality.

296
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Thank you.

297
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,850
It was either that or get my hair
highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.

298
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,010
I get that you're not a big believer in
the "catching flies with honey" approach,

299
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,510
but do you honestly think you'll collect
a jarful by cleverly taunting them?

300
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,470
Flies, no. Doctors, sure.
If I'd said to Foreman,

301
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,830
"Nice try. It was a great guess,
but sorry, not this time"

302
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,120
what do you think
he'd be doing right now?

303
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,990
I think he'd go home not feeling
like a piece of crap.

304
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,000
Exactly.

305
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,800
- You want him to feel like a piece of crap?
- No. I don't want him going home.

306
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Dr. Foreman.

307
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,240
- Still have the cough.
- I'm feeling a lot better though.

308
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,207
His fever is gone.
His rash is going away.

309
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,060
- I see.
- Is everything okay?

310
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,360
Just ordering some tests.
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
How much longer?

312
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,571
9:30. I figure she was on the
eighth hole when I paged her.

313
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,980
You probably got another half hour.

314
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,460
I ran a T.S.H., T3 and T4. The
patient's negative for hypothyroidism.

315
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,290
I'm not talking about you.

316
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,230
Well, the fact that he's getting better would
indicate the unreliability of the tests.

317
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,370
If I'm right and it's a viral infection,
one of two things always happen:

318
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,220
The patient dies, or the patient's
immune system fights off the invader.

319
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
What's with her?

320
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,550
Her leg hurts after running six miles.
Who knows? Could be anything.

321
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,730
He's getting better. That
doesn't prove you're right.

322
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,525
That just proves
he's getting better.

323
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,220
It's not two illnesses.
It can't be two illnesses.

324
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,783
I am so glad you work here.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,630
If I'm right,
the antibiotics you prescribed...

326
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,030
could box his kidneys and liver, impeding
his ability to fight off the virus.

327
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,860
- It could kill him.
- Well, that certainly would be a concern.

328
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Fifty bucks?

329
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,800
Don't look away. The space
monkeys will be all over you.

330
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,530
- You wanna bet on the patient's health?
- You think that's bad luck?

331
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,598
You think that God will smite him
because of our insensitivity?

332
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,643
Well, if God does,
you make a quick 50.

333
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,070
Go check his white blood count.

334
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,940
If he's fighting off a virus
like you think, it'll be way up.

335
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,911
Hey. Cuddy said you needed
a consult. What's up? I'm busy.

336
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,266
- I was just being glib.
- You haven't said anything.

337
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
No.

338
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,160
Before, when I was talking about Brandon's
girlfriend thinking sex could kill you.

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,340
I was just making a joke
because I was uncomfortable.

340
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,310
Oh, I don't even remember what you said.

341
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,069
I'm uncomfortable about sex.

342
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,680
- Well, we don't have to talk about this.
- Sex could kill you.

343
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,100
Do you know what the human body
goes through when you have sex?

344
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,330
Pupils dilate. Arteries constrict.

345
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,240
Core temperature rises, heart races,
blood pressure skyrockets.

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,910
Respiration becomes rapid and shallow.

347
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,490
The brain fires bursts of electrical
impulses from nowhere to nowhere.

348
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,593
Secretions spit out of every gland,

349
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,972
and the muscles tense and spasm like you're
lifting three times your body weight.

350
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,740
It's violent, it's ugly,
and it's messy.

351
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,080
And if God hadn't made it unbelievably fun,
the human race would've died out eons ago.

352
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,540
Men are lucky
they can only have one orgasm.

353
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
You know that women
can have an hour-long orgasm?

354
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,911
Hey, Foreman. What's up?

355
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,380
- Hey, Foreman.
- Hey.

356
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,060
- White cell count isn't up, is it?
- No. We were both wrong.

357
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,800
White cell count is down,
way down and dropping.

358
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,800
His immune system is shot.
We need to get him into a clean room.

359
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,520
Can you walk, Brandon?

360
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
Yeah. A little.

361
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,880
Okay. 'Cause we'll need to
leave the chair outside. Thank you.

362
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,000
Where's April? April?

363
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,450
Can you take that chair, please?

364
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,560
- Thank you.
- Yes, Robert.

365
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,280
I'll need to take your, um,
your mask and your robe too.

366
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,338
You might wanna block your ears
for this, it's quite loud.

367
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,020
Something's made him
immuno-compromised.

368
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,340
His white blood cell count is down, which
means his body can't fight off infections.

369
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,060
- If he gets sick, he'll die.
- Sick? How sick?

370
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,280
If he gets a cold, he'll die.

371
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Okay. I'm gonna push the needle into your
hip bone and take some of the marrow.

372
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,100
That's not so bad.

373
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,790
That was just the anesthetic.

374
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,140
The core biopsy needle,
it's a bit bigger.

375
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,120
Hey, man. Take a deep breath.
This is gonna hurt, a lot.

376
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
Your marrow makes the blood cells.

377
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
We take a peek at it
under a microscope,

378
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,200
and maybe we find a viral infection.

379
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,120
Maybe we find some fibrosis.

380
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,660
Something to explain why
your blood count is so low.

381
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
There we go.

382
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,095
One step closer to an answer.

383
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,320
What if you don't find one,

384
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,860
I can't stay here forever.

385
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,573
- The patient could've died.
- The one with the pulled muscle?

386
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,960
Those symptoms are consistent
with a dozen other conditions.

387
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,550
- You know, I'm entitled to a consult.
- You are not getting out of clinic duty.

388
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,730
Come on. You got a hundred other
idiot doctors in this building who go...

389
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,610
all warm and fuzzy every
time they pull a toy

390
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,290
car out of a nose...
you don't need me here.

391
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,080
No, I don't. But working with people
actually makes you a better doctor.

392
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,470
When did I sign up for that course?

393
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
When did I give you
the impression that I care?

394
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,360
Working in this clinic obviously instills
a deep sense of compassion.

395
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,940
I've got your home number, right? In case
anything comes up at 3:00 in the morning.

396
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,570
It's not gonna work.
You know why?

397
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,151
Because this is fun.

398
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,960
You think of something
to make me miserable.

399
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,810
I think of something to
make you miserable...

400
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,540
It's a game, and I'm gonna win because I got
a head start. You are already miserable.

401
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,180
Is this important?

402
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
No. Good.

403
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,270
- What's with you and her?
- Don't.

404
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,200
You have a thing for her?
The only people who can get to you...

405
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,740
No. There is not a thin line
between love and hate.

406
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,930
There is, in fact, a Great
Wall of China, with armed

407
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,680
sentries posted every 20
feet between love and hate.

408
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,550
- Thirty-six Vicodin.
- Who's the patient?

409
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,150
- I am.
- You can't...

410
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,190
Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician.

411
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Yeah.

412
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,540
You will lie, cheat and
steal to get what you want,

413
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,390
but you're incapable of
kissing a little ass?

414
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,770
We all have our limitations.

415
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,780
House?

416
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,680
Wrong bottle. Do me a favor.

417
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,300
Take one of these, wait
five minutes for it to kick in,

418
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,500
then find
Cuddy and kiss her ass.

419
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,940
What was the kid's first symptom?

420
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,520
You did the history. Of his 800
symptoms, which one hit him first?

421
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
The cough.

422
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,670
Gout.

423
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,000
Are we talking about Brandon?

424
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,900
Gout?

425
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,860
Uric acid crystals in the joints?

426
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,350
The symptoms are pain,
swelling, redness,

427
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,050
stiffness. Not one of which
do I see on that board.

428
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,613
Because he doesn't have gout.

429
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,161
Every day, cells die.

430
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,459
We survive because the remaining cells
divide and replace the losses.

431
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,710
The colchicine, a gout medicine,
blocks mitosis and stops cell division,

432
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,350
which will result in
abdominal pain, rash,

433
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,690
nausea, fever, kidney failure,
low blood pressure...

434
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,477
and will also mess with the bone marrow.

435
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:13,010
But he doesn't have gout.
Why would he have gout medication?

436
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,320
Because you guys were right.

437
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,950
He didn't have
two conditions at the exact same time.

438
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,445
First, he got a cough. And because
he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.

439
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:24,460
In order to justify charging $200, that
doctor felt he should actually do something.

440
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,660
Oops. He wrote a prescription.

441
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,500
7,000 people die each year
from pharmacy screw ups.

442
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,020
Not nearly as many as die
from doctor screw ups,

443
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,720
but still, not something
they use in their promotional materials.

444
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,130
The pharmacist gave him
gout medicine instead of cough medicine.

445
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,216
And the only thing it wouldn't do,

446
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,100
it would do absolutely nothing
to relieve his cough.

447
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Occam's Razor...

448
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,350
the simplest explanation is
almost always that somebody screwed up.

449
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,438
But once he checked into this hospital,
he was completely in our control.

450
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,760
Our food, our pills, our everything.

451
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,310
So even if you're right,
no more gout medication.

452
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,780
He'd either continue to deteriorate,
or he would've gotten better.

453
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,180
But he got better,
and then he got worse.

454
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,202
It doesn't fit.
It doesn't make sense.

455
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:11,538
Okay. Two people screwed up.

456
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,541
Not as simple as one, but...

457
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,120
- He's resting. He's...
- I'm Dr. House.

458
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,960
- I'm your son's physician.
- Oh. You're the one we haven't met yet.

459
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,420
You're the one he hasn't met. How can
you treat someone without meeting them?

460
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,180
It's easy if you don't
give a crap about him.

461
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
That's a good thing.

462
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:45,420
If emotions made you act rationally, well,
they wouldn't be called emotions, right?

463
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,158
That's why we have this nice division of
labor. You hold his hand, I get him better.

464
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,250
If I start tucking him in at night,
well, that's not fair to you guys.

465
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,060
And if you start prescribing medicine,
well, that's not fair to me.

466
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,700
So, what I wanna know is,
who stepped on my side of the net?

467
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,007
Who cared enough to get stupid enough
to give him his cough medicine?

468
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,370
When we checked in, Dr. Foreman...

469
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,679
Tuesday, he's getting better.
Wednesday, he's getting sick again.

470
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,420
Somebody gave him
his cough medicine Wednesday.

471
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,148
Come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.

472
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,568
I just wanna know
who tried to kill the kid.

473
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,993
- Dr. House, maybe we should...
- His throat was sore.

474
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,790
Page Dr. Occam.
He's gonna wanna hear about this.

475
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm sorry.

476
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,070
He was coughing,
and I just wanted to help him...

477
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,560
Aren't you a dear.

478
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,530
Where are the pills? He took the last of'em
before he was switched into that room.

479
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,860
- They're all gone?
- It was just cough medicine.

480
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,054
No, it wasn't.
Where's the bottle?

481
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,100
We need to know
exactly what you put in this bottle.

482
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,020
We think it was colchicine,
a gout medication.

483
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,280
If the prescription said cough medicine,
that's what I dispensed.

484
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,740
The family is prepared
to waive liability, alright?

485
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,407
We just need to know what it was,

486
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:14,077
- ...what dosage it was.
- It was cough medicine.

487
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Refill it.

488
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,210
- He's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that.

489
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,507
Does Brandon like
that quality in you?

490
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,700
You're a little negative.

491
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,420
- Things don't always work out for the best.
- Doesn't hurt to hope they do.

492
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,970
No. Not unless that makes
you figure you can do

493
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,640
whatever you want, like
give people cough medicine.

494
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,460
- This is cough medication.
- This is what Brandon was supposed to get.

495
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,600
They're small, round and yellow.

496
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,220
Can you tell this man
what the pills in your

497
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,450
son's medicine bottle
actually looked like?

498
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,380
They were small, round and yellow,
exactly like this.

499
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,150
Those were the pills
that Brandon was taking.

500
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,080
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know
what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.

501
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,600
It was so perfect.
It was beautiful.

502
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,840
Beauty often seduces us
on the road to truth.

503
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,220
And triteness kicks us in the nads.

504
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,480
- So true.
- This doesn't bother you?

505
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,410
That you were wrong?
I try to work through the pain.

506
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,920
I was not wrong. Everything I said
was true. It fit. It was elegant.

507
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,940
- So, reality was wrong?
- Reality's almost always wrong.

508
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,336
The cough medicine did something.

509
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,360
Aggravated the condition.

510
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,260
It's all over the place.
Must be in his blood.

511
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,472
- What if it is his blood?
- Lymphoma?

512
00:33:57,472 --> 00:33:58,800
Unless you've got something better.

513
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,170
Well, we foolishly ruled out lymphoma
because his C.T. scan showed no adenopathy,

514
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,120
C.B.C. showed a normal
differen-smear, bone marrow showed no...

515
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Screw the tests.

516
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,151
Do an exploratory laparotomy
and find out what's in there.

517
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,650
He has no blood pressure, no immune system
and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.

518
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,140
Yeah, you're right.
Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.

519
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,140
I'll schedule him for surgery.

520
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,290
Okay, Brandon, we're running this tube
through your heart...

521
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,930
and into the pulmonary arteries
in your lungs.

522
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,010
The sensors will give us
information we need for

523
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,000
the exploratory surgery
later this afternoon.

524
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,200
- My fingers are numb.
- Try not to move.

525
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,860
We're in the right atrium, trying to catch
the flow through the tricuspid valve.

526
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,920
I think the catheter's curling
in the atrium.

527
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,600
Got it. We're in the R.V. now.

528
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Ectopy.

529
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,480
- You must've irritated the heart wall.
- It'll calm down.

530
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,230
He can't tolerate any cardiac
arrhythmia. Pull back.

531
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,450
He needs the surgery.

532
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Pressure's dropped.

533
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,640
- You still with us, Brandon?
- Get the curtains.

534
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
V.F.

535
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,035
Charging. Clear.

536
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,251
Sinus rhythm.

537
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,520
I got a pulse.

538
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah, but no surgery today.

539
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,394
- How're you doing?
- Okay.

540
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,438
Great. I'm doing good too.

541
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,580
I get to knock off an hour early today.
You know why?

542
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,700
Because I kissed my boss's ass.
Do you ever do that?

543
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,282
I think she just said yes 'cause
she wants to reinforce that behavior.

544
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:24,700
Wants me to kiss a lot of other people's
ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.

545
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,600
What would you want? A doctor who
holds your hand while you die,

546
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,830
or a doctor who ignores you
while you get better?

547
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,840
I guess it would...

548
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,922
particularly suck to have
a doctor who ignores you while you die.

549
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,468
- I should go.
- You think it's gonna come out on its own?

550
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,580
Are we talking
bigger than a breadbasket?

551
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,340
Because, actually,
it will come out on its own.

552
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,740
Which for small stuff is no problem.

553
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,530
It's wrapped up in a nice,
soft package, and plop.

554
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,560
Big stuff, you're gonna rip something,

555
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,970
which, speaking medically, is
when the fun stops.

556
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
How did you...

557
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,040
You've been here half an hour, you haven't
sat down. That tells me its location.

558
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,770
You haven't told me what it is.
That tells me it's humiliating.

559
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,570
You have a little birdie
carved on your arm.

560
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,870
That tells me you have a high
tolerance for humiliation.

561
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
So I figure it's not hemorrhoids.

562
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,710
I've been a doctor 20 years.
You're not gonna surprise me.

563
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,160
It's an MP3 player.

564
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,000
Is it because of the size,
or the shape,

565
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,800
or is it the pounding bass line?

566
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
What are we gonna do?

567
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,340
- I'm gonna wait.
- For what?

568
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,580
Okay. It's 3:00.
I'm off.

569
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,980
Would you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a patient
in Exam Room Two needs her attention?

570
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,800
And the R.I.A.A. wants her to check
for illegal downloads.

571
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,780
Brandon's not ready for surgery.

572
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,960
Okay.

573
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,780
Let's leave it a couple of weeks.
He should be feeling

574
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,290
better by then. Oh, wait.
Which way does time go?

575
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,380
He crashed during prep. He's also
experiencing pain in his fingers.

576
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,620
Think some bug
may have gotten in the clean room.

577
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,650
I think we should double
his dosage of G-CSF to

578
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,420
temporarily boost his
white blood cell count.

579
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,697
Pain in his fingers. Right.

580
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,750
- Hi again.
- He can't...

581
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Where's he going?

582
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,630
Hey. How you all doing?

583
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,850
Interesting fact. Every seven years, it's
a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?

584
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,222
- Dr. House, this is a clean room.
- Yeah. I read the sign.

585
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,560
But cells of different organs
reproduce at different rates.

586
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,700
So, you get a new kidney
every three years.

587
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,710
Get a new stomach lining every week.

588
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,850
This is why colchicine poisoning causes
all these symptoms, but not all at once.

589
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,940
But we went to the pharmacy.
We saw the pills.

590
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,070
Colchicine does its damage
in a very specific order.

591
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,420
First of all, there's the
pain in the abdomen,

592
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,510
the rash, the fever. Isn't
that what you got first?

593
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,420
Then the kidneys go,
which is exactly what happened to...

594
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,254
- Brandon.
- Right.

595
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,100
Then it screws up your bone marrow,
and then neuropathy.

596
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,970
Painful tingling
in the fingers and toes.

597
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,000
And what do you suppose
happens after that?

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,180
Hair loss. The bad news is...

599
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,020
- ...your special boy is doing drugs.
- No, he's not.

600
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,862
- Ecstasy?
- No.

601
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,992
- Twice with Dan and Mike.
- You know what they cut that stuff with?

602
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,640
Apparently, colchicine.
Unless you ingested the

603
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,670
colchicine through your
contact lens solution,

604
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,890
or skin cream
or some other drug you're lying about.

605
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,960
I don't know how it happened. I don't care
how it happened. It happened. Start,

606
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,440
- Brandon.
- Lovely name.

607
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,060
Start Brandon on FAB fragments, and get him
some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out.

608
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,980
And get some air in here.

609
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,950
Make a note.
I should never doubt myself.

610
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,790
I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't
hurt you to be wrong every now and then.

611
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,540
What, you don't care about
these people?

612
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,800
The colchicine interferes with the
ability of the heart muscle to contract,

613
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,710
pumping blood,
lowering your blood pressure.

614
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,440
The antibodies we're giving you
should neutralize the colchicine,

615
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,420
allowing your heart
to beat at its normal rate.

616
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
When will you know?

617
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
We know now.

618
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,180
Thank God.

619
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,470
Big weekend? It's not for me.
I'm fully stocked.

620
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,360
- Cuddy got you doing inventory?
- Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.

621
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,960
- The gout medicine O.D.?
- Yeah.

622
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,450
The fact that I know it's
a gout medicine O.D.

623
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,270
would seem to indicate the case
is already solved.

624
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Well, you'd be wrong.

625
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,010
What about the fact that
the kid is now...

626
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,950
I believe the technical term is
"not sick"?

627
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,380
You know how many forms
of colchicine there are on the market?

628
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,880
- Stop it.
- Neither do I. But it's a lot.

629
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,140
Pills, powders, liquids, I.V. Fluids.

630
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,370
Somewhere at a party, in his coffee,
up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.

631
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,350
So, you're not happy with
your Ecstasy theory?

632
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,750
- He said he used it twice.
- People lie.

633
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,070
- If you're gonna lie, it's...
- You know what? I'm not interested.

634
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,240
- Not curious?
- No. Because I'm well-adjusted.

635
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Right.

636
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,290
- Temperature's normal.
- I want cousin Sharon there.

637
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,250
If we invite Sharon,
we have to invite all the cousins.

638
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,110
So what? My side of the family
doesn't need anything.

639
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,060
I don't suppose I could have some of those
cough pills, huh? They're okay, right?

640
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,940
- Yes. You're doing great.
- You should invite Dr. House.

641
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,630
- Will he come?
- No. But he'll send a gift.

642
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,120
I'll make sure it's a good one.

643
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,800
There's a letter
on the back of these pills.

644
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,580
Your old pills
didn't have a letter on them?

645
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,874
No. Round and yellow,
but no letter.

646
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,400
Well, these will help your cough.

647
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,850
Hey, you wanna go get some...

648
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,016
No.
