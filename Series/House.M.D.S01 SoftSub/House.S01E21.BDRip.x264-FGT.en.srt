1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,679
He is not sick.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,489
Dr. Riley is throwing up.
he obviously can't lecture.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,410
You witnessed the spew, or
you just have his word for it?

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,470
I think I'm coming down
with a little bit of the clap.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,966
I may have to go home for a few days.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,639
Dr. Riley doesn't have
a history of lying to me.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,340
You said this is the fifth time
he's missed a class this year!

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,000
Either he's dying or he's lying.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,760
I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,129
Fine, I'll have Cameron do it.
She loves inspiring the inspired.

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,130
You'll do it.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,919
Why is it always me?

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,440
Because the world hates you.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,609
Or because it's a class on diagnostics.

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,220
Pick whatever reason
feeds your narcissism better.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,010
I'm not doing it.

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,459
You're supposed to stop me.
Renegotiate.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,440
And you were supposed
to keep on walking.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,840
Sorry, I guess we both screwed up.
Go on, do it again.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,099
I'll do the lecture for
four hours off clinic.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Two.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,479
I know you'd rather
spend a couple of hours

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,920
listening to yourself than
listening to patients.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,990
Class starts in twenty minutes.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,659
Dr. House, there's a patient.

26
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm outta here,
take it up with Cuddy.

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,710
Gregg.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,610
Hi, Stacy.

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,450
How're you doing?

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,010
How am I doing?

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,850
Well, the last five years have been like...

32
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,590
you ever see those
"Girls Gone Wild" videos?

33
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,730
Your life's been like that, or
your life's been spent watching them?

34
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,310
I have missed you.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,610
Is that why you're here?

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,510
I need your help.

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,510
Who am I looking at?

38
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,390
My husband.

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,280
Who is suffering abdominal pain
and fainting spells.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,650
No sign of tumors, no vasculitis.

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,220
Could be indigestion,
or maybe a kidney stone.

42
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,579
A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,610
Did you think I wasn't
going to get married?

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,960
Not to someone so poorly endowed.
This guy's pancreas is pathetic.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,980
There is no kidney stone,
no indigestion.

46
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,150
Three hospitals, five doctors,
not one of them found anything.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
Well, maybe there's
nothing to be found.

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,519
Right, you suddenly trust doctors,
love puppies and long walks in the rain.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,700
The walks are out.

50
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,870
I was around you long enough to know
when something's not right.

51
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,040
Mark's had personality changes,
he's acting strange, disconnected...

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Interesting.

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,920
It means there's either a neurological
component or he's having an affair.

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,990
No affair, no nothing!
He's sick!

55
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,850
I know you're not too busy.
you avoid work like the plague.

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,900
Unless it actually is the plague.

57
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm asking you a favor.

58
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm not too busy,

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,510
but I'm not sure I want him to live.

60
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,220
It's good seeing you again.

61
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,420
Three guys walk into a clinic.

62
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,020
Their legs hurt.
What's wrong with them?

63
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,380
I'm not going to like you, am I?

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,450
Most likely cause of leg
pain is muscle strain.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,950
Apply heat and rest affected areas.

66
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,480
Statistically, you're right. Very good.

67
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,189
My experience: Over
half of leg pain is

68
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,130
musculoskeletal, generally
from excessive exercise.

69
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,630
Twelve percent is varicose veins
brought on by pregnancy,

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,130
and most of the rest is
the result of vehicular accidents.

71
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,950
I said three people. That's six legs.

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,559
So, you've got three hurt jogging,

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,530
two in collisions, and one
of the legs is pregnant.

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,576
But what were they doing
when pain presented?

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,400
I have no idea.

76
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,569
You didn't ask?
You didn't take a history?

77
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,950
Of course, but all that told us was
what they said happened.

78
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,810
Person A, farmer,
says he was fixing a fence.

79
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,320
Tightness of the ankle,
loss of muscle control.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,700
Person B, volleyball practice.

81
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,700
Coach figured it was a pulled muscle.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,380
And C, we've got Carmen Electra. Golfing.

83
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,050
Yes!

84
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,300
Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?

85
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,000
The Baywatch thespian.

86
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,819
And no, I've gotta disguise
the identity of each of the patients

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,800
and I got tired of using
the middle-aged man.

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,300
Carmen seemed like
a pleasant alternative.

89
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,430
Also, she's apparently quite the golfer.

90
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,080
Now, in less than two hours,

91
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,559
one of these three will get
tossed out of the hospital

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,660
because they were faking it
to score narcotics,

93
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,820
and one will be very close to death.

94
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,530
Any guesses on which is which?

95
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,530
Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,180
Did you hike to the fence, and how far?

97
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes, it's about half a
mile from my farmhouse.

98
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,219
And where's the pain localized?

99
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,530
It started just above my ankle
and it's radiating up.

100
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,960
So, what should we do first?

101
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,310
Family history?

102
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,990
Indicative of leg pain?
That's a very short list.

103
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,420
Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis
imperfecta or multiple myeloma?

104
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,470
Could be a blood issue.

105
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,770
We should run a CBC and a D-dimer.

106
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,459
And get an MRI.

107
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,039
MRI or a PET scan?

108
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,339
If the problem's vascular,
he's better off...

109
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,720
Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing.

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,420
Patient's dead. You killed him.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,819
We had no time to run any tests.
there was nothing we could do!

112
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,420
You had time to look at the leg.

113
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,590
I thought we were starting
with the farmer's case first.

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
We are.

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,820
But if we're going to look at a leg...

116
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,330
I need you to take off your pants.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
Puncture.

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,380
Snakebite.

119
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,859
That would be my guess.

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,449
Farmer didn't know
he had been bit by a snake?

121
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,450
That's what he said.

122
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,930
Sudden shooting pain,
tall grass, never saw a thing.

123
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,250
What kind of snake?

124
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,909
You want me to tell you
what kind of snake it

125
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,550
was from the shape of
the hole in the leg?

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,429
How are we supposed to know
what kind of antivenin

127
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,076
to use if we don't know
what kind of snake it is?

128
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh, there are people
to find those things out.

129
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,300
Shouldn't we wait for
the Humane Society or something?

130
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,330
The guy might only
have a couple of hours.

131
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,390
And while we wait for
the Humane Society to show up,

132
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,080
what say we check up
on the volleyball player?

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,810
You have tendonitis.

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,730
How old is this person?

135
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,950
I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old man
on a girls' volleyball team, right?

136
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,120
It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
Well, I was just worried that...

138
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,670
Would you worry about her more
if she was younger?

139
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,989
Obviously we should care about
our patients no matter what age...

140
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,290
Yeah, right. I saw the way
you were looking at Carmen.

141
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,990
She's mine, stay away.

142
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,990
Would you operate on your mother?

143
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,950
Of course not. I'd be too nervous.
couldn't be objective.

144
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,140
Then why are you so anxious to treat
every patient like they're family?

145
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,160
The actual patient is 16.

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,110
Here's what happens
when doctors care to much.

147
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,090
I need to know everything about you.

148
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,099
I went back three generations:
No history of cancer, Parkinson's,

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,610
or any other degenerative condition.

150
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,279
But there's this boy at school, and
he's on the boys' volleyball team,

151
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,389
and they made out at a party,
and now he won't call her back,

152
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,470
and this friend of hers at school said
this boy didn't like her and never did.

153
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,400
You got all this from
an examination of the knee?

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,609
I think she's depressed.

155
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,609
- She doesn't have tendoni?
- She has tendonitis.

156
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,639
She's depressed about having tendonitis.

157
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,819
She's depressed for
the same reason she has tendonitis.

158
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,290
Not the boy.

159
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,040
No, the boy's a jerk, she knows that,
and yet she's depressed.

160
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,730
I found a nodule.

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,539
Ah. Problems with the thyroid
gland causes depressed

162
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,430
mental state, can cause
inflammation of the tendons.

163
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
I'll run the tests.

164
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,730
So, because she took
such an extreme interest,

165
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,359
she found out
the person had a thyroid condition.

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,770
No, because she took such an interest
she discovered a tiny nodule.

167
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,829
Which, in reality, signified nothing,
but gave us no choice

168
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,160
but to put a person with tendonitis
through an expensive and painful test.

169
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,650
Here's how a well-adjusted
doctor handles a case.

170
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,990
Can I put my pants back on now?

171
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,740
I'd rather you didn't.

172
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,690
Which Carmen Electra is this?

173
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,580
First one. The golfer.

174
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,060
Then why isn't she wearing pants?

175
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,380
You have decreased reflexes
in your patellar tendon. Anyone?

176
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
Slipped disc?

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,210
Could be. How bad does it hurt?

178
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,370
It hurts really, really bad.

179
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,180
Yeah?

180
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,550
It doesn't seem real.
Is she the one faking?

181
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,080
Oh, for God's sake.

182
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:59,230
She's here to play out my fantasy,
not because she's Meryl Streep.

183
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,250
Fine.

184
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,090
What the hell is wrong with me?

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,730
Do something!

186
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,450
Too much pain
to be a slipped disc.

187
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,479
Could be herniated and
impinging the nerve root.

188
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,800
Or it could be
referred pain from his groin.

189
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,910
Sir, are you getting pain
anywhere else?

190
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,640
He's curling. It's not the back.

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,699
- Sir, where are you getting pain?
- Help me!

192
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,340
He's not going to tell us anything
if we don't get him out of pain.

193
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,189
Give him 50mg of Demerol.

194
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,940
We have no history,
he could be allergic.

195
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,260
What do I do?

196
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,889
We can't diagnose him
while he screams.

197
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,850
Better than killing him
with pain killers, then...

198
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,470
Apparently, he's not allergic.

199
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,270
Thank you, I feel a lot better now.

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,620
We screwed up.

201
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,160
No, you did exactly
what his attending did.

202
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,250
And that was the proper way
to handle the case?

203
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:02,850
Yeah.

204
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,350
The guy used him as a dealer!

205
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,640
You're going to see a lot of
drug-seeking behavior in your practice,

206
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,830
and there's a reason: It works.

207
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,630
Meanwhile, back on the farm...

208
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

209
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,750
Four vials of the CroFab antivenin.

210
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Hey, how you doing?

211
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,710
All right.

212
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,790
Thank you.

213
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,420
This will start making you
feel better really fast.

214
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,200
He's having an allergic reaction, bag.

215
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,090
Paddles and epi.

216
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,731
- But his heart's fine.
- It's not going to stay that way.

217
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,460
Paddles!

218
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,540
What say we take five?
Get some coffee, go pee.

219
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,070
You didn't think
she was going to get married?

220
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,560
She asked me the same question.

221
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,800
And... what?
You're not gonna treat him?

222
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,190
There's probably nothing wrong with him.

223
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,860
Oh, sure, that makes sense.

224
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,210
She's just using the old
"sick husband" routine

225
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,350
as an excuse to get
back in touch with you.

226
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
You think this is easy for her?

227
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,110
The only reason she'd be anywhere near you
was if she was desperate.

228
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,260
So I should help her
because she hates me.

229
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,910
She doesn't hate you.

230
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,740
She loves you, she just...

231
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,260
can't... stand to be around you.

232
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,340
Dr. House?
It's been almost six minutes.

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Found him.

234
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,780
The volleyball player

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,739
was responding to the anti-inflammatories

236
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,990
as you'd expect in a case of tendonitis.

237
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,179
What about the snakebite guy?

238
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,280
I don't really care
about the volleyball player.

239
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,110
What if I told you the volleyball player
had a sudden massive stroke?

240
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,300
Really?

241
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,500
No. But that would make
you interested, right?

242
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,940
What if her T4 came back low?

243
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,929
It's not quite as interesting,
but it has the benefit of being true.

244
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,270
You said the thyroid biopsy
was a wasted test.

245
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,950
No, I didn't.

246
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,409
I said she put a person with tendonitis
through an expensive and painful test.

247
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,560
Apparently the patient had
tendonitis and a thyroid condition.

248
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,396
We're going to start you on Thyroxin.

249
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,310
It'll make you feel better
and level your moods.

250
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,110
Thank you.

251
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,620
So, that's it?

252
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,570
You were right the first time.

253
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,820
Snakebite guy's way more interesting.

254
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,960
Gross, actually.

255
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,470
The patient responded to epinephrine
and the allergic reaction was arrested.

256
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,450
Unfortunately, the patient
continues to deteriorate.

257
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,100
Maybe the snake wrangler was
wrong about the type he caught.

258
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,570
He faxed us the venom tests
which confirmed it's a timber rattlesnake.

259
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,050
No, it's not. Notice the volume?

260
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,259
I skimmed over that and the
gender and the coloring

261
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,940
and skipped right to
the name of the snake.

262
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,330
200mg.

263
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,250
Our guy got bit less than four hours ago.

264
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,510
There's no way a snake regenerates
that much venom that quickly.

265
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,090
We're supposed to know
how fast snakes make their venom?

266
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,130
Nope.

267
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,160
Unless you've got a patient bit by one.
Then it might be helpful.

268
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
So what do we do now?

269
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,310
He must have been bitten
by a different snake.

270
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,999
We go back and find it.

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,009
Or you go online and find there's only three
poisonous snakes common in New Jersey:

272
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,210
The copperhead, the timber
rattler, and the coral.

273
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,430
The copperhead and the timber rattler both
respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.

274
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,700
So we give him the antivenin
for the other one.

275
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,250
Is that a question?

276
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:17,411
Well, we can't just blindly
give him another antivenin.

277
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,416
Especially after the first
one almost killed him.

278
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,890
You said only three types of poisonous
snakes commonly found in New Jersey.

279
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,900
But what if this is an uncommon one?

280
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,580
Pretty good.

281
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:27,729
We've gotta find the right snake.

282
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,059
No need. Odds are, by the
time you get back the autopsy

283
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,829
results will tell you what
kind of snake it was.

284
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,410
But you said...

285
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,360
So we do give him
the antivenin for the other one.

286
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,409
Again, was that a question?
I asked what you would do.

287
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,880
It seems unfair for you
to ask me what you would do.

288
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,810
Who gives the guy the other antivenin?

289
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,370
And who goes looking for the snake?

290
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,749
I assume that one choice kills him
and one saves him.

291
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,530
That's usually the way it works
at the leg turning black stage.

292
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,700
So half of us killed him
and half of us saved his life.

293
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Yeah.

294
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,990
But we can't be blamed for...

295
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,439
I'm sure this goes against
everything you've been taught,

296
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,810
but right and wrong do exist.

297
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,740
Just because you don't know
what the right answer is...

298
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,119
maybe there's even no way you
could know what the right answer is...

299
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,210
doesn't make your
answer right or even okay.

300
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,860
It's much simpler than that.
It's just plain wrong.

301
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,460
We gave the guy the antivenin.

302
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,430
What if I'm allergic again?

303
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,470
That's why these people are here.

304
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,179
If you have a reaction, we're
ready to do whatever's necessary

305
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,080
to ensure your airway stays open
and your heart keeps beating.

306
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,710
My wife's on her way in,
can't this wait?

307
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,420
I'm sorry, it can't.

308
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
It hurts again.

309
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,290
He came back?

310
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,920
On average, drug addicts are stupid.

311
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,700
I'd call the cops.

312
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Good for you.

313
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,920
A lot of doctors wouldn't
risk their careers on a hunch.

314
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,210
It's not a hunch, I mean,
I know he wants drugs.

315
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,500
I believe drug addicts get sick.

316
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,870
Actually, for some reason they tend to get
sick more often than non-drug addicts.

317
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,080
Luckily, you don't have to play your hunch,
there's a faster way.

318
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,330
Actually, there are several.
My preference is urine testing.

319
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,520
But you already know
he has drugs in his system.

320
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,630
That's not what I'm testing for.

321
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,240
We're going to put this hard, rubber tube
up your urethra and into your bladder.

322
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,970
It might be a little uncomfortable.

323
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,300
Shouldn't I be getting
some kind of anesthetic?

324
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,420
We're concerned about
allergic reactions today.

325
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,540
If the guy can handle a rod in his penis
for half an hour, he's really sick.

326
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,790
Or he's really jonesing.

327
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,130
There's easier ways to get a hold of drugs.
Other hospitals, for example.

328
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,550
The volleyball player is not
responding to treatment.

329
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,830
At least we think it's not working
on account of the fact she's getting worse.

330
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,900
Can you still hear me?

331
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:37,960
No.

332
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,210
A little.

333
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,590
Not really!

334
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,900
Well, if you can't hear me,
how do you know what I asked?

335
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,310
I'm sorry. What did I do?

336
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,249
I don't know. It really hurts!

337
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,230
I promise to be very careful.

338
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,850
Susan!

339
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,850
Not her real name!

340
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,270
Susan, I barely touched you!

341
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,959
- No, it hurts so much!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

342
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,910
I have to get this blood.
Just hold on.

343
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,510
Hypersensitivity to touch.

344
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,180
- Her calcium up?
- Lab over 16.

345
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,640
The question is why.
Likely suspects?

346
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,999
- Parathyroid adenoma.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,259
- Kidney problems.
- Vit. D intoxification.

348
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,879
- Hyperthyroid.
- Caused by our treatment?

349
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Whoa whoa whoa.
Can you please slow down?

350
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,320
The adenoma
is most likely. Check her PTH...

351
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,450
phosphorus, and ionized calcium,
and do a technetium sestambi.

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,070
Okay, that's enough
about the volleyball player.

353
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,350
What's up with the farmer?

354
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,870
What farmer?

355
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,540
Snakebite guy.

356
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,380
Oh, right, you guys don't know about him.

357
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,060
He doesn't get bitten until three months
after we treat the volleyball player.

358
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,850
Luckily, it's been well established
that time is not a fixed construct.

359
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,379
His condition's not improving.
double the dosage.

360
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,020
Already did.

361
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,339
There's another antivenin,
it's not as effective, but...

362
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Already tried it.

363
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,089
The first stuff,
the stuff he was allergic to...

364
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,090
Gave it to him with high-dose steroids.
Nothing's working.

365
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
What does it all mean?

366
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Wrong snake?

367
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,610
We tried every other antivenin we had.

368
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,870
We're too late?

369
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,120
Yep. He's dying.

370
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,230
His wife's here,
finally found a babysitter.

371
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960
Who wants to let him know?

372
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,540
Actually, I'm kidding.

373
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,250
He's not dying?

374
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,570
Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's
no wife and kid. Which is great.

375
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,820
Makes the "breaking the
news" thing way easier.

376
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,830
Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.

377
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,620
The drug addict is peeing blood.

378
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,050
How do they teach you
how to tell someone that they're dying?

379
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,340
It's not like teaching architects how to
explain why their building fell down.

380
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,140
Do you roleplay and stuff?

381
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,349
Yeah, one of us gives the bad news
and one of us gets the bad news.

382
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,710
And what do you have to do
to get an A in You're Dying 101?

383
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,520
They grade you on gentleness
and supportiveness?

384
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,060
Is there a scale for
measuring compassion?

385
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,600
This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten
bucks every time somebody says "Thank you."

386
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,590
Imagine that.

387
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,700
This guy's so good, people thank him
for telling them that they're dying.

388
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,770
Eh, needs brown.

389
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,960
I don't get thanked that often.

390
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,430
You're dying.

391
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,940
In a few hours.

392
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,130
There's nothing we can do
except deal with the pain.

393
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,410
Well, I need to go home.

394
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,180
You're not going home.

395
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,610
Well, my dog?

396
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,830
What will happen to my dog?

397
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,569
Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

398
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,900
Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying
and all he cares about is his dog?

399
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,520
Any of you guys go the dog route
in your improv sessions?

400
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,620
It's a basic truth of the human condition
that everybody lies.

401
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,110
The only variable is about what.

402
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,540
The weird thing about
telling someone they're dying is it

403
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,680
tends to focus their priorities.

404
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,740
You find out what matters to them.

405
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,120
What they're willing to die for.

406
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,680
What they're willing to lie for.

407
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,000
Well, you must have a neighbor who can...

408
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,760
The neighbors don't like him.

409
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,289
Then the Humane Society
can take him in and...

410
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,760
No, they won't.

411
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,059
Maybe my aunt...

412
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,860
It wasn't a snakebite, was it?

413
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,469
I said I don't remember being bit.

414
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,170
Sure you do. Just not by a snake.

415
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,350
I assume that Cujo bit
one of your neighbors awhile back.

416
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,690
You tell me that he bit you,
and I gotta report it.

417
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,940
Cujo's got a record,
he gets the chair.

418
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,930
The good news is,
you might just live.

419
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,940
The bad news is,
your dog's gonna die.

420
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
The guy risked his life to save this thing?

421
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,960
I'll hold him,
you swab the mouth.

422
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,500
I think I've got a better grip here,
you go for the mouth.

423
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,190
- All right, I'm odds.
- What, are you serious?

424
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,340
- Come on.
- One, two, three!

425
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,959
I don't care if he's scratching
your nads off, you don't let go.

426
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Just do it!

427
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
I say we let the guy die.

428
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,190
I got his head, just do it!

429
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Got it.

430
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,690
What would you call that?

431
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,840
That's tea-colored, right?

432
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,810
The guy who we thought
was just after the drugs...

433
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,020
what's the differential diagnosis
for urine that's tea-colored?

434
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,930
Kidney stone.

435
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,500
Kidney stones would cause what?

436
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,290
Blood in urine.

437
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,039
- What color is your pee?
- Yellow.

438
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,019
- What color is your blood?
- Red.

439
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,650
What colors did I use?

440
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,919
- Red, yellow and brown.
- And brown.

441
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,019
- What causes brown?
- Wastes.

442
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,970
Which means the kidneys
are shutting down. Why?

443
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,416
- Trauma.
- None that his history would indicate.

444
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,929
Could be damage done by
the self-injection of the Demerol.

445
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,619
- Treatment?
- Heat and rest...

446
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,879
- Other possible causes.
- Infection.

447
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,370
Start him on antibiotics. What else?

448
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,130
Come on, come on!

449
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,880
I... I don't know.

450
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,380
You're useless.
But at least you know it.

451
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,709
Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase,
what does that tell you?

452
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,030
The trauma diagnosis is right.

453
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,169
He takes it easy for a few days,
he'll be fine.

454
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:10,970
You sure?

455
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,469
The elevated CK rules out infection...

456
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,900
You know what's worse than useless?

457
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,430
Useless and oblivious.

458
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,020
What are they missing?

459
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,109
You know, it's kind of hard to think
when you're in our face like this...

460
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,259
Yeah? You think it's going to be easier

461
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
when you've got
a real patient really dying?

462
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,050
What are you missing?

463
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,690
Muscle death.

464
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,540
Not your case.

465
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,170
Nothing wrong with a consult.

466
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,170
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin.
It's toxic to the kidneys.

467
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,250
Brilliant.

468
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,300
MRI his leg, see what's killing it.

469
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,639
Why is the girl getting the MRI?

470
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,439
Because the neck scan
revealed nothing and

471
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,520
her doctor's way more obsessive
than she thinks she is.

472
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,479
But you said the guy needed the MRI.

473
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,080
Because Dr. Cameron back there
said muscle death, not one of your said it!

474
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,300
Not one of this guy's doctors said it.

475
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,250
They gave him bed rest and antibiotics,
just like you guys would have.

476
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,970
Did he get better?

477
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,620
No.

478
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
- Well, how long...
- Three days.

479
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,750
It is in the nature of medicine
that you are gonna screw up.

480
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,990
You are gonna kill someone.

481
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,530
If you can't handle that reality,
pick another profession.

482
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,100
Or finish medical school and teach.

483
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,619
Three days before they thought
it might have been muscle death?

484
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,810
No, three days before the patient suggested
it might have been muscle death.

485
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,180
The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma:

486
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,420
A cancerous tumor in your femur.

487
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,510
It needs to be removed surgically.

488
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,950
With chemo, she has
an excellent chance of survival.

489
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
But I have to warn you,

490
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:04,940
depending on how large the tumor
is, and how ingrained it is,

491
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,910
the surgeon may need to amputate your leg.

492
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,660
I'm sorry.

493
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,030
It's okay.

494
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,140
Well, dogs' mouths are pretty filthy,

495
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,610
but they have natural antibodies
to fight off most of the stuff. We don't.

496
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,950
That's why dog bites can be so nasty.

497
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,930
The lab test of your dog's saliva
revealed a type of strep bacteria.

498
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,690
It's commonly known as
the "flesh eating disease".

499
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,650
We'll need to operate immediately
to remove the damaged tissue.

500
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,060
We may need to remove the leg.

501
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,620
The MRI revealed a problem.

502
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,250
No kidding.

503
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,579
I'm sorry none of your
doctors found it earlier.

504
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,826
I'm personally going to oversee
your treatment from now on.

505
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,290
You're gonna cut me open, aren't ya?

506
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,840
We may need to remove the leg.

507
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,737
His MRI showed that the leg pain
wasn't caused by the self-injection,

508
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,900
wasn't caused by an infection.

509
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,840
It was an aneurysm that clotted,

510
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,320
leading to an infarction.

511
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,520
God, you were right. It's House.

512
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,310
We have to do the surgery.

513
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,639
The necrotic tissue has to be removed.
If there's too much...

514
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,200
I don't care what you find.

515
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,750
It may become necessary
in order to save your life.

516
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,670
I like my leg.

517
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,790
I've had it for
as long as I can remember.

518
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,269
Honey, I love your leg
as much as you do.

519
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,400
They're not cutting it off.

520
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,150
Patient made the right choice.

521
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,980
Tell a surgeon it's okay to cut a leg off

522
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,040
and he's going to spend the night
polishing his good hacksaw.

523
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,910
Right, surgeons could care less
about saving limbs.

524
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,359
Well, of course they care
about their patients.

525
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,190
They just care
about themselves more.

526
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,440
Which is not an unreasonable position.

527
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,019
Trying to maximize the
tissue you save also

528
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,359
maximizes the chances of
something going wrong.

529
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,460
Which means you've gotta
be extra careful.

530
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,830
Which is such a pain in the ass.

531
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,720
Amazing advances have been made.

532
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,360
Kids with prosthetic legs are running
the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.

533
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,270
Yeah, they're just not as pretty.

534
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,109
Do a bypass, restore the circulation.

535
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,300
Amputation is safer.

536
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,840
For you, or me?

537
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,359
The blockage of blood flow...

538
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,780
Four-day blockage.

539
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,690
Yes. It caused muscle cell death.

540
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,739
When those cells die,
they release cytokines and potassium...

541
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,839
If you restore the blood flow
instead of just lopping it all off,

542
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,799
then all that crap gets
washed back into my system.

543
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,099
The cytokines could cause organ failure,

544
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,959
and the potassium could
cause cardiac arrest.

545
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,870
On the other hand, I may just
get the use of my leg back.

546
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,279
The post-operative pain alone...

547
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,259
I'll get through it. I
understand the risks,

548
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,400
you're in the clear. Go schedule an OR.

549
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,210
God, you're an idiot.

550
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,279
I think I'm more of a jerk.

551
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,660
I'm not being glib.

552
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,750
And I'm not being cute,
I don't want you to kill yourself.

553
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm not gonna die.

554
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,200
Oh, I feel completely reassured.

555
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:54,082
(Not this leg!)

556
00:31:54,791 --> 00:32:02,090
(Not this leg either)

557
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,190
I think they gotta up that morphine.

558
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,670
The doctors say they can't.

559
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,150
The doctors recommended
bed rest and antibiotics.

560
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,606
They screwed up, it doesn't mean
they're wrong this time.

561
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,910
Sure doesn't mean they're right.

562
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,920
- Morphine will kill you.
- I can handle it.

563
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,419
You're in pain,
you're not thinking right.

564
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,560
That's why I need
the damn morphine!

565
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,860
Okay, I'll talk to them.

566
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,490
Oh my God, how much longer
is the pain going to last?

567
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
It depends on how much
muscle cell death there was.

568
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,540
He could be right, he could come out of
this with almost full use of his leg.

569
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
Or?

570
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,290
He could be in pain
for the rest of his life.

571
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,140
There's a third option, surgically.

572
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,360
A middle ground between
what we did and amputation.

573
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,200
He's not big on middle ground.

574
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Yeah.

575
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,910
Nurse, Nurse?
I need more calcium gluconate.

576
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,569
You just had 5 mLs.

577
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,449
Either your ass is getting whiter
or my potassium is rising.

578
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,090
I'll talk to your doctor.

579
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,680
Well, you better make it fast,
'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest.

580
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,990
You give me the dose, or I go
into white count complex tachycardia.

581
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,960
I could get in trouble...

582
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:03,080
Listen, it's not a narcotic!
I'm not looking for a buzz.

583
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,020
You've got about twenty seconds.

584
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,730
I was wrong.

585
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,830
What have you got?

586
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,370
White complex tachycardia.

587
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,870
- Who diagnosed...
- He did.

588
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Paddles!

589
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,600
- Charge.
- Clear!

590
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,210
The patient was technically
dead for over a minute.

591
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,810
He's back.

592
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,480
Do you think he was dead?

593
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,620
Do you think those experiences were real?

594
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Define real.

595
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,200
They were real experiences.
What they meant...

596
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,979
Personally, I choose to
believe that the white light

597
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,410
people sometimes see
visions, this patient saw.

598
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,300
They're all just chemical reactions that
take place when the brain shuts down.

599
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,400
You choose to believe that?

600
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,620
There's no conclusive science.

601
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,199
My choice has no practical
relevance to my life,

602
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,800
I choose the outcome I
find more comforting.

603
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,870
You find it more comforting
to believe that this is it?

604
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,920
I find it more comforting to believe
that this simply isn't a test.

605
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,830
How bad is the pain right now?

606
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,650
It's bad.

607
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,009
It's not getting any better.

608
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,159
If you were right,
the pain would be subsiding.

609
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,450
You'd be getting better.

610
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,160
- It's just taking longer.
- No, it's not.

611
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,300
We've got to
let him cut the leg off.

612
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,800
It's my leg. It's my life.

613
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,210
Would you give up your leg to save my life?

614
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,000
Of course I would.

615
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:42,740
Then why do you think
your life is worth less than mine?

616
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,170
If this were any other patient,
what would you tell them to do?

617
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,539
- I would say it's their choice.
- Wha... not a chance!

618
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,820
You'd browbeat them until they made
the choice you knew was right.

619
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,090
You'd shove it in their face
that it's just a damn leg!

620
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,020
You don't think you deserve to live?

621
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,600
You don't think you deserve to be happy?

622
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,160
Now let them cut off your leg.

623
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,240
Sorry. I can't, I can't,

624
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm sorry.

625
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,550
The pain alone is going to kill you.

626
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,330
I know, I know.

627
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,340
I need you to talk to the doctor.

628
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,400
He change his mind?

629
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
No.

630
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,979
He's asked to be put in a
chemically induced coma

631
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,470
so he can sleep through the
worst part of the pain.

632
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,010
We can do that.

633
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,940
What happens after he's in the coma?

634
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,619
We'll obviously monitor
his condition closely,

635
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,509
and if he can get through
the next forty-eight

636
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,179
hours without another
cardiac incident...

637
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,529
I meant, I'm his health-care proxy,

638
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,370
I get to make medical decisions
for him if he's not able to.

639
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,539
You should talk to him
about what he wants to do.

640
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,570
I know what he wants,
but if he's out it's my call, right?

641
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,310
You'll be out in less than a minute.

642
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Thank you.

643
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,610
Hey.

644
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,760
I'll see you when I wake up.

645
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,450
We'll go golfing.

646
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,180
I love you.

647
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:28,760
I love you, too. I'm sorry.

648
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,680
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

649
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,790
The middle ground
you were talking about?

650
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,590
We go in, take out the dead muscle.

651
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,849
There's still some risk
of reperfusion injury, but...

652
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,760
Give me the forms you need signed.

653
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,770
You're saving his life.

654
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,060
He won't see it that way.

655
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,120
Because of the extent
of the muscle removed,

656
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,410
utility of the patient's leg
was severely compromised.

657
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,820
Because of the time delay
in making the diagnosis,

658
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,350
patient continues to
experience chronic pain.

659
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,560
She had no right to do that.

660
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,880
She had the proxy.

661
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,439
She knew he didn't want the surgery.

662
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,410
She saved his life!

663
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,289
Well, we don't know that.
Maybe he would have been fine...

664
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,409
It doesn't matter.
It's the patient's call.

665
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,630
The patient's an idiot.

666
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,240
They usually are.

667
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,810
Do you have a buzzer or something.
What time does this class end?

668
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,480
Twenty minutes ago.

669
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,230
I'm not doing this again.

670
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,920
And this guy is not the world's
greatest dad. Not even ranked.

671
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,390
Who the hell lets their kids
play with lead-based paint?

672
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,770
That's why he's always sick.

673
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,660
Find him some plastic cups
and the class is all his again.

674
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,320
Stacy, it's Gregg.

675
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,850
I've got an opening in my calendar
for ten tomorrow morning.

676
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,430
Make sure your husband isn't late.
