1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,760
What d'you say now?

2
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,230
I don't know.

3
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,360
You said your dad wouldn't
be home for an hour.

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,539
I know, but it,

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,020
- it, you know...
- Don't you love me?

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,110
Of course, you know I...

7
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,840
Come on. Let's do it.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
All right.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Where are they?

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
Nightstand.

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,110
Gentlemen, start your engines.

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,120
I so want this car!

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,410
Oh my god, you're bleeding!

14
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,750
Look out!

15
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,040
What lie are they telling you?

16
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,430
Okay, yes.

17
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,540
Come on.

18
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,220
Okay, thank you.

19
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,380
Okay, pharmaceuticals were
delivered this morning,

20
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,770
but shipping accidentally sent the
box with vicodin to research.

21
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,000
That's a tough one.

22
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,800
If only we had some way to communicate
with another part of the building.

23
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,199
16-year-old MVA victim.

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,359
He's been in and out of the hospital

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
for three weeks with internal bleeding,

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,939
no one can find the cause,

27
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,839
Internal bleeding after a car accident,

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,010
Wow, that's shocking!

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,130
Let me talk to shipping,
I speak their language.

30
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,040
It's been three weeks...

31
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,150
Your hospital doesn't
have my pain medication.

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,270
Shipping says it's going to be an hour.

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,839
- This is Dr. Cuddy, what's going on?
- The crash didn't cause the bleed.

34
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,339
Right, the bleed caused the crash.

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,060
Blood got on the road, it got all slippery.

36
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,510
Anyone here got drugs?

37
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,486
She saw his blood, she got distracted,
and she crashed his dad's porsche.

38
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,660
Dad loved that.

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
- He was...
- Don't talk.

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,370
It's gonna be an hour.

41
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,459
Well, thank God you took control.

42
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,709
If you can't wait one hour to get your...

43
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,400
Kid's got hemolytic anemia.

44
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,360
Kid? How old?

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,899
He must have inherited it...
He's gonna die. My condolences.

46
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,940
It wasn't inherited.
The problem's outside the red blood cells.

47
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,699
This is impossible. A 16-year-old
doesn't get hemolytic anemia...

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,852
Give her back the file.

49
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:55,409
You have bigger
problems to tend to, like my meds.

50
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,700
Elevated indirect bilirubin,
low-serum haptoglobin...

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,360
He's got meningitis.

52
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,900
No.

53
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,720
- Artificial heart valve.
- No.

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,480
Get everyone in my office.

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,098
Kid's gonna be dead in a matter of days

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,540
if we don't figure out why his
red blood cells are disintegrating, so...

57
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,229
Differential diagnosis, people.

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,490
Well, it's not environmental.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,669
Dad hired a company to clean the house,
maid washed all the clothes,

60
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,630
and bought hypoallergenic
sheets and pillows.

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,690
You want us to recheck?

62
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,820
No. If it's environmental
he'll get better just from staying here.

63
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,959
It could be an infection.

64
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,359
No fever, no white count.

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,630
Well, he's 99.2.

66
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,220
Barely above normal.

67
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,380
But above.
His body's reacting to something.

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,830
We could account for the lack
of fever and white count if it's lupus.

69
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,139
Drugs'll fit just as much as lupus.
Meth'll cause hemolytic anemia.

70
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,749
A lot of meth.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,960
He also doesn't seem like the type.

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,740
Because his dad drives a porsche?

73
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,510
Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.

74
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,120
Didn't mean to offend you.

75
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,669
Okay, so it's infection,
lupus, drugs, or cancer.

76
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,410
Cancer?

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,060
Why not? Great meeting.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,729
Shouldn't we narrow it
down before we finish?

79
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,700
My leg gave us 'till 11:15.

80
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,210
I'll talk to wilson about lymphoma,
ana for lupus, radioimmunoassay for drugs,

81
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,980
you test for... whatever
you thought it was.

82
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,880
I've got a date with a pharmacist.

83
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,740
Come on, come on, come on...

84
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,010
Excuse me.

85
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,270
You know, there are other
ways to manage pain.

86
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,200
Like what, laughter?

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,419
Meditation?

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,560
Got a guy who
can fix my third chakra?

89
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,190
You're addicted.

90
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,479
If the pills ran my life,
I'd agree with you.

91
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,089
But it's my leg that's busy
calendaring what I can't do.

92
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,210
You're in denial.

93
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,539
Right, I never had an infarction in my leg,

94
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,540
no dead muscle, no nerve damage.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,989
Doesn't even hurt.

96
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,150
Actually, it kind of tickles.
The chicks dig this.

97
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,630
Better than a puppy.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,510
It's not just your leg.
You wanna get high!

99
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,610
You're doing what, 80 mg a day?

100
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,510
Oh, that's way too much!

101
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,440
Moderation is the key.
Unless there's pain.

102
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,230
It's double what you were
taking when I hired you.

103
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,060
'Cause you're twice as annoying.

104
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,699
I can't always be here to protect you.

105
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,059
Patients talk. Doctors talk.

106
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,880
About how big your ass has gotten lately?

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Not me, I defend it. You got back.

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,859
You can't go a week without the drugs.

109
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,639
No, I don't want to go a week
without the drugs, it'll hurt.

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,309
No, you can't.

111
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,639
If you're just getting off
pain medication, it will hurt,

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,020
but you won't be having a great
time, but you'll make it.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,509
If you're detoxing you'll
have chills, nausea...

114
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,339
Your pain will magnify five,
ten times. You won't make it.

115
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,980
Well, I guess we'll never know.

116
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,050
I'll give you a week off clinic duty
if you can go a week off narcotics.

117
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,899
No way! I love the clinic.

118
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,459
You love the pills. Two weeks.

119
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,620
Pills don't make me high.
They make me neutral.

120
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,770
A month.

121
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,270
You're on, mister.

122
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,459
Drugs could cause this?

123
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,750
Cocaine and meth are very hard
on the blood system.

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,320
Has he had any erratic behavior?

125
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,700
No, but...

126
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,450
She was in rehab in the 9th grade.
She's supposedly clean now, but...

127
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,890
She obviously cares for him.

128
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,700
Yeah, what she
cared about was the car.

129
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,480
Anniversary present from my wife.

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,070
We drove it up north
to watch the leaves change.

131
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,480
She was dead a year later. Cancer.

132
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,870
Mr. Foster, we're going
to test Keith for drugs.

134
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,020
I don't do drugs.

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
No, it's not that we
don't trust you, but...

136
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,910
His hair will tell us any drugs
he's taken in the past sixty days.

137
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,140
It's kind of
like rings on a tree.

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Negative.

139
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,800
Have you been sick?

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
No, nothing.

141
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,236
Have you been out of the country?

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,270
We went to china, but we got all
of our shots before we left.

143
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,410
It could be an infection.

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,080
We're going to give him a
gallium scan just to be safe.

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,739
We inject a radioactive
isotope into his bloodstream,

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,360
and we check to see if there's
inflammation anywhere in the body.

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,110
Has he ever complained of any joint pain?

148
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,839
Sensitivity to light, rashes...

149
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800
No, no, nothing.

150
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,080
Any relatives ever been
diagnosed with lupus?

151
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,370
I don't even know that that is.

152
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,750
In simple terms, the body
becomes allergic to itself.

153
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,939
The immune system attacks healthy cells in
the circulatory system

154
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,320
and destroys them.

155
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,950
Would it be treatable?

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,740
It can be manageable.

157
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,490
We can test for the antibodies.

158
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,200
95% of patients with lupus
test positive for ANA.

159
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,440
Not cloudy. Negative.

160
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,070
What about bruising?

161
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,320
He ever complain about tenderness
under his arms or his groin?

162
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm not sure he'd tell me if he did.

163
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,129
I guess I really don't know
what's going on in his life.

164
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,390
He's a teenager.

165
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,830
Yeah.

166
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,030
What type of cancer did your wife have?

167
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,820
Pancreatic.

168
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,830
It's his lymph nodes we're concerned about.

169
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,110
We're going to do a biopsy
to check for lymphoma.

170
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,560
Okay, you feel this?

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
No.

172
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,510
Good.

173
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,980
I have cancer, don't I?

174
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,850
We're just testing.

175
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,450
That's what they told my mom.

176
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,890
Definitely not cancer.

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,400
Nothing?

178
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,320
Nothing.

179
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,659
Negative for drugs. Ana was negative,
gallium scan was clear...

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,199
Yeah, I got that from the "nothing".

181
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,570
Where's his hematocrit?

182
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,420
Thirteen.

183
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,168
Drops any lower

184
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,379
he's not going to have any red blood
cells to bring oxygen to his body.

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,539
He'll suffocate with his
lungs working perfectly.

186
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,540
You okay?

187
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,590
Excuse me, someone?
Help, please?

188
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,760
Polite for a dying kid.

189
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,040
How long has it been?

190
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm fine.

191
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,480
There's something in my eye, up top.

192
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,610
Which eye?

193
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,920
This one. What's happening?

194
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,490
It's all right. Just, look down for me?

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,810
It's clear. There's nothing in it.

196
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
It's getting worse!

197
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Is it fuzzy, or...

198
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,920
No! It's dark!

199
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I can't see!

200
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,399
It's a retinal clot in the left eye.

201
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,749
Coumadin would dissolve the
clot, fix his eyesight.

202
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,180
You can't use bloodthinners,
he's got internal bleeding.

203
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,900
Fix the eye, you kill everything else.

204
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,760
Surgery's out for the same reason.

205
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,619
We have two hours to figure this out.

206
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,090
Either we restore the blood
flow or he loses the eye.

207
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,380
Forget the eye.

208
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,580
Tell him to use the other one
to look on the bright side.

209
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,850
The clot tells us something.

210
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,120
It could help us figure out what he has,
which could mean he gets to live.

211
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,870
Differential diagnosis, people.

212
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,870
How does internal bleeding
suddenly start clotting?

213
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,750
It makes no sense,
they're opposing processes.

214
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,329
It can happen in lupus.

215
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,330
Increased platelet count
can cause blood clots.

216
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,810
Ana was negative. It's not lupus.

217
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,340
This is true.
But why are you the one saying it?

218
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,910
What are you doing here?
I thought we ruled out cancer.

219
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,050
I was lonely.

220
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,869
Well, go see Cuddy.
She needs a friend.

221
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,879
That's funny, she said you might need one.

222
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,970
That's why you're here?

223
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,810
She wants you to keep an eye on me,
make sure I don't cheat.

224
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,500
No, I want to make sure you don't start
firing shots from the clock tower.

225
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,570
I'm fine.

226
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,250
What's going on?

227
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,980
He hasn't had vicodin in over a day.

228
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,100
Does your leg hurt?

229
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,670
You ever been shot?

230
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,259
There's gonna be side effects.
Insomnia, depression, tachycardia...

231
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,159
Withdrawl symptoms.
Not applicable.

232
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,490
The only side-effects I'm going to have are
some pain and thirty days of freedom.

233
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,680
Am I the only one who's
concerned about a dying kid?

234
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,170
If it's not lupus, what else?

235
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,210
Most likely candidate for throwing
a clot is infection or cancer.

236
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,330
Checked the biopsy twice, it's not cancer.

237
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,210
It's not an infection.
Gallium scan didn't reveal anything.

238
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay, what hides from a Gallium scan?

239
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Cardiac.

240
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,819
Right. Clot slips off, travels through the
artery, and

241
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,180
gets backed up in the eye.

242
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,910
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
What happened?

244
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,900
It's an infection. In his heart?

245
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Great.

246
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,070
Echocardiogram for the heart and
iv antibiotics for the infection, stat.

247
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,570
Is it my birthday?

248
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm not lonely, my leg hurts.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,269
She's a real masseuse.

250
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,470
She's five hundred dollars
an hour, minimum.

251
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,119
She's hot, so she's a hooker?

252
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,930
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

253
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,539
The envious, jealous,

254
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,110
I-never-got-any-in-high-school
kind of logic, hello!

255
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,940
She's a legitimate masseuse, come on.

256
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,810
God, she's beautiful.

257
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,850
Because she's beautiful I should do it?
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

258
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,990
The envious, jealous,
I'm-married-and-i-can't-do-anything logic!

259
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Hello.

260
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,959
Hi. Listen, I'm, I'm sure you're really
good at whatever it is you do but...

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Dame su mano.

262
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,190
Huh?

263
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,090
Hey, no, let go
of my hand. Come on.

264
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,560
She doesn't speak english.

265
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,270
Oh, my god.

266
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,850
Bueno.

267
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,390
Take off your clothes.

268
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,080
Not a fan of the stroganoff?

269
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
I'm not hungry.

270
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,320
The antibiotics can cause nausea.

271
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,250
So can the food.

272
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,830
Shouldn't you be looking at my eye?

273
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,280
The blood clot isn't life-threatening.

274
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,320
We're focusing on figuring out
the cause of your problems.

275
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,220
So the blindness will
be permanent, won't it?

276
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,700
Thank you.

277
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Bye.

278
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,130
I had a massage.

279
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,450
Looks like you had a masseuse.

280
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Help the pain?

281
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm fine.

282
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
I know.

283
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,909
Kid's echo was normal, no sign of
any vegetations on heart valves.

284
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,679
Never met a diagnostic
study I couldn't refute.

285
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,579
And the antibiotics aren't doing anything.

286
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,520
So, double the dosage. 70mg.

287
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,529
That'll box his kidneys for sure!

288
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,689
Oh, you're right. Save the kidney.

289
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,530
The guy we transplant it
into will be grateful.

290
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,429
Also, I have an idea for his eye.

291
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,710
Nothing we can do about his eye.

292
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,270
- He's got a clot in his retinal...
- Read the memo.

293
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,479
If we remove some of the liquid from
the eye itself, the vitreous humor,

294
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,980
it might make some extra room
around the retinal artery.

295
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,230
If the artery expands, the clot
might move out on its own.

296
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,150
That's very creative.

297
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,130
Why didn't you mention this before?

298
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,720
Well, I didn't think of it before.

299
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You should have.

300
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,350
This isn't going to hurt.

301
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,810
Your eye's numb.
You'll only feel pressure.

302
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Give it a minute.

303
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
I can see.

304
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,129
I can see you.

305
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,650
I heard! Congratulations.

306
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,420
Don't. I haven't brushed
my teeth in two days.

307
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,030
Ah, I'm so scared they're not gonna
find out what's wrong with you.

308
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,010
No biggie. I'm fine.

309
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,999
I feel so bad about all this.
It's all my fault.

310
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,480
No. No, it's not.

311
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,290
But your father. He hates me.

312
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,320
He's just pissed about his car.

313
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,680
Help, help help!

314
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,390
What's wrong?

315
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,629
Ast is 859, we're getting him to the ICU.

316
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,789
ALT and GDT were in the tank.
Our antibiotics...

317
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,019
Would not have caused this.

318
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,449
She must have given him drugs.

319
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,499
I wouldn't do that!

320
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,479
It's not drugs!
His liver is shutting down.

321
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,150
What? What does that mean?

322
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,710
It means he's all better.
He's ready to go home.

323
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,790
What?

324
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,250
What do you think it means?

325
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,630
You can't live without a liver, he's dying!

326
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,349
What is your problem?

327
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,829
Bum leg, what's yours?

328
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,510
Hey, we don't have
time for this, let's go.

329
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,010
His son's dying and
you're mocking him?

330
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,670
It was a dumb question.

331
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,010
No, it wasn't.

332
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,760
You're right, it wasn't.

333
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,940
Is proving Cuddy wrong worth all this?

334
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,910
You know, House shouldn't even be here.

335
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,020
Because he said something inappropriate?

336
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,829
If we sent him home every time he did that,
we wouldn't need this office.

337
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,020
He's in pain.

338
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,329
What does the man have
to do to piss you off?

339
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,359
He's been without pain
relief for seventy hours...

340
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,899
Exactly! He's detoxing,
can't you see he's out of his mind?

341
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,780
That's what they said about manson.

342
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,299
Do you want to continue talking about me

343
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,920
or should we discuss
what the liver damage tells us?

344
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,819
I was born in a log cabin in illinois...

345
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,760
Hemolytic anemia doesn't
cause liver damage.

346
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,149
Add the fact he's coughing blood,

347
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,610
you've got three of the indicators
of organ-threatening lupus.

348
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,370
It's moving too fast.
Could be hepatitis-e.

349
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,279
There's only been one case of hep-e
originating in the US since...

350
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,459
Its history. Since he's been in and out of
the country four times in the last year...

351
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,989
You really think he's got Hep-E?

352
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,739
No. I think the lupus is way more likely.

353
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,300
All right. Then let's start him
on IV Cytoxan and Plasmapheresis.

354
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,670
No, we should rule out Hep-E.

355
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,439
You just said it wasn't hep-e.

356
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,600
I said lupus was way more likely,
but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-e.

357
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,170
He's toast.

358
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,790
Exactly.

359
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,909
But there isn't a treatment
for hepatitis-e.

360
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,199
Either he'll get better on his own
or he'll continue to deteriorate.

361
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,420
Yeah, I went to medical school, too.

362
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,880
Start him on Solumedrol.

363
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,099
If he's got Hep-E that's only
going to make him worse!

364
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,860
Not as much. Goldilocks, people.

365
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,647
It won't hurt him so much
that it'll kill him,

366
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:34,750
and it won't hurt him so
little that we can't tell.

367
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,260
It'll hurt him just right.
And if it does nothing...

368
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,429
We'll know it's not Hep-E and
start treating him for lupus.

369
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,850
Now watch me do it while
drinking a glass of water.

370
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,280
What do we tell the dad?

371
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,850
"We think your kid has Lupus, so we're
gonna treat him for hepatitis-e..."

372
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,769
And oh yeah, if it really is Hep-E,

373
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,939
we're not actually giving
him Hep-E medication,

374
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,660
"so it's gonna make him worse, not better?"

375
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
You think he'll go for that?

376
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,300
So you want us to lie?

377
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,560
No. I want you to lie.

378
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,130
Why me?

379
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,470
Because he trusts you.

380
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,109
This is a mistake.

381
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,239
This is a lawsuit.

382
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,600
Hep-e is possible.

383
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,109
House always pulls these stunts
and he's right more often...

384
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,859
He's delaying treatment because
of a one-in-a-million chance

385
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,609
that even he doesn't think is the problem.

386
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,689
I don't want to lie to him.

387
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,690
Then don't.

388
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,640
And get fired?

389
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,900
Like he's going to fire you, he loves you.

390
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,590
I've got to do something,
the kid needs treatment.

391
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Treat him for lupus.

392
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,030
That will get you fired.

393
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,230
You really think House is losing it?

394
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,610
Yeah.

395
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,480
He's fine. He knows what he's doing.

396
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,000
We're recommending a
drug called Solumedrol.

397
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,820
For hepatitis?
Did that show up on his blood tests?

398
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,150
The tests are never 100% accurate.

399
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,559
Well, then all the other
tests could be wrong, too.

400
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,809
This could still be an infection or cancer.

401
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,440
They don't fit any of
the most recent symptoms.

402
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,410
Well, what, just hepatitis does?

403
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,880
I know, I know, I know,
you can never be sure.

404
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,150
When Linda was in the hospital,

405
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,079
the doctor told us there was this
aggressive experimental treatment

406
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,790
which might extend her life
by two or three years.

407
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,059
We figured if there was
any hope at all that

408
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,821
we could have her with us a little
while longer, it would be worth it.

409
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,320
3 weeks later, she was gone.

410
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,100
I don't think it's hepatitis.

411
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,740
I think your son has lupus.

412
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,830
I think it's broken.
What did you do?

413
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,950
Accidentally closed the car door on it.

414
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,950
No. Door would have broken the skin.

415
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,070
This looks like something
hard and smooth smashed it.

416
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
I want my lawyer.

417
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,100
The brain has a gating mechanism for pain.

418
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,740
Registers the most severe injury
and blocks out the others.

419
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Did it work?

420
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,470
Well, my hand hurts like hell.

421
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,750
Yeah, I feel much better.

422
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Don't splint it.

423
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,700
I want to be able to bang it against the
wall if I need to administer another dose.

424
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,380
Just... tape it up.

425
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,346
Why did you tell Cameron to lie to Mr.
Foster?

426
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,380
Make it tight will ya.

427
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,970
Answer me.

428
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,000
Nothing I could say is going
to change how you feel,

429
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,779
and nothing could come out of your reaction

430
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,541
that is going to change what I plan
to do, so I prefer to say nothing.

431
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,350
So, that was you just saying nothing.

432
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,430
The guy is furious.

433
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,810
And scared.

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,760
So, what are you going to do?

435
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,700
The father's
insisting on the lupus treatment.

436
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,570
Yeah, Cameron told me
and I told her to tell him no.

437
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,700
Well, you can't just sit
back and let the kid die.

438
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,050
Neither can the father.

439
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:07,110
So that's your plan? You're gonna
play chicken with the kid's life?

440
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,470
Well, he's the dad. I should win easily.

441
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Take the week off.

442
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,160
What, 'cause I lied to a patient?

443
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,460
I take risks, sometimes patients die.

444
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,839
But not taking risks causes
more patients to die,

445
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,080
so I guess my biggest problem is I've been
cursed with the ability to do the math.

446
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,019
I told him that you wouldn't
treat him for the lupus until...

447
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,020
What did he say?

448
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,720
He said he wanted to transfer
Keith to another hospital.

449
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,829
He's not stable enough, he'd
never make it through the door!

450
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,889
That's what I told him.

451
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,090
And that's when he caved.

452
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.

453
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,190
Two plus two equals four.

454
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,559
If it is hepatitis-e we
should begin to see a marked

455
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,189
decline in liver function
tests within the hour.

456
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,119
Why bother explaining it to me? It's not
like I have any choice in the matter.

457
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,640
If there's no hep-e we'll start
treatment for lupus immediately.

458
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,109
Keith? What's wrong?

459
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,650
What's happening?

460
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,110
Get off!

461
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,979
Keith? It's Dr. Chase,
where does it hurt?

462
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Jules, no!

463
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,260
He's hallucinating.

464
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:12,509
Is this from the medicine?

465
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,559
We haven't started the medicine.

466
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,920
Keith, we're in the hospital.
Keith, there's nothing on you.

467
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,300
- Keith!
- Keith!

468
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,210
You okay, buddy?

469
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,780
I think I wet the bed.

470
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,810
Don't worry about it, it's fine.
Let's get you up.

471
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,820
Oh, god!

472
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:40,170
He's had a major bleed.
Bright red blood per rectum.

473
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,920
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

474
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,840
He's going into hypervolemic shock.

475
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,920
Pressure's 60, heart rate's 140.

476
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,960
We need an angiography, stat!

477
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,969
Angiography revealed major
upper and lower GI bleeding,

478
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,819
severe hemodynamic compromise,
and liver failure.

479
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,349
He's also hallucinating.

480
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,699
Thinks he's being talked to
by someone named "Jules".

481
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,629
Hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis,

482
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,479
which is the fourth diagnostic criterion.

483
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,660
It's official. This is lupus.

484
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,390
Who's Jules?

485
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,719
Any mention of her in the medical history?

486
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,600
It doesn't matter what he's hallucinating
about, it matters why! It's lupus!

487
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,430
There's no need to get snippy.

488
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,699
This kind of lupus takes years to get
to this point, it's been a week.

489
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,549
Yeah, and a 16-year-old kid
shouldn't have hemolytic anemia,

490
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,500
or be bleeding out of
every orifice, but he is.

491
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,819
We had an opportunity to treat this,

492
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,380
instead we diddled around
with hepatitis-e and now it's too late.

493
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,500
He needs a new liver.
We screwed up.

494
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,330
You're saying I screwed up.

495
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,960
Yes.

496
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,321
Then why didn't you just say that?

497
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,449
You gonna just blame this on her?

498
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,810
Did you agree with my
recommendation to treat for hep-e?

499
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
No, I didn't.

500
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,919
And she made herself quite clear.

501
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,559
And then she went and lied to the father.
That's why you're angry.

502
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,600
Yeah, I trusted you.

503
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,870
You always trust me. It's big mistake.

504
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,409
Lupus is a bad diagnosis.

505
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,069
It's the best diagnosis we've got.

506
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,459
That doesn't make it good.

507
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,960
No, it just makes it this
kid's only chance to live.

508
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,540
Put him on the transplant list.

509
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,130
Cafeteria. Stay away from the sushi.

510
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,050
And what happened to your hand?

511
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,730
Got stuck in a drawer.

512
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,329
Yeah, right. You're going
through withdrawl.

513
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,410
No, I am going through pain.
Pain causes nausea.

514
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,740
I took this job to work with
you, not cover your ass.

515
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,030
Your vicodin.

516
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,790
And your solution is to give me drugs.

517
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,390
It's interesting.

518
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,820
No. Now I'm covering my ass.

519
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,390
Take your pills before you kill this kid.

520
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,660
Lupus is normally treated with medication,

521
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,419
but in Keith's case the
disease is too advanced.

522
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Because you lied.

523
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,589
Because House wanted to play
games with my son's life.

524
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,959
There's no way to really tell what
progression the disease may take...

525
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,930
You're right, and I'm sorry.

526
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
So what do we do?

527
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,070
He needs a new liver.

528
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,590
There are over 15,000 patients
on the transplant list.

529
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,850
But how many are about to bleed to death
unless they get a new liver?

530
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,230
In Jersey? I'd say, uh, twenty.

531
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,219
2000 patients die each year because

532
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,669
a donor liver can't be found,
that's almost five a day.

533
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,670
So he's screwed.

534
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,790
I'll see what I can do.

535
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,050
Could I donate part of my liver?

536
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,990
Sorry, you're a different blood type.

537
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,910
So we just wait?

538
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,910
I'm afraid so.

539
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,170
And hope for someone to die.

540
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,930
Who's Jules?

541
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,369
Dr. House, you should get
back to your office...

542
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,179
Jules. There's
no Jules in the history.

543
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,689
It was a hallucination.

544
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,550
Of what?

545
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:19,399
Our cat. Does this matter?

546
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
No, I'm sorry.

547
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:22,479
We'll continue the
transfusions and the treatment

548
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,040
for the anemia and liver failure
while we're waiting for a donor.

549
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
How long can he wait?

550
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,690
Not long.

551
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,689
I don't think this is lupus.

552
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,039
This is lupus.
Come on, let's just go...

553
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,529
Your fourth diagnostic criterion
of lupus is psychosis;

554
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,509
This is just a kid missing his cat.

555
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,180
He was being attacked by an
animal that wasn't in the room.

556
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,130
That's psychosis.

557
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:42,819
There's a difference between
psychosis and hallucination.

558
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,879
So, if he was imagining a
fake cat it'd be lupus,

559
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,360
but since it was a real cat it's not?

560
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,510
Take your damn pills.

561
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:48,599
Psychosis requires...

562
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,690
There's no cat! Jules is dead.

563
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,480
You have a dead family pet,
and you never mentioned it?

564
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,210
Nice family history.

565
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,219
Family history is asking
about family members,

566
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,459
meaning people related to the patient.
Let's go.

567
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,469
How did the cat die?

568
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,590
Can you get him out of here?

569
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,580
Dr. House, come on, let's go...

570
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,860
What happened to the cat?

571
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,650
Old age. She was fifteen years old.

572
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,990
When?

573
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
About a month ago?

574
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,799
Does this have anything to do with...

575
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,650
Where'd she sleep?

576
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,310
With keith.

577
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,680
This is not a cat allergy.

578
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,560
It's not lupus. Where is Jules?

579
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,830
Four years of college, four at med
school, two years of residency,

580
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,120
another four of sub-specialty training,
and where do I end up?

581
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,390
Talking instead of digging.
Come on, the ground's frozen solid.

582
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
What's that?

583
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,900
Out of the way!

584
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,930
We have the liver. Prep or 4.

585
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,670
All right, Keith. Start
counting backward from ten.

586
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,830
Ten...

587
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
nine...

588
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
eight...

589
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,510
Scalpel.

590
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Stop the gases.

591
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,400
What the hell are you doing, house?

592
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,189
Saving a sixteen-year-old
kid from a lifetime of

593
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,580
immunosuppressant drugs
and a very nasty scar.

594
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,380
This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis.

595
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,490
He has acute naphthalene toxicity.

596
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,760
Naphthalene.
You're talking about mothballs.

597
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,580
Nope.

598
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,090
Termites.

599
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,760
They create naphthalene
to protect their nests,

600
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,490
which I'm assuming is rather large and is
inside all four walls of his bedroom at home.

601
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,660
And your assumption is based on what?

602
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,550
The autopsy I just
conducted on his pet cat.

603
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,979
Call Cuddy. And security.

604
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,869
You are not removing that kid's liver.

605
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,870
Now!

606
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,289
Have you completely lost your mind?

607
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,800
No, but I have been feeling
a little sick lately.

608
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,070
Achoo!

609
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,900
There's no way we can do this surgery now.

610
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,050
You think?

611
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:41,640
You've already cost him his
liver, don't kill him too!

612
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,439
Why are you so eager to
cut into a healthy kid?

613
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,209
Healthy? He's in the toilet!

614
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,910
He just needs some chicken soup.

615
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,959
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub.
We're doing this transplant.

616
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,710
No, you're not.

617
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,710
You said it!

618
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,989
If Keith's symptoms had
an environmental cause,

619
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,619
they would have disappeared
as soon as he got here.

620
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,590
They've only gotten worse.

621
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,165
If the food here wasn't one step below.

622
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,949
Riker's island he would've gotten better.

623
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,189
He's lost fourteen pounds.

624
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,309
Yeah, sure. This is nothing
but a dietary thing.

625
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,509
Naphthalene is a gas,
a fat soluble gas.

626
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,129
The kid breathes it in,
it gets stored in his fat cells.

627
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,140
Outside the hospital his body
burned protein and carbs for energy

628
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,870
and the naphthalene stayed in fat.

629
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,759
But once the car accident
put him in the hospital,

630
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
and he started losing weight,

631
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,979
his body had to get its
energy somewhere else.

632
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,550
It started to burn fat.

633
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,090
The floodgates opened, the
poison poured into his system.

634
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,749
So, getting away from the
poison is what poisoned him?

635
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,409
Getting him away from his dad's
meatloaf is what's killing him.

636
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,020
You wanna explain to me why
you stopped the surgery?

637
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,370
Oh, my god! My god.

638
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,689
I want him locked up!

639
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,070
Hey! Take it easy.

640
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,780
Your cat did not die of old age.

641
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,159
He died of massive internal bleeding

642
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,090
and acute liver failure caused
by naphthalene poisoning,

643
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,749
the exact same thing your son has.

644
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,419
You lie to me, you mess
up my son's surgery,

645
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,199
and now you expect me to trust you?

646
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,469
Give me twenty-four hours,
we'll pump your son full of calories...

647
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,629
That liver is going to somebody right now.

648
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,019
We're doing that surgery.

649
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,709
If you do the surgery,
you'll be killing a mother of four.

650
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,710
Father of three.

651
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
I was guessing.

652
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
Like you are now?

653
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,459
Naphthalene poisoning
is the best explanation

654
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,020
we have for what's wrong with your son.

655
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,879
It explains the internal bleeding,
the hemolytic anemia,

656
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,230
the liver failure...
It also predicts what'll happen next.

657
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,529
If you do the surgery he's gonna lay
on that table for fourteen hours

658
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,870
while his body continues to burn fat
and release poison into his system.

659
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,589
Either way, I did you a favor.

660
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,470
He's awake now,
you've got a chance to say goodbye.

661
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,280
I think you should trust Dr. House.

662
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,720
Give the liver to the other guy.

663
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,960
INR is down, and his
blood count is climbing.

664
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,240
It means you made the right call.

665
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,580
His liver is healing.
He's gonna be just fine.

666
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,830
You made it a week.

667
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,600
And won my prize.

668
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Congratulations.

669
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,499
Cuddy's a sucker. I would have
done it for two weeks off.

670
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,410
Yeah, it was a piece of cake.
You learn anything?

671
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,460
Yeah, I'm an addict.

672
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
Okay.

673
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,380
I'm not stopping.

674
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,140
There are programs.
Cuddy would give you the time.

675
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,169
You could get on a different
pain management regimen...

676
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,170
I don't need to stop.

677
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,949
You just said...

678
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,460
I said I was an addict.
I didn't say I had a problem.

679
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,760
I pay my bills, I make my meals.
I function.

680
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,539
Is that all you want?
You have no relationships.

681
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,389
I don't want any relationships.

682
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,480
You alienate people.

683
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,829
I've been alienating
people since I was three.

684
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,500
Oh, come on! Drop it!

685
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,059
You don't think you've changed
in the last few years?

686
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,300
Well, of course I have. I've...

687
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,429
I've gotten older. My
hair's gotten thinner.

688
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,239
Sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I'm lonely,

689
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,009
sometimes I wonder what it all means.

690
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,010
No, I was there!

691
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,480
You are not just a regular guy
who's getting older, you've changed!

692
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,879
You're miserable, and you're
afraid to face yourself...

693
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,930
Of course I've changed!

694
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,690
And everything's the leg?
Nothing's the pills?

695
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,610
They haven't done a thing to you?

696
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,960
They let me do my job,
and they take away my pain.

697
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
How'd it go?

698
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,959
He admitted he's addicted
to the narcotics...

699
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,219
Well, admitting you have a problem

700
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,220
- is the first...
- And he says it's not a problem.

701
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Maybe it's not.

702
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
What do I know?

703
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
What are you going to do?

704
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,990
Nothing. I've done enough damage.

705
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,500
Better hope he never finds
out that that was your idea.

706
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,140
He'd never believe it.
