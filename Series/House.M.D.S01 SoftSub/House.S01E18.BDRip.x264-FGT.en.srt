1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,405
Did I say anything stupid?

2
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:12,382
I had two drinks!

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
Three!

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,920
Okay, there was that last one.

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,645
That's okay, some day you'll be pregnant
and you can return the favor.

6
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,329
I feel like such an idiot sometimes.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,330
No!

8
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,703
You know, when the baby
comes I am gonna be...

9
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:37,060
You know what?
You are going to be so great. You are.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,390
Hey!

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Oh.

12
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:56,378
You all right?

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,740
Oh, no.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,836
You know why I pulled you over?

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm so sorry, Officer,
I must have, dozed off.

16
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,440
Have you been drinking?

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,020
No.

18
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:15,060
Of course she hasn't.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,980
- Somebody has.
- I've been drinking.

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:20,828
You all right?

21
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,325
I, I'm not, I, uh...

22
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:24,540
How far along are you?

23
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,352
Uh, almost...

24
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:28,631
Ma'am, step out of the vehicle.

25
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,062
Ma'am, walk to the rear of the car.

26
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,174
Naomi, are you... Naomi?

27
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,187
- Naomi...
- Sir, remain in the car!

28
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,548
- Hey, listen, she's not drunk, all right?
- I will arrest you, sir.

29
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:49,507
- She's sick!
- Badge 302,

30
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:50,915
- can you roll me another unit?
- Just look it! She's not...

31
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,459
Get back in the car.

32
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,455
Naomi!

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,180
Call an ambulance!

34
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,810
Well, the good news is, it doesn't look
like a stroke. No bleeds, no clots.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,720
Thank God.

36
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,450
It sounds like there's bad news.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,169
Why, what would cause that?

38
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,059
It's preeclampsia, isn't it?
I'm gonna miscarry, aren't I?

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,969
Preeclampsia is a possibility, but
let's not get ahead of ourselves.

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,549
I've miscarried three times,

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,739
I'm 39, we had to use in vitro, you've
gotta make sure that the baby's okay...

42
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,410
Let's make sure that you're okay, first.

43
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,210
How about we take care of
both of you at the same time.

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,630
The nurse will be in soon to take some
blood. I'd like to run some more tests.

45
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,620
Thank you, Doctor.

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Thank you.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Where is everybody?

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,660
No one's in the office?

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,750
No, haven't heard
from Cameron all day.

50
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,190
You seen House?

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,350
Look for a shallow grave
with Vogler standing over it.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You have a Stage 4 cancer.

53
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,040
It's metastasized to your liver.

54
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,810
There's a new drug called 8C 12
that's shown promise in Phase 2 trials.

55
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,280
It's your best shot.

56
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,390
Thank you, Doctor.

57
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,560
You've been so good to me.

58
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,490
Well, I did publicly bash
your company's drug.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,630
When I think about how I treated you...

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,380
Oh, hey, come on.

61
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,330
There, there, there.

62
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,400
So, there is some hope?

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Always.

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,440
But just in case, I special-order
an extra jumbo-size coffin.

65
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Hey!

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,080
Don't thank me.
It's just who I am.

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Hey!

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,180
Up and at 'em, big guy.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,849
Sorry, up late. Internet porn.

70
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,039
How come you're not in your office?

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,099
Because there is a computer in my office.

72
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,859
If I log on, romance will ensue.
My wrist might fall off.

73
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,790
Hiding because Vogler's
looking for you.

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,930
That's just pathetic.

75
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,759
I don't like loud, angry giants
threatening me with violence.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,899
How is that pathetic?

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,520
You think you can avoid firing
one of us by hiding out here?

78
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,690
He'll find you sooner or later.

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm okay with later.

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,700
39-year-old female,
28 weeks pregnant, G 4, P 0.

81
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,920
Three miscarriages?

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,380
Gimme.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,309
Altered mental status and
complete loss of coordination.

84
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,310
Tox screen?

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,219
Negative for alcohol and drugs.
She was on oxybutynin.

86
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,180
For incontinence.

87
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,649
We took her off, but no change.

88
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,060
BUN, creatinine are up,
LFT slightly elevated.

89
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Preeclampsia.

90
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,040
Call the OB-GYN service
and rub some prayer beads.

91
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,619
BP's normal.
No preeclampsia in other pregnancies.

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,429
Because she didn't carry long enough.

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,580
The three miscarriages make me think
it's an underlying physiology.

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,190
Pregnancy-related autoimmunity.

95
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,190
Too bad that Cameron quit,
I could use an immunologist right now.

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,430
We'll see if you're right.
Check the blood.

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
Cameron quit?

98
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,950
Last night.

99
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,890
And do an MRA for vasculitis, too.

100
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,570
There is no way she quit!

101
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,780
She got fired because
you couldn't swallow your pride!

102
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,770
An ultrasound?
Excellent thought!

103
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,090
And put her on magnesium, too,
in case it is preeclampsia.

104
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Sure.

105
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,790
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.

106
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,349
I didn't do anything.

107
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,460
Exactly my point.

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,280
You wanted me to yell at him?

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,079
What the hell would
that have achieved?

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,889
What, is he going to jump into
his time machine and fix everything?

111
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,709
When a dog dumps on the floor,
do you pat its head and call it a genius?

112
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,629
No, you smack it
in the nose with a newspaper!

113
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,820
Dogs can learn things, House can't.

114
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,170
Coward.

115
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
Child.

116
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,310
Hey, there!

117
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,689
I brought my colleague
along to help out.

118
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,300
Hi, I'm Dr. Chase.

119
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,610
Hi.

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,439
Well, ultrasound looks good.
No sign of fetal distress.

121
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,979
So it's not preeclampsia?

122
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Well, it still could be, but
it hasn't progressed, at least.

123
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,669
We're gonna put you on bed rest
and monitor the baby.

124
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,990
Okay.

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,870
We'll give you some potassium
and magnesium as well.

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,819
So, we should keep the fluids running for now and check her
again in an hour unless there are signs of fetal distress or...

127
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,579
Honey? Wha... uh, she's choking!

128
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Lean forward.

129
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,479
What is, is she all right?

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,679
It's probably just some
muscle weakness.

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,689
What do you mean, probably?

132
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,820
Naomi, open up.

133
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,700
People choke,
it could be nothing.

134
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,110
You all right?

135
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,420
I can't, I can't, I can't even swallow.

136
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,319
She gets sick a lot but this, this
cold got really bad all of a sudden.

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
And the fever...

138
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,510
Shhhh, it's okay.

139
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
It's not a cold.

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
It's pneumonia.

141
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,309
Pneumonia?

142
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,900
Relax, pneumonia's her
second-biggest problem.

143
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,750
She has gone from the twenty-fifth weight
percentile to the third in one month.

144
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,800
Now, I'm not a baby expert but I'm pretty
sure they're not supposed to shrink.

145
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,139
Well, there's this diet we put her on
when we stopped breastfeeding...

146
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,979
But it's healthy, raw food. We're vegans.

147
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,979
Almond milk, tofu, vegetables...

148
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,400
Raw food. If only her ancestors
had mastered the secret of fire.

149
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,810
Babies need fat, proteins, calories.
Less important: Sprouts and hemp.

150
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,449
Starving babies is bad,
and illegal in many cultures.

151
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,450
I'm having her admitted.

152
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,589
Is she gonna be all right?

153
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,350
Antibiotics for the pneumonia,
IV feeding to get the weight up.

154
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,340
Don't worry, it's a vegan IV.

155
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,880
Don't see any signs of vasculitis.

156
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,430
Odd, since you're always
right about everything.

157
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,340
Could be a different auto-immunity.
Or you could bite me.

158
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,090
Oh, no.

159
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,540
Naomi, you okay?

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,910
I'm getting cramps.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Strong?

162
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,990
Yeah. Feels like my miscarriage.

163
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,589
It's preterm labor.

164
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,209
He's too little, he won't survive!

165
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,449
She's on magnesium already.

166
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,899
Fuse interbutoline, then.

167
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,379
We're going to give you some medicine,
okay? Try to stop your labor.

168
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,280
Okay. Okay.

169
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,050
There you are,
I've been looking everywhere for you.

170
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:53,589
Listen, you said I had to cut one of my people
if I didn't give that speech about your drug,

171
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,710
and in fairness to your point of view,

172
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,530
my speech really wasn't the one
you had in mind, so I've cut Cameron.

173
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,660
Now we're all squared away, right?

174
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,259
In the morning, I expect you in my
office with your letter of resignation

175
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,380
and plans for a public apology,
otherwise I'll destroy you.

176
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,190
So that's a 'no' on us
being squared away.

177
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,740
She might make it to full term.

178
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,799
Contractions are less frequent
and not well organized.

179
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,460
Great to see you back in the office.

180
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,020
I guess Vogler found you?

181
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,660
Yeah, we had a nice little chat.

182
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,130
I really should have kept Cameron.

183
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,259
She knew where to find the sugar.

184
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,369
It's what I said. Preeclampsia.

185
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,770
A little stress from the MRA,
she pops straight into labor.

186
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,909
What about the myasthenia?

187
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,519
Come on, she didn't seem that weak.

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,159
She choked, she couldn't even swallow.

189
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,360
What did she choke on?

190
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,639
Her food. The muscle weakness
isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.

191
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,730
What kind of food?

192
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,519
A little bit of cooked pear,
it doesn't matter! It shows weakness.

193
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,630
She choked on soft, wet pear.

194
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,860
Did she forget to take the bones out?

195
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,680
That's way past muscle weakness.

196
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,909
Did you do an upper endoscopy?

197
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,030
You think there's something
obstructing her esophagus?

198
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,330
We've gotta talk.

199
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,140
Oh. We've gotta talk.

200
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,390
And check her eyelids.

201
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
Check her eyelids?

202
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,630
Special board meeting today,
only one item on the agenda: You.

203
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,829
Well, enjoy the bagels. I'm untouchable.

204
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,310
Huh. Right.

205
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,309
Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be
unanimous. I've got you and maybe even Cuddy.

206
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,270
Oh, well that settles it.

207
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:53,589
Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider
will be totally stymied, go home,

208
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,479
curl up on the floor of
his shower and weep.

209
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,209
What can he do?
I've got a contract.

210
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,129
Does it say how much
your team gets paid?

211
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,589
Where your parking space is?

212
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,520
If your car should be filled
with horse manure?

213
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,010
Vogler's smart.

214
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,259
He's got some plan to get you.

215
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Does it involve candy?

216
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,070
Because I'm a sucker for chocolates.

217
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,380
She's doing better.

218
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh, thank God.

219
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,380
Technically, Alexander Fleming.

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,120
He developed antibiotics.

221
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,419
Pneumonia's under control,

222
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,080
and from now on, what say you
go with human food. OK?

223
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,510
Absolutely, swear to God.

224
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,520
This time, that's your guy.

225
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,460
Rachel and Joel Kaplan?

226
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,620
Yes?

227
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,609
You're under arrest.
Give the right to remain silent...

228
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,300
What did we do?

229
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,359
You're being charged
with child endangerment.

230
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,639
What? How? We...

231
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,819
Starving your kid.

232
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm from Social Services,
we're taking responsibility for your baby.

233
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
This is how Vogler's gonna destroy me?

234
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,389
What did he do, grease your cane?

235
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,160
He had my patients arrested.

236
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,990
No. He didn't, I did.

237
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,390
The nurses were concerned
and they called me.

238
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,539
There was evidence of abuse.

239
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,379
You took a big
legal risk by not calling Social Services.

240
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,229
Those parents were not
abusive, they're idiots.

241
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,269
Oh, well that's certainly a relief.

242
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,389
It was my call.

243
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,390
You made the wrong one.

244
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,559
You know, there's a new biography
of Quisling, I think you might like it.

245
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,100
Sure. No idea who that is.

246
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,510
Norwegian guy,
World War II, traitor.

247
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,539
The fact that I have to explain
this kind of takes the edge off my flow.

248
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
I was protecting you.

249
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,259
From what?
Cops aren't gonna bust me.

250
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,789
Disiplinary committee maybe
gives me a slap on the wrist.

251
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,099
And Vogler has an excuse
to get rid of you.

252
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,700
If I don't give him one,
he makes one up.

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,869
Vogler's just one vote.

254
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,000
He's gotta convince the other eleven of us.

255
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm just trying to stop you from
making that extra easy.

256
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,420
Sean, do your wife's eyelids
look any different than usual?

257
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,500
Maybe one is drooping a little bit,
but you know, she's tired, so...

258
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,050
Naomi, can you open your mouth
for me and tilt your head back?

259
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

260
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,830
Yeah, there's swelling,
indenting the esophagus.

261
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,499
Is that why she choked?

262
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,969
We'll need to do an x-ray.

263
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,159
What? No, the baby...
you said no x-rays.

264
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
It's important.

265
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,660
She has a three centimeter mass
in her right upper lobe.

266
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,100
Maybe it's a granuloma.

267
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,790
No. There's no calcification.

268
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,470
It's small-cell lung cancer.

269
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,760
The tumor's starting to press
against your esophagus.

270
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,430
It hasn't metastasized,

271
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,910
but it has spread to other parts
of your lungs so we can't operate.

272
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,989
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

273
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,949
She had kidney failure
and brain problems...

274
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,110
Some cancer patients get what are
called paraneoplastic syndromes.

275
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,409
You were making antibodies
to fight the tumor.

276
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,849
They got sidetracked
and attacked other cells:

277
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,449
Your brain first,
then your liver, kidneys...

278
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,160
even the nerves that
control your eyelids.

279
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,610
That's called Lambert-Eaton syndrome,

280
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,760
it told us the tumor was in the lungs.

281
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,080
How bad is it?

282
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,190
Small-cell is the most
aggressive kind of lung cancer.

283
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,730
The five-year survival rate is
only about ten to fifteen percent,

284
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,509
which is why we need to start you
on chemo and radiation right away.

285
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,329
Not radiation, what about the baby?

286
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,650
You'll need a C-section before
you can start the treatment.

287
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,729
I can get you in first thing
tomorrow morning.

288
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,860
What are the chances my baby will survive?

289
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,630
Pretty good. Twenty-eight weeks,
so about eighty percent.

290
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,120
No, wait, that's one in
five chance he'll die?

291
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,330
I really wouldn't advise waiting.

292
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,859
Naomi, you've got to start
this treatment right away...

293
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,090
What happens if I wait?

294
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,400
Twenty-nine weeks, survival rate
is closer to ninety percent.

295
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm not doing the radiation.

296
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
You'll die...

297
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,949
Listen, you know the chances, they're nothing,
but a few more weeks will save the baby.

298
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,219
Listen, you're depressed right now,
and you're not thinking right.

299
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,210
Sweetie...

300
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,530
Could you just, tell her, please?

301
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,350
This cancer moves quick.

302
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,280
The median survival's two to four months.

303
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,300
If you postpone, even for a week...

304
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,310
I'm sorry, honey.

305
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,680
As most of you know, Gregory House
recently gave a speech about me.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,160
I'd like to return the favor.

307
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,810
Sorry.

308
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Dr. Wilson.

309
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
I was hoping you were
going to miss this one.

310
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,470
A man is the sum of his actions.
Here are a few of Dr. House's.

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,880
He violated a DNR and
was charged with assault.

312
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,720
He brought a termite into
the OR and spat on a surgeon.

313
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,249
He accepted a Corvette from a patient who
was a known member of the New Jersey mafia.

314
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,910
Ed, look...

315
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,910
Edward.

316
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,330
Edward.

317
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,329
You look at anyone's career,
you can find things that are...

318
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,930
These are the last three months.

319
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,799
He's personally had more complaints filed against
him than any department in this hospital.

320
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
Okay, he's screwed up.

321
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,839
He's miserable, and he should
probably reread the Ethics Code,

322
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,349
but it works for him.
He's saved hundreds of lives.

323
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,839
He is a drug addict who flaunts his
addiction and refuses to get treatment.

324
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,380
He is a disgrace and
an embarrassment to this hospital.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,230
I'd go on, but it gets kinda mean,
so I'm gonna keep this simple.

326
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,870
House goes, or I go.

327
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,799
You shouldn't personalize this.

328
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,920
And by I, I mean my $100 million.

329
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,350
How's that for personalizing?

330
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,040
You gave us that money for a reason.

331
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,350
Are you really willing to throw it
all away because of one doctor?

332
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,660
Gregory House is a symbol of everything
wrong with the healthcare industry.

333
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,480
Waste, insubordination,

334
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,039
doctors preening like they're kings

335
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,200
and the hospital
their own private fiefdom.

336
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,620
Healthcare is a business,
I'm gonna run it like one.

337
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,259
I hereby move to revoke
the tenure of Dr. Gregory House

338
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,689
and terminate his employment
at this hospital, effective immediately.

339
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,499
Don't you think we should discuss this...

340
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,350
We just did.

341
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,190
We need time.

342
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,810
The vote is on the table. All in favor?

343
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,650
Dr. Wilson?

344
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Opposed?

345
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,420
The motion is defeated.

346
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,580
Dr. Wilson, would you mind
leaving the room, please?

347
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,040
Excuse me?

348
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,550
We're gonna take another vote.

349
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,640
Well, first of all, you can't void my vote
by making me stand in the hallway.

350
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,880
And second, you should check the by-laws.

351
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,239
You need notice and at
least one business day

352
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,979
before you can reconsider any matter.

353
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
We're voting on a different
matter which you are...

354
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,830
conflicted out of.

355
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,690
How can I be conflicted?

356
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
This vote is whether to
dismiss Dr. James Wilson.

357
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:47,500
Naomi is refusing to have the C-section.
Her odds aren't good enough.

358
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,270
They do suck. Where's Wilson?

359
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Paged him twice.

360
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,119
She does this,
she knows she's gonna die.

361
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,370
She's saving her child.

362
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,080
Cameron would point out that
people are capable of sacrifice.

363
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,279
Cameron isn't here.

364
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,959
Perhaps proving her point.

365
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,200
You think this woman is
making a rational decision?

366
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,050
I think people can
overcome their baser drives.

367
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,910
Pretty damn rarely. And not this
time, this is purely biological.

368
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,430
In evolutionary terms, the needs of
the next generation are more important.

369
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
You're saying she's making the right call?

370
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,590
Darwin is, I'm not.
The next generation is not my patient.

371
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,170
We have to raise the odds for Mommy.

372
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,470
And where the hell is Wilson?
He's the oncologist.

373
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,090
Good plan, cure cancer.

374
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,350
Surprised no one ever
thought of that before.

375
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,010
There he is. Dr. House!

376
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,019
You guys bust out?

377
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,190
We made bail.
They won't let us in our baby's room.

378
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,419
Weird. You'd think they'd
let you take her home

379
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,679
while they figured out if
you tried to kill her.

380
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,679
We're good parents, we fed her
whenever she was hungry.

381
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,919
Big meals. We had no idea
that diet was so bad for her.

382
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
The nutritionist said
it had everything she needed!

383
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,959
The kid who stacks the
free-range grapefruit

384
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,389
in your health food
store is not a nutritionist.

385
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,670
But my uncle is.
He went to college and everything.

386
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,590
Foreman, I need a CT scan on...

387
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Olive Kaplan.

388
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,110
Seriously?

389
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,060
Olive Kaplan. Look for
abscesses or occult infections.

390
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Bye.

391
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,739
Listen, Vogler's all about clinical trials

392
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,340
,
the hospital's chock full of them.

393
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,240
There's got to be something
for small-cell lung cancer.

394
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,510
What are you doing?

395
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I got sacked.

396
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,820
Did you make a pass at Cuddy?

397
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,550
Told you, she only has thighs for me.

398
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,240
I voted to keep you.

399
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,030
So he's getting rid of every board member
who votes to keep me around?

400
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,120
Yeah, every one of us.

401
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,950
Just you?

402
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Yeah.

403
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,920
But you're only off the board, right?

404
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,820
They couldn't have got
unanimous approval for you.

405
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,310
Brown from Oncology voted no,
so did Cuddy, Taylor and Peevey.

406
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,290
Eh, so you're off the board, big deal.

407
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,259
Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling.
You're still a doctor...

408
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,080
Yeah, getting dumped looks
great in Who's Who.

409
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,770
Vogler gave me the option of
resigning, and I took it.

410
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,320
Big of him.

411
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,709
I've got no kids,
my marriage sucks.

412
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,350
I've only got two things
that work for me:

413
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,619
This job and this stupid,
screwed-up friendship,

414
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,070
and neither mattered enough
to you to give one lousy speech.

415
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
They mattered.

416
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,930
If I could do it all again...

417
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,420
You'd do the same thing.

418
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,090
Well, you'll be gone soon, too.

419
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,610
Those clinical trials?

420
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,250
I'll make some calls.

421
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,170
Thanks.

422
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,440
It's not cancer.

423
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,530
It's not gonna kill me?

424
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,850
It's hemorrhoids.

425
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,949
But all that blood...
that can't be right?

426
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,100
Looks worse than it is.

427
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,349
Nice job of protecting me.

428
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,000
Can this wait?

429
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,900
His ass can wait.
You saved my job by sacking Wilson?

430
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,521
What did you think would happen
when you made that speech?

431
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,430
You think he would just pout for a
little while and we'd all forgive you?

432
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,980
You don't spit on the man
who signs your paycheck.

433
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,850
First Cameron, then Wilson... you're next.

434
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,270
Pull your pants up.

435
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,270
So it's about the money.

436
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,756
Of course it's about the money.

437
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,209
The money Vogler gave,
he could have bought a few jets,

438
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,490
maybe a baseball team, or just stuck it in
Chase Manhattan and collected interested.

439
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,480
But he gave it to us
to buy equipment, to do research!

440
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,100
You are a great doctor, House,
but you are not worth $100 million.

441
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,279
We've sequenced the DNA of the tumor cells.

442
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,380
P53 gene mutation and codon 55.
She's perfect for your trial.

443
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,170
She's pretty far advanced.

444
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,730
Well, you want easy cases,
you picked the wrong speciality.

445
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Otherwise in good health?

446
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Excellent.

447
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,270
When can she start?

448
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,770
Middle of next week.

449
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,099
Cancer's already stage 3,
it'd be a waste of time.

450
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,360
She can start in two days.

451
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,890
She can't start in two days!
She's pregnant!

452
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,240
She won't be in two days.
I've scheduled a C-section.

453
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,930
She'd still have to wait a month.

454
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,490
You can't take part in an trials
until 30 days after major sugery.

455
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,129
Well, it's definitely surgery, but major?

456
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,130
It's not your call.

457
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,360
Again, a question of interpretation.

458
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,660
You're scamming a doctor, now?

459
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,189
Come on, Vogler's looking for
any excuse to can you.

460
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,070
Oh, I think he's got
a big bag of those already.

461
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,180
These regulations aren't
just here to annoy you.

462
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,710
Okay? Doing this is
dangerous to the patient.

463
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,570
Well, I'll be sure to let her know that.
Care to join me?

464
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,970
Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent
the tumors from creating blood vessels.

465
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,850
Without blood, the tumor starves.

466
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,440
- That sounds great...
- What about the baby?

467
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,360
The treatment would be fatal to the baby.

468
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,960
I've scheduled a C-section
for this afternoon.

469
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
No.

470
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,257
It's in the trial phase right now,

471
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:05,450
but so far complete remission
in more than thirty percent of subjects.

472
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,789
I told Dr. Foreman I
didn't want a C-section.

473
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,700
When your chances of living were
less than a third of what they are now.

474
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,069
Well, the baby's premature, that...

475
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,399
Our pediatrics department has the
best neonatal ICU in the state.

476
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,689
No, his lungs, his brain, he's not ready.

477
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,439
And he could be fine!

478
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,550
You don't know what it's
like, raising a sick child!

479
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,050
His odds are much better than yours are.

480
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,930
You have to let them at least try this.

481
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Talk to her.

482
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,070
Okay. Leave the room.

483
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,630
How long have you been
taking oxybutynin?

484
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,080
Since I was about twenty.

485
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,930
Incontinence is pretty uncommon
in a woman of your age.

486
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,570
It's even more bizarre
in a woman in her twenties.

487
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,530
I guess I haven't had the best luck
when it comes to my health.

488
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,250
Seems that way.

489
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,620
You said to your husband,

490
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,120
"You don't know what it's like,
raising a sick child."

491
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,980
You didn't say,
"You don't know what it would be like."

492
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,350
This is not your first child, is it?

493
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,600
And he doesn't know.

494
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,450
I was eighteen.
Got pregnant, got married.

495
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,520
I had the most beautiful
little girl, Grace.

496
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,310
She had infantile Alexander's disease.

497
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,520
I'm sorry.

498
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,690
For two years we watched her die.

499
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,200
My husband was,
my first husband was a, a great guy,

500
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,210
but after that I couldn't even look
at him without thinking of her.

501
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,619
I left him, I left my job,
I left everthing...

502
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,500
Very moving story.
Explains why you're being so selfish.

503
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,229
I'm willing to die
to protect my husband.

504
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,759
Because it's what you want.
Your husband wants you to live.

505
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,809
Well, he doesn't understand...

506
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,720
Oh, who the hell does?
Tragedies happen.

507
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,839
You think that turning
yourself into a disposable incubator

508
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,879
for a few weeks is going to protect
your baby from all the crap in this world

509
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,190
go ahead, die happy.

510
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,739
I got no problems with
people killing themselves,

511
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,180
but don't think it makes you a hero.

512
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Okay.

513
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,930
You're scheduled for 4 P.M.

514
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,610
Yes, this is Dr. Lim.

515
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,900
Count down from ten.

516
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Okay.

517
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Ten...

518
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Nine...

519
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Eight...

520
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,740
That seemed kind of fast, is she all right?

521
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
She's fine.

522
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,080
Wake her up.
That was Vogler. Surgery's off.

523
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,480
Hey! You're killing her!

524
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,579
Really? See, I thought you
were the one trying to ram

525
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,809
her into a drug trial five minutes...

526
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,219
She knows the risks,
she was fully informed...

527
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,789
Well, the guy running
the study sure wasn't.

528
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,479
- Not his life, not his call!
- His study, his call!

529
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
Right, so she kicks off,
his number look bad.

530
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,759
The numbers look bad,
the study looks bad!

531
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Which would cost you money!

532
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,700
Yeah and keep a life-saving
protocol off the market!

533
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,659
One person, one blip in the data!

534
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,249
You ever heard of the FDA?
They eat blips for breakfast!

535
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,839
One person should never endanger thousands!

536
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,340
Well, thank God you were here
to save all those lives!

537
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,190
The board's meeting again this evening.

538
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,370
Why don't you settle down?
Play some Game Boy.

539
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,110
Why don't you watch your soap?

540
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,158
I hear they're firing the
handsome doctor today,

541
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,640
boy, that should be a good one.

542
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,459
If we had the C-section anyway,

543
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,770
she could
still do the experimental treatment, right?

544
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,739
We'd just have to wait thirty days.

545
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,889
Assuming the doctor running the trial
isn't too pissed off to let her in, yeah.

546
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,010
And assuming I'm even healthy enough to...

547
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,699
Honey? Are you okay?

548
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,540
Stats are dropping. Down to the 80s.
Stay with us, Naomi.

549
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,480
What's going on?

550
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:10,681
We need you to leave the room.

551
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,709
Respiratory distress.

552
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,169
Could you just tell me what's going on?

553
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,170
We're trying to find out.

554
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,570
- Still kicking.
- Flash pulmonary edema?

555
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,940
Lungs are clear. There it is.

556
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,100
- Pulmonary embolus.
- Gotta get her to an OR.

557
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
What happened?

558
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,499
It's an embolism. A blood clot.
It's fairly common with lung cancer.

559
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,180
It's not a full saddle embolism,
so blood's still trickling through.

560
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,479
We've been able to get
Naomi breathing a little, but

561
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,729
we need to remove the clot, and we
need you to approve the treatment.

562
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,379
Yeah, of course
. Whatever you have to do, just do it!

563
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
It's not that simple.

564
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,830
Okay. The best course for the baby
would be an immediate C-section.

565
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,600
The longer we postpone,

566
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,459
the greater chance it'll have
brain damage from lack of oxygen.

567
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,580
Fine, whatever, just do it!

568
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
Here's the problem.

569
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,480
The C-section would be very,
very dangerous for Naomi.

570
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Dangerous, like...

571
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,260
In her current condition, there's a
real chance she wouldn't survive.

572
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,190
I'm sorry.

573
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,980
Look, your wife's unconscious,
we need you to make a decision.

574
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,180
I just want her to live. No C-section.

575
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,769
Stats are still way down.
We've got to push the streptokinase.

576
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,770
Too risky.

577
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,099
Even if it dissolves the clot, she
could still bleed out anyway.

578
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,689
She's hemodynamically compromised.

579
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,770
It's not good for the baby.

580
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Dad doesn't care.

581
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,050
Embolcine 250,000 units.

582
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,320
BP's dropping. Pressers!

583
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,390
We don't have time.
We've gotta suck it out.

584
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,520
Systolic BP's 80.

585
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,700
BP's stabilizing, O2 stats rising.

586
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,699
Did you get the clot?

587
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,760
I think so. She's stabilized.

588
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,130
How long was her oxygen at that level?

589
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,500
Ten minutes?

590
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:22,959
Brain function compromised?

591
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,180
Souldn't be but it will...

592
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,910
BP's dropping. Up the dopamine.

593
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,009
She's not responding. How much?

594
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,089
She's up to 30 micrograms!

595
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,090
Is she septic?

596
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,510
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

597
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,160
We won't be able to stop it.

598
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll go talk to the husband.

599
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:47,290
No, you stay here. Keep her as stable
as you can for as long as you can.

600
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,240
She had trauma during the procedure.

601
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,490
She's bleeding into her abdomen.

602
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,530
There's nothing we can do. I'm sorry.

603
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,740
No.

604
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,319
I need you to okay the C-section.

605
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,790
Yeah, that's gonna kill her, right?

606
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
It probably will.

607
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,130
I can't do that.

608
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,080
She's dying either way.

609
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,079
I'm sorry, I'm...

610
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,000
Stay with me, Sean.
I need your okay on this.

611
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,729
She makes the decisions, and I'm...

612
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,930
Right, and that's gonna be tough
from now on, but this decision is easy.

613
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
You know what she'd want.

614
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,729
I can't do it.

615
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,969
You make this call,
only two things change.

616
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,049
One: Yeah, you feel guilty
for killing your wife.

617
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,820
Two: Your baby lives.

618
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,040
Naomi's baby lives.

619
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,650
Okay, okay.

620
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,049
He's out. Umbilical cord's clamped.

621
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,050
No respiration.

622
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,390
His lungs aren't opening up.

623
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,890
They aren't mature.

624
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,370
Come on, take a breath.
You know you can do it.

625
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
What've you got?

626
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Looks like v-fib.

627
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,710
Pulse?

628
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,810
No. Paddles!

629
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,800
Come on, come on.

630
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,450
Clear!

631
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,560
Nothing.

632
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,400
Charging.

633
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Come on, open up.

634
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
How's he doing?

635
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,000
He's still not breathing.
We've got to intubate.

636
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,410
Clear!

637
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Thank you.

638
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,550
I'm late for the board meeting.

639
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,749
- We need to talk.
- I don't want to hear it.

640
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,710
It's about a patient.

641
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,680
The pregnant woman?

642
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,399
She wasn't qualified for that trial
and I'm not going to apologize...

643
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
I'm not talking about her.

644
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,400
At this point I think it's best that I
concentrate on patients who are still alive.

645
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,690
Pulmonary embolism.
She bled out. Saved her son.

646
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,630
This is Olive Kaplan's CT scan,
the incredible shrinking baby.

647
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,460
Her thymus gland...

648
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,180
DiGeorge Syndrome.

649
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,860
It's genetic, can cause the
gland to wither to nothing.

650
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,530
This is why she couldn't gain weight.

651
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Yeah.

652
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,860
I'll call the police and Social Services
and have all the charges withdrawn.

653
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,039
I've sent a test down to confirm.

654
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,759
When it comes back you should start
Olive on immunoglobulin replacement.

655
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
You're not going to do it?

656
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,720
I assume I won't be here.

657
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,400
Your boy's doing good.

658
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,260
It's the same motion as yesterday,
people, same reasons.

659
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,970
All those in favor of dismissing
Gregory House raise a hand.

660
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,380
Dr. Cuddy, you realize
this is going to happen.

661
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,760
I can't do it.

662
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,270
You can't abstain.

663
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,090
I'm not abstaining, I'm voting no.

664
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,570
You've changed your mind since yesterday?

665
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,359
What did he do,
buy you dinner and roses?

666
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,659
Threaten to drown your dog?

667
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,760
He did his job.

668
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,959
Right. He saved another life.

669
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,740
Maybe.

670
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:51,059
Good for him. It's great.
It's not the point.

671
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,259
It's what we do.

672
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,959
And you could do it a lot better if you
didn't have to worry about some madman

673
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,889
running around the hospital
accountable to no one!

674
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,309
But that's not the choice you're giving us.

675
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,929
House won't listen to anyone...

676
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,810
And you're not accountable
to anybody, either!

677
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,060
Because you think you own us.

678
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,599
I move for the immediate
dismissal of Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

679
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,420
She's upset, we all are. Why would
you risk your career to save him?

680
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,139
If you think House deserves to go,
if you think I deserve to go,

681
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,220
Wilson deserved to go, then vote yes.

682
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,980
But if you're doing this because you are
afraid of losing his money, then he's right!

683
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,450
He does own you.

684
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,840
You have a choice.
Maybe the last real one you'll have here.

685
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,870
Cuddy is a genius,

686
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,740
convincing four people to give up
a fortune to save our sorry asses.

687
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,770
Dr. Cuddy!

688
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,090
The man of the hour.

689
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,560
What are you doing?

690
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,961
We're drinking. I would have thought
that was pretty obvious.

691
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,240
Well, to the great champion.

692
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,780
Saved you, saved Wilson,
saved the whole team.

693
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,459
Of course, none of them
would have needed saving

694
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,170
if you could actually get
along with another human being.

695
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,879
Thank you, Miss Buzzkill.

696
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,930
Well, you only cost us $100 million.

697
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,499
Could have saved some lives,
could have made a few jobs,

698
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,130
helped a few people. Yippee.

699
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,930
You voted to get rid of him.

700
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,080
The lesser of two evils.

701
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,610
You should be mourning.
I know I am.
