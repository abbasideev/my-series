1
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:20,379
Will it be much longer?

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,682
We'll call you when we're ready.

3
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,976
I've been waiting almost an hour.

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,290
We'll call you when we're ready.

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,765
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:50,870
So she's really coming back?

7
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:52,561
Who's coming back?

8
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,632
You don't know her.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,220
You give her a raise?

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,580
Increase her benefits?

11
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:02,610
Don't have TiVo on this thing,
can't rewind. Shut up.

12
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,650
You lower her hours?

13
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,610
You don't even know her.

14
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:10,100
Who is this guy?

15
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:11,806
He's a patient.

16
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,480
He's examining me.

17
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:16,474
He's got to go back to work
as soon as I'm done with the examination.

18
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,620
Guess I do, too.

19
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:20,810
It's got to be something.

20
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,509
I mean, she didn't come back
because she likes you.

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,070
Wait a minute!

22
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,140
She did come back
because she likes you!

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,870
You dog! You slept with her!

24
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:39,090
Keep talking. I'll finish your exam
with a prostate check.

25
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:42,513
I've agreed to take her on one date.

26
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,514
What?

27
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:45,564
So, you into this girl?

28
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:46,109
Yes.

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,066
No! She's not giving me any choice.

30
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,740
Wait... she's making you do her?

31
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,625
Date her.

32
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:59,010
Young ingenue doctor
falling in love with gruff, older mentor.

33
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:02,550
Her sweet gentle nature
bringing him to a closer,

34
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,120
fuller understanding
of his wounded heart.

35
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:09,180
Do her, or you're gay.

36
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,820
For God's sake.

37
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:17,620
- Sitting in a tree, K-i-s-s-i-n-g.
- Grow up. And learn to harmonize.

38
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,360
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,960
Who the hell walks around
with an open urine sample?

40
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm sorry, I didn't,
uh, I didn't...

41
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,538
You think that was
a bit of an overreaction?

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,380
Well, he peed on me.
I'm not into that.

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,400
It's apple juice.
Now go find that man and apologize.

44
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,843
One more patient complaint
and you're looking at a suspension.

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,340
I forgive you for ruining my jacket.

46
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:05,790
Look, you seem like
a regular kind of guy,

47
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,390
not the type to get another regular
guy into trouble, am I right?

48
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:16,260
Twenty bucks cash if you'll stop crying.

49
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:21,730
Forgive me, yell at me, just give
me something I can work with, okay?

50
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,230
Game's over. You two make nice?

51
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,710
Get a wheelchair, and
get this guy into the ER.

52
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,850
- What happened?
- Right pupil's blown.

53
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,070
Holy... you gave the guy a stroke?

54
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,480
So the bear wipes himself with the rabbit.

55
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Lame.

56
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,440
Hey!

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
Yo!

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,040
What are you doing here?

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
I work here.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,839
What, here in this office?

61
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,499
House practically
begged me to come back.

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,409
Please tell me
you took him to the cleaners?

63
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,670
Same lousy salary.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Then why'd you do it?

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,260
'Cause this is the happiest place on Earth.

66
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,670
21-year-old male, comes in
with grinding of the teeth.

67
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,009
And House gives him a stroke,
totally blows out his pupil.

68
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,689
You scared a guy into stroking out?

69
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,519
Does that surprise anyone here?

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,929
Blown pupils usually means
brain stem edema.

71
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,689
Sure, but since he's not dead or in a coma,

72
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve.

73
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,090
CT scan shows two things.

74
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,529
Ischemia. Death of brain tissue.

75
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,730
Means there's been some damage,
hopefully not permanent.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
And?

77
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,009
That's it. There's nothing there to tell us
what the underlying cause is.

78
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,060
We've got to do an MRI.

79
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,390
You're looking at the
wrong part of the scan.

80
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,770
I'm looking at the brain,
what else is there?

81
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,090
The jaw.

82
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,520
The jaw tells us why he stroked?

83
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,270
No, the jaw tells us
why we can't do an MRI.

84
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,040
Unless we want his jawbone
flying across the room.

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,639
Metal plate.
He's had major reconstruction

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,280
and there's no way we're removing it,
so we're forced to be clever.

87
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,939
Angiogram to rule out vascultis,

88
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,280
EMG for peripheral neuropathy,
tox screen to eliminate drugs,

89
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,810
an echo to rule out cardiac emboli.

90
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,040
Dr. Cameron.

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,220
I'd appreciate you keeping the terms
of your new contract to yourself.

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,160
Don't want everyone
clamoring for the same perks.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
What perks?

94
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,509
Nothing you'd be interested in.

95
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,510
So it's not money, then?

96
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,759
Office space,
insurance, parking...

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
anything he could offer
you, we'd be interested in.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,680
He agreed to go on a date with me.

99
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,040
A date? Date, dinner and a movie,
naked and sweaty date?

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,130
He only committed to the first two.

101
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,110
He's so, he's so old!

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,000
And you're so young.

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,009
It's a big mistake.

104
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,740
It's my boss. I'm allowed
to sexually harass my boss.

105
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,899
I'll arrange for the EMG,
you want to set up the angiogram,

106
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,550
and you get the blood samples,
patient history, patient consent?

107
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,310
Like watching an accident
about to happen.

108
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,790
Morning! Harvey, I'm Dr. Foreman.
I'm here to discuss your case.

109
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,170
I'm Annette, I'm Harvey's friend.

110
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Nice to meet you.

111
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,830
I need your next of kin, you didn't
fill that out on your intake form.

112
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,090
Harvey's parents are dead.
They died two years ago in a car crash.

113
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,730
I see. So, Harvey,
you have any siblings?

114
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,580
No, and no grandparents
or uncles or aunts.

115
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,699
Annette, I don't want to
have to ask you to leave.

116
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,870
I want her to stay.

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,500
Well, she can stay.

118
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,270
You do the talking.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,760
Why'd you come
to the clinic this morning?

120
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,020
About six months ago,
I started grinding my...

121
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,190
you know, in your mouth,
you get, you chew with them...

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Teeth.

123
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,030
Harvey's experiencing
a little nominal aphasia,

124
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,529
you know, when you can't
remember nouns.

125
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,910
Yeah, I think I know
what nominal aphasia is.

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,400
Have you had any treatment
for the teeth grinding?

127
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,729
I went to a, you know, they do that
thing with sharp, uh, pointy things.

128
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,129
Needles?
Someone took your blood.

129
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,459
No, they make you breathe.

130
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,180
Pulmonologist.

131
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:21,819
No, she had this, uh,
electrical machine...

132
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,390
He saw an acupuncturist.

133
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,240
Do you know what the acupuncturist did?

134
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,940
She diagnosed Liver Qi stagnation
and sent Harvey to a Shen balancer.

135
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,659
He referred him to a homeopathic
doctor who sent him to chiropractor.

136
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,610
Naturally.

137
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,179
Well, the chiropractor
thought it might be food

138
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,080
sensitivity and sent
Harvey to a naturopath.

139
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,140
The naturopath sent me back to the...

140
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,720
Back to the acupuncturist.

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Yes.

142
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,650
Okay. Well, we'll need to see the records
from all of those practitioners.

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Thanks.

144
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
Everything set for the angiogram?

145
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,410
Cameron's got the EMG first.

146
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Who's that?

147
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,190
Harvey's guru.

148
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,470
That's what she called herself?

149
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,280
That's what she acted like.

150
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,980
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.

151
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,470
Pleasure to meet you.

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,090
My OB/GYN died recently.
He's a nice man. Warm hands.

153
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,479
Not anymore. So,
does it hurt when you tinkle?

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,930
Yeah, it's when it's worse.

155
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,030
You have some vaginal tearing.

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,930
No sign of brusing, no indication
of trauma, forced entry...

157
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,880
Ramona. You naughty girl.

158
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,399
You've either got yourself
an 18-year-old boyfriend

159
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,630
or an 80-year-old with
some little blue pills.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,230
Myron thought
he'd just try them out!

161
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,820
Lucky you.

162
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,850
I guess.

163
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,050
You prefer it
if Myron was a little droopier?

164
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:27,030
Maybe a little. We used to hold hands,
or read together, or watch Jeopardy!

165
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,530
I haven't seen Jeopardy!
In almost a month!

166
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,400
Have you talked to him about this?

167
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,950
You try talking a 73-year-old out of sex.

168
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,269
With all these male enhancements
the pressure to put out's incredible.

169
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,150
It's worse than high school.

170
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,529
He doesn't get
what he wants from me,

171
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,210
he'll get it from Connie
in the corner condo.

172
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,440
She's dying her hair red!
Major league slut.

173
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,950
Here's a prescription for
vaginal estrogen suppositories.

174
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,529
It'll help with the lubrication.

175
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,530
Thank you.

176
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,830
Maybe you could give
Myron a prescription.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,300
Something weaker
than he's got now?

178
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,650
Tell him it's better
for his heart, he'd buy that.

179
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,000
You can't tell him the truth,
so you want me to lie to him?

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Would you?

181
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,030
Close your legs.

182
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,550
Nerves stimulate muscles to move
by creating a small electrical current.

183
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,610
The machine will measure that.

184
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,660
And I will insert this needle into
various muscles and ask you to flex.

185
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,429
Sometimes it can be painful.
Let me know, and I can pull back...

186
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,920
No. I mean, it's okay.

187
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,890
Okay. Put your arm out to the side.

188
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,150
You all right?

189
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm good.
You don't have to stop.

190
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,160
Raise your arm up over your head.

191
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,859
The EMG was clean.

192
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,139
Well, based on this history
it's either toxic herbs from

193
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,519
the homeopath, spinal damage
from the chiropractor,

194
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,859
infection from the needle
that the acupuncturist

195
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,070
accidentally let sit in eye of
newt, or the Shen balancer.

196
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,749
What the hell is a "shen"
and how come it's lopsided?

197
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,720
The only abnormal test result
we found was on the echo report.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,540
Mitral valve prolapse.

199
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,419
Hang up a shingle and condemn the
narrowness and greed of Western medicine,

200
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,040
you'd make a damn fine living.

201
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,880
Clot's formed on a faulty valve,
gets sent to the brain, voila! Stroke.

202
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,119
Of course, no harm, no foul.

203
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,180
It's just taking a few bucks
from superstitious idiots, right?

204
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,360
Could also be an aneurysm due to trauma.

205
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,589
Trauma? From what,
the chiropractic treatments?

206
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,349
It's bacterial endocarditis,
an infected valve.

207
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,429
We should do blood cultures.

208
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,239
Except the six months that
he had with these charlatans

209
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,599
might have been better
spent going to someone who

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
looks at things that
exist in the real world.

211
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,069
But that's just me
being all narrow again.

212
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,249
I noticed a small bruit when
I listened to Harvey's left carotid.

213
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,429
You could hear that if you had
an aneurysm from trauma.

214
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,419
Aneurysm would have
shown on the angiogram.

215
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,710
No, not necessarily.

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Quite a dilemma.

217
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,600
Oh, great pool hall oracle,
grant me guidance.

218
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,439
Do we go with Foreman's theory,
which is at least marginally

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,930
supported by medical test
results, or Chase's theory,

220
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,900
which is completely
unsupported by medical evidence.

221
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,960
What to do...

222
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,979
The guy obviously broke
his jaw somehow.

223
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,620
Who knows what other
trauma he's suffered?

224
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,610
We should do the angiogram again.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,150
And all signs point to...

226
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,860
Sorry, Chase.
The gods have spoken.

227
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,980
Start Harvey on blood thinners
and antibiotics.

228
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,710
Wow. Yeah, I get it. House is adorable.

229
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,830
I just want to hold him and never let go.

230
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,160
Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing?

231
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,930
You're choking him!

232
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,199
Foreman, stop. Let her go.

233
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,170
She was trying to kill him!

234
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,540
No. No, she wasn't.

235
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,070
His vitals seem okay.

236
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,080
Please. Please don't hurt her.

237
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,450
What the hell is going on in here?

238
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,120
She's... she's a dominatrix.

239
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,680
Right, Annette?

240
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,969
The patient asked
you to strangle him?

241
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,840
Harvey is an asphyxiaphyliac.

242
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,890
He likes to be strangled or smothered.

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
That's just sick.

244
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,630
Well, that's an intriguing legal opinion.

245
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,629
Geez, what kind of a lawyer is he?

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,549
You want a legal opinion?
Call the cops.

247
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,640
I was careful. I watched the monitors,
made sure his O2 stats were over 90.

248
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
I would never hurt him.

249
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,910
Then what was the point?

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,880
Harvey was upset.
He needed to calm down.

251
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,790
To feel in control
by being controlled.

252
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,810
He pays you for this?

253
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,850
In return, he does
my taxes and cleans my house.

254
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,539
We're not done here,
we have to talk!

255
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,689
Call the cops, bar her from the hospital,
force her to pierce your nipples...

256
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,250
not really medical decisions.

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,380
It was a long time ago.
I was seeing this woman.

258
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,360
A banker, and turns out
she liked to be burned.

259
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,580
You actually dated someone
who likes to get burned?

260
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,019
Yeah, why would you want to
be in a relationship with

261
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,799
someone that's so obviously
only going to lead to pain?

262
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,330
Shut up.

263
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,999
It was a weird scene.
I observed...

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,180
Chase. Did you know about this woman?
What she does?

265
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,640
I met her at some parties, yeah.

266
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,140
I wouldn't have tortured you
if I knew you liked it.

267
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,610
Well, here's a phrase to remember:

268
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,989
"Hey, this guy might have been pounded
on the head one too many times!"

269
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,529
I said I thought it was
a trauma induced aneurysm.

270
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,310
Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight
if you'd mentioned the "liking pain" thing.

271
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,450
You're on my naughty list.

272
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,239
Sorry, no leather
stethoscope this Christmas.

273
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,030
I'm not into...

274
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,579
I assume you never started
him on antibiotics or blood

275
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,359
thinners before Mistress
Ilsa's rude interruption.

276
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,679
It was probably a good thing.

277
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,830
Start him on antibiotics
and blood thinners.

278
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,750
You still think Chase is wrong?

279
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,080
No, he's probably right.

280
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,620
Then we should schedule him
for vascular surgery.

281
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,509
Go into the carotids,
find the aneurysm, repair it.

282
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,369
If we put him on blood thinners,
he might bleed out.

283
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,770
But if Foreman's right about it
being bacterial endocarditis, and we...

284
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,630
I think Chase is right.

285
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,840
Okay, if Foreman used to be right
about it being blood clots,

286
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,289
and we take the surgery route,
then we'll probably kill the guy.

287
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,429
So, start him on blood
thinners, and if he has

288
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,400
another stroke, then we'll
schedule the surgery.

289
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,100
Yeah?

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
You Dr. House?

291
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,020
I have a feeling
I'm going to regret this, but yes.

292
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,230
Ramona said I should
come to you for my refill.

293
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,610
With, for the beginning to droop?

294
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,340
She said you'd probably
want to talk to me first.

295
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,650
She lied.

296
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
Here you go.

297
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,070
Thanks.

298
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,010
Always happy to
make people happy. Goodbye.

299
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,190
I... I don't know
how much more of this I can take.

300
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
How much more of what?

301
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,150
Sex.

302
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,790
You don't want more sex?

303
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,930
My golf swing is all messed up.

304
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,640
Hey, here's a radical thought.
Talk to her.

305
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,030
The truth?

306
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,119
Sounds crazy when you put it like that.

307
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,040
Oh, Ramona's got a big appetite.

308
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,640
If I don't perform,
I don't want to lose her.

309
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,570
You got a pharmacy around here?

310
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,640
In the hospital? Could be.
Let's see if we can find it.

311
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,190
Got any blue pills?

312
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,410
You looking for ED medication?

313
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,870
Well, that's one example
of a blue pill. Name six others.

314
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,129
There's a brand of acetaminophen out...

315
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,850
Perfect. Fill her up.

316
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
Dr. House.

317
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Little busy here.

318
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,919
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions
for coming back to work.

319
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,160
It's purely business.
I'll make sure you get the recipt.

320
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,100
Well, I think it's a good thing.

321
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,819
What happened in your
last relationship, it's

322
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,380
no reason to wall yourself
from people forever.

323
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,640
5 years of self-pity is probably enough.

324
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,180
Wow. Well, you've certainly
given me a lot to think about.

325
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,580
If only I was as open as you.

326
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,940
Well...

327
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:14,870
Actually, it was your blouse
I was talking about.

328
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,080
Bear in mind Cameron's probably
the only female that can tolerate you.

329
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,420
Wear the sky-blue shirt.
It almost makes you look nice.

330
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,960
They said she couldn't
come back into the hospital.

331
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,990
They won't let me see her.

332
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,640
Harvey, you're lucky
she wasn't arrested.

333
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,070
What were you thinking,
doing that at a hospital?

334
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,990
Squeeze my fingers?

335
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,880
I was scared.

336
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,840
I need you to squeeze with both hands.

337
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,790
I am.

338
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,950
Weakness in his right arm and hand.

339
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,259
Harvey's having mini-strokes. The blood
thinners aren't making a difference.

340
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,260
Stop the treatment.

341
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,790
Sorry, we tried your way,
you could not have been wronger.

342
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,290
I said Chase was probably right.

343
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,360
Oh yeah, we've all got
perfect 20-20 hindsight.

344
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,610
Get a hold of Main in vascular, see if his
surgical dance card is free for tomorrow.

345
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,330
About tomorrow night.

346
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,289
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

347
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,510
I didn't see any reason to.

348
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,120
Where are we going? I want to
make sure I dress appropriately.

349
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,090
That would be army boots and t-shirt.

350
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,510
It's the county paintball tourney.

351
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,710
First prize is fifty bucks. I'll split
it with you if you hold your end up.

352
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,419
I'm not sure if that was the deal.

353
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,520
Relax. I made a reservation
at Cafe Spiletto.

354
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,360
Regarding wardrobe:

355
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,740
Are you too young to
remember spandex?

356
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,960
I'll figure something out.

357
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,999
The surgery will repair
the damaged blood vessels

358
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,200
in your neck and your
strokes will stop.

359
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,920
All this is because of the strangulation?

360
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,510
More like strangulations.

361
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,280
My parents were right.

362
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,449
I'm a loser.
I don't know what to do.

363
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,570
Harvey, calm down.

364
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,000
I need to talk to Annette.

365
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,959
You can do this on your own.
Surgery's the only...

366
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,740
She hates me. I've been calling,
I've been calling and she's not picking up.

367
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,469
Harvey, you don't need...

368
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,410
I can't, I can't.

369
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,740
Harvey, you will do what I say.

370
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,909
I don't want surgery!

371
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,560
Sign the consent. Sign it!

372
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,810
I can't do anything.

373
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,510
No surgery! No surgery!

374
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,880
No surgery!

375
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,879
We could give him anti-depressants,
see if he changes his mind.

376
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I already did.

377
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,019
Mashed them up in his applesauce,
it'll lighten him up soon enough.

378
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,170
Someone should just
tell him to do it. Way faster.

379
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,320
Except that's forgery.
Also illegal.

380
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
- And I already tried.
- Not you.

381
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Where's a good dominatrix
when you need one?

382
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,790
Annette's barred from the hospital.

383
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,440
If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush.

384
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,330
And believe me, she knows how to use it.

385
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,920
They let you come back.

386
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,970
Not because you deserve it.
You've been bad.

387
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,360
You will have the surgery,
do you understand?

388
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,769
Do not laugh at me.
You will respect...

389
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,700
Where do you get off
telling me what to do?

390
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,229
Get out of my way,
you back-faced witch.

391
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,270
Is that part
of their deal, or...

392
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,540
This isn't like him.

393
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,950
Something's wrong.

394
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,950
Get out!

395
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,210
Get out!

396
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,500
Get out, get out!

397
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,810
Emotional swings, he's having
another stroke. Harvey!

398
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,190
He's crashing.

399
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,750
Can we get a cart in here?

400
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,159
So, what's that, two strokes
you've scared this guy into?

401
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,070
Yeah. It's making me question
my view of myself as a people person.

402
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,239
Now you want to do surgery
on him without his consent.

403
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,830
The kid's in a coma,
he needs the surgery!

404
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,289
He said no. We can't do it.

405
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,569
Emergent situation,
invoke heroic measures.

406
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,639
You need a court order.

407
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,749
Great, where do I get me one of them?
Do I need to lawyer up?

408
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,340
I'll need to show the judge
an affidavit from next of kin.

409
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,890
Well, they might have a problem signing
anything seeing as how they're dead.

410
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,330
He'll want proof.

411
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,430
Like what, dad's hand?
I don't even know where they're buried.

412
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,330
Bring me a published obit or
a death certificate and we'll run with it.

413
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,990
I don't want you to mess up your clothes.

414
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,369
His parents were accountants,
maybe there's an obit in the trade papers.

415
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,279
They guy lives in Market Town.
I don't know if he grew up

416
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,879
there, but we could check
the local funeral home.

417
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,119
Great, and when your
searches turn up nothing

418
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,800
you should try to find
out where they live.

419
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,210
He said they were dead.

420
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,779
Accountants,
they're usually pretty good with money,

421
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,030
so how come he lives
in a slum like Market Town?

422
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,490
Maybe they were bad accountants.

423
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,179
Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim?
The odds are astronomical.

424
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,679
Maybe Harvey burned through their money.

425
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,410
Or maybe they cut him off when
they found out about his proclivities.

426
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,280
That'd be my bet. Go to his apartments.
See if you can find his folks.

427
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,390
Number, address, something.

428
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,630
Hey, can I talk to you?

429
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
Sure.

430
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,639
Look, Cameron's a friend.
This whole dating thing...

431
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,549
Time's up. Thanks for playing.

432
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,819
Hey, I've been on the scene
more than you recently.

433
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
Way ahead of you.

434
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,050
I've got a case of malt
liquor stashed in the trunk,

435
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,540
Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD,
we are gonna get all the way down.

436
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Now move.

437
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,799
Come on, you're not into her.

438
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,520
Most guys who aren't interested in
a woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.

439
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,100
Oh, you know me too well.

440
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,450
I think you should go with
your instincts here. Be a jerk.

442
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm missing my soap for this?

443
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,280
Women love to be right.

444
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,490
You've got to leave them feeling superior.

445
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,829
Like they've dodged a bullet.
If you're nice, she'll blame herself...

446
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,830
And fall for me even more.

447
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,889
The Love Doctor has made
an art of breaking up with women.

448
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,079
'Cause you're convinced
that the loss of you would be

449
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,180
too devastating for
any woman to handle.

450
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,740
Yeah, I'm the one with
the serious ego problem here.

451
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm just saying:
Some relationships aren't meant to happen.

452
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,770
Harvey's school registration.

453
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,390
Permanent home address?
Emergency contacts?

454
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,690
Annette Raines.

455
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,930
Mistress Annette.

456
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,230
You have to extort
a date out of House.

457
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,580
You think that's a bad sign?

458
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Cameron?

459
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,200
High school yearbook.

460
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,040
Think this might
give us a clue, Sherlock?

461
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,790
House isn't going to
hand you anything.

462
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,360
You want him,
you've gotta take him.

463
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Jump him.

464
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,060
Harvey. H-a-r-v-e-y.

465
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,379
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you. Okay.

466
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,980
Yes, Harvey Park.

467
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,270
Great, we've been looking for you!

468
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,679
I'm calling from
the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.

469
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,110
Harvey's here, and it's rather...

470
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
He hung up.

471
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,666
You tell him why you were calling?

472
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,570
I didn't get a chance.

473
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,110
Call back.

474
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I'll do it.

475
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,190
Let the master show you how it's done.

476
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,900
Mr. Park? This is Dr.
House calling from.

477
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,700
Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching
Hospital in New Jersey.

478
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,160
Your son Harvey is dead.
We need you to identify the body.

479
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,690
Yes, I'm sorry, it's the law.

480
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Okay.

481
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,310
There's a real art to
delivering bad news.

482
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,150
They're gonna show up at the morgue.

483
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,080
Be sure to let me know
when Cuddy starts screaming.

484
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,000
You lied to them!

485
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,770
He told us our son was dead.

486
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,190
It's only a white lie.

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,250
Technically, all I did was
call them a little early.

488
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,860
Trust me, he'll be dead real soon.

489
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,190
Actually, I saved you
some rush hour traffic.

490
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,990
I'm calling our lawyer.

491
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,000
Fine. Just as soon as
you sign this surgery consent.

492
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,410
I have a pen.

493
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,770
Marilyn Park
from Oc Learner. Yes, I'll hold.

494
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,740
Harvey's your son.

495
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,770
I'm sure you still care about him.

496
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,360
He humiliated us.

497
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,690
Everybody we know
knows about his perversion.

498
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,490
But you don't get off on embarrassment
the way your son does.

499
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,990
I guess it skips a generation.

500
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,049
How much money would it take
to compensate you...

501
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,800
Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute.

502
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,470
But here's the thing.

503
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,960
Humiliation comes in
all kinds of packages.

504
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,450
People finding out that your son's a perv,
that's pretty high up there.

505
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,000
People finding out
that you'd rather let your son die

506
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,060
than sign a piece of paper.

507
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,720
Where's that rank?

508
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,869
And trust me, if I have to paste
up a sign in every nail salon

509
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,920
and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania,
I'll make sure they know.

510
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,510
Your son will be in surgery
first thing in the morning.

511
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,840
Dumplings, that was a cheap shot.

512
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,520
Hi. Are you, can we talk?

513
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,790
Gee, I wonder
what this is going to be about.

514
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,690
I just want to make sure
no one gets hurt.

515
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,379
I will be fine. Everybody's acting like
I'm going out with Jack the Ripper.

516
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,450
Oh, it's not you
I'm worried about.

517
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,040
It's been a long time since
he opened up to someone, and I...

518
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,230
you better be absolutely sure
you want this because...

519
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,010
if he opens up again and gets hurt,

520
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,240
I don't think
there's going to be a next time.

521
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,350
You're worried
I'm going to break his heart?

522
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,070
The wide side's too short.
You're gonna look like Lou Costello.

523
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,100
This is a mistake.

524
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,780
I don't know how to have
casual conversation.

525
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,400
You think you're
talking about one thing,

526
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,250
and either you are and
it's incredibly boring,

527
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,590
or you're not because it's subtext
and you need a decoder ring.

528
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,579
Open doors for her,
help her with her chair...

529
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,810
I have been on a date.

530
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,830
Not since disco died.

531
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,170
Comment on her shoes, her earrings,
and then move on to D.H.A.

532
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,090
Her dreams, hopes and aspirations.

533
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,410
Trust me. Panty-peeler.

534
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,940
Oh, and if you need condoms,
I've got some.

535
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,920
Did your wife give them to you?

536
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,960
Drug rep. They've got
antibiotics built in, somehow.

537
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,400
I should cancel.

538
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,420
I've got a patient in
surgery tomorrow morning.

539
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,390
And if you were a surgeon,
that would actually matter.

540
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,250
That's a good idea, settle your nerves.
Get me a beer, too.

541
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
No beer.

542
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,750
You're gonna eat before dinner?

543
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,220
This is pretty lame, right?

544
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,760
I think she likes lame.

545
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,640
It's beautiful.

546
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,630
And you look very handsome.

547
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Thank you.

548
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,750
I've always loved this restaurant.

549
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,320
Yeah. It's changed a lot
since the last time I was here.

550
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,420
It used to be a strip joint.

551
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,290
Nice earrings.

552
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,230
My mom's. Thank you.

553
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,620
Nice shoes. Comfortable?

554
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm not expecting you
to be someone you're not.

555
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,029
We're in a restaurant,
we're dressed up, we're eating.

556
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,570
If not small talk,
what is there?

557
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,860
According to Freud,
and I'm paraphrasing,

558
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,160
instinct of love toward an object
demands a mastery to obtain it,

559
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,139
and if a person feels they can't control
the object or feel threatened by it,

560
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,970
they act negatively toward it.

561
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,550
Like an eighth-grade boy
punching a girl.

562
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,050
I treat you like garbage,
so I must really like you.

563
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,420
Given your Freudian theory, what does
it mean if I start being nice to you?

564
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,260
That you're getting in touch
with your feelings.

565
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,170
So there's absolutely nothing I can do
to make you think that I don't like you.

566
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,080
Sorry, no.

567
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,190
I have one evening
with you, one chance,

568
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,059
and I don't want to
waste it talking about

569
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,760
what wines you like or
what movies you hate.

570
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,340
I want to know how you feel

571
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
about me.

572
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,030
You live under the delusion that you
can fix everything that isn't perfect.

573
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,890
That's why you married a man
who was dying of cancer.

574
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,430
You don't love, you need.

575
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,220
And now that your husband is dead,

576
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,860
you're looking for your new charity case.

577
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,450
That's why you're going out with me.

578
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,729
I'm twice your age,
I'm not great looking,

579
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,290
I'm not charming,
I'm not even nice.

580
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,600
What I am is what you need.

581
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm damaged.

582
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,350
Came in late.
Had a good time last night?

583
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,930
How's the surgery going?

584
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,970
Harvey's doing fine so far.
How'd the night go?

585
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,910
It was fine,
how was your evening?

586
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,910
She had the ravioli,
I had the puttanesca.

587
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,810
Yes, I really want to know
about the quality of the food.

588
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,950
Either something very good happened,
or something very bad. Which is it?

589
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,600
Well, I did have a little
indigestion afterwards.

590
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,240
Maybe it was the garlic bread.

591
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,979
Or the wine.
Something made my eyes puffy.

592
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,480
Yeah. Crying in your pillow can do that.

593
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,830
It was the wine.
We had a nice, candid conversation.

594
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,830
Nothing deep, mostly small talk.

595
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,150
I'm sure.

596
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,519
Took your advice, complimented her shoes

597
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,240
that's fifteen minutes of chat right there.

598
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,650
No snide comments?

599
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,480
I guess, when we talked about you guys.

600
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,340
Just answer one question:

601
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,930
You two going to do dinner again?

602
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,380
I don't think so.

603
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,220
I don't know.

604
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,950
Hey kids, you were wrong.

605
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,950
No aneurysm, no nothing.
This guy's clean.

606
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,580
Which means we've got no idea
what's causing the strokes.

607
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,240
He's had two more post-op.

608
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,859
We won't know the
extent of the damage

609
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,120
until he comes out of the coma.
If he comes out.

610
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,050
Maybe we should go back to
the blood thinners, up the dosage.

611
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,899
If it's not clots, a
loading dose of blood

612
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,040
thinners is gonna make him
bleed out of his ears.

613
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,730
Then he won't be able to hear.

614
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
Oy ve.

615
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,890
Nobody home, leave a message!

616
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,380
This is important!

617
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,330
Chase, Cameron,
get another angiogram and echo.

618
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,100
Better get a full-body scan. If it is
clots, it'd be good to know where they are.

619
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,380
Sorry about that. Guy dying.

620
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,450
Those pills you gave Myron,
they're not working.

621
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,090
Well, glad to see you've got
the correct perspective on the thing.

622
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,820
Well, the old ones, you know,
made me feel like a tree!

623
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,590
Nice visual.

624
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,500
The new ones, well,
might as well be eating candy.

625
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,099
Candy wouldn't
take away your headaches.

626
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
What?

627
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,739
You came to me and told me that
you were having too much sex.

628
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,829
I never did!

629
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,089
You too, Sequoia.

630
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,449
Well no, that's not true, I...

631
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,099
I know that everybody lies, but
you'd think that after a certain

632
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,260
amount of time together you
wouldn't be trying so hard.

633
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,930
Your rings don't match.

634
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,810
What, well, why would they?

635
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,320
Well, style is one thing,
but one silver, one gold?

636
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,059
How long have you guys been married?

637
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,420
- 55 years.
- 49 years.

638
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,160
Damn it, you're having an affair.

639
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,180
Did you really say
you wanted to have less sex.

640
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,130
Well, less. If I wanted none
I'd stay home with Esther.

641
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,060
I just need a little rest.

642
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,500
You guys aren't the victim of
the little blue pill, you're the problem!

643
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,510
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,910
Me, too. I should just
have told you how I felt.

645
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,230
Aw.

646
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,200
Oh, welcome to hell.

647
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
Hey, how 'bout the pills?

648
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,730
Looks like you guys are good
to go drug-free for a while.

649
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,610
Dr. Chase, these breath mints
you've been popping since yesterday.

650
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,040
Are they a new fetish?

651
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,160
Oh, I got them at Harvey's.

652
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,480
What, I just took two boxes.
the guy's got a whole drawer of them!

653
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,200
And you didn't find that interesting.

654
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,519
Well, there's lots of
interesting stuff at his place.

655
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,130
The mints weren't
high up on the list.

656
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,010
Wrong.

657
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Chase, get your nose in here.

658
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,629
If you're trying to humiliate me,
I told you...

659
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,370
Come on,
just put your face in his mouth.

660
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Rich, wouldn't you say?

661
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,550
Smells like old vomit.

662
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,790
Number one sign of
fulminating osteomylitis.

663
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,330
Infection of the jaw?

664
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,330
Probably from the original break.
Never healed properly.

665
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,590
Infected tissue from the jaw breaks off,
blocks blood flow to the brain,

666
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,170
and life just isn't worth
living without blood.

667
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,580
It was hidden from the scans
by the metal plate.

668
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,790
And an infection of the jaw
isn't likely to show up on blood tests.

669
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,460
So how do we confirm?

670
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,790
Like this.

671
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have pus.

672
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,850
We're gonna remove the jaw.

673
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,950
Anybody got a buzzsaw?
Okay, call a surgeon.

674
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,750
Hi, I'm Dr. House.

675
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,740
How's tricks, Annette?

676
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,540
I just wanted to see
if he was okay. I'll leave.

677
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,410
No, it's okay.
I came to talk to you both.

678
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,660
Like I tell all my patients, you've
simply got to say "no" to strangulation.

679
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,060
Me, I'm a freak,
I get off on not being in pain.

680
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,950
That, and chocolate-covered
marshmallow bunnies.

681
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,760
He's not a freak.

682
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,900
Yeah, he is. A little.

683
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,260
But it's got to stop. Or he'll die.

684
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,750
It's not about pain.

685
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:57,700
It's about being open, being completely
vulnerable to another person.

686
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,620
If you can learn to be
that deeply trusting...

687
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,920
it changes you.

688
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,980
Well, lock him in a cage.
That should be fine, medically.

689
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,660
Dr. House.

690
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,210
Were my parents here?

691
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,940
Did they come to see me?
