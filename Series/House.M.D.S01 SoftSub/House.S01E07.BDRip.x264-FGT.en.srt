1
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,799
So now the plan is either find
ourselves a new counselor,

2
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:09,026
stick it out with the old
one but go more often,

3
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:11,763
or resign ourselves to the fact
that she's never gonna be happy

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,744
no matter what I do, so let's
just take the money we're wasting

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,047
and put it towards a membership
at Lakeview, you know?

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,960
I'm guessing the last option
obviously formally present her.

7
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,881
Yeah. Jeez.
What's with you?

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,842
It usually takes about half
speed to stay with me.

9
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,517
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

10
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:29,566
How are things with Elise?

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Great.

12
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:33,318
Great?

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,940
Simple answers. You're either out
of breath or you're lying to me.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,540
Yeah... we have our moments,
but they usually work out.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,949
Can I get some water?

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
Yeah...

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,590
So how do you work things out?

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,580
Talk, someone apologizes.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,750
Man I shouldn't have drank last night.

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,520
Hey, you mean you apologize.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Yeah, I guess.

23
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,180
How often do you guys have sex?

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
Enough...

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,010
You do it this morning?

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,980
You did, you did it this morning,

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,660
maybe that's why you can't stand up.
Come on!

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,890
Elise!

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,080
Honey, I'm dehydrated.

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,250
We have anything with electrolytes?

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,310
Sleeping beauty, wake up,
this is an emergency.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,210
The fridge is empty.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,850
Come on, it's almost four!

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,040
Elise, sweetie...

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,470
Call Jacques, tell him
I'm not feeling well.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
It's Saturday.

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,170
You haven't been to work
in three days, remember?

38
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,650
Just let me sleep.

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,210
Come on. You haven't been
out of bed since Wednesday.

40
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,750
Leave me alone...

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,700
Come on, lets go.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,280
I said leave me alone!

43
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,900
I think there's something wrong with me.

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,699
She's been averaging 18 hours of
sleep a day since her admission.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,190
Clinical depression.
Incredibly contagious.

46
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,189
Every time I'm around
one of them I get blue.

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,679
It's not clinical depression.

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,420
Great, you got it all figured out.
You don't need me.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,409
Three ER doctors, two neurologists and a
radiologist have all figured out what its not,

50
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,569
we need to figure out what it is.

51
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,759
Well, maybe if above mentioned
doctors were interested

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,149
in my opinion they would
have asked for it.

53
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,550
None of them are willing to
subject themselves to you.

54
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,600
No pain no gain.

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,429
The blood work showed no
signs of inflammation,

56
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,239
and no one can figure out
what's actually the cause of...

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,820
Huh.

58
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,910
What?

59
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,150
Husband described her
as being unusually irritable recently.

60
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
And?

61
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,670
I didn't know it was possible for a woman
to be "unusually" irritable.

62
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,590
Nice try, but you're a
misanthrope, not a masochist.

63
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,069
What's the first thing you ask a
doctor who's referring a patient?

64
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,030
Are you questioning my
ability to take a history?

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,409
"What's the primary"...

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,909
Not "what?". "Why?"

67
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,319
Diseases don't have motives.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,720
No, but doctors do.

69
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,440
Why this patient, what interests you?

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,950
Give me the chart.

71
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,100
Why?

72
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,290
I find your interest interesting.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,989
She's irritable, sleeping 18 hours a day.

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,560
What's interesting about that?

75
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,999
Hypersomnia is usually accompanied
by irritability in depressed patients.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,410
True, but not relevant.
She's not depressed.

77
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,079
Hello! She's sleeping 18 hours a day!

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,670
Fever.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,879
Clinical depression does not cause fever.

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,159
She could be sick and depressed?

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,359
She's sick! Dammit,
why didn't I think of that?

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,479
Yeah, that's what I mean...

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,299
Elevated SED rate indicates inflammation.

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,959
Hypersomnia and personality
changes point toward the brain.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Not the spleen.

86
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,910
Thank goodness we hired a neurologist!

87
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,999
Brain symptoms... hmm, could
this be a brain problem?

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,559
No other systemic signs of
inflammation, probably not vasculitis.

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,040
What about parasites?
Malaria, chagas?

90
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,420
The patient's never been outside the
United States, especially the tropics.

91
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,610
You mean she claims she's
never been outside the U.S.

92
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,530
Very good.

93
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,339
Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub
smears show no sign of parasites.

94
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Has to be a tumor then.

95
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,559
A tumor sitting directly
on top of the brain stem.

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,059
That three ER doctors, two neurologists,
and a radiologist missed?

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,979
Partridge in a pear tree missed it too.

98
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,419
Redo the blood work and
get a new MRI with 2

99
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,660
millimeter cuts through
the mesodiencephalic.

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,869
And check for evil stepmothers.

101
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,110
This much sleep usually
indicates poisoned apples.

102
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,840
Anything else beside the
shortness of breath?

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,370
Not really, its actually
just kind of a tightness.

104
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
You smoke?

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
No, never.

106
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Exercise?

107
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,280
Eight hours a day.

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,340
I teach preschool.

109
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Sounds fun.

110
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,969
Any history of heart
disease in your family?

111
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,160
Not that I know of.

112
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,710
Take a deep breath.

113
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,080
Been under a lot of stress lately?

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,770
None more than usual.

115
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,160
You're probably just a little anemic,

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,670
but I'm going to do an
EKG just to make sure.

117
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,100
Do I need to take this off?

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,090
No, you can just pull that down in front.

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Good. Lord. Are those real?

120
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,180
Do they look real?

121
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,560
They look pretty damn good.

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,869
They were a present for my husband's 40th.

123
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,900
I figured he'd enjoy them
more than a sweater.

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
That's so sweet.

125
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,960
I'm afraid the cause of your problem
could be staring us right in the face.

126
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,470
Actually I guess I'm the
one doing the staring.

127
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,520
Of course I can't be sure,
I'd like to consult a colleague.

128
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,860
He's actually somewhat of
an expert in these matters.

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,100
Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
A tumor?

131
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,560
We don't know, we're
checking just to be safe.

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
They already checked for that.

133
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,669
The previous MRI had a broader view.

134
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,539
Some tumors are almost impossible to see
unless we know exactly where to look.

135
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,490
That means it would be small, right?

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,080
Yes.

137
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,569
So you'd be able to operate? Take it out?

138
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,569
If it is a tumor, there are a
variety of treatment options,

139
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,160
but there are variables
other than just size.

140
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,530
Don't worry...

141
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
Too late.

142
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
Try to remain as still as possible.

143
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,320
The less distortion there is,
the more detail we'll be able to see.

144
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,570
Ok.

145
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,870
Well. That's what breasts look like.

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,339
Is a lie a lie if everybody
knows it's a lie?

147
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,089
Well, if a tree pretends
to fall in a forest...

148
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,899
House, come on, they're breasts.

149
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,049
They're a birthday present,
not a philosophical treatise.

150
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,090
Lie number one,

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,539
she did not do that for her husband,
she did that for herself.

152
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,270
She thinks if she looks
different, she'll be different.

153
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,979
No, she thinks if she
looks different, she'll

154
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,789
be more attractive,
which, I have to say...

155
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,840
Not to her husband.

156
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,870
Cosmetic surgery is so that everyone
else will look at us differently.

157
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,479
Same reason you're wearing that tie.

158
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,340
Well exactly, that was
going to be my next point.

159
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,409
Last three months, same five ties.

160
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,330
Thursday should be that paisley thing.

161
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,599
It's a gift from my wife.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,329
No its not. Julie hates green.
You bought that yourself.

163
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,920
You want to look pretty. At work.

164
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,960
Wilson's got a girlfriend...

165
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,610
Stop! Stop. I don't.

166
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,890
It takes two department heads
to treat shortness of breath?

167
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,740
What, do the complications increase
exponentially with cup size?

168
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,960
I want an EKG and blood tests
including tox screen on Mrs...

169
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,059
Exam Room 1.

170
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,640
You're ordering tests
to cover your lechery.

171
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,890
Interesting.

172
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,590
Very tricky case.

173
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,060
You love everybody.
That's your pathology.

174
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,860
There were no lesions and no
mass effect that we could see.

175
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,800
What does that mean?

176
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,029
It means we're still not sure what's
causing your neurological problems.

177
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,640
I know some thing are hard to cure,

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,079
but what I just don't
get is why it's taking

179
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,250
so long to figure out
what's wrong with her.

180
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,149
I know you're scared, I would be too.

181
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,250
I don't feel good...

182
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,160
You feeling nauseous?

183
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,020
Honey? You all right?

184
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,130
She's seizing!

185
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,639
Get her on her side.
I need some Ativan!

186
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I'll get it!

187
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,540
What's happening?

188
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
She's having a seizure.

189
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,390
She's aspirating, suction!

190
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Elise!

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Come on Elise!

192
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,969
The MRI reveals nothing.

193
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,690
That we were able to detect.

194
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,760
It's not a tumor.

195
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,139
A small glioma could hide from contrast.
We could do a PET scan.

196
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,080
Yes, that's how a responsible doctor
would waste his time in the situation.

197
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,259
Suddenly tests and radiologists
aren't capable of error?

198
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,710
A glioma not presenting
on a contrast MRI

199
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,830
would have to be smaller
than a grain of sand,

200
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,590
which does not a gravely ill person make.

201
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,979
It could be just postictal disorientation.

202
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,460
We would have seen improvement by now.

203
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,619
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.

204
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,939
Does the husband care about her?

205
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,370
He hasn't left her bedside.

206
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,790
No way... it also means she
doesn't have Lyme Disease.

207
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,639
What? Love conquers all?

208
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,729
Lyme Disease initially
presents with a rash.

209
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,129
Mr. Clingy would have noticed.

210
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,439
We've looked at everything else.

211
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,560
Did you look at her breasts?

212
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Men.

213
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,320
Could be paraneoplastic.

214
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,280
She have any family
history of breast cancer?

215
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,930
Her mother died of it.

216
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,950
The brain, but not
the brain. Clever, huh?

217
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,480
How can breast cancer cause
problems in her brain?

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,290
There are molecular similarities
between brain cells and tumor cells.

219
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,530
Paraneoplastic Syndrome causes the body's
own antibodies to get thrown off track.

220
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,830
They end up attacking the
brain instead of the tumor.

221
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,910
So if you do find the
tumor, what do you do?

222
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,230
We treat the underlying malignancy.

223
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,490
Once there's no tumor to
attack, there's nothing

224
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,419
for the antibodies to
get confused about.

225
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,910
If the tumor's treatable.

226
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Exactly.

227
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm sorry,
I know it's uncomfortable.

228
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,580
The tighter we go,
the better the image will be.

229
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,079
Least it'll keep me awake.

230
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,530
Don't worry, it's almost over.

231
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,190
I wish people would stop
telling me not to worry.

232
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,710
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,550
My mom was the same age.

234
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,140
We've been trying to get
pregnant for over a year.

235
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,660
I guess we're lucky we didn't.

236
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,590
A lot has changed since your mom died.

237
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,350
Don't worr...

238
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,850
Don't give up.

239
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,070
No tumor?

240
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,889
The MRI and mammogram only showed
a few benign calcifications.

241
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,890
It's most likely a small cell tumor,

242
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,190
its no surprise we're
having trouble finding it.

243
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
We should do a PET scan.

244
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,180
Start with her lungs,
and maybe her bones...

245
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,129
Sometimes it presents with no tumor at all.

246
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,029
How can a disease caused by a tumor
present if there's no tumor?

247
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,079
It happens. Twelve percent of cases.

248
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
And how do you treat it
if there's no tumor?

249
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,370
You don't. Those twelve
percent have no treatment.

250
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,780
They were too busy looking for the tumor,

251
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,120
right till they put the
patient in the ground.

252
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,610
What choice do we have?

253
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,910
Treat the symptoms.
IV Immunoglobulin.

254
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,720
So we're just
going to ignore the tumor?

255
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,640
Eventually it'll get bigger.
Then it'll be really easy to find.

256
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,890
One of you needs to check
out where she works.

257
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,720
Why?

258
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,260
Cause the husband's not sick.

259
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,290
Meaning?

260
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,759
If it's not paraneoplastic
and it is a reaction to some

261
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,450
sort of toxic, it's obviously
not coming from their home.

262
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,320
Foreman, you do it.

263
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,930
Why are you riding me?

264
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,570
It's what I do... has
it gotten worse lately?

265
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,390
Yeah. Seems to me.

266
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,710
Really. Well that rules out the race thing.

267
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,750
Cause you were just as black last week.

268
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,420
How long has Elise worked here?

269
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,780
Three years, she's my best rotisseur.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,820
What's that?

271
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:42,570
The rotisseur prepares the
roasted meats and gravies.

272
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,859
How do you clean your grill?

273
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,260
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE.)

274
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,979
They say elbow grease.

275
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,109
Do you use chemical cleaners?

276
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,750
Ah, no. Absolutely no, our chefs
don't do the cleaning, anyway.

277
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,479
What about pesticides?

278
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,549
You must spray for roaches
and that sort of thing?

279
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,619
Nope, my kitchen is clean. No roaches.

280
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,960
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE.)

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,630
I need to get back to work.

282
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,290
So the fact that I'm here asking you
these questions, it doesn't worry you?

283
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,990
Look at me. I'm here 18 hours a day.

284
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,260
That guy practically lives here,
he does live here...

285
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,960
I use the same detergents for 15 years
and everyone is healthy as a horse.

286
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,340
Whatever Elise has she didn't get here.

287
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Tell her I hope she feels better,
and I had to get a new rotisseur.

288
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,750
Where's Ed?

289
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,140
He went down to the gift
shop to buy a shirt.

290
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,760
I told him I'd stay up
here in case you woke up.

291
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,420
You must have better things to do.

292
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,430
I send my laundry out.

293
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
You're not married?

294
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
No.

295
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,190
Waiting for the perfect guy?

296
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,550
Let me guess.

297
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,370
You've already found him.

298
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,560
He threw my towels out the window.

299
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
What?

300
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,160
It's how we met.

301
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,730
Freshman year, he came to a
party my roommate and I threw.

302
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,930
He spent most of the night
on the bathroom floor.

303
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,170
He figured I wouldn't notice vomit on
the towels if I didn't have any towels.

304
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,199
I'm assuming he came back
the next day to apologize?

305
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,040
No way. We had to track him down.

306
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,320
Conflict resolution has never
been one of Ed's strong points.

307
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,960
Nobody's perfect, right?

308
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
I guess.

309
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,380
Oh my neck hurts.

310
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,290
You've been in this bed
for a really long time.

311
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,580
We're gonna do the same
test we did last night, ok?

312
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,500
Do you know what day it is?

313
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,939
My arm itches.

314
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,559
It's probably just a mild skin irritation,

315
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
I'll get you some
hydrocortisone in a minute.

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,879
Do you know what day it is?

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,960
Tuesday. It really itches.

318
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,870
How about get you that cream right now.

319
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,959
Oh my God! Get them off! Someone!
Get them off of me!

320
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Elise calm down.

321
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,290
Elise calm down.

322
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,830
- Get them off!
- I need some Haldol, 5 milligrams.

323
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,199
Elise, what's wrong?

324
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,609
Get them off! Get them off!

325
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,340
There's nothing there, Elise.
There's nothing there!

326
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,220
We had to sedate her.

327
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,280
You gave sedatives to a patient who's
already sleeping 18 hours a day?

328
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,799
It was better than letting her
scratch all the skin off her arms.

329
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,730
Or supposed to be.

330
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,699
Creepy-crawlies are consistent
with paraneoplastic syndrome.

331
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,959
Onset immediately after IVIG isn't.

332
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,409
There is a simple explanation. Maybe
she really has bugs under her skin.

333
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,410
Infection?

334
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,440
That's what the worsening of symptoms
after immunotherapy would suggest.

335
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,180
Blood cultures and the timeline
rule out most bacteria.

336
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,119
If a patient throws up on your shoes
do you clean up "most" of it?

337
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,730
The symptoms rule out the rest.

338
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,880
Serology rules out viruses,
CSS smears rule out parasites.

339
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,119
In the final stage of
African Trypanosomiasis

340
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,499
almost all the parasites
are inside the brain.

341
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,700
It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.

342
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,119
But it's not possible for
a patient who's never

343
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,649
been to Africa to have
African Sleeping Sickness.

344
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,349
I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.

345
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,880
She could have got it from a transfusion.

346
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,189
Or I'm just saying she could
have got it from a transfusion.

347
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,460
Which she never had.

348
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,310
Okay...

349
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,529
What about toxins?

350
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,610
No, the kitchen she works in is
cleaner than some hospitals.

351
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,279
But they do serve rabbit.
Rabbit Fever fits her symptoms.

352
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,059
Tularemia initially presents with a
rash or ulcer near the infection site.

353
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,250
Not if she inhaled it.

354
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,899
Chopping the meat with a cleaver could
easily aerosolize the bacteria.

355
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,790
No, then she'd have respiratory symptoms.

356
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,859
Maybe she ignored it,
figured she had a cold.

357
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,899
We rejected Lyme Disease because the
couple would have noticed a rash,

358
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,699
but a wet hacking cough is
just going to slip right by.

359
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,200
Hey, it's either that or she missed her exit
on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.

360
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,969
Ok. Two lousy ideas.

361
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,570
Unfortunately they're better
than all the other ideas.

362
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,940
Tularemia. Bizarre.

363
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,690
Very nice.

364
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,370
That's why I ride you.

365
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,750
Did he just turn on the TV?

366
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,030
He needs to think.

367
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,069
So this should tell us whether
or not she's got rabbit fever?

368
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,340
For a diagnosis of Tularemia you need a
four-fold increase in serum antibody levels.

369
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,759
To measure an increase you need a
before, all we have is an after.

370
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,079
A single titer over 160
would be a big clue.

371
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
"That's why I ride you."
What does that mean?

372
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,909
Even when I have a good
idea it's because of him?

373
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,330
Actually I think he said
your idea was a lousy idea.

374
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,179
It has to be one of these two conditions.

375
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,009
I say we take our best guess and
just start treatment. Or treat both.

376
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,600
The treatment for Tularemia
can cause aplastic anemia.

377
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,799
How come he doesn't ride you guys?

378
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,599
He's got a crush on you.
He just doesn't know how to show it.

379
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,920
Get over it, he rides everybody.

380
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,790
And the treatment for sleeping
sickness kills one in ten patients.

381
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,630
So we start with the safer treatment.

382
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,850
By "safer" you mean the one that's
slightly less likely to kill her?

383
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,360
Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?

384
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,320
Yep.

385
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,480
Probably inconclusive, but worth doing.

386
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,520
So what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?

387
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,019
There's nobody. Give it up.

388
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,199
Your lips say no,
your shoes say yes.

389
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,309
Well they're French.
You can't trust a word they say.

390
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,330
Solid, yet stylish.

391
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,600
A professional woman would be impressed.

392
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,300
I'm thinking accountant, actuary, maybe.

393
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,180
It's somebody in the hospital.

394
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,530
Patient?

395
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,210
No, chemo's not sexy.
Daughter of the patient?

396
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,819
She would certainly have
the neediness you need.

397
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,879
I'm not gonna date a patient's daughter.

398
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Very ethical.

399
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,029
Of course, most married men would
say they don't date at all.

400
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,430
There was no date!

401
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,370
I had lunch with one of the nurses.

402
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,119
It's her first time in an oncology unit
and she's having a tough time,

403
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,940
emotionally.

404
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,900
Perfect.

405
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:32,689
I wanted to be nice.
That's all. I mean it.

406
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,810
You always do.
It's part of your charm.

407
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,850
Hi boys.

408
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,950
Mrs. Campbell's test results.

409
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,559
Oh, you remember her, the preschool
teacher with the heart of silicon.

410
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,940
Nope, doesn't ring a bell.

411
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,599
They came in yesterday, I figured
you guys would have been all over them.

412
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,780
I know how concerned you are.

413
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,820
She's all upset because we paid
more attention to the other girl.

414
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,450
You check out her ass,
I've got the chest.

415
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,870
The tests were normal.

416
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,959
'Cause that's just my
opinion, you may want to call

417
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,040
a couple of guys from
maintenance in for a consult.

418
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,309
You check her EKG results
before she left the other day?

419
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,160
You ordered it.

420
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:06,369
You're the responsible one.

421
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,029
What's wrong? They look normal to me.

422
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,910
Where is she?

423
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:10,370
Waiting downstairs, why?

424
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,370
I was right.

425
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,710
Do I have to get rid of the implants?

426
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,370
Surprisingly, no.

427
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,279
But your EKG shows a slightly
decreased heart rate.

428
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,090
Is that a problem?

429
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:32,320
You told me you hadn't changed your
diet or exercise, were you lying?

430
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Lying?

431
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,379
Does your husband have high blood pressure?

432
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
My husband?

433
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,769
Yeah.. see, if you're gonna
repeat everything I say

434
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,760
this conversation is gonna
take twice as long.

435
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,679
Yes, he was diagnosed six mouths ago...

436
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,990
He do a lot of cooking at home?

437
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,940
Not really, other than
oatmeal in the morning.

438
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,980
Did you happen to notice a slightly
odd taste to the oatmeal lately?

439
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,329
Wait, are you saying that...

440
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,379
That it looks like your husband
stirred in some of his

441
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,529
blood pressure medication
along with brown sugar.

442
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,350
You think my husbands trying to poison me?

443
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,550
No, nothing like that.

444
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,630
He just doesn't want to have sex with you.

445
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,560
Decreased sex drive is one
of the most common side

446
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,449
effects of the beta
blockers he's been taking.

447
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,350
I'm guessing he figured if you're
both frigid, no harm no foul.

448
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,070
You should have gotten him the sweater.

449
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,629
That's ridiculous.

450
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,330
Fine.

451
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,199
But if you're still concerned
about the shortness

452
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,180
of breath, I'd start
making your own breakfast.

453
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Wait!

454
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,050
What should I do?

455
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,080
If you care about your husband at all,

456
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,140
I'd do the responsible thing:

457
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,300
Buy yourself some condoms,
go to a bar, find...

458
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,530
Lab tests inconclusive?

459
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,300
Not surprisingly.

460
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,620
No. But too bad.
Luckily, I have the answer.

461
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
To what?

462
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,559
Thanks for asking.
The life itself. Sex.

463
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,739
Anything that can be transmitted via the
blood can be transmitted through sex.

464
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,379
Sleeping sickness from sex?

465
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,440
It's not without precedent.

466
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,689
I'm pretty sure it is.

467
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,189
Unless you're talking about going to Africa
and having sex with the tse tse fly.

468
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,449
A Portuguese man was diagnosed three years
ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness.

469
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,660
His only connection with
Africa was through a

470
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,160
girlfriend who served under
the military in Angola.

471
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,230
Oi, where'd you find that?

472
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,950
The journal de Instituto de
Higinay Medicina Tropical.

473
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,590
You don't read Portuguese?

474
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,440
You do?

475
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm pretty sure that's what it said.

476
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,970
Either that or
it was an ad for sunglasses.

477
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,460
Her husband has never
been to Africa either.

478
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,779
Oh, stymied again.
Your logic is bulletproof.

479
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,189
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms
is more likely than cheating.

480
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,190
Because?

481
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,260
They're completely devoted to each other.

482
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,410
Because?

483
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,230
They love each other.

484
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,750
Or?

485
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,540
They're overcompensating for guilt.

486
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,460
Find out which it is.

487
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,300
You want me to ask a man whose wife
is about to die if he cheated on her?

488
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,660
No, I want you to be
polite and let her die.

489
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,959
Actually, I don't want
you to ask her anything.

490
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
Foreman take the husband,
Chase take the wife.

491
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,140
You don't trust me to do my job?

492
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,299
We all formulate questions based
on the answers we want to hear.

493
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,330
And how exactly do you re-formulate
"Have you screwed around?"

494
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,889
Did you know she's been
trying to get pregnant?

495
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,460
Yes.

496
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:34,419
After you got so freaked
about the sick babies

497
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,060
a while ago I figured
that was your thing.

498
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,179
But you've never been
prescribed folic acid,

499
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,229
and you can't lose a baby if
you've never been pregnant.

500
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,859
You pulled my medical records?

501
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,010
You coughed the other day,
I was concerned.

502
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,819
You were curious.

503
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,619
Like an eight-year old
boy with a puzzle that's

504
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,880
just a little to grown-up
for him to figure out.

505
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,910
To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to...

506
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,680
So... it's either sleeping
sickness or this rabbit thing.

507
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,089
They're both fatal without treatment.

508
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,250
And unfortunately the treatment
for both is extremely dangerous.

509
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,939
Are there test you can do?

510
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,310
Not at this stage.

511
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,310
But each condition has a unique history.

512
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,780
We're hoping your answers to a
few questions will help us.

513
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,850
Sure. Whatever you need to know.

514
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,370
Before the sleeping problems,
did you have any trouble breathing,

515
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,100
a cough that wouldn't go away,
anything like that?

516
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,050
No.

517
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,520
Are you certain?

518
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Absolutely.

519
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,839
I've never been away from her
for more than a night,

520
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,880
if she had breathing troubles,
I would have noticed.

521
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,600
The other condition is
significantly more likely if...

522
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,350
if you've had an affair.

523
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,460
Have you ever had an affair?

524
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,730
Of course not.

525
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,679
You sure?

526
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,730
I think I'd remember cheating on my wife.

527
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,709
You might be reluctant to admit it...

528
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,450
No.

529
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,170
I just want to be perfectly clear.

530
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,469
If your wife has sleeping sickness
and we don't treat her, she'll die.

531
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,930
I would never do that to Ed.

532
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,580
I love him.

533
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,490
Absolutely not.

534
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,550
I love her.

535
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,760
Alright then.

536
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,990
They say no cheating,
we cross of sleeping sickness.

537
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,660
Any new ideas?

538
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,949
Ok, we go with Foreman's Tularemia.

539
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,010
Start her on IV-Chloramphenicol 25
milligrams per kilogram four times a day.

540
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,430
Good night.

541
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,020
Where's Ed?

542
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,360
Right next to you.
Well you are two down, two to go.

543
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,940
Two days?

544
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,900
No, doses.

545
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,840
You have about twenty
more days of this fun.

546
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,190
What time is it?

547
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,750
About four a.m.
I pulled the short straw.

548
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,200
Flow rate looks good.

549
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,620
No rash or flushing...

550
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,820
What time is it?

551
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,490
4 a.m.

552
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,430
Do you not remember just asking?

553
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,950
I don't know...

554
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,010
Elise...?

555
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,690
Elise? Elise? Elise!

556
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,870
What are you doing?

557
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:54,939
Trying to wake her.

558
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,910
She fall asleep again?

559
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,860
In the middle of a sentence.

560
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:57,960
Elise!

561
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,700
Elise!

562
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
What's happening?

563
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,880
Patient's not responding.

564
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,149
Pulse is fine, airways open.

565
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,340
Check her blood pressure.

566
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,620
Pupils are reactive.

567
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,340
Elise wake up.
You gotta wake up.

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,979
What does that mean?
What are you doing?

569
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,370
She's not responsive to pain.

570
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,630
Come on Elise!

571
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Is she dying?

572
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,650
I don't know.

573
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,740
She's in a coma.

574
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,339
There's only one way a Tularemia patient

575
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,949
goes into a coma
while on IV-Chloramphenicol.

576
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,599
The patient doesn't have Tularemia.

577
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,260
And then there was one.

578
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,569
Patient comes in because
she's sleeping too much.

579
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,559
It takes ten doctors and a coma
to diagnose sleeping sickness.

580
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,860
And then there was none.

581
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,039
We still have the problem
of explaining how a white

582
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,480
chick from Jersey who's never
traveled south of D.C.

583
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,149
Has African sleeping sickness.

584
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,870
Well, the obvious explanation?

585
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,779
I made it clear.

586
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,390
If this guy's lying about sleeping around,
he knows he's murdering his wife.

587
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,460
Does seem unlikely...

588
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Go away.

589
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
What are you doing?

590
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,730
Checking for lymphadenopothy.
And waiting for you.

591
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,770
Who are you?

592
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,130
I'm Dr. House.

593
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,540
Your wife has human
African Trypanosomiasis.

594
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,230
Sleeping sickness.

595
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:56,359
You mean its not Tularemia.
A virus, tumor or cancer.

596
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Nope.

597
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,640
I've never had an affair.

598
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,630
I believe you.

599
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,090
And I trust Elise.

600
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,120
The treatment for this
disease is a drug that's...

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,640
fatal on its own ten
percent of the time.

602
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,089
Which is why I need your written consent
before I can legally prescribe it.

603
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,419
Why would she lie if she
knew it could kill her?

604
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,920
I don't ask why patients lie,
I just assume they all do.

605
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,110
But why?

606
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:29,749
To protect you, because she
didn't think it mattered.

607
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,590
It just seemed easier because...

608
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,080
that's what people do.

609
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,829
Now, If you're absolutely certain that your
wife has never had sex with anyone but you

610
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,210
since you've been married,
then I'm wrong.

611
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:53,500
But if you think there's a possibility
that just one time she wasn't perfect...

612
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,220
one weekend you're out of town...

613
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:02,260
one fight when she ran to a friend,
one stupid Christmas party...

614
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,330
then you need to allow
me to start treatment.

615
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,480
Because if we don't...

616
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,470
she's gonna be dead by tomorrow morning.

617
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,760
Do you trust your wife that much?

618
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,670
I don't know...

619
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,190
I'll start the treatment.

620
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,230
Glass syringes?

621
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,230
And special IV tubing.

622
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Why do we need this stuff?

623
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:57,810
Because Melarsoprol melts plastic.

624
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,900
This stuff's supposedly arsenic
mixed with antifreeze.

625
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,939
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, huh?

626
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,120
At least you wouldn't have been so glib
if you'd been prescribed Melarsoprol.

627
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,879
Can cause vomiting,
abdominal pain,

628
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,059
blood toxicity, neural damage,
cardiac arrhythmia...

629
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,100
I forgot to say it's gonna
hurt like all hell.

630
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,390
She's lucky she's in a coma.

631
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,599
How long before we know its working?

632
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,950
It's tough to say.

633
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,360
It's a good sign that she
hasn't gotten any worse.

634
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,000
Does she even know I'm here?

635
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,000
She knows you're always there for her.

636
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Yeah...

637
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,380
If she gets better it means she
wasn't always there for me.

638
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,690
It means she made a mistake.

639
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,250
I can't help it.

640
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,660
Part of me, a big part of me...
can't handle that.

641
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,070
Doesn't want her to get better.

642
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,950
Does that make me a terrible person?

643
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Yes.

644
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,229
So we're treating her for
African sleeping sickness

645
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,180
because you don't think it's possible for
someone to be faithful in a relationship?

646
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,980
And you do?

647
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Yes.

648
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,530
And you need to tell me that?

649
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,470
Look, I'm not having an affair.

650
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,029
I had lunch, with someone I
work with, at work. Once.

651
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,030
I believe you.

652
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,360
What I don't believe is
that it'll be just once.

653
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,999
I love my wife.

654
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,420
You certainly love saying it.

655
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,780
I'm sorry.
I know you love your wife.

656
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,820
You loved all your wives.
Probably still do.

657
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,279
In fact, you probably still love

658
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,979
all the women you ever
loved who weren't your wives.

659
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,679
You can be a real jerk
sometimes, you know that?

660
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,019
Yeah. And you're the good guy.

661
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,119
At least I try.

662
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,539
As long as you're trying to be good,
you can do whatever you want.

663
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,419
And as long as you're not trying,
you can say whatever you want.

664
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,180
So between us, we can do anything.
We can rule the world!

665
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,870
Mixing up some margaritas?

666
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,010
Mines a double, Senorita.

667
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,109
That's Portuguese, you know.

668
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,110
Spanish.

669
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,110
What's going on?

670
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,700
I'm re-calibrating the centrifuge.

671
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Turn around.

672
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,820
It's a very sad thing,

673
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,470
an un-calibrated centrifuge.
It makes me cry too.

674
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,210
I'm not crying.

675
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,550
Ok.

676
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,760
I told the husband he was a jerk.

677
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,090
Why?

678
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,340
When I was in college, I...

679
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:16,160
I fell in love, and I got married. And...

680
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,939
At that age the chances
of a marriage lasting...

681
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,630
It lasted six months.

682
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,810
Thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain.

683
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
There was nothing they could do.

684
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
I was 21, and...

685
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,600
I watched my husband die.

686
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,460
I'm sorry...

687
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,520
But that's not the whole story.

688
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,840
It's a symptom, not your illness.

689
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,039
Thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed

690
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,599
at least a year before his death,

691
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,330
you knew he was dying when you married him.

692
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,330
Must have been when you first met him.

693
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,360
And you married him anyway.

694
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,800
You can't be that good a
person and well adjusted.

695
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,050
Why?

696
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,650
Because you wind up
crying over centrifuges.

697
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,140
Or hating people.

698
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,149
Fever spiked at 104.
Echo shows global hyperkinesis.

699
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,030
Blood pressure?

700
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,349
Barely 90 over 40.

701
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,399
You give her gilpamine?

702
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,760
Started 270 micrograms per minute
ten minutes ago, still no change.

703
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,209
Killing her parasites isn't gonna do much
good if we kill her heart at the same time.

704
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,500
A heart can be replaced, a brain can't.

705
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,220
Right now were killing both.

706
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,419
If she's gonna die, we
should at least let her do

707
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,280
it without that acid
flowing through her veins.

708
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,210
What's happening?

709
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
We would have expected your wife's
condition to show some improvement by now,

710
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,770
but it hasn't.
It's going the other way.

711
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,860
Please don't die...

712
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,810
please don't die...

713
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,490
She's awake!

714
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,520
Hey. She's gonna be ok.

715
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,870
Yeah, sure.

716
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,320
What are you gonna do?

717
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,560
Were you always honest with her?

718
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,200
Do you know how lucky you are?
Your wife is alive, she loves you!

719
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
What she did...

720
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,450
you can't love a person
and do that to them.

721
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,710
She loves you.

722
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,700
I need to know
who you had the affair with.

723
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,170
He has to be notified so he
can get treatment as well.

724
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,030
Why did you lie to us?

725
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,030
You knew your life was at stake.

726
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,070
He's not coming back, is he?

727
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,030
We all make mistakes,
and we all pay a price.

728
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,530
I need that name.

729
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,490
Hi, there...

730
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,410
How you doing?

731
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,620
Fine.

732
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,500
Do you know where your dad is?

733
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,050
Can I help you?
