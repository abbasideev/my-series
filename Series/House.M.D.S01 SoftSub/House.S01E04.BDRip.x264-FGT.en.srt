1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:07,820
<i>Radiologist, contact 5317.</i>

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,830
- Amber.
- No.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,300
- Why not?
- Amber's a stripper name.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,220
Find me one stripper
named Amber Hartig.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,463
Or not. Okay.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,160
Non-stripper names. Um, Desiree?

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,920
Bambi? Kandy Kane?

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,660
Max.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Maxine.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,420
Max Hartig.
It's a cute name, isn't it?

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,860
If you're a professional boxer, maybe.

12
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,564
Can you believe we made
this little creature?

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,015
I know. It's incredible.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,440
It's the most amazing
thing we've ever done.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,760
I almost ran the marathon
last year.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,219
If we're lucky, you won't inherit
your daddy's sense of humor.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,180
Hello. Say "hi" to Bear.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,800
She hasn't even eaten anything.
Why is she spitting up?

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,610
Well, honey, we can't bug them again.

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,820
Okay, okay.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,720
I'm sorry. It's our first kid. We're
both a little panicky, I guess.

22
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,557
Well, you gotta ask the pediatrician
next time. I just deliver 'em.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,740
- Is she spitting up?
- Yeah. Second time in an hour.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,730
Oh. If you lived underwater
for nine months,

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,840
you'd have a lot to spit up too.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,115
- Is something wrong?
- A little lethargic.

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,440
- Well, we didn't think...
- She's hot.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,980
Is she...

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,590
The baby's seizing!
Get the crash cart!

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,250
- What's wrong?
- Need some help in here!

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,320
Oh, God. Is she all right?

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,630
- I.V. Access?
- No. Ativan.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
What's going on?

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,713
The M.R.I.'s back.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,300
And? It's what we expected.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,070
The accident caused
serious damage.

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,420
It's amnesia.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,340
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

40
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,840
Enjoying our lounge, House?

41
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,035
Just came in to get milk for my
coffee, which you're out of.

42
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:54,940
Flat or sparkling?

43
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,204
- Sparkling.
- Splat.

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,458
So, the Hartigs?

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,168
Their baby gets a fever.

46
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,070
What, don't tell me...
the kid had a seizure.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,620
Yep. The parents, of course, start freaking,
and I have to deal with that for an hour.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,590
Like it was your fault. She was
perfect when I delivered her.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,880
If you wanna blame
someone, blame the pediatrician.

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,500
So, how is the kid now?

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,060
Bowel obstruction. She's under observation.
She'll be fine.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,520
Pediatrician
will take all the credit.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,406
Exhibit A: Baby Girl Hartig.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,700
Term baby, 42 hours old.

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,250
Went into seizures six hours ago,
brought into the intensive care...

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,456
diagnosed with obstruction
of the small bowel.

57
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,710
I'm still amazed you're actually
in the same room with a patient.

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,770
People don't bug me
until they get teeth.

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,140
Exhibit B: Baby Boy Hausen.

60
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,380
Another term baby, 48 hours old.

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,790
Brought into the NICU
three hours before the Hartig baby.

62
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,860
Fever of unknown origin,
101 degrees, trending upwards.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,420
Wow, that is amazing.

64
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,150
You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge all
morning and heard about two sick babies.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,040
- It's eerie.
- Don't touch that.

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,420
Alright.

67
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,720
We have an infection
spreading in the hospital.

68
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,710
These kids have totally
unrelated illnesses.

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,450
They fell sick within four hours
of each other.

70
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,560
They had the same delivery
rooms, maternity rooms

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,380
and neighboring, so
transmission's possible.

72
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,450
- They have the same symptoms.
- The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.

73
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,240
No matter how close their beds are, I'm
pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,740
What does bowel obstruction
on a chart indicate?

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,850
Normally I'd say it indicates
a patient's bowel is obstructed,

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,770
but I'm pretty sure you have
some deeper truth to impart.

77
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,230
It means that some random
doctor of indeterminate

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,570
skill thinks that the patient's
bowel is obstructed.

79
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,870
Okay, you're upset because they
threw you out of their lounge.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Look at the X-ray.

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,250
It's a normal gas pattern.

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,120
If you want, I can get you

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,850
- ...a key to the oncology lounge.
- Air in the colon.

84
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,210
- We're getting TiVo.
- If it's air,

85
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,260
no bowel obstruction.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,570
Even if it is air, it could have
been there before the obstruction.

87
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,980
No. Something's infected
both these infants.

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,830
And you're the only one
who put this together because...

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,220
Because I'm the only one
who looked at both kids.

90
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,165
I want them isolated.
I want the maternity ward shut down.

91
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,670
Because you're better at reading
an X-ray than a radiologist.

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,110
Radiologists always
over-read babies' X-rays,

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,110
especially if they're asked
to rule out a pathology.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,030
- He read into it what he wanted.
- Which is exactly what you're doing.

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,790
You're finding a cluster because you
think it's interesting to find a cluster.

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,090
Two plain old sick babies
would bore you.

97
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,430
See, this is why I don't
waste money on shrinks,

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,690
'cause you give me all these
really great insights for free.

99
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Shrink.

100
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,500
If you would consider going to
a shrink, I would pay for it myself.

101
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,390
The hospital would hold
a bake sale, for God's sake.

102
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,238
We have an epidemic!

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,680
Two sick babies is very sad,
but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

104
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,085
How many do?

105
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,420
Get up. We're going hunting.

106
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,210
For what?

107
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,350
Wabbits.

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,400
Hi. Bye.

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,360
He's screaming. He's fine.

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,534
Good-looking baby.

111
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,310
Oh, sorry. Wrong room.
We'll see you later.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Twelve rooms, right? That's it?

113
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,089
Yep. We've definitely
checked the whole floor.

114
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,000
Good news. No epidemic.

115
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,230
Tragic, huh?

116
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,934
Overflow rooms, third floor.

117
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,200
This imaginary infection
has spread to the next floor?

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,234
- We were just gonna call.
- Did he get hot all of a sudden?

119
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Yeah.

120
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,060
Yeah, I'll take care of that for you.

121
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,600
Almost there, honey.
Don't worry. We're almost there.

122
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,410
Excuse me! Hi.

123
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,900
Hi.

124
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,940
Intake sent you up here?

125
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,060
Yeah, my wife's contractions...

126
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,790
- ...are less than...
- Okay, Intake messed up. I am very, very sorry.

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,790
Nurse Alpert will arrange
for an ambulance...

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,820
to take you to Princeton General.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,070
The maternity ward is temporarily closed.

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,420
We have to leave?

131
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,340
- Yes. I am very sorry.
- Why are you doing this?

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,691
You will be there
very, very soon.

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,027
Happy now?

134
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:39,390
No.

135
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,155
But I am interested.

136
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,870
Three sick babies, and a fourth
showing early symptoms.

137
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,750
- How bad?
- Spiking fevers.

138
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,470
B.P.'s plummeting.
They're barely able to keep systolic up.

139
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,010
At this rate, they
could be dead in a day.

140
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,000
Where did this come from?

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,040
Two delivery rooms, four
different maternity rooms.

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,060
No common personnel and
no common equipment.

143
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,940
- There's got to be something in common.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,650
That would be the difference
between an epidemic and a coincidence.

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,060
I'm putting a team together.
We're gonna start swabbing.

146
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,030
What's she gonna swab? Every respirator,
sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital?

147
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,830
- That'll take months.
- Needle in a haystack.

148
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,710
It's worse than that, We don't even
know it's a needle we're looking for.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,810
Then why'd you let her go do it?

150
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,440
Because the hospital is her
baby, and her baby's sick.

151
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,360
If she doesn't solve this
soon, her head's gonna

152
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,140
explode, and I don't
want to get any on me.

153
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,950
So let's figure out
what's in the haystack.

154
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,400
- Differential diagnosis, people.
- Parasite.

155
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,550
- It's spreading too quickly.
- Next?

156
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,360
Virus?

157
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,560
The kids are too sick, and the
blood tests showed no lymphocytosis.

158
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,490
And they're not responding
to acyclovir or ribavirin.

159
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,090
If it's some other virus,
we'll never find it in time anyway.

160
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,860
Which leads us
to bacterial infection.

161
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,630
It's not responding to broad-spectrum
antibiotics, so we've got something resistant.

162
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,130
- The usual suspects?
- MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

163
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,150
Maybe contaminated food
or water source.

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Pseudomonas.

165
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,810
- V.R.E.?
- "H" flu.

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,970
Okay. Those are the big ones.

167
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,140
Cultures will take 48 hours.
Might as well be postmortem.

168
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,640
We'll start them on vancomycin for the
MRSA and aztreonam to cover the rest.

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,500
Let's get M.R.I.'s, check for
abscesses or some occult infection.

170
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find
something important, or unimportant.

171
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,810
We did an M.R.I. on all the babies, and,
unfortunately, we didn't find anything,

172
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,287
so we're starting them on the
strongest antibiotics that we've got,

173
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,248
and we're hoping that
that will take care of it.

174
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,417
But he's so tiny.

175
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,544
How sick is he?

176
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,760
His fever's up to 103.5,
and his blood pressure is 80 over 40.

177
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,342
How, um...
How bad is that?

178
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,960
It's low. The heart needs
to circulate the blood.

179
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,840
If it's weak, the oxygen isn't getting
to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.

180
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,670
I have to ask you something.

181
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,580
- Judy...
- No, no, Kim. Let me.

182
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,000
I had a cold last month,
and I told the doctors about it.

183
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,910
Honey, this has nothing
to do with you.

184
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Kim's right.

185
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,900
Your son was born healthy.

186
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,248
He caught the infection
after his birth.

187
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,250
There's no reason to think
that he caught it from you.

188
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,430
But you don't know. I mean,
you don't know how he got sick.

189
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,900
Pretty standard question...
"How sick is my child?"

190
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,600
- You couldn't answer.
- I answered.

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,210
You rattled off numbers...
B.P., O2 sats.

192
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,960
- It's not what they need to know.
- What they need

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
to know is the future.
You got a Magic 8 ball?

194
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,740
No, just eight years
of medical training.

195
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,570
Look, I realize it's tough
to break bad news to families.

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,740
Not as tough as hearing it.

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,440
And I guess being the poor guy dying
is the toughest of all?

198
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
No.

199
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,900
It's easier to die
than to watch someone die.

200
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,345
Well, we're checking the vents.
It could be airborne.

201
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,920
Somebody get the sinks, too,
and underneath them.

202
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
I'll get it.

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,740
How many med students
have you got swabbing the decks?

204
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,940
What else are they gonna do?
It's not like they're delivering babies.

205
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,740
- You find anything yet?
- Uh, yeah.

206
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,540
About half the antibacterial gel
dispensers are empty or broken.

207
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,783
That's bad, yet diagnostically
completely insignificant.

208
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,490
Well, if the staff can't wash their hands,
it's no wonder an infection has spread.

209
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,570
- Hey! Tie clip!
- Sorry?

210
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,629
We have an epidemic in this hospital,
and your tie is becoming a petri dish.

211
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,465
Put on a tie clip
or take the damn thing off.

212
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,889
My joints have been feeling all loose,
and lately I've been feeling sick a lot.

213
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,770
Maybe I'm over-training.

214
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm doing the marathon, like, 10 miles a
day, but I can't seem to lose any weight.

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Lift up your arms.

216
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
You have a parasite.

217
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,880
- Like a tapeworm or something?
- Lie back and lift up your sweater.

218
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,285
You can put your arms down.

219
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,410
- Can you do anything about it?
- Only for about a month or so.

220
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,530
After that it becomes illegal to remove,
except in a couple states.

221
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,800
- Illegal?
- But don't worry.

222
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,881
Many women learn
to embrace this parasite.

223
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,520
They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes,
arrange play dates with other parasites.

224
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,680
- Play dates?
- It has your eyes.

225
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,550
But that's impossible.

226
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,480
Well, I assume you weren't
getting your period.

227
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,560
Maybe that should have
given you an inkling.

228
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,350
- But I'm on this birth control implant.
- Yeah, I know.

229
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,920
- I saw the scar on your arm.
- And my doctor said I

230
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,570
might not get any periods
at all if it was working.

231
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,450
Interestingly enough, you also
don't get any periods if it isn't working,

232
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,400
which is why you were supposed
to get regular pregnancy tests.

233
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,940
I'm gonna send a nurse in here
to schedule your prenatal care.

234
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,086
You're due in about five months,
so start planning the shower.

235
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,530
Doctor?

236
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,320
Please, me and my husband
wanted to have a kid soon,

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
but, oh, God,

238
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,680
like four months ago,
we had this really big fight.

239
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,220
He moved out.
I did something stupid.

240
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,520
- One-night stand?
- Ex-boyfriend.

241
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,900
Well, I'll schedule you
a paternity test too.

242
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,365
I can't let my husband know.

243
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,490
Does the old boyfriend look
like your husband?

244
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Yeah.

245
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,590
Then just have the kid.
He'll never know.

246
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,260
The most successful marriages
are based on lies.

247
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
You're off to a great start.

248
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,460
Well, you look cheery.
What's going on?

249
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,500
The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies,
their kidneys are shutting down.

250
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,820
And the urine tests show no casts.

251
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,170
Which means the antibiotics
are causing the kidney failure.

252
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,510
You're the nephrologist.
Which one did it?

253
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,938
We'll take 'em off that one.

254
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,430
Don't tell me both
vancomycin and aztreonam.

255
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,620
They both can cause this.

256
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,290
There's no way to know
which one it is. No test.

257
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,520
We can't take 'em off the antibiotics
though. They'll die of the infection.

258
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,140
If we leave them on both the antibiotics,
they'll die of kidney failure.

259
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,160
So, we take our best guess then.
Which drug's causing the kidney failure?

260
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,880
It's like I said, it's always MRSA in
hospitals. Take them off aztreonam.

261
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,580
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I
vote to take them off the vancomycin.

262
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,920
There's no point in guessing.

263
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,520
Take one kid off vancomycin,
the other off aztreonam.

264
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,910
They have the same disease. You want
to give them different treatments?

265
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,010
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,940
Therapeutic trial, to find
the cause of the infection.

267
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
That's wrong.

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,100
We have four sick kids at least.

269
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,994
Who knows how many more haven't
started showing symptoms yet?

270
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,510
We have a duty to these two.

271
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,720
If these two have different reactions,
we'll know how to save the rest.

272
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,560
So you're condemning one of these
kids to die based on random chance?

273
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,440
I guess I am.

274
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,630
So you're going to flip a coin?

275
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,720
That's how you decide
which baby lives?

276
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,580
Can I borrow a quarter?

277
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,180
Do you want to get sued,
lose your license, House?

278
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,790
Well, generally I'd applaud that,
but my job is to protect this hospital,

279
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,390
so I strongly advise you to come up
with a medical rationale...

280
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,940
why baby "A" should get medicine "X"
and vice versa.

281
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,820
Hold on there, slick.
We didn't all go to law school.

282
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,150
Your advice is that I should
use medical reasons to make

283
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
medical decisions? Hmm,
that's not gonna be as easy.

284
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,230
Any medical justification.
It doesn't need to be a good one.

285
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,370
Well, "Hartig" sounds
Jewish, so does aztreonam,

286
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,910
so we'll take the Hartig
kid off vancomycin.

287
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
How's that?

288
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,950
- You can't experiment on babies.
- Doctors experiment all the time.

289
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,750
- On adults, with their consent.
- Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

290
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,070
Their informed consent.
They have to know the

291
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,440
other kid is getting a
different treatment.

292
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,640
Sorry. Can't do that. It
would be unethical for one

293
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,630
patient to know about another
patient's treatment.

294
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,740
They have a right to know.

295
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,760
If they know, they won't consent.
That defeats the whole purpose.

296
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,780
That's their right.

297
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,100
Two more babies
have just become symptomatic.

298
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,770
I defer to your legal wisdom.

299
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,460
Which takes precedence six dying
babies or a missing consent form?

300
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
You can't do it.

301
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,767
Do what you think is best.

302
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,260
Your daughter's kidneys
are shutting down.

303
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,830
Your son's kidneys are failing.

304
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,660
So we're going to
take her off the aztreonam.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,830
We're taking him off vancomycin.

306
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,990
But what, what made her
sick in the first place?

307
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,000
- What do you think is causing it?
- It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.

308
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,870
We think it's MRSA...
Methicillin-resistant staph aureus.

309
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,920
It's a very resistant form
of a very common bacteria.

310
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,610
We're hoping the aztreonam
will clear it up.

311
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,220
Vancomycin is the best treatment for MRSA,
so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

312
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,240
Is it gonna cure her?

313
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,480
Your child is very sick.
You need to know that.

314
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,040
This is a Hail Mary pass.
It might cure her. It might not.

315
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,330
So, that'll cure him?

316
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,300
We'll know in 24 hours
if it's working.

317
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,160
- What did you tell them?
- I told them the truth.

318
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,590
They seemed relieved.
Did you tell them how sick their son is?

319
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,780
- I explained what was going on.
- Allison, their baby's dying.

320
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,810
If the parents weren't
in tears by the time you left,

321
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,880
you didn't tell them the truth.

322
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,580
- That's not how I see it.
- Do you want them blindsided?

323
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,210
Want them coming up and saying, "My God,
my baby died. Why didn't you warn me?"

324
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,020
So now it's about worrying
about them yelling at us?

325
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,380
No.

326
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,220
It's about getting them prepared
for the likely death of their child.

327
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,920
If their son dies tomorrow,

328
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
you think they'll
give a damn what I said to them today?

329
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,770
It's not gonna matter.
They're not gonna care.

330
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
Nothing's gonna be the same ever again.

331
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,360
Just give those poor women
a few hours of hope.

332
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,869
- Dr. House!
- Oh, no.

333
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:19,590
Dr. House,
this is my husband, Charlie.

334
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,160
Who told you
where my office was?

335
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,910
Jill, come on. He obviously
doesn't want us bothering him.

336
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,586
Oh, I was trying to hide it.

337
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,341
Look, Doctor, this is about the mono
that you said you thought I had.

338
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,660
- The mono?
- Yes.

339
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,971
You know,
shouldn't Charlie be tested?

340
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,290
You know, the test.
The blood test.

341
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Right.

342
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,150
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I sometimes forget patients.

343
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,480
I thought you were this idiot who
doesn't know how to use birth control.

344
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,110
I can't have mono. I don't
even feel sick or anything.

345
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,600
That's very often the first sign.

346
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Call my office in the morning,
and I'll schedule you for blood tests.

347
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,550
Thank you.

348
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm not even tired.

349
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Find anything yet?

350
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,260
Oh, just some baby formula being stored
under a sink with a dripping faucet.

351
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,260
Tap water contamination.
You thinking pseudomonas infection?

352
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,890
I was. I wasted a couple
of hours chasing it down.

353
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,580
But, of course, the formula hasn't
been anywhere near the babies.

354
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,450
- Whatever idiot stored them there...
- Alright.

355
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,370
We'll figure it out.
Just calm down.

356
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,200
- I am calm.
- Let me know when you're gonna need it.

357
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
- Oh, come...
- I warned you.

358
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,164
I did that calmly.

359
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,589
- Hey.
- Hi.

360
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,842
She any better?

361
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,679
Uh, her fever has been stable
the last hour.

362
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,100
We're not gonna make it, are we?

363
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,330
Sorry?

364
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,770
Me and Ethan.

365
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,691
Our next-door neighbor,

366
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,120
her little boy died
in a car crash,

367
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,440
and she and her husband split up,
like, four months after the funeral.

368
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,240
It's just, uh,
what always happens, right?

369
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,980
What happens to patients after
they leave the hospital, I don't know,

370
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,640
but try not to get ahead
of yourself.

371
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,440
Dr. Chase, activity on the monitor.

372
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,250
- How long?
- I don't know. It just started.

373
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,099
Pulse? Fluid, wide open.

374
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,020
- Do we have an arterial line?
- Not yet.

375
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,477
Let's get a B.P.

376
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,450
- You can't come in here.
- Is my baby dying?

377
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,090
- Mrs. Hartig...
- Is she dying?

378
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,960
Ma'am, you'll have to leave.

379
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,445
It's not your baby.

380
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Ventilate.

381
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,460
B.P. 60 over 20.

382
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,520
- Heart rate's 180.
- Start the levophed.

383
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,040
Still dropping.

384
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,251
50 over 10.

385
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,965
I can't hold B.P.,
even with three pressors.

386
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm losing pulse.

387
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,110
V-fib.

388
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,990
Shut the blinds.

389
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,000
- Charging.
- Set.

390
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,210
Clear.

391
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Still V-fib.

392
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,580
Charging. Clear.

393
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,280
Charging. Clear.

394
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Still V-fib.

395
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,740
Charging. Clear.

396
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,800
- Charging.
- Chase.

397
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,670
Time of death...
6:57PM

398
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,003
The aztreonam doesn't work.

399
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,720
Double-cover all the other babies
with vancomycin.

400
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,270
I'll do it.

401
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
Cameron, tell the parents.

402
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,560
Tell them their child
probably saved five lives.

403
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,920
- But Chase should...
- Chase is busy.

404
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,110
You're the attending.

405
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
Make sure she does her job.

406
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,673
I asked you to make sure
she does her job, not do it for her.

407
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:06,850
- She froze up.
- She felt sorry for the parents, so she shut up.

408
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,040
You felt sorry for her,
so you opened your mouth.

409
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
She has a problem.

410
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,440
She needs to deal with it.

411
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,150
If you hadn't bailed her out,
she would have done it.

412
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,120
Great. Then she wouldn't
have slept for two weeks.

413
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,880
Maybe she should be thinking
about a different specialty.

414
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,565
Lab work? Research?

415
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,470
Yeah, what is it?

416
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,100
The Hartig baby...
she's getting sicker too.

417
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,780
The vancomycin
isn't working either.

418
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Vancomycin doesn't kill it.
Aztreonam doesn't kill it.

419
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,040
What the hell is this?

420
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,280
It's a superbug.
It could be V.R.S.A.

421
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,210
There's only been two reported cases
ever in the United States.

422
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,760
One of the kids,
the Hausen baby, had a skin rash.

423
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
It could be scalded-skin
syndrome, which would

424
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,250
- ...be a sign of V.R.S.A.
- Then these kids are dead.

425
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,517
This is our fault.

426
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,600
Doctors over-prescribing antibiotics.

427
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,773
Got a cold?
Take some penicillin.

428
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,380
Sniffles? No problem.
Have some azithromycin.

429
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,630
Is that not working anymore?
Well, got your Levaquin.

430
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,040
Antibacterial soaps
in every bathroom.

431
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,000
They'll be adding vancomycin
to the water supply soon.

432
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,500
We bred these superbugs.

433
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,210
They're our babies,
and they're all grown up,

434
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,760
and they've got body piercings
and a lot of anger.

435
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,216
On the other hand, maybe antibiotics
had nothing to do with it.

436
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,960
Did you notice how low his B.P. was
at the end, even with three pressors?

437
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,750
Heart damage?

438
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,898
Go home. There's nothing more
you can do tonight.

439
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,753
Baby Boy Chen-Lupino.

440
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,700
Time of death 6:57 p.m.,
Thursday, December 2, 2004.

441
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,020
This is a cross section
of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.

442
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,299
Fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates.

443
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,803
There was no sign of lymphocytosis
in the blood tests.

444
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,130
Yes, well, we all had plenty
of good reasons to think bacterial.

445
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,560
Nobody is scolding you.

446
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,477
Unfortunately,
all those clever reasons were wrong.

447
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,230
It is a virus
infecting their hearts.

448
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,607
Then we're screwed. We
can't chase down a virus.

449
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:11,611
- There's a thousand possibilities.
- We could run gels, antibody tests.

450
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,800
- A thousand of them?
- The kids don't have enough blood.

451
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,870
Chase, you're the intensivist.
How many could

452
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,090
we do before we risk
exsanguinating the kids?

453
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,220
You're talking vials, not stick tests?
I wouldn't take more than five or six.

454
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,760
Okay, so we have to narrow
the thousand viruses down to six.

455
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,340
Now, the autopsy's shown us
what the virus does.

456
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,860
So, let's go. What do we know?

457
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,200
That ribavirin and acyclovir
don't knock it out.

458
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,000
- Cross out the herpes viruses.
- Also adenovirus.

459
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,630
What else? What else?
Keep talking!

460
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,950
Well, It only seems
to hit children.

461
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,640
- The mothers aren't sick, so...
- No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.

462
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,190
Cross out the entire
TORCH syndrome.

463
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,460
- You didn't find any lung damage?
- No.

464
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,323
- None of the paramyxoviridae.
- Cardiac scarring, people.

465
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,325
C.M.V.

466
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,320
Enteroviruses too, I think.

467
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,251
- Eleven.
- Influenza A.

468
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,337
Flu A.

469
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,670
Yes?

470
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
And?

471
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,440
I'm putting R.S.V. down as a yes.

472
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,640
That makes eight.

473
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,906
- Eight vials of blood is pushing it.
- Pushing it? Well, we love that.

474
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,120
Get the antibody kits,
start testing the sick kids.

475
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,340
Alright, I'll look into whether
there are any antivirals for these eight.

476
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,480
Wait a second. The kids on
the floor who didn't get

477
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
sick, are any of them
still in the hospital?

478
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,810
They got moved to the fifth floor, but
they're probably all checked out by now.

479
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,540
No, the Limpert boy had a bit of jaundice.
He's checking out today.

480
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,310
- I want to test his blood too.
- Why?

481
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,460
Because we need
all the information we can get.

482
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,370
The healthy kid
can be our control group.

483
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,170
I'll just tell his parents he can't
check out because he has the smallpox.

484
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,520
<i>Stephen Morgan,
contact Hospital Administration.</i>

485
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,360
<i>Dr. Paul to the Recovery Room.</i>

486
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,117
All done. All done.

487
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
What did we get?

488
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,166
Well, the sick babies
all tested positive for echovirus 11.

489
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,510
- Great.
- And C.M.V., and parvovirus B-19.

490
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,690
Three viruses?

491
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,840
But what's weirder, the
healthy kid we tested,

492
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,960
he's positive for echovirus 11
and C.M.V. antibodies as well.

493
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,520
They're infants.

494
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,720
They have their mother's blood,
their mother's antibodies.

495
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,020
So we've just learned nothing?

496
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,670
We have half the picture.
The healthy kids survived

497
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,820
because their mothers'
antibodies saved them.

498
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,080
If the mom had C.M.V. in
the past, she'd have the

499
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,320
antibodies for C.M.V. The kid
would be immune from it.

500
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,140
So, we test the sick kids' moms
for echovirus, C.M.V. and parvovirus.

501
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,020
And whichever they
don't have the antibodies for,

502
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,751
that's what's killing their kids.

503
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,794
I'll test the mothers.

504
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,470
<i>Dr. Kent's office, one.</i>

505
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,340
Echovirus 11.

506
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,770
It's an enterovirus.
It lodges in the intestinal tract.

507
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,360
Enteroviruses cause diarrhea and flu-like
symptoms in adults, maybe a rash,

508
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,440
but for newborns,
it can be deadly.

509
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,020
It's damaging her heart.

510
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,981
Well, is there anything
you can do?

511
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:19,960
Viruses are more difficult to treat
than bacterial infections.

512
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,560
We still haven't found a cure
for the common cold.

513
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,990
So, you mean there's no vaccine or...

514
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,700
There's a company in Pennsylvania
developing an antiviral.

515
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,920
It got positive results
in a lab setting.

516
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,871
We managed
to get our hands on it.

517
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,460
Imagine not being able
to touch your own baby.

518
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,840
- Can I get your guys' help
with something?
- Sure.

519
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,771
- Your daughter, her...
- Maxine.

520
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,480
That's her name... Maxine.

521
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,120
We need someone to hold Maxine up off the
bed while the nurse changes her sheet.

522
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,283
Sure. Okay.

523
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,680
Look at you. Hi.

524
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,760
Hold still.

525
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
That's it.

526
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,800
Hi. Easy. Shh.

527
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
There you go.

528
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Hey, Foreman.

529
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,950
Got a minute?

530
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,780
So, pulmonary resistance has stabilized
for the two kids, but, uh, B.P.'s still...

531
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,100
No news then. How's Cameron?

532
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,560
- Dr. Cameron?
- Sure.

533
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,280
Let's start with her and then move on
to all the other Camerons we know.

534
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,960
I'm sorry. I'm just not used to you
asking about someone's well-being.

535
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,290
I can understand how the
question would surprise you.

536
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,160
I don't quite get how it
would confuse you.

537
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,560
- Why do you wanna know?
- Why do you wanna know why I want to know?

538
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,280
- Just curious.
- Me too.

539
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,820
You don't get curious.

540
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,570
I'm the most curious man in the world.
Not about trivialities.

541
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,680
Well, then
this must not be trivial.

542
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,440
How is Cameron
handling everything?

543
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,710
Just fine.

544
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,274
Great. Glad we talked.

545
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,826
Your husband is definitely
the source of your mono.

546
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,495
Oh. Wow!

547
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,163
Oh, thank God.

548
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,520
Wow. I'm gonna be a mom.

549
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,335
Whoa!

550
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,900
Thank you so much. I gotta
get you a gift or something.

551
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,100
Sometimes the best gift
is the gift of never seeing you again.

552
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,880
Okay. Alright.

553
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,050
But, Dr. House,
you've been so awesome.

554
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,160
I mean,
I really totally trust you.

555
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,180
- Do you think you...
- No.

556
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,390
Could do the prenatal...

557
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,890
No.

558
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,450
- Or deliver the baby?
- That would be "no".

559
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,530
Okay.

560
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Wow.

561
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,140
Chase, take a look at this.

562
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,860
Oh, God. It's good news.

563
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,540
No. It's great.

564
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,920
Thank you.

565
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,880
- Hi.
- She's doing great.

566
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,500
Hi, little girl.

567
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,637
- They all gone?
- Hartigs are checking out right now.

568
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,810
- You look tired.
- Thanks.

569
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,880
It's no wonder. You've had a hard
time the last couple of days.

570
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,274
And you haven't?

571
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,317
Not like you.

572
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,156
Anyone who's that awkward...

573
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,600
either has no experience
with death or too much,

574
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,329
and I'm pretty sure
it's not the former.

575
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,720
Chase told me about that idea you had,
the parents holding the baby.

576
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,310
Where'd you get that?

577
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,240
Did you lose someone?

578
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,440
Did you lose a baby?

579
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,434
You can be a real bastard.

580
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,998
Unfinished business?

581
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm in the haystack.

582
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,090
Ah, because now you know
you're looking for a needle.

583
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,090
Right.

584
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,220
If I tell you to let it go,
it won't make any difference, will it?

585
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,770
Enteroviruses
are spread by humans.

586
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,200
Fecal oral usually.

587
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,310
It could be respiratory
secretions though.

588
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,230
So Cuddy got stool samples from the whole
staff. Just wait till they come back.

589
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,939
- That won't do it.
- Why not?

590
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,010
The shedder, whoever he is,

591
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,750
he's so virulent,
he must have been symptomatic.

592
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,320
Cuddy would have noticed him.

593
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,740
And the babies didn't share
any common personnel.

594
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,420
- That's what's weird.
- Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.

595
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,372
<i>Transition Team to O.R. 2.</i>

596
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,880
<i>Transition Team to O.R. 2.</i>

597
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,137
Can I help you?

598
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,940
- You saved my life.
- I just ran some tests.

599
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,100
Your will and determination
are what saved your life.

600
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,440
- I know who I am now.
- Yes, you do.

601
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,690
<i>And I know who I am as well.</i>

602
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:26,360
<i>Naomi, I love you.</i>

603
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,325
Hey, seriously, man.
You're not supposed to be here.

604
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,496
I'm performing a delivery.
You are?

605
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,190
Patient whose prenatal care
I've been handling.

606
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,880
I just took her on
a couple of minutes ago.

607
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,961
Of course, I'll need one
of you two guys to supervise.

608
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,131
When's she due? Late March.

609
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,176
That's five months from now.

610
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,510
Thank God these chairs
are comfortable.
