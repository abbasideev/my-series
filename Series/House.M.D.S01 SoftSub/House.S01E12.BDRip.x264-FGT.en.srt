1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,490
Are you thinking about taking drugs?
Well...

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,490
think again, because drugs
are not the answer.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,750
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, don't remember this ugly mug?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,619
Two years ago, I was a star.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,809
I won nine games in a row.
But by the end of August I was a goner.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,090
Cut, cut!

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,760
Not good, huh?

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,540
Well, you caught the ball.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:32,690
Yeah.

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,670
Look, I usually don't give line readings,
but try this, here, here.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,610
Hollywood ain't holding its breath.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,200
Well, they're doing it wrong.
I mean, for Hank.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,460
Tell the director.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,080
I thought I'd give the marriage a few months
before I'd go for the meddling wife thing.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,090
His arm came back day
after he hooked up, I say meddle.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,570
You okay?

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,800
Just gas. Go help your man.
Give me a little room here to work it out.

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,790
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.
Like that?

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,580
No...

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,750
Hey, sweetheart.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Hey.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,110
Hi, Bryan.

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,350
Hey.

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,539
You boys having a little trouble
with the big speech?

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,540
Yeah, you got any ideas?

27
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,380
It's your story.
Just be yourself.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,610
Drugs were there,
you took 'em. Simple.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,130
Why'd you get clean?

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Because I was gonna die.

31
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,150
And come April, 'cause you're clean,

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,620
You're starting, opening day,
against the Yanks.

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,950
Try it her way?

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Yeah.

35
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,929
Let's start with the 2nd part first.

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,130
That'll get him in the groove.

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
Okay.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,160
We'll do the throwing thing first.

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,400
Everybody wants to direct...

41
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,710
Warner alright?

42
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,760
Yeah, he's good. You just
bring it, babe. Just tell your story.

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,021
Come on, kid! Show 'em what
you're gonna give the Yankees!

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
Alright, action!

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,380
Oh, God!

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,850
It's gonna be okay,
It's gonna be okay.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,019
He's got osteopenia.
His bones are too thin to fix the arm.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,090
No, price is not a problem
if you have what I need.

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,070
- Osteo...
- Young man?

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,620
How did you know?

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,909
Well, if he's an old man,
osteopenia would just be a fact of life,

52
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,816
you make him comfortable, send him home,
which means you're just boring me.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,309
So he's young, which means
it's most likely caused by cancer,

54
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,016
and you're here
because you haven't found it.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,709
Have you looked really, really hard?

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,809
MRI and PET scan are both negative.

57
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,640
Well, how old is he?
Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,340
Well, let's see. Born 9/21/77.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,810
It's Hank Wiggen?

60
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,570
- He signed it, sweet.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,790
To Jimmy Wilson,
the Cy Young of medicine.

62
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,690
You ask for that?

63
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,900
I just the Jimmy part.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,320
The bone's too thin to support the kind of
surgery that would let him pitch again.

65
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,109
But if we figure out
what's causing the osteopenia,

66
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,639
we can reverse the bone damage,
then do the surgery.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,280
Beat the Yankees, and save the free world.

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,560
It was a working dinner.
My work, company pays.

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,120
I dunno. I just feel kinda weird
after what it turned into.

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,790
Well, then it stopped being work.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,790
You know, if it'll solve
your ethics problem

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,619
you can reimburse me for these.

73
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,370
What are they, five dollars and
fifty-seven cents, I believe?

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,680
. You let me know about Friday?

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Yeah.

76
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,399
None of the usual suspects!

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,759
Age isn't right, in apparent
perfect health before

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,089
this incident, MRI and PET
scan negative for tumors.

79
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,000
Test him again,
it's gotta be cancer.

80
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,190
Sorry I'm late.
Car broke down on the interstate.

81
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Don't believe you.

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,179
Chem 7 also shows
a poor kidney function.

83
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,340
Now why would a guy in
his twenties have a poor kidney?

84
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,329
Cancer. It first attacks the bones,
and then the kidneys.

85
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,569
Come on, people.

86
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,410
He was 17 and 7!
His ERA was 2.1.

87
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,139
You want it to be his kidneys,
because if it's his kidneys,

88
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,550
then maybe we can treat it,
maybe we can fix it.

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,710
And if it's cancer,
then he'll never pitch again.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,899
If this were a regular guy who
came in and broke his arm lifting a box,

91
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,246
you would've packed him up
and sent him home!

92
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,810
My God, you're right,
I lost my head.

93
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,110
All life is equally sacred.

94
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,239
And I promise you, the
next knitting injury that

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,620
comes in here, we're on
it like stink on cheese.

96
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,529
He weighed 175 his rookie year.

97
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,030
Stop.

98
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,530
Now he's 195 after playing
a year in Japan. Why?

99
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,820
He let himself go.

100
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Steroids!

101
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,379
I mean, the guy was a drug user,

102
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,689
I'm sure he wouldn't have balked
at pumping up through chemicals.

103
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,969
That'd explain the weight gain.
And the kidney problems.

104
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,510
And the bone loss.
Go ask him what he's on.

105
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,770
When he says nothing,
have him pee in a cup.

106
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,099
If your car breaks down,
you're an hour late, not two minutes.

107
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,690
And two minutes isn't late enough
to use a clever excuse like car trouble.

108
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,370
I was coming in early.

109
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,240
Unprompted lies,
that's a bad sign.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,990
Either a guilty conscience or
something personal's going on.

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,220
See, that's all you had to do,
Just walk in, sit down, do your job.

112
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,120
No, no, I never took them.

113
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,960
We're gonna need a urine sample.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,660
Oh no, you don't trust me.

115
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,730
Baby, I'm worried about
taking this morphine.

116
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,390
You're in pain,
the doses are monitored.

117
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,230
It's not a slip.
Besides, opiates weren't your thing.

118
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,100
They should've been.

119
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,510
Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample.

120
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,650
I wanna say no, so I am. No.

121
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,570
Trust is a big issue in early recovery.
He really did gain the weight honestly.

122
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
If you say so.

123
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,890
You're not getting it.

124
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,060
He thinks I'm an idiot.

125
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,330
He sure does.

126
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,060
Should we save the sample?

127
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,350
Dr. Sportsfan can put it in Lucite
and hang it around his neck.

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey, Friday night?
Can you cover for me?

129
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
I think so.

130
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,460
Oh, Friday. No, I'm sorry, I have to go
to that oncology thing... that seminar.

131
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,120
Oh.

132
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
What's going on?

133
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,350
Dinner with the... drug rep.
Casting pharmaceuticals.

134
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,830
Arnie?

135
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,800
Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes,
only tells one?

136
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
New guy.

137
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
You need cash?

138
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,890
No. I don't have that much on me...

139
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,110
No no, it's not a problem.

140
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,120
Ya, I'll be over by 6. 'Kay.

141
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,399
5 p.m., Dr. House checks out.

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,630
It's 4:45.

143
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,910
I was rounding up.

144
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,890
Carol Moffett,
please see Dr. House in Exam Room 1.

145
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,990
Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy.

146
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,190
It's Carol.

147
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Ah.

148
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,190
Uh, trouble with the leg?

149
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
When's the wedding?

150
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,450
This Saturday.

151
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:13,059
Oh. Not much time to fit
into that pretty dress,

152
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,069
and no time for practical shoe-shopping.

153
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,349
You're running two miles a day
further than you should be.

154
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,379
It hurts right here...

155
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,780
New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the
afternoon Cokes, you're gonna look beautiful.

156
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,110
What's wrong with you?

157
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,239
I can't get my contact lenses out...

158
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,979
Out of what?
They're not in your eyes.

159
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
But they're red.

160
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,210
That's because you're trying to
remove your corneas.

161
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,310
What's wrong with you?

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,719
Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that...

163
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,079
Yeah, yeah. Symptoms,

164
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,779
we're working on a personal best here.

165
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,799
Yeah. Numbness in my feet
and hands, constipation...

166
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,230
And?

167
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,929
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable
talking about his private matters...

168
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,770
Well, neither would I, if I was having
trouble controlling my pee pee!

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
You're a dentist.

170
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,789
Nitrous oxide poisoning,

171
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,789
which means you're either dipping
into your own supply,

172
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,326
or you've got a bad valve in the office.

173
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,999
Laughing gas rehab's probably
more expensive than the plumber.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,820
Meanwhile, get yourself some B12.

175
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,130
Who's left?

176
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,440
I can't see...

177
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,500
Nah, I'm just screwing with you.

178
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,269
It's a hangover,
my English Lit prof. Told me

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,790
he'd fail me next time
if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.

180
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,219
Well, make friends with the dentist.

181
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,060
He can give you a note, and maybe
a little nitrous to take the edge off.

182
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,450
Dr. House!

183
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,080
He tested negative for steroids.

184
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,419
Elevated beta 2 proteins, though,
could be cancerous.

185
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,389
Amyloidosis, or lymphoma.

186
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,139
Or steroids.
You guys got any money on you?

187
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,519
He tested negative for steroids.
I, um, I have a couple 20s on me.

188
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
50 of them?

189
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,810
Foreman?

190
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:38,559
The FAT PAD biopsy and abdominal CT scan
were negative for the cancers, but...

191
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,390
Well, that just leaves us with steroids!

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,059
He tested negative for steroids.

193
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,399
Less money is made by biochemists
working on a cure for cancer than by

194
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,830
their colleagues struggling valiantly
to find ways to hide steroid use.

195
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
But there's one thing they can't hide...

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,150
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

197
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,670
And this is the coolest day of my life.

198
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,860
See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles.

199
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,990
I am clean, man,
no steroids, no nothing.

200
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,370
Your lips say no,
your prunes say yes.

201
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,040
Hypogonadism.

202
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,530
Isn't that a great word?

203
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,780
Thanks, we don't get to
say it nearly enough.

204
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,270
Start him on Lupron right away.

205
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,820
These freaks are willing to defile themselves
for mass entertainment, for money.

206
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,640
I feel sorry for them.

207
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,779
He drops a clean urine,
denies using steroids,

208
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,080
then you're giving him a drug
for what, steroid abuse?

209
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,439
No, no, it's not.
It's got calcium in it.

210
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,000
It's very good for the bones.

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,140
Basically, on a molecular level,
it's just milk.

212
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,290
How long do you figure
before I get a call from Cuddy?

213
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,040
You put him on Lupron.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,169
And, you told them it was like milk.

215
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,650
Yes.

216
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,030
Is there any way
in which that is not a lie?

217
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,410
It's creamy.

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,969
But, I had 3 reasons.

219
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,630
Good ones?

220
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,260
Well, we'll see in a minute,
I'm just making them up now...

221
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,130
He lied to me first.

222
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,619
Your mother did teach you
2 wrongs don't make a right.

223
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,679
If he lies to me
about not taking steroids,

224
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,089
then I lie to him about not treating
steroids, he's cured. Adds up for me...

225
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,980
Second reason.

226
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,929
If I told him the truth,
he wouldn't have taken the stuff.

227
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,669
And if he told you the truth,
what would this stuff do to him?

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,200
Severe respiratory problems.

229
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,610
Third reason.

230
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,120
I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.

231
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,690
Excellent!

232
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,370
You and your lawyer can write a paper.

233
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,209
Which brings me to my fourth reason.

234
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,850
I thought you said there were only three.

235
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,046
I thought you'd buy one of them.

236
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,149
Seriously?

237
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,020
He's not gonna sue.

238
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,219
Because his lawyer is a nice guy,

239
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,819
who realizes it's unfair
to blame us for ruining

240
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,800
this kid's hundred
million-dollar career.

241
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,110
Good guess, but no.

242
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,820
If the Lupron causes respiratory problems,
it means he's not on steroids,

243
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,430
which means there's something
else wrong with him.

244
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,120
And the choices, for that something else,
are almost universally very bad.

245
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,300
Osteopenia messing his bones up.

246
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,700
Hypogonadism.

247
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,930
Impaired liver function,
kidney function, and...

248
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,179
we have managed to find
the only professional

249
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,830
athlete in the galaxy
who is not on steroids.

250
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,540
And it's not cancer.
So, what's killing him?

251
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,029
Who shares my suspicions that
the Yankees were somehow involved?

252
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,990
Shrunken testicles indicate his body's
not putting out enough testosterone.

253
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,540
Throw out the lungs,
that was the Lupron, my fault.

254
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,456
Don't worry,
I'll send him a nice note.

255
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
What about something environmental?

256
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,639
Arsenic, mercury,
the symptoms could indicate...

257
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,869
Pretty small environment.
Wife's fine, no one else is sick.

258
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,990
If you throw out the kidneys,
everything else adds up.

259
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,629
The testicles, the bones,
the impaired liver function,

260
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,999
could all be caused
by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
Addison's disease, I like it.

262
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,680
Mainly of course,
because the treatment is...

263
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Steroids.

264
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,619
Enough irony for all of us.

265
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,669
Treatment would cause him to retain fluid.

266
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,259
With the kidneys almost shut
down already, he'll die.

267
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,990
Well, we'll get him a new kidney.

268
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,619
Your theory is that
Addison's is causing all

269
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,690
the symptoms except for
the kidney problems.

270
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,680
What's causing the kidney problems?

271
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,459
Cameron, if you could make
an ironic guess right about now?

272
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,840
- He tested nega...
- Negative for steroids.

273
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,380
Agreed. He's not on steroids now.

274
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,099
If he was on them
anytime in the last five years,

275
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,580
it could've caused the kidney damage.

276
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,520
You see, kidneys don't wear watches.

277
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,660
Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn't
matter, 'cuz kidneys can't tell time.

278
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,730
Steroid damage could take years.

279
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,110
No steroids.

280
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,066
How many times does he have to tell you?

281
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,760
I don't know.

282
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,709
How many times did he lie about cocaine
before coming clean with the league?

283
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,870
That is completely different.

284
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,680
Oh, that's right, I remember.
You never did come clean.

285
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,639
The league was out to get
you, they faked the blood test,

286
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,469
you had to get yourself
a lawyer and everything.

287
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,980
If Hank says he never used steroids,
that's the truth.

288
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,220
That's too bad.

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,800
Because our theory is that
the kidney damage is caused by A,

290
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,800
and everything else is caused by B.

291
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,979
The beauty of this theory is that
we can treat A and B.

292
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,310
But if you add the kidney symptoms
back into the mix,

293
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,300
then we are looking at
another letter altogether,

294
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,360
one that is apparently not in the alphabet.

295
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:50,220
Can't fix the bones, no more baseball, no
more breathing... no more brain function.

296
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,250
Get another explanation.

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,310
Okay. Yeah.
Think I've got one in my other pants.

298
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Hold on.

299
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,980
Five years ago, Bangor, Maine.

300
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,230
My pitching coach had me on something,
I never knew what it was.

301
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,480
And you never tried
too hard to find out either.

302
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,550
I gained 12 pounds of
muscle in like, 4 weeks.

303
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm sorry, baby.

304
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,810
How you doin' Doc?

305
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,910
Good. Very good, yeah.

306
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,919
You want me to put Hank Wiggen
on the transplant list.

307
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,050
He needs a new kidney.

308
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,206
I was thinking
the kidney people might have some.

309
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,939
Well, they like to save
them for people who have...

310
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,299
how do I put this... kidney problems.

311
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,259
He's a professional ballplayer,
brings joy to millions.

312
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,016
Do you really want to be known
as the hospital that sent him home to die?

313
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,730
That's a great idea, we can be the
hospital that killed two people.

314
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,119
The guy who deserved the kidney,
and the ballplayer we bumped

315
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,459
up the list when we weren't even
sure what was wrong with him.

316
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,079
Everything else is related
to the Addison's.

317
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,539
The test for Addison's was inconclusive.

318
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,960
The test for Addison's
is always inconclusive.

319
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
Why do we do it at all?
We should just ask you.

320
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,610
You're not putting him on the list.

321
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,749
Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.

322
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,980
You take a perverse pleasure
at turning me down.

323
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,330
It's what I live for.

324
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,480
Once in a while, though,
try to ruin my day.

325
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,360
Ask me something I can say "yes" to.

326
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,990
Oh, I'm sorry Doctor,
I didn't know you were busy.

327
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Want me to come back?

328
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Is he on the list?

329
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,220
No.

330
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,010
Then I'm giving him one of mine.

331
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Okay.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,280
You're not gonna tell me
it's a bad idea?

333
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,830
Why give a kidney to someone
who might not be able to use it?

334
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,060
Not my area.
That is, however, my chair.

335
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
When do we do it?

336
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,870
Very noble gesture.

337
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,240
My favorite kind,
dramatic, yet completely empty.

338
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,619
The chances of non-identical twins...

339
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,126
- being a match...
- Do you live alone?

340
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,860
You writing a book?

341
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,420
I made it a question
just because it's more polite.

342
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,169
You got a big "Keep Out" sign
stapled on your forehead.

343
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,650
That explains it,
I told them to put it on my door.

344
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,240
Even if real human contact is something
you don't have or even want, or need,

345
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,600
you should at least be able to
see it in other people.

346
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,310
Yeah. Right. True love.
That's just how we match organs these days.

347
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,210
There's a couple in France, high school
sweethearts, they're trading brains.

348
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,000
We're a match. Run your tests.

349
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,180
Hey. The lab call, is she a match?

350
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,190
Haven't heard yet.

351
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,650
You got a text message, though.
Friday night, very cryptic.

352
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,560
Gee... thanks for checking.

353
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,849
Can you cover for me?

354
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,850
Oncology seminar.

355
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,710
Right.

356
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,750
Friday night the same thing
as the car trouble?

357
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,900
I had car trouble.

358
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
House says you were lying.
I believe him.

359
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
What's that?

360
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,099
You got a little wet smudge
at the end of your nose!

361
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,939
Hey, I like the guy.
He says what he wants, does what he wants.

362
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,086
He won't talk to anyone
unless he can jerk them around.

363
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,290
Or needs a thousand bucks.

364
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
What is with that?

365
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,910
I scored.

366
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,200
It's a brave new world, Doc,
and we are at the cutting edge.

367
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,870
You are looking at two all-access
passes to Paradise itself!

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
How much?

369
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,980
True cost, no man can say.

370
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,020
Could that man's accountant say?

371
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,960
One thousand dollars.

372
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,540
Friday night, the biggest official monster
truck jam in the history of New Jersey!

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,169
Okay, please tell me
you didn't just say Friday night.

374
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,710
Whatever you've got, you cancel.

375
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,919
I can't do it!

376
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,070
Listen, they only give
these tickets to owners.

377
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,270
Anytime.

378
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,466
We wanna be in the middle of the track,
we're in the middle of the track.

379
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,820
These tickets are so good...

380
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,470
we have to sign a release.

381
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,000
I mean it. We do this, we could die.

382
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,939
I've got the oncology thing!

383
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
I...

384
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,950
The rectal cancer lecture,
they booked me a year ago!

385
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,340
I can't get out,
there's no way out!

386
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,710
Fine.

387
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll ask one of my other friends.

388
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,030
What, you're saying
I've only got one friend?

389
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,290
Uh, and who...?

390
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,550
Kevin, in Bookkeeping.

391
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,910
Okay, well first of all,
his name's Carl.

392
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,930
I call him Kevin.
It's a secret "friendship club" name.

393
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,110
It's hookers.

394
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,110
Oh, my God!

395
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,299
Multiple hookers!
But House is House, right?

396
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,200
He's gotta have his way.
Four or five of 'em.

397
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,799
That's not even funny!

398
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,999
What, you don't think he has sex?

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,660
No, of course he...

400
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:17,559
Of course not, he doesn't have sex,
he makes love!

401
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,320
I didn't say that.

402
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
It's the lab.

403
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Dr. Foreman.

404
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,339
If you have the results,
I'd like you to talk

405
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,090
to both of us. If you
don't, wait for me to...

406
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,800
Believe me,
I'd much rather be with your better half.

407
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,179
And by better half, of course,
I mean the one who struck

408
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,070
out Sammy Sosa on three
pitches and talks a lot less.

409
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,520
But I thought I would talk
to you first, and alone.

410
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,180
I got your results back from the lab...

411
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,550
you do match.

412
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,240
I do?

413
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,070
You're also pregnant.

414
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,840
You can't be a donor.

415
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,110
Not in your current condition.

416
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,030
Excuse me...
I have to go talk to my husband.

417
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,560
Heart looks good.
We can schedule the transplant.

418
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,030
No transplant.
Lola's not gonna have an abortion.

419
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,510
Actually, your wife just told me
that she was making an appointment.

420
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,220
Well, I don't care what she said.

421
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,599
I think you two need to
discuss this further...

422
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,720
We've been trying to
get pregnant almost since we met.

423
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,099
Well, it's your wife's decision
whether or not she...

424
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,490
She wants to trade a child for a kidney,
that's murder!

425
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,050
I'm not gonna let her do that.

426
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,330
Foreman says we've got a problem
with the transplant.

427
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,750
If she terminates the pregnancy, he's not
going to let himself die on principle.

428
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,830
Would you give up a baby
for someone you love?

429
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,030
Please tell me I don't have to decide.

430
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,970
Depends, how long would they live?

431
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,080
Is this a pragmatic question for you?

432
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,870
Fifty years, no problem.
Six months, I say let 'em die.

433
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,119
Well, I've actually given this
a lot of thought,

434
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,140
and my personal tipping point is
seven years, eight months, and 14 days.

435
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,630
I couldn't do it.

436
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,870
You found religion.

437
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,499
Do you have to be religious
to believe a fetus is a life?

438
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,990
There seems to be a correlation.

439
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,470
I'm, uh...

440
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,850
Do you like monster trucks?

441
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,920
I don't know what they are.

442
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Right.

443
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,580
I got two tickets.

444
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Friday night.

445
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,699
You asking me to go with you?

446
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,460
Sure. Sounds good.

447
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,130
Like a... date?

448
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,090
Exactly.
Except for the "date" part.

449
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Forget it.

450
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,530
Ah... no, I was gonna
go to the oncology dinner...

451
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,360
'Course, you have to
hear Wilson's lecture.

452
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,430
No. I just found out
he canceled like, two weeks ago.

453
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,140
So... what do we wear?

454
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Still with us, Hank?

455
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,470
Yeah. My chest feels funny...

456
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,429
Tachycaridia.
Your heart's beating too fast.

457
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,530
We're sorting it out,
but you stay with us, alright?

458
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,599
Keep talking to us, Hank.

459
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Where's Lola...?

460
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,999
10 units of insulin sub q, an IV push...

461
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,139
It's still dropping.

462
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,239
Why's his potassium up?

463
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Damned if I know.

464
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,650
We've got to suck the potassium out of him.

465
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,870
We gotta get his heart rate down.

466
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,870
Need a crash cart!

467
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,400
It's definitely not Addison's.

468
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
It's not steroids either.

469
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,650
His heart rate is 130 and rising,
like a Randy Johnson line drive.

470
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
A for effort.

471
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,139
There's no point in doing the transplant.

472
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,630
Even if he was stable enough, it's obvious
that we have no idea what's wrong with him!

473
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,170
First it's too high, and now it's too low?

474
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,040
His heart's not responding to the atropine.

475
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,820
Heart rate's down to 40.

476
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,900
I thought it was up.

477
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,949
Now it's down.
Last time he went out at 35.

478
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,420
What's wrong?

479
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I have no idea.

480
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,610
Hit him with the atropine
before he gets to 35 again.

481
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,880
We've already given him 3 ml.

482
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,590
Apparently, that's not enough.

483
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,110
We can't stabilize his heart rate.

484
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,280
What did you do to him?

485
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,230
Kayexolate.

486
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:33,160
His pulse was through the roof.
So is his potassium.

487
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
It wouldn't do this.

488
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,290
But something did.

489
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,620
Call me when he's stable... or dead.

490
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,060
I remember the first time.

491
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,340
You weren't even supposed
to be pitching that day.

492
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,460
I'd flown all the way to Tokyo
to watch this kid, and he gets tossed

493
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,080
for arguing a call in the first inning.

494
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,460
Ah, your pitches... perfect.

495
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,320
Ball seemed to go faster than your arm.

496
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,990
It was like the rules didn't apply,
like physics couldn't slow you down.

497
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,730
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

498
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,150
Hey, Warner.

499
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,220
Hey, kid. How ya feelin'?

500
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,490
I hurt. My arm,
my head... everywhere.

501
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,700
They must have dialed down the morphine.

502
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,110
That's just wrong,
you're in pain.

503
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,950
Hey.

504
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,000
I got something for ya.

505
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
No...

506
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,810
A doc in St. Louis gave
'em to me for a migraine.

507
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,530
I'm an addict, I can't take that.

508
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,869
Even Lola was okay with the morphine.

509
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,310
This stuff's just a little stronger.

510
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Go on.

511
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,100
I'll just try one, Warner.

512
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,160
Three more symptoms.

513
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,619
Heart rate up, heart rate down,
now he's hallucinating.

514
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,610
You gotta promise not to tell Lola...

515
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,880
He's not just dreaming?

516
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,420
No REM. He's actually awake.

517
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Drugs?

518
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,960
Not psychedelics,
not with the heart symptoms.

519
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,610
All hallucinations would
point to digitalis.

520
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,800
It would also mess up his heart.

521
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,440
But, he's not on it,
and why would he take it?

522
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,690
Yeah. Pithy analysis.

523
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,690
I can see why they asked you
to speak at the cancer dinner.

524
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,240
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

525
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm sorry about the monster trucks.

526
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,710
No, I think it's great.
You're... giving back.

527
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,170
The only thing is...

528
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,380
the digitalis...

529
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,570
it would only explain the later symptoms,
not the original ones.

530
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,739
Sure, it's got a lotta movement,
problem is everybody sees the movement.

531
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,170
Yer throwing yer curve ball,
like yer throwing a curve ball.

532
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,760
Deception, that's it.

533
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,080
Same motion, less movement,
so it won't come back at ya.

534
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
How'd you get in here?

535
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,150
Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the
new shortstop from the Dominican.

536
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,370
How's Hank doin'?

537
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,090
Lousy.

538
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,210
Around your fingernails,
that swelling, it's called clubbing.

539
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,079
Hippocrates noticed that a lot
of his friends who also had

540
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,590
that, tended to frequently
grab their chests and die.

541
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,320
Yeah, I got a heart condition.
What's wrong with Hank?

542
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,130
What do you take for it?

543
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Digitalis.

544
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Got 'em with you?

545
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
That's weird.

546
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,930
I just filled this prescription
a couple days ago.

547
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,550
There's another bottle here.

548
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,770
Don't bother.

549
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,480
Hank Wiggen stole your pills.

550
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,170
He tried to kill himself.

551
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,150
So what happened?

552
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,070
He left the bottle open,
while he went to get some water?

553
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
Next time, just take the whole bottle.

554
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,069
Hey man, you got no right...

555
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,120
See, people remember how many they've got.

556
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,840
Date's right on the label, number of
pills, regular person can do the math.

557
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,270
But a junkie doesn't have to.

558
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,050
It's how many pills he's got left,
that's all he's thinking about.

559
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,350
Bought a big insurance policy?

560
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,470
This isn't about the money.

561
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,120
Not for you, no.

562
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,040
Most reputable stores won't cash
your checks after you're dead.

563
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,209
But for Lola... well, girls like that,
they're all about the money...

564
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,840
Don't you say that.
She already saved my life.

565
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,829
I was dead in Japan
and she brought me back,

566
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,730
everything since then, that's gravy,
it's more than I deserve.

567
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,750
- You owe her.
- Everything.

568
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,010
So, the attempted suicide,
the scaring her to death, that's...

569
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,020
what is that, that's... gratitude?
Love? Yeah, I get that.

570
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,880
We'll take out what you did
to yourself yesterday,

571
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,780
we're back to the kidneys and the bones.

572
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,960
I'm scheduling the transplant.

573
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,590
Never visit a patient.

574
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,080
I want that baby!

575
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,260
Even if I'm gone,
that's a piece of me, and Lola.

576
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,590
Breathing. Walkin' around town.
Goin' to baseball games.

577
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,690
If there's any more transplant talk
from you, or Lola, or anybody else...

578
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,590
I won't screw it up this time.

579
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,570
I'll take myself out for good.

580
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,160
I'll start treating the Addison's,

581
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,249
which will most likely
destroy what's left of your kidneys...

582
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,090
Fine. Start the treatment.

583
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,670
Hey.

584
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,760
What?

585
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,920
Hank Wiggen peed on me.

586
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,590
What d'you think these
pants are worth on eBay?

587
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,449
I've got some big-boy diapers in my office,
the rep. Hands them out like candy.

588
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,849
Is it that bad?

589
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,039
No! Not if you like the smell of urine...

590
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,640
'Course, why should I trust someone who
lies about what he's doing Friday night?

591
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,430
Question is, what are you
really doing Friday night?

592
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,830
Or more to the point, what could
possibly be better than monster trucks?

593
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,330
Or are we breaking up?

594
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,890
Stacy's coming into town this weekend,
we're having dinner. Just...

595
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
catching up.

596
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,710
I definitely had pants here.

597
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,300
Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper?

598
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,760
I heard she's playing Atlantic City.

599
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,810
No, Stacy the Constitutional Lawyer.

600
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,340
You thought I couldn't handle this news.

601
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,620
You talk to her a lot?

602
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,840
No. It's been a long time.

603
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,176
If you don't want me to see her...

604
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,660
What is this, eighth grade?

605
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,170
I'm fine.

606
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,509
It's fine if you're upset...

607
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,510
No! It's...

608
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,670
I have no right to be upset.

609
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,980
You two are friends.

610
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,230
You should see her. Say hi for me.

611
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,090
So... you're okay.

612
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,660
I'm not the cancer doctor
who's lying about the cancer dinner.

613
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,380
I'm not the one who's betraying
all those poor little...

614
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,210
bald-headed dying kids.

615
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,720
I'm gonna go get some pants, I stink.

616
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,190
You're treating him for Addison's
and you don't think it's gonna work?

617
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,140
He tried to kill himself.

618
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,160
I know. He's confused.

619
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,550
We can have another baby,
I can make him understand that.

620
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,289
I'm having an abortion. We do the trans...

621
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,900
No.

622
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,489
I can make decisions about my body.

623
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,140
And he can make decisions about his.
He doesn't want your kidney.

624
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,020
So... he'll die?

625
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,850
Probably.

626
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,500
If you keep that appointment,
he'll also probably die.

627
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Keep the baby.

628
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,870
Are you just being polite?

629
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,480
See, my pants are...

630
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,130
Oh, they're all wet.

631
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,140
You can't smell that?

632
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,470
I think she'll abort anyway,
try to force his hand?

633
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,190
No, she's not gonna risk losing him.

634
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
That's funny?

635
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,960
No, the monster trucks?

636
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,489
House asking you,
that's... that's funny.

637
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,690
I was the first person he ran into,
he just... asked me.

638
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,190
Yeah, like a date!

639
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,020
Exactly.
Except for the "date" part.

640
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,609
If the patient decides to
go the dialysis route,

641
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,400
we got some product
you should check out.

642
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Hey, Dr. Foreman.

643
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,959
Courtesy of the generous Sharon and
the good folks at Casting Pharmaceuticals.

644
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,750
I was just telling the guys
about the Bermuda conference in April.

645
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,839
Three days of sun and scuba,
and one hour of lecture.

646
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,980
Oh God, do we have to go to the lecture?

647
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,380
So, you're the new Arnie.

648
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,539
Dr. House. It's, uh, good to see you.

649
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,700
Would you get me a coffee?
Black, no sugar.

650
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,200
Okay, so who is it?

651
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,970
Come on, she's sleeping with one of you.

652
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,950
Oh God, please tell me it's you.

653
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,489
She buys lunches! She doesn't...

654
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,530
Don't worry, you're not gay...
you're adventurous!

655
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,759
You think she's gonna prostitute herself?

656
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,879
The three of us are that important to her?

657
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,990
I'm afraid not, no.

658
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,340
The groupies sleep with the roadies
in order to get to Mick.

659
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,680
And... you're Mick?

660
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,690
That was the metaphor I was making, yes.

661
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Why are you here?

662
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,880
Damn, it's you.

663
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,980
It's not Addison's.
New symptom: The inability to smell.

664
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,039
I was just in Hank's room,
and he said it smelled

665
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
like the men's room at
Veteran's Stadium. He was right.

666
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,149
We rejected environmental causes
because the wife was healthy.

667
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,910
Well, she's not.
Last six months, she can't smell a thing.

668
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,360
If you think of them as one single patient,
add her symptoms to his...

669
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,530
Cadmium poisoning.

670
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,159
It explains everything. Even why they
had so much trouble getting pregnant.

671
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,336
How could they have gotten
exposed to that much cadmium?

672
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,960
Unless they were eating steel
and batteries for breakfast.

673
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,740
So, where else is cadmium?

674
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,969
Some foods, polluted groundwater,
we should check their home...

675
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,590
I think I know how it happened.

676
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,239
I'm gonna need another urine sample.

677
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,150
- What for...
- Sure, whatever you want.

678
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,830
Why wouldn't you give it to me before
but now it's no problem?

679
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm dyin', right?

680
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,390
So you've got nothing to lose this time.

681
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,290
Begs the question...

682
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,820
what were you worried about last time?

683
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,190
The funny thing is, when we tested you
before, we were just looking for steroids.

684
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,350
What should we look for now, Hank?

685
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
Hank?

686
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
What's the story?

687
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,350
A little weed every now and then
when no one was looking?

688
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,060
I don't believe this. We quit.

689
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,100
You did. If you'd kept going, you wouldn't
have just lost your sense of smell.

690
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,830
No, I quit the hard stuff.

691
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,770
I just needed to relax.

692
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,860
Based on the symptoms,
you're a lot more than a social user.

693
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,030
So you've been lying to me all this time.

694
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,430
I'm sorry.

695
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:00,510
There must've been cadmium in the soil
where the marijuana was grown.

696
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,219
Some people get bone loss, kidney failure,
some people's testes shrink, and...

697
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,020
some people lose their sense of smell.

698
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,720
We'll start treating it right away.

699
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,580
You should be fine by opening day.
Baseball's in the summer, right?

700
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,470
It didn't hurt the baby, did it?
The cadmium?

701
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,580
If you've been clean,
the baby should be fine.

702
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Okay.

703
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,100
Please. I'll stop everything,
I'll go to meetings every day!

704
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Lola.

705
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,170
Twice a day.

706
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,310
How'd the ballplayer doing?

707
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,710
Much better.

708
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,050
Too bad about his career.

709
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,630
What d'you mean?

710
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,079
Major League Baseball's
collective bargaining

711
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,250
agreement requires medical
reports on all treatment.

712
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,349
Even Hank's history is not
likely to get much leniency.

713
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,700
Why should they care that
he's being treated for Addison's?

714
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,140
You're not treating him for Addison's!

715
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,590
My report says I am.

716
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,160
You're lying on the report?

717
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,590
Everybody does stupid things, it shouldn't
cost them everything they want in life.

718
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,000
No, it shouldn't,
but it usually does.

719
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,980
On the other hand, it means someone
can actually beat the Yankees.

720
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,910
So what about House,
is any way we get him down there?

721
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,080
You really wanna... talk about work?

722
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,650
No. Not at all...

723
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,580
That was amazing!

724
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,960
I'm telling you,
Gravedigger never disappoints.

725
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,630
You ever been married?

726
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,660
Well now, let's not ruin a lovely
night out by getting personal.

727
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,730
I lived with someone for a while.

728
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,590
You gonna finish that?

729
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,980
I'll race you to the car!
