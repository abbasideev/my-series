1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,130
Jessica!

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,350
Jessica, come on!
We've gotta go!

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,770
Move it or lose it, sister.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,400
I don't feel good.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,370
Oh. You don't feel warm.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,040
My stomach hurts.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,939
Honey, if you don't have a fever...

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,860
I don't want to go to school,
I can do my work at home.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,340
Jessica, what's wrong?

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,460
Everybody hates me.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,300
Oh, they don't hate you.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,260
They don't even know you
because they're too ignorant to try.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,519
I hate myself!

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,210
Jessica, don't say that.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,180
Oh, honey,
look at me, look at me.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,009
You are a wonderful,
beautiful, little girl.

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,210
- Don't let a few bad apples...
- A few?

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,250
Try my whole class.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,890
Remember the story where the guy keeps
saying that he hates green eggs and ham,

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,320
and then at the end he realized
he really loved them?

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,250
One day they're gonna realize
what a great kid you really are.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,250
You've just gotta be like
Sam I Am, and don't give up.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,840
- Come on, Jessica, hurry!
- That's it, keep going.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,610
Good, nice!

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,120
You're doing great, Jessica.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,519
Hey, hey Seth? You want to spend
the rest of class sitting on the bench?

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
No.

29
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,810
Keep going, Jess,
you've got 40 more seconds.

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,990
My arm hurts.

31
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,450
Come on, tough it up,
you can do it. You can do it.

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,719
My chest hurts.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,819
How do you think the ground feels?

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,150
Hey, Seth? Two laps, bye.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
Hey, Jess, it's just a stitch, okay?
Just keep breathing, you got it.

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,730
I can't.

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,530
Only 10 more seconds,
you got it.

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,830
Jessica, Jessica!

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,450
Jessica!

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,180
One of my students is
having a heart attack.

41
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
Yeah, she's ten.

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,010
Don't you think I know that?
Just send the damn ambulance!

43
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,860
Come on, wake up.
Come on, sweetie.

44
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,670
You ever see an infected pierced scrotum?

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,680
No, but I know a few people on whom I'd
like to see it happen. We need to talk.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,370
Well, if pain's what you're after
the penis is really the way to go.

47
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,250
I'd recommend the Abadirabia.

48
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,560
We're not talking.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,050
Oh? Sounded like we were.

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,120
No, you're attempting to avoid talking
because you know what I want to talk about.

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
Nipples?

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,990
You need to get rid of
one of your people.

53
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,900
Absolutely. As soon as
I do performance reviews.

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,120
And then review the reviews, of course.

55
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,029
Because a decision like this can't be made
without proper, you know, review.

56
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,279
Shouldn't take longer
than a month, maybe two.

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,510
Four at the most, unless
it gets complicated.

58
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,030
There's no way out on this.

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,616
You may as well get it over with as fast
as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,870
Only instead of a two-cent piece of
tape and gauze, it's a human being.

61
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,140
- Like you care.
- Like you don't.

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,400
You have a week. Get it done.

63
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,460
We have a referral from Dr. Linkowitz.

64
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,570
Don't know him.

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
He knows you.

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
What's the problem?

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Heart attack.

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,440
Definitely don't know him.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,730
The patient's ten.

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,369
Ten year olds do not have heart attacks.

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,559
It's gotta be a mistake.

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,760
Right. The simplest explanation is
she's a forty-year-old lying about her age.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,850
Maybe an actress trying to hang on.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,500
I meant, maybe the tests were wrong.

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,010
That's what the ER thought.

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,130
Three CKMBs were positive, the EKG
shows classic signs of ST elevation.

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,050
It's a heart attack.

78
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,830
She's morbidly obese.

79
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,729
The "morbid" part of that raises alarms.

80
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,239
Come on, it takes decades to
eat your way into a heart attack.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,860
Doesn't take decades to kill yourself.

82
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,309
If I was that fat, I'd be pretty
tempted to knock back a bottle of pills.

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,859
It's not a drug overdose.

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,279
The fatigue, muscle pain, and
difficulty concentrating

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,529
have been bothering
her for over a year.

86
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,839
That's because of her weight.
That's because of her depression.

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,340
That's what five pediatricians,

88
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,709
two nutritionists, and a psychologist said.

89
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,316
The heart attack would seem to
indicate that they missed something.

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,700
It's got to be something genetic.

91
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,410
What about Metabolic Syndrome X?

92
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Insulin resistance?

93
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,650
Syndrome X could cause a stroke,
but I don't know about a heart attack.

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,129
Could, if her blood
pressure was high enough.

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,019
Which is likely, considering her weight.

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,260
It fits the symptoms. Me likee.

97
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,590
Do a hyperinsulinemic euglyemic clamp.

98
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,910
Oh, and one more thing.

99
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,040
I've been told that I've got to get rid of
one of you guys by the end of the week.

100
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,200
New sheriff, belt tightening,
you know how it goes.

101
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,650
Okay, carry on.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,979
It's some kind of game,
House's own version of "Punk'd".

103
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,490
It's not House, it's Vogler.

104
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,079
We can't let it get to us,
we've got to stick together.

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Why?

106
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,849
What are you suggesting,
we start slashing each other's throats?

107
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,889
I'm suggesting it's a zero-sum game.

108
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,660
Your loss is my win.
That's not conducive to team play.

109
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,660
Which is what House seems to want.

110
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,290
Come with Cameron.

111
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,510
May be a bad strategy, but I don't
want to give House his satisfaction.

112
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,690
Come on, sick kid, remember?

113
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,910
She's diabetic?

114
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,720
No, but it's similar.

115
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,370
MSX patients don't respond
normally to insulin,

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,270
which causes her body to create too much,
and that leads to metabolic abnormalities.

117
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,830
We're going to do a test to be sure,
but there are certain dangers.

118
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,850
Is this thing treatable?

119
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,319
It's controllable
through proper diet and exercise.

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,399
Wait. Jessica already eats right.
And she exercises every day!

121
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,129
I know you've already seen
several nutritionists...

122
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,859
And we've done everything they recommended.

123
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,770
I understand, but...

124
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,150
Why can't any of you doctors
see past her weight?

125
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,500
If diet and exercise are the treatment,
then the diagnosis is wrong.

126
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,810
It might be,

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,760
but the only way we'll know is
if you'll let us do this test.

128
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,879
It's really bad, especially at night.

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
It's like my heart is on fire, like it's,
I don't know, like it's...

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,400
- Burning?
- Exactly!

131
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,300
Sounds almost like heartburn.

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,300
So, can you give me something?

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,880
Like a thesaurus?

134
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,660
What?

135
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,530
I take it you never mentioned this
during any of your prenatal visits.

136
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,870
Prenatal?

137
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
I'm not pregnant.

138
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,739
Sorry, you don't get to make that call

139
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,640
unless you have
a stethoscope. Union rules.

140
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,420
I know when I'm pregnant,
all right? I have six kids.

141
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,630
That's why my husband had a vasectomy
and we use condoms.

142
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,500
Vasectomies can reverse themselves,
condoms break.

143
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,870
Okay.

144
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,420
This is what a woman
is supposed to look like.

145
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,140
Okay, we're not just skin and bones.
We have flesh. We have curves.

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,430
You have little people inside you.

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,910
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

148
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,090
I guess I must have just
been brainwashed by the media,

149
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,310
and all those years of medical training.

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Damn right.

151
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,700
Let's see if I can find some antacids
while the nurse gets some blood.

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,890
Blood, why?

153
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,300
The heartburn,
gotta make sure it's not spreading.

154
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,660
I don't want to.

155
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,350
The test involves some
pretty precise measurements.

156
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,090
If we don't know exactly how much you
weight, we won't get the right answers.

157
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,630
Tell you a secret.

158
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,470
When I was your age, I was heavy, too.

159
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,160
Were you over 100?

160
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,160
Way over. The kids in my neighborhood
used to call me Rerun.

161
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,270
Rerun?

162
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,390
He was a heavy guy from TV.
I used to pretend I liked it, but I didn't.

163
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,220
How come you're not heavy any more?

164
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,170
Ninth grade, grew five inches,
everything kind of evened out.

165
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,669
You think that'll happen to me?

166
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,639
Well, yeah! I mean, your mom's tall,

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,400
and you are a little short for your age.

168
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,030
You'll probably spring right up.

169
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,550
Obesity isn't something
you just grow out of.

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,080
Take it you've never seen a baby?

171
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
She's not a baby, she's ten!

172
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,161
And you figure making her feel like
crap would do her a world of good?

173
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,130
Yeah, if it gets her off the couch!

174
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,270
I'm sure she's already
under enough pressure.

175
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Enough from mummy.

176
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,619
Everything in society tells us
we have to be thin to be successful.

177
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,690
No, society tells you
you have to be thin to be attractive.

178
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,650
And guess what, that's what attractive
means: That society likes looking at you.

179
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,789
I think we should be telling our kids
it's fine as long as they're healthy.

180
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,520
All right. You weigh 90 pounds
because it makes you healthier?

181
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Forget it.

182
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,740
He's just cranky because he knows
he's the one to get the axe.

183
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,640
So, any thoughts?

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,710
On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?

185
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Who you're gonna let go.

186
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,649
I'm thinking I can convince
Vogler it would be

187
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,490
more cost-efficient to
let me keep all of them.

188
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,519
Yeah, you should be
able to pull that off.

189
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,449
Most billionaires aren't
very good with numbers.

190
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,740
It will be more cost-efficient
once I've grabbed Cameron's ass,

191
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,420
called Foreman
a spade, and Chase...

192
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,010
well, I can grab his ass, too.

193
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,430
You are uniquely talented in many areas,
but office politics is not one of them.

194
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,560
Don't take Vogler on.

195
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Separate or together?

196
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,050
Together.

197
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,420
Increasing glucose to
6.9 milligrams per minute.

198
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,610
Are you okay?

199
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,450
I'm thirsty.

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,276
Just a little bit longer,
and you'll be done.

201
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,470
Like Dr. Chase.

202
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,540
Wanna put some money on it?

203
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,489
I said I'm thirsty.

204
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,090
Just five more minutes,
okay, sweetheart?

205
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,309
I'm not your sweetheart,
don't call me that.

206
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,859
Jessica, that's not nice.

207
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,469
- You're the ones who aren't nice.
- Jessica...

208
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,669
You're not either!
I don't want to do this anymore!

209
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,359
Jessica! Jessica,
you have to calm down!

210
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,469
No! Let me go!

211
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,599
Check her blood sugar. She's
gotta be getting hypoglycemic.

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,019
Never seen her like this before.
What goes wrong?

213
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,300
- Hey, calm down!
- Let go of me!

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,520
Get it out of me,
you son of a bitch! You bastards!

215
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,979
She's sedated.
Mrs. Simms, don't worry.

216
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,549
Hypoglycemia can cause
temporary psychosis and

217
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,349
it's a common complication
during a HEC procedure.

218
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,589
I never wanted it done in the first place.

219
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,039
We understand you're upset, but...

220
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,999
You were supposed to be
monitoring her condition.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,079
But instead you were
bickering and placing bets.

222
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,339
I apologize if we looked
we weren't paying full attention

223
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,209
to your daughter, but
I assure you that...

224
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,310
Oh, please. Save your pathetic
insincerity for your boyfriend.

225
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,790
You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically
sincere. And they didn't screw it up.

226
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Who are you?

227
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm from the lab.

228
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,609
The blood tests showed
your daughter wasn't hypoglycemic,

229
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,371
which means her psychosis wasn't
caused by anything these doctors did.

230
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,420
So then what was it caused by?

231
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
I have no idea,

232
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,160
but you'll be happy to hear
it can't be cured by diet or exercise.

233
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,000
What else could cause
uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?

234
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,300
Nothing that could also
cause a heart attack.

235
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,920
I assume I don't have to point out

236
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,779
that now would be an extremely
good time for one of

237
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,250
you to distinguish yourself
with a brilliant idea.

238
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,640
A hypocoaguable state
could cause a blood clot.

239
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,360
Blood clots can cause a heart attack.

240
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,959
More likely to cause a stroke,
not the psychosis.

241
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
No, you're wrong.

242
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,899
If the clot made it to
the amicdal area of the

243
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,579
brain, it might cause
uncontrollable rage.

244
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,059
Right, because anything's possible,

245
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,479
but nothing's going to cause
multiple clots in a kid this age.

246
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,250
She's fat!

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,289
Obesity doesn't cause blood clots.

248
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,059
Extremely obese patients
can get a fat embolus.

249
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,659
Right, after they get liposuction
which she's clearly never had.

250
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,320
How do you know?

251
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,040
Because we have her medical records.

252
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,369
And because no plastic
surgeon in his right mind

253
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,349
is going to give a
ten-year-old liposuction!

254
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,010
Have you ever met a plastic surgeon
who was in their right mind?

255
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,839
She hasn't had liposuction.

256
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,140
Thank you.

257
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,280
But what about some other
ridiculous obesity treatment?

258
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,160
Like what?

259
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,940
Diet pills can cause
heart attacks and blood clots.

260
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,410
Her tox screen was negative.

261
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,859
Wouldn't show
over-the-counter weight loss drugs.

262
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,359
Her mother wouldn't give her diet pills.

263
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,170
Yeah, she thinks her daughter's perfect
just the way she is.

264
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
She's lying.

265
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,160
Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin
to prevent further clotting.

266
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,510
And you, find those pills.

267
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,400
Not diet pills.

268
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,120
You might want to broade
the search just a little.

269
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,729
And don't just ask the mom, if she
hasn't mentioned yet, she's not gonna...

270
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,310
If you're gonna fire
someone, go ahead and do it,

271
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,189
but don't treat us like lab
rats, testing how long

272
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,230
it takes us to get us at
one another's throats.

273
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,490
So what should I do?

274
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
I don't give a damn what you do.

275
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,390
Yes, I had noticed your
complete indifference.

276
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,500
You don't even offer
a medical opinion any more.

277
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,910
Who would you fire?

278
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,030
Not my call.

279
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,310
I want your opinion.

280
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,190
Fine, it's you.

281
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,710
Either way, you're making a choice.

282
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Chase.

283
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,489
Because he screwed up
an angio a month ago?

284
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,820
Anyone can make a mistake.

285
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,870
Right, it's the money.

286
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,299
You resent it, but you're going to tell me
he doesn't need the job.

287
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,799
He doesn't appreciate the job.

288
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,809
He was ready to go
three rounds with Cameron for it.

289
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,410
He wants the job.
He just doesn't appreciate it.

290
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,730
There's nothing wrong
with just wanting to hang out,

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,920
but this is not
the place to do it.

292
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm surprised.

293
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,180
You thought I'd pick Cameron?

294
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,990
I didn't think you'd pick at all.

295
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,730
I guess he's not the "rise above the
fray" guy he likes to think he is.

296
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,420
You practically forced it out of him.

297
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,160
He's scared of losing his job,
just like everyone else.

298
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,009
I've been thinking. You've made it quite
clear that you're miserable here...

299
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,430
I am not miserable.

300
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,149
You're not happy.

301
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,150
And you are?

302
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,490
With... my job, yes.

303
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,660
I am exactly where I want to be
doing exactly what I want to do.

304
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,750
I think I sense a hint of sarcasm there.

305
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,750
Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?

306
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,830
Hmmm... I was wrong.

307
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,800
About Vogler or Foreman?

308
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,370
Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy tests.

309
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,060
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?

310
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,890
Either a woman carrying an alien baby
or your newest patient.

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,189
So, you never saw her with any pills?
She never mentioned anything?

312
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,460
No, of course not.

313
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,170
Would it be all right
if I talked to a couple of her friends?

314
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,680
Her friends?

315
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,199
Well, I'm not going to interrogate them,

316
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,939
but I just want to ask if
Jessica ever mentioned anything.

317
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,859
It's pretty important,
she's very sick.

318
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,090
I understand, it's just, well,

319
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,430
Jessica really doesn't have any friends.

320
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,460
Not one?

321
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:54,389
I've tried to help, make the kids
include her more, but kids can be...

322
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:54,800
Kids?

323
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,430
Heh, I was going to say jerks.

324
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,520
All the fifth-graders are
assigned an eighth-grade buddy.

325
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,910
Maybe you could talk to her's.

326
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,570
What's the status on House?

327
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,460
He asked for time to complete performance
reviews on everyone in his department.

328
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,300
And you told him no
and gave him how long?

329
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,500
A week. He'll do it.

330
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,700
Guy's never done what he's told.

331
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,530
Don't see why he's going to start now.

332
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,320
Hi! Edward Vogler.

333
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Is Dr. House claiming that
I'm forcing him to get rid of one of you?

334
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,850
I assume his goal is to
stir up antagonism toward me.

335
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,510
And your goal is?

336
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,150
I am forcing him.

337
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,370
I'll do whatever I can to ease
the transition for whoever he chooses.

338
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,949
If you're feeling guilty about your
decision, there is an easy solution.

339
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't feel guilty.

340
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,219
Then why approach me
and tell me all this?

341
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,600
I don't feel guilty,
that doesn't mean I don't feel bad.

342
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,130
I'm rich, but I'm still human.

343
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,000
I just wanted you to know that if there's
anything I can do for you, my door's open.

344
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Thank you.

345
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,350
You looking for info?

346
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,129
I thought you already had
House all figured out?

347
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,130
I do.

348
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,850
Don't know his team, though.

349
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,320
The ultrasound and biopsy
confirmed our worry.

350
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,010
The tumor is extremely large,
at least thirty pounds.

351
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh, God.

352
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,860
It's actually
a personal record for this clinic.

353
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,750
But it's completely benign,
there's no sign of cancer at all.

354
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,010
I've already spoken with Dr. Bergin, and
he's available first thing in the morning.

355
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
For what?

356
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,059
For the surgery.

357
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,930
But if it's not cancer,
it can't kill me, right?

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,480
No.

359
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:58,380
I'll have a huge scar!
I won't be able to wear a bikini!

360
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,129
You wear a bikini now?

361
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,860
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

362
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,040
Nope, but I've never gone
swimming with you.

363
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,849
I knew it. That's
what this is all about!

364
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,949
You are trying to force me
to have cosmetic surgery!

365
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,329
Yeah, that's exactly why I planted
a thirty pound tumor on your ovary.

366
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,840
It's not gonna kill me.

367
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,220
The only thing surgery is going to do
is change the way I look.

368
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,150
That is the definition of
"cosmetic surgery".

369
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,159
It would also relieve
your heartburn and discomfort.

370
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,780
Yeah, right.

371
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,250
Why give an antacid when
you can cut someone up

372
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,490
and make them look a little
easier on your eyes?

373
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,730
My husband loves my body.

374
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,650
He can't get enough of it.

375
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,660
You think he's gonna want to touch me if I
look like I've been gutted like a fish?

376
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,760
That was unexpected.

377
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,270
Yeah, it was.

378
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,860
All she does during recess is
run laps around the playground.

379
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,399
She says she's exercising,
but everyone knows

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,280
it's just because no one
wants to play with her.

381
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,600
I mean, I'm only her buddy
because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.

382
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,510
That does not mean
I am her friend.

383
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,770
I'll make sure her doctors
are all clear on that.

384
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Thanks.

385
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,380
So, has she ever said anything
to you about diet pills?

386
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
She told you that, too.

387
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,570
What do you mean?

388
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:22,600
I totally busted her
for taking drugs one day.

389
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,840
She totally lied, said they were
diet pills her mom had given her.

390
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,370
Come on, get real. No way a girl
like that is taking diet pills.

391
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,679
I didn't give her diet pills,
I would never do that!

392
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,529
Right, so it was her imaginary mom.

393
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,729
She didn't take any pills,
the girl's lying!

394
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,730
Why would she lie?

395
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,120
Because she's another mean little jerk?

396
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Mom.

397
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,810
I'm sorry, honey.

398
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,510
Clemmie didn't lie.

399
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,440
I did. I took the pills.

400
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,241
I told her you gave them to me
'cause I didn't want to get in trouble.

401
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,200
Where did you get them?

402
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,860
I took them. From the store.

403
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,440
Why? Why would you do that?

404
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,699
Because I didn't want to be ugly anymore.

405
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,459
Oh, baby. You're not ugly.

406
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,339
Yes, I am! I know you don't think so,
but I am! I'm disgusting.

407
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,090
Jessica, please, don't say that.

408
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,340
I just, just wanted to fit in.
You know, have friends?

409
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,080
Or at least have one person
my age be nice to me.

410
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:41,240
Listen, the pills cause blood clots,
heart attacks, and insomnia.

411
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,710
It explains everything.

412
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,290
We'll keep her overnight to
make sure, but she'll be fine.

413
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,530
Thank you.

414
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,156
I can't believe she was that desperate.

415
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,869
Yeah, I'm sure that
if everyone I knew hated me,

416
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,359
I couldn't bear to look at me.
I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift.

417
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,189
I'm not talking about the shoplifting.

418
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,339
I'm sure she didn't even know
they were dangerous.

419
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,539
She probably saw them
advertised on TV or over the internet.

420
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,489
Right, so I guess it's the media and
pharmaceutical companies' fault now?

421
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,140
Not the fact that she can't stop
shoving food down her throat.

422
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,009
No one forced her to get fat.

423
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,969
No one forced a cancer
patient to get cancer.

424
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,589
Give me a break,
it's not a disease.

425
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,819
Have you seen the latest research?

426
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,140
Yes, I have.

427
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,700
What I haven't seen lately is a kid
eating an apple or riding a bike.

428
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,319
You Americans can't even
compete with the rest

429
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,130
of the world in basketball
anymore, unless,

430
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,300
of course, it's the type you play with
a remote control on a big screen TV.

431
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,330
Right.

432
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,390
Wait!
Are you going to let him say that?

433
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,100
He insulted our basketball teams!

434
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,289
Oh, my God! Mommy,
they hurt so bad!

435
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,020
What happened?

436
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,059
Please help me!

437
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,800
She's bleeding!

438
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
From where?

439
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,630
Oh, my god!

440
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,700
Just please stop it, please!

441
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,709
Diet pills don't cause skin necrosis.

442
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,310
Could be something related to the pills.

443
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,280
- Or not.
- Or both.

444
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,499
Diet pills brought her to us,
we gave her the sores.

445
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,509
You think she got a staff infection
from something here?

446
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,120
I'm not saying the hospital gave
the sores, I'm saying we did.

447
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,790
By treating her.
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

448
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,080
Highly unlikely. We started her
on heparin before the warfarin.

449
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,270
Who gave her the heparin?

450
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,000
I did warfarin, she did heparin.

451
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,109
Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?

452
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,570
Yes, I did not screw up.

453
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,610
Did you actually see her prepare
and administer the heparin?

454
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,240
Enough said.

455
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,441
You were standing right there.

456
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,389
I was preparing my own dose.

457
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,270
Yeah, right. There's gotta
be some other cause.

458
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,329
None that I can think of.
Let's fix the mistake.

459
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,099
Give her unfractionated IV
heparin and low molecular

460
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,380
weight heparin by
subcutaneous injection stat.

461
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,519
Making me look bad is not
going to save your job.

462
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,419
You think you're incapable of
making a mistake?

463
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,229
You think that I am that weak that
I am just going to roll over and take this?

464
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,910
House isn't just going to protect you
just because you kiss his ass!

465
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,869
Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.

466
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,870
Hey!

467
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,980
Stop worrying about your asses and
start worrying about the patient's.

468
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,810
She sleeping?

469
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,190
As a result of the sedatives, yeah.

470
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,680
Can't let her wake up, too much pain.

471
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,210
"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis".

472
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,820
I have no idea what that means.

473
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,070
But it says here we gave her the warfarin,

474
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,710
and I do know what "induced" means...

475
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
we did this?

476
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,420
At this point it's not exactly clear.

477
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,170
You know, I should
probably talk to Dr. House.

478
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,650
Oh, you two need time to
get your story straight.

479
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,370
He doesn't tell me what to do.

480
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,670
So you don't just blindly
follow his commands.

481
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,120
You're your own man.

482
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,700
And yet, here you are working
for a man you can't stand.

483
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,210
I respect him.

484
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:42,320
What exactly is it you respect?
His attitude toward humanity?

485
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,540
He thinks we're all idiots and liars.

486
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,269
How 'bout his attitude toward you,

487
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,209
plays with you like a
cat with a ball of string...

488
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,770
What do you want?

489
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,910
I want to know if you
want to keep your job.

490
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,509
If he chooses to let me go,
I can live with that.

491
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,510
That's not an answer.

492
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,159
You offering to protect me?

493
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Still not an answer.

494
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I want my job.

495
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,430
Dr. Chase.

496
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,030
Boss.

497
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,130
What was that about?

498
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,770
Wanted to know what warfarin is.
I don't know.

499
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,390
Icy.

500
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,110
Definitely think twice before
correcting one of your mistakes again.

501
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,659
Correct all you want.

502
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,599
Of course, it's a bit more productive
if there's an actual mistake.

503
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,040
Right, I always forget that part.

504
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,160
I gave her the heparin,

505
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,039
which means the necrosis is
not a reaction to the warfarin,

506
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,440
which is probably why she's not
responding to your treatment.

507
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Yet.

508
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,310
If you didn't screw up,
then what is it?

509
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,000
You don't have an answer.

510
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Yet.

511
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,900
When you come up with
something, let me know.

512
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,890
I'll be in the clinic,
warming up.

513
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,159
I'm the only one who's always
stood behind you when you've screwed up.

514
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,339
Why? Why would you support
someone who screws up?

515
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,810
Because I'm not insanely insecure.

516
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,339
And because I can actually
trust in another human being

517
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,530
and I am not an angry,
misanthropic son of a bitch.

518
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,510
I'm sorry, you said you weren't angry.

519
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,020
Who would you fire?

520
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
No one.

521
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,660
Not an option.

522
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,479
If everyone took a paycut
and put in a few more hours

523
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
we could all stay for the
same amount of money.

524
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,480
Figures you'd try and come up with
a solution where no one gets hurt.

525
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,370
The problem is, the world doesn't work
that way just 'cause you want it to.

526
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,769
Figures you'd stall and refuse
to deal with the issue.

527
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,610
Problem is, the world doesn't go away
just because you want it to.

528
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,030
Excuse me, Dr. House?

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,500
My wife saw you yesterday,
Lucille Hernandez?

530
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,480
Uh, he's not in today.

531
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,870
My wife said
he walked with a cane.

532
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,370
He's also got a bit of a drug problem.
Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.

533
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:46,519
The MRis are rented, but...
Did you make a decision?

534
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,570
- He's not gonna fire anybody.
- Yes.

535
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,310
I'm going to cut the pay of all four of us.

536
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,450
17% across the board will allow you to
keep us all for the same amount of money.

537
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,410
I believe it's what you
suits call "win-win".

538
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,780
- All right, if you can...
- No.

539
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,829
If he can work it so we can
keep the current staff for

540
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,180
the same amount of money,
what difference does it make?

541
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,610
It's not about the money.

542
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,190
This is not a negotiation, it never was.

543
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,069
I need to know that whatever
I ask you to do,

544
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,420
however distasteful you
find it, you'll do it.

545
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,960
And just as importantly,
you need to know that.

546
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,740
What's going on with my wife?

547
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,959
Even if I was Dr. House,
physician-patient

548
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,759
confidentiality protects me
from annoying conversations.

549
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,200
But she told me about the tumor.

550
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,499
Yeah? She also tell you
why she's refusing to have it removed?

551
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,650
I don't care about a scar.
And she can always gain the weight back.

552
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,150
You want her to regain the weight?

553
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,900
Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.

554
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
Why?

555
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,980
I've always thought she's looked sexiest
when she was pregnant.

556
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,399
Something 'bout knowing
she's a mother makes me want to...

557
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,960
Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone.

558
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,510
I did. You gotta talk to her,

559
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,569
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to her...

560
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,540
The tumor is benign, nothing's gonna
happen. Except maybe some more heartburn.

561
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,029
What if it gets even bigger?
Or if it changes?

562
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,890
You know where to find us.
Building's not going anywhere.

563
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,710
Tell her it's cancer.

564
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
You obviously don't have
a problem with lying.

565
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,200
Oh, way to win me over.

566
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,900
We have six kids.

567
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,069
She can't afford to take a chance.

568
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,799
You have kids! How novel!
That changes everything.

569
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,500
So if Mommy has heartburn,
one of them might catch on fire.

570
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,230
Please,

571
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,670
I don't know what we'd do.

572
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,590
They are cute.

573
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,650
Have her come back in.

574
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,650
What?

575
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,410
Your plight has moved me.

576
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,900
Tell your wife to come back.

577
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,790
Her necrosis is getting worse.

578
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,130
Maybe because we're
treating her for the wrong thing.

579
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,430
Have you found the right thing?

580
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,620
No.

581
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,260
Then we continue the treatment.

582
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,409
Hope it's just taking
longer than it should.

583
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,029
At this point it doesn't matter
what caused the necrosis.

584
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,030
Or who.

585
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,166
If we don't stop it from spreading
it will kill her before the end of the day.

586
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,890
What else can we do?

587
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,770
Get rid of it.

588
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,580
Remove the dying flesh
before it penetrates the abdominal wall.

589
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,570
Do it.

590
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,350
There's still a chance that the heparin
treatment could start to take effect.

591
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,260
We're gonna wait as long as we can,

592
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,010
but if there's no change
in the next few hours,

593
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,139
we're gonna have to treat
the symptoms directly.

594
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,949
So you can get rid of the sores.

595
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,100
Through surgery.
Technically, it's an amputation.

596
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,329
Amputation? But the sores are...

597
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,200
Warfarin-induced necrosis attacks
fatty tissue, mainly in the breasts.

598
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,300
Wait, are you talking about
cutting off my daughter's breasts?

599
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,110
She's ten years old!

600
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,250
A radical mastectomy may be
her only chance of survival.

601
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,020
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to sign this.

602
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,110
Can we talk?

603
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,950
What, no roses, no chocolates?

604
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,400
- If you're here to apologize...
- I'm not here to apologize.

605
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Uh-oh,

606
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,220
that means you're here
for something more complicated.

607
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,660
Do you want to fire me?

608
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,259
Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse.

609
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,240
Thank God Vogler came along.

610
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,689
It's the only reason I can think of that
you're insisting that I made a mistake.

611
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,390
Really? Because there is
another explanation.

612
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,610
Perhaps not as much fun
as your Freudian analysis, but

613
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,719
maybe you actually made a mistake.

614
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,360
You're doing this because you can't
deal with your feelings for me.

615
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,970
I believe that you are
the only one to express feelings.

616
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,239
And if we're going to look
at this from a first-year

617
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,610
psych point-of-view, maybe
you want me to fire you.

618
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,359
Maybe that's why
you're acting weird. You...

619
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,640
You're the one being different!

620
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,889
You're always pushing things, pushing the
rules, pushing us, but not this time.

621
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,759
You just jumped on this
idea like a life raft.

622
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,250
Not one question about what else it could
be, no riding us for other answers.

623
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,790
I have the answer.

624
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,850
Then why aren't you watching TV?

625
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,199
Or playing your damn Game Boy,

626
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,470
or whatever else you have
fun doing by yourself?

627
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,880
Maybe I should just quit.

628
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,520
Make it easy for everyone.

629
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,210
Maybe you should.

630
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,109
Men are pigs.

631
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,409
You call me in to tell me...

632
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,059
I should have realized the
vasectomy and condoms

633
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,480
was overkill, but this
was too obvious to miss.

634
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Cute kids.

635
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,179
Love her green eyes.
And his baby blues.

636
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,829
Of course, since you and
your husband have brown eyes...

637
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,830
Where'd you get that?

638
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,410
From the father of three,
maximum four of your six children.

639
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,940
So I'm thinking maybe the reason
you don't want surgery is,

640
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,269
while your husband may find you
attractive no matter what,

641
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,170
all the other men you're sleeping with
might not be so open-minded.

642
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,440
Which brings me back to
my original thesis: Men are pigs.

643
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,650
You got nothing to worry about.

644
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,359
You know, pretty much have sex
with anyone, fat, skinny,

645
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,489
married, single, complete
strangers, relatives...

646
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,990
You? You're sick.

647
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,190
So are you.

648
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,860
I'm sure there are websites full of men looking
for married women with surgical scars.

649
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,160
So have the surgery.

650
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Please?

651
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Okay.

652
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,429
Why have you been talking to Cameron?

653
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,170
Well, if House picks you
I'll be needing a new source in that room.

654
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,370
If he picks me?

655
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Sure.

656
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,699
Foreman's smarter,
House has got a thing for Cameron.

657
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,999
I've been feeding you information
so you'll protect me.

658
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,850
I will protect you as long as I need you.

659
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,100
And you will feed me information
as long as you need me.

660
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,110
I spoke with Cameron
because if I have alternatives,

661
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I don't need you.

662
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,980
She's not gonna rat on House.

663
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,060
Foreman ever said anything
about talking to me?

664
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Interesting, huh?

665
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,950
It's been almost three hours,
still no change in her condition.

666
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,700
I think we should get her into surgery.

667
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,480
So what do you want to do?

668
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,500
Assume that Cameron didn't screw up.

669
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,619
What if it's not the warfarin?

670
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,049
It has to be.
The sores presented right after we...

671
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,970
Right, right, right,
but let's just say it's not.

672
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,720
Come on, come on,
what have you got?

673
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,530
Can I have a second to think?

674
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:58,611
No, there's no time to think! Just say
the first thing that comes to you head.

675
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,710
She's fat.

676
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,249
Enough already, okay?
We've got it, you hate fat people.

677
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,250
That's not what I meant.

678
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:05,259
We already considered obesity as a cause.

679
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,439
So did all her other doctors.

680
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,069
No, what if it's not a cause?

681
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,140
What if it's a symptom?

682
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,730
Okay, so what could cause
obesity and skin necrosis?

683
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,496
Listen, I don't care if it makes sense,
just give me something.

684
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,170
Ulcers secondary to vaculitis.

685
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,180
No, that's just sores, not obesity.

686
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,680
Pyoderma gangrenosum?

687
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,929
More sores. Okay,
let's look at it from the other side.

688
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,429
What has obesity as a symptom?

689
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,780
Hypothyroidism?

690
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,630
Genetics are more likely.
Her mom's heavy, too.

691
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,370
She's not just heavy. She's tall.

692
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,889
We have any history on the dad?

693
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,890
Yeah.

694
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
6'1".

695
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,700
Kid's short.

696
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,380
We've got stunted growth, high blood
pressure, blood clots, obesity...

697
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
it's Cushing's.

698
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,739
No, necrosis doesn't present in...

699
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,569
In rare cases Cushing's
can cause hypercalcemia,

700
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,110
which can lead to the same
skin necrosis as warfarin.

701
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,309
It's perfect. It explains everyting.

702
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,700
Except it's not Cushing's.

703
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,289
She's had multiple blood tests and
none show abnormal cortisol levels.

704
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,549
The hypercortisolism could be cyclical,
we just didn't catch it in the right phase.

705
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,030
- We'll have to do another UFC.
- There's no time!

706
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,239
We've got less than an
hour to make the call.

707
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,469
If we treat for Cushing's
and we're wrong, she's dead.

708
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,800
If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll
lose her breasts and may still be sick.

709
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Do an MRI.

710
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,789
You want us to look for
hypercortisolism with an MRI?

711
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,650
No, I want you to look for what could
cause hypercortisolism with an MRI.

712
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,500
Nothing on the adrenals.

713
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,329
Heard Cameron went home.
Is she sick?

714
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,030
Go back to the pituitary views.

715
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,990
She seemed okay.

716
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,130
Think she's got another reason for leaving?

717
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
I hope so.

718
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,680
Wait, stop. There.

719
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,730
What's that?

720
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
A tumor.

721
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
It's Cushing's.

722
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,860
The tumor causes Cushing's.
Cushing's messes with hormone production.

723
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,899
Hormones control everything:
Growth, weight...

724
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,030
Can you fix it?

725
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,870
She'll need surgery to remove the tumor.

726
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,189
Once it's gone, everything
will get normal very fast.

727
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,430
No mastectomy?

728
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
No.

729
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,270
Thank God.

730
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:50,550
The surgery's dangerous.

731
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,209
The pituitary is located
between the caverns of

732
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,130
the sinuses, basically
right between the eyes.

733
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,299
The area contains the
nerves that control eye

734
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,549
movement and the major
arteries that feed the brain.

735
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,550
Oh, my God.

736
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,390
Your surgeon will approach
the gland transphenoidally.

737
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,370
An incision will be made under the lip in
which he'll insert a fiberoptic microscope.

738
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,389
Once the tumor's found, he'll
cut it into small pieces

739
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,480
and remove it from the
same hole under the lip.

740
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,809
The whole procedure should
take about three hours and

741
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,930
your daughter should be able
to go home in a few days.

742
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,080
The sores will go away,
as well as her fatigue and her muscle pain.

743
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,170
She'll even start losing weight.

744
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,050
Jessica.

745
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,050
Hi.

746
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,350
Is that really you?

747
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,080
Yeah, it's me.

748
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,660
You look fantastic!

749
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,690
She always looked fantastic.

750
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,370
Yeah.

751
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
It's been a week.

752
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,580
Actually, it's over a week.
Where have you guys been?

753
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,950
Who is it?

754
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,410
Chase.

755
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,740
No, Chase stays.

756
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Pick someone else.

757
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,150
- The deal was...
- Deal's changed.

758
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,370
Pick someone else.

759
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
No.

760
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,430
Pick someone else or
it'll be the whole department.
