1
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,510
Hi.

2
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:18,940
Sounds like a good party.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,160
20 bucks.

4
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:25,739
Okay. No problem,
I just got it in here somewhere.

5
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,830
Oh god, I'm...

6
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:35,365
I'm sorry, I guess I must have
forgotten to go to the machine.

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,519
Yeah, and, brush your teeth.

8
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,855
Lady, you don't have two cents.

9
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,757
I can... I can get it from...
from my friend who's inside,

10
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,701
he can give it to me and then I can
bring it back out here to you.

11
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:47,401
You don't know anybody here.

12
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,401
Yes I do!

13
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:53,450
James, he's blonde and he's really
friendly and he's a big talker.

14
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,569
I need to see him.

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,410
Go on in.

16
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,019
James?

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
James?

18
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:30,276
James?

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Hi.

20
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,899
Do you know where James is?

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,168
Oh yeah, he's around here somewhere.

22
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:51,132
Let's go find him.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,686
James?

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,220
Do you know where James is?

25
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:10,848
Where is he?

26
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:19,721
I really need to find him.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
What are you doing?

28
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,066
Bitch!

29
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,352
No! She's trying
to help me! Get off her!

30
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,658
Get off me!

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,190
Settle down!

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
Move!

33
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,592
Geez, I didn't touch her.

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,780
Great. Now we
gotta go to the hospital.

35
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,770
Homeless. Admitted 24 hours ago
with a suspected drug overdose.

36
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,710
Her tox screen's clean,
but she's still delusional.

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,820
Homeless, usually
means crazy. No money.

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,660
- Cuddy's not going to like this?
- We're a teaching hospital.

39
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,349
No ID.
Doesn't even seem to know her name.

40
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,599
I got called in because of
some lesions on her arm.

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,239
Homeless always means no roof,
at least, there's too much sun.

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,060
The lesions were non-cancerous,
but I noticed a twitch. Her wrist.

43
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,690
You feel that?

44
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,340
Sure. I'm human.

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,500
Make a fist around my fingers,
tight as you can. Squeeze.

46
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I am.

47
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,010
Right.

48
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,930
Raise your arms
above your head for me.

49
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,730
She's seizing.
Get me some Ativan.

50
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,190
She doesn't want to be discharged.
She's manipulating me.

51
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,160
It's real.
Check her finger sticks.

52
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,459
Blood sugar's 38.

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,680
I need D15. IV push stat.

54
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,719
Fake low blood sugar.
Now that's acting.

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,030
The blood sugar was real.

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,070
But she's probably diabetic.
OD'd on her own insulin.

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,920
I need 2032.
Do you have her effects out here?

58
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,239
Look, a seizure buys her a
place to sleep while the

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,010
nice doctors run their tests,
maybe a few free meals.

60
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,900
$20 says there's insulin in here.

61
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,540
Oh... put this back, please.

62
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,580
What about the twitch?

63
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,820
Her arm moved.

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,709
Why fake a twitch?
In case the seizure was too subtle?

65
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,409
A twitch could indicate a
tumor, which could indicate...

66
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,380
A need to see a neurologist,
which is why you called me.

67
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,190
Keep an eye on her until 2:00 PM, watch her
blood sugar, give her a nice hot lunch,

68
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,790
then discharge her.

69
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,479
He's wrong.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,910
Foreman is wrong?

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,499
The neurologist is wrong,
about a neurological problem?

72
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,890
He took one look at her
and figured it was a scam.

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,420
So, you figure he's not being objective.

74
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,189
House, the woman had a twitch.
She had a seizure.

75
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,480
Both of which Foreman saw?

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,590
He just wanted her out the door!

77
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,120
Back up there, big fella.

78
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,750
Foreman's the guy you
want to take a swing at.

79
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,130
I just want her to get
some medical attention.

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,340
That's not even close to being true.

81
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,620
Something else. Something personal.

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Give me the file.

83
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,180
Looks like this will be fun.

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,580
The twitch could be a mini-seizure,
unrelated to the diabetes.

85
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,710
Brain tumor?

86
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,150
Glad you could join us, Eric.

87
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,570
What's the differential
for a twitch in the wrist?

88
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,719
The patient's a thirty-ish Jane Doe.
I just thought I'd discharge her.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,690
Well, she's my patient.
No harm in a second opinion.

90
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,240
A blow to the head?
A subdural hematoma?

91
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,680
Read the file, no evidence
of cranial trauma.

92
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,660
A twitch could indicate a brain tumor.

93
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,410
Or about a dozen other things.

94
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,190
Come on, there's two things
homeless people are good at...

95
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,890
getting sick, and running scams.

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,129
If you're so worried about it being
a brain tumor, get her an MRI,

97
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,356
when she's clear on that, then
you can bounce her out of here.

98
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,199
Well, you've got her all figured out.

99
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,236
I've known a lot more homeless
people than you have.

100
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,889
Yes, you've got that going for you.

101
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,029
How could I have doubted
your medical opinion?

102
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,439
The big question,
you're missing it, all of you.

103
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, geez.

104
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,750
Who is she?

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,940
Okay. Why are we on this case...
just because Wilson asked?

106
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,430
Do I need a better reason?

107
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,250
Most people wouldn't, you do.

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,309
The only thing we know for sure about
Jane Doe is that her name isn't Jane Doe.

109
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,750
Which means no medical history.

110
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,380
Allergies, medication,
previous diagnoses, treatment...

111
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,040
we have no baseline,
no context for medical treatment.

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,830
Wow. Looks just like insulin.

113
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,000
Vomit. Still moist.

114
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,980
What do you think...
a couple of days old?

115
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,300
You trying to make me hurl?

116
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,460
Yeah. And here's the big finish...

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,400
Salty. Chemical imbalance.

118
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,259
Low magnesium could cause a twitch.

119
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,790
Or high calcium. Or it's a coincidence.
The point is, we don't know anything.

120
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,530
- So do the MRI. Find out...
- The MRI can wait.

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,829
Hang a banana bag, give her
24 hours to correct the

122
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,750
electrolyte imbalance,
we'll take it from there.

123
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,460
Great. Thanks.

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,090
Okay. Even if she's not faking,
what's so fascinating about this case?

125
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,770
At the moment,

126
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,420
how much you don't want me to take it.

127
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,190
That's pretty fascinating.

128
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,980
Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,090
In fact, he's never looked better.

130
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,990
He doesn't like me. I can tell.

131
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,540
That's okay.
He doesn't like me either.

132
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
Who's James?

133
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
Pain in your head?

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,780
Go! Get away from me.

135
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,009
All right, let's get it out.
One milligram of Ativan, push.

136
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,590
NO! NO! NO!

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Hold on.

138
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,740
She bit me!

139
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,890
Good news is, she's
negative for HIV and hep-C.

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,700
Yeah?

141
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,129
I'm getting a tetanus shot,
she's getting an MRI.

142
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,639
There's a two day wait
for non-emergency MRls.

143
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,030
She's getting an MRI.
And then she's out of here.

144
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,659
Now Dr. Terharg specifically
said I'd have the MRI at 10:00,

145
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,219
it's almost 11:00, and I haven't
even had the pre-test yet.

146
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,710
Sorry, we're a little backed up.

147
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,660
Excuse me, you're Dr. Terharg's 10:00?

148
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm Angela Whitney.

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,140
I'm meeting my decorator at 11:30,
she's coming all the way from New York.

150
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,090
Dr. Terharg promised I'd be home in time.

151
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
Of course.

152
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,240
She's just about prepped for her MRI?

153
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,270
Mrs. Whitney?

154
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,369
You tried to steal someone else's test?

155
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,470
Dr. Terharg is a plastic surgeon.

156
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,710
The woman was getting a six-month
checkup on a chin implant.

157
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,309
I can't believe you authorized this.

158
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,020
Really? Sounds exactly
like something I'd do.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,510
She can't have an MRI.

160
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,449
The CT scan shows she has a
surgical pin in her arm,

161
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,940
the MRI magnet would have
ripped it out of her body.

162
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,820
You like the Alien movies?

163
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,770
You had no medical history,
what were you thinking?

164
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,760
We'll surgically remove the pin, then
do the MRI, does that sound good?

165
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,759
She has an electrolyte imbalance.

166
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,170
Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, believes
this woman has a brain tumor.

167
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,370
Actually, I...

168
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,840
Hey, don't ever apologize
for a medical opinion.

169
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,509
If he's right, we don't do
this test, the patient dies.

170
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,630
Now I realize that you have
a specialty of your own,

171
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,630
but does yours have anything
to do with the brain?

172
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,070
His does.

173
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,079
Fine. But nothing more
until you find out who she is.

174
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
- How are we supposed to...
- Hey!

175
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,460
He knows more homeless
people than any of us.

176
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,660
Go check out the 'hood, dawg.

177
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,040
I don't know.

178
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,110
I've seen a lot of faces around here but...

179
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,110
I don't think I know her.

180
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,690
Great.

181
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,170
Hey, I ah, like that jacket.

182
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,850
Yeah, it's all coming to me now.
I know where she keeps her stuff.

183
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,450
Just bats.

184
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,060
I thought the lining would be thicker.

185
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,089
No tumor, nothing.
Her brain is clear.

186
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,059
Which means, that girl had surgery just
so you wouldn't get reamed out by Cuddy.

187
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,860
Not necessarily, there could still
be something neurological going on.

188
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,159
Sure, she's not conning us, the MRI is.

189
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Not wearing a coat in this weather.
That is so wrong.

190
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,590
She drew these.

191
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,650
They might give us a clue.

192
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,569
She sign them?
Her name would be a start.

193
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,460
All the mythology, the locations,
they're all dependant on life experience.

194
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,170
Philadelphia.

195
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Look at that skyline!
It's very evocative.

196
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,519
The Chrysler Building.

197
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,540
That's a cloud.

198
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,279
And the Chrysler Building's in New York.

199
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,889
Mmm... I'm getting Philly.

200
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,900
And that cactus, well,
that's a smashed car...

201
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,559
car accident.

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,950
A cactus in Philadelphia?

203
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,200
Water... well,
water's October, right?

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,110
Obviously.

205
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:22,039
On the page number 22,
so that's October 2nd, 2002.

206
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,549
Ergo, the patient was in a car
accident two years ago last October.

207
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,710
My goodness! Was she okay?

208
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,590
Broke her arm, I think.
They fixed it... with this.

209
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,740
Surgical pin.
Better than a wallet.

210
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,970
Serial numbers in case of recall,
tied to a patient's name.

211
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,860
That's why you insisted on the MRI?

212
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,420
So you could remove the
surgical pin from her arm.

213
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,470
You didn't think I was going to do
it to save your sorry ass, did you?

214
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,920
You might want to take a look at that.

215
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,749
Her name is Victoria Matson,
at least that's the one she used then.

216
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,716
Any hospital with the record of treating
her should be sending that information.

217
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,569
Oh, crap!

218
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,239
Her blood work came back an hour ago,
magnesium was normal.

219
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,469
Did you change her banana bag?

220
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,269
Stopped the magnesium,
started iron dextran for severe anemia.

221
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,780
She's allergic to iron dextran!

222
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,730
Grab some Epi off the code cart.

223
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,129
Respiratory arrest,
call the code!

224
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,080
You have an allergic reaction,
can you speak?

225
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,050
She's not getting any air.

226
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Got the Epi.

227
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,710
Stats down in the 80s and dropping.

228
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,370
We have about another minute.

229
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,439
Well, we got her sedated and stabilized.

230
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,650
And we still think there's
nothing wrong with her?

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,580
Well, nothing's changed.

232
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,240
We almost killed her...
that's different.

233
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,810
And we know who she is.

234
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,830
So far we've heard from three hospitals
with records of Victoria Matson.

235
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,040
Seven visits, going back two years.

236
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,410
Any home addresses?

237
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,359
The pin in her arm went
in during an ER visit.

238
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
She wasn't conscious,
so they didn't get an address.

239
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,640
The other visits
she gave fake addresses.

240
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,816
Any treatment for neurological problems,
anything that might explain the twitch?

241
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,769
Last winter, Jefferson Hospital in
Philly, got treated for frostbite.

242
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,730
Baby, it's cold outside.

243
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,259
And depression.
They put her on Prozac.

244
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,729
Well, I'd be bummed out too.

245
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,299
Zero degrees, living in a box.

246
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,260
Put her back on it.

247
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,579
She cheers up
She might stop biting people.

248
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,350
There's a billing record from
Hartman Hospital last year.

249
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,289
Two appointments, ultrasounds,
doesn't say what for.

250
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,290
Pregnant?

251
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,560
Only if she was expecting an elephant.

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,260
The appointments were ten months apart.

253
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
Kept the first,
blew off the second.

254
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,450
Abdominal pain.

255
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,050
- The chart doesn't say...
- Wait a minute.

256
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,899
She goes in the first time,
they look, they can't find anything.

257
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,539
Ten months later, why should she
subject herself to that again?

258
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,040
Why make a second appointment?

259
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,240
She didn't.
The nurse made the appointment.

260
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,510
They were looking...
they were looking for ovarian cancer.

261
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,180
You got all of that from
one cancelled appointment?

262
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,890
With Jerry Lousing, yeah.
He's an oncologist.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,489
Hang on, her current blood work
doesn't show cancer. CA125 is normal.

264
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,049
And the cancer wouldn't account
for the alleged twitch,

265
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,799
or any other of her alleged symptoms.

266
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,020
Actually, it would.

267
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,279
Neoplastic Syndrome associated
with the cancer could

268
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,730
cause her to twitch like
a bunny on crystal meth.

269
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,350
Ultrasound her ovaries.

270
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,910
Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?

271
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,670
No. Foreman was wrong.

272
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,219
I'm starting to wonder about
that guy's medical chops.

273
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Right.

274
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,999
Shelley Diamond?

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Yes?

276
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,230
Dr. House is ready to see you now.

277
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,290
The little ones are
licking each other again,

278
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,320
and Harry's got a seeping
wart on his extra toe.

279
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,940
What room should we go to?

280
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,670
You know, I think I might be
coming down with something.

281
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,880
Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry.

282
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,140
Oh yeah. Just walk out,
like "I'm not going to do anything".

283
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,310
Bye bye.

284
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,470
Working hard?

285
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,060
This stuff's pretty good.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Calendrica, works for the counseled genius.

287
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,070
Bad guy's Mr. Fury, fairly
generic, no special skills,

288
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,070
but apparently very well organized.

289
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,010
Think you work hard,
try ruling the universe.

290
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,880
You trying to
teach me something here?

291
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,120
We've got the flowing dress, the ring.

292
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,149
Think the patient was married?

293
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,490
Maybe it was a bad break up, maybe he
dumped her cause she was on drugs.

294
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,760
You care about her personal history?

295
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,090
Nope. Question is,
why don't you?

296
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,970
I hate to cite a cliche, but...
Dad on the streets?

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,030
Dad's with Mom.

298
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,530
They're both living on the streets?

299
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,610
No! On a pension.

300
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,260
So who pissed you off?

301
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,350
Right now, you.

302
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,429
Your turn,
you gonna tell me why this case?

303
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,230
She's my new girlfriend,
I'm having a tattoo designed,

304
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,810
I was hoping you could find out her name.

305
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,759
So she's just another sick
person the kindly Dr. Wilson

306
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,379
has made sure doesn't get
lost in the big ugly system.

307
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,619
Yes, I forgot, I need a
reason to give a crap.

308
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,820
You're giving two craps.

309
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,349
The metric system always confuses me.

310
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,350
Dr. House.

311
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,259
Time for Girl Scout cookies already?

312
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,540
Get me some Thin Mints.

313
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,020
Since you're too sick
to work in the clinic.

314
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,710
Okay.

315
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,440
I thought you...

316
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,630
I thought you could do some teaching.
Patient histories.

317
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,730
My specialty.

318
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,130
When you teach, you learn
so much, don't you think?

319
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,790
It's all about the giving back.

320
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,020
Good old Cuddy. Always thinking.

321
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,880
She assign you a patient to interview?

322
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,480
Then why are you still here?

323
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,299
Why are we on this case?

324
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,140
Because Wilson asked
House to do him a favor.

325
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,609
I think House just wants to prove
she's sick so Foreman will be wrong.

326
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,730
Oh, you boys.

327
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,980
Hey, I'm just doing my job.

328
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,720
Foreman's going to be so embarrassed
when he finds out she's got cancer.

329
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,429
Oh. I thought you were too
sick to be down here.

330
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,640
I had to get away from those
students so I faked a page.

331
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,120
Foreman's parents, happily
married, 40 years.

332
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,750
Mazel Tov.

333
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,940
Keinahora.

334
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,390
So, why does he hate homeless people?

335
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,270
But if it's an uncle
or a grandparent

336
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,590
you'd think he'd use it in
his college application essay.

337
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,880
Family struggles beats a 4.0 GPA any day.

338
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,450
I think he had a 4.0.

339
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,190
Maybe he's just a snob.

340
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,100
You really don't need to know
everything about everybody.

341
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,900
I don't need to watch the OC,
but it makes me happy.

342
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,650
Yeah, delirious.
What's the other file?

343
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,620
Wilson, James. Boy wonder oncologist.
You know him?

344
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,359
You know, in some
cultures, it's considered

345
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,470
almost rude for one
friend to spy on another.

346
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,670
Of course, in Swedish, the word friend can
also be translated as 'limping twerp'.

347
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,240
Did your pager really just go off,
or are you ditching the conversation?

348
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,720
Why can't both be true? Come on.

349
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,410
Solid non-cystic mass on the left ovary.

350
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,310
Five by three centimeters,
central necrosis.

351
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,550
The only question is whether she
dies in two months or three.

352
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Oh, God.

353
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,810
You were right. There's
nothing we can do for her here.

354
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,680
Might as well put
her back on the street.

355
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,200
Unless it's not cancer.

356
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,850
Oh, you're joking.

357
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,780
Well, hard not to...
nothing funnier than cancer.

358
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,069
But what if it's a tuberculoma.

359
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,959
She's living out on the streets,
breathing all kinds of crap 24/7.

360
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,220
The odds are she's got TB, why can't she
have a nice benign growth to go with it?

361
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,400
A solid mass on her ovary.
Ovarian cancer's way more likely.

362
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,790
You're right.
It's not even close.

363
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,540
Start her on INH
Rifampicin and Streptomycin.

364
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,650
But that's the treatment for a tuberculoma.

365
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,710
And what is the treatment for
advanced ovarian cancer?

366
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,470
Pine box.

367
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,560
What are you giving me?

368
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,700
A second dose of some antibiotics.

369
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,750
If you've got a tuberculoma,
it should help.

370
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,680
I don't have a tuberculoma, do I?

371
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,720
Probably not.

372
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Listen...
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

373
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,780
I'm sorry I lied to you.

374
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,720
I took too much insulin on purpose;
I really wanted a place to sleep.

375
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,120
Were you ever married, Victoria?

376
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,480
But in the comic...

377
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,830
No, it's a comic, comics are just made up.

378
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,740
So who's James?

379
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,260
Is he real, or
did you make him up?

380
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,820
He's real.

381
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,530
Can I help you find him?

382
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,469
The light's bright
it's getting brighter...

383
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,199
Take it easy, everything's fine.

384
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,830
Mr. Fury wants to hurt me.
Please, help me!

385
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,730
Wait, wait, wait, hold on...

386
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,099
Please turn it off...

387
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Please! Oh, god!

388
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,780
All right, hold on Victoria.

389
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,470
Hold on. Take it easy.
Everything's fine.

390
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,819
- Take it easy, - It's burning!

391
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,499
- Everything's fine, Victoria.
- No! It's burning!

392
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,880
Hold on. Take a sip, take a sip.

393
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,310
It's poison, you gave me poison!

394
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,470
Hold on. Take it easy.

395
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,950
Hey, turn off that damn light!

396
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,510
Help me, please!

397
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,310
Take it easy, take it easy.

398
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,760
The bad guys can't get you here,
I've got you covered.

399
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,520
Mr. Fury's not the bad guy,

400
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm the bad guy, it's me,
I'm the bad guy...

401
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,580
It's not a tuberculoma. Can't be.

402
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,530
I didn't know the biopsy was back.

403
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,480
Her temperature's 105.

404
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,730
Treatment's not working,
it's cancer. She's dying.

405
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,110
105...

406
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,010
Good news! It's a tuberculoma.

407
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,586
How do you figure that?
Her temp's through the roof.

408
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,220
It's the lab results from the biopsy,
it's definitely a tuberculoma.

409
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,439
So... we're right about the diagnosis,

410
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,180
and the treatment for that
diagnosis is killing her.

411
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,730
Perfect.

412
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,800
The lab checked the biopsy again, twice.

413
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,389
Well, a tuberculoma doesn't
give you a temperature of 105.

414
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,000
Then it's a tuberculoma and something else.

415
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,119
The something else is
gonna to melt her brain.

416
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Poach.

417
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,869
Better metaphor.

418
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,200
A fever that high has to be bacterial.

419
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,190
Maybe the bowel got nicked in the biopsy.

420
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,370
I did the biopsy... no nick!

421
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,619
She could have picked up an
infection on the streets.

422
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,420
Well, she didn't have a fever
when I admitted her!

423
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,919
The Prozac we've given
her could have triggered.

424
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,519
Serotonin Syndrome, which
would explain the fever.

425
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,980
No! Jefferson put her on Prozac,
and it wasn't a problem.

426
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,360
She probably never took it!

427
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,679
Most likely they saw her one time and
dumped her out of the ER with a script.

428
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,746
Oh, just like you were going to do!

429
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,490
Okay you two, grab some scalpels
and settle this like doctors.

430
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,369
Send blood and urine cultures
and get a chest x-ray.

431
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,979
And fine, take her off Prozac

432
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,389
and put her on Bromocryptin
for the Serotonin syndrome.

433
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,279
Might want to get her
in an ice bath as well,

434
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,100
assuming we want her to live long
enough to see those test results.

435
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,190
I said I was sorry.

436
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,600
Your fever's 105.
If we don't bring it down fast...

437
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,490
Foreman,
why are you doing this to me?

438
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,210
We're saving your life.

439
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,710
Hey, come on. You can do this.

440
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,160
Please!

441
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,441
17 year old female presents with abrasions

442
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:46,660
and apparent trauma injury to her wrist...

443
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Dr. House?

444
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Continue.

445
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,980
You're reading a comic book.

446
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,550
And you're calling attention to your
bosom by wearing a low-cut top.

447
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,459
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were
having a state-the-obvious contest.

448
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,020
I'm competitive by nature.

449
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,079
I thought you were supposed to be
listening to our patient histories.

450
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,799
Nope. I'm supposed to be teaching you.

451
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,140
If I can do that without
listening, more power to me.

452
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,450
17 year old female...

453
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:16,709
This guy's supposed to have universal
power over all of gravity;

454
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,699
How come his hair won't stay down?

455
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,860
That's just stupid.

456
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,029
She fell off her horse while
riding in the county fair.

457
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,650
No, she didn't,

458
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,850
she fell off the steps of her beach house,
you must have gone to the wrong room.

459
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,139
Hard to believe that one
patient could slip past Cuddy

460
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,239
and get herself admitted
with a sprained wrist.

461
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,719
Two seems almost impossible...

462
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,540
what room?

463
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,050
Room 2106.

464
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,190
Patients lie.

465
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,900
But usually only one lie at a time;
How much does she weigh?

466
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,500
It's her wrist not her...

467
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,770
Poundage, ladies, and by the
by, what color is her nose?

468
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,560
- She's thin...
- Flesh toned.

469
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,390
What does this have to do with her wrist?

470
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,920
Almost nothing.

471
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,610
She's either under 90 pounds,
or she has a red nose. I gotta go.

472
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
What's wrong with her?

473
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,760
That would be telling.

474
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,610
Oh, I am just too nice.

475
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,680
It starts with 'C'.

476
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,390
Urine cultures are negative.

477
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,900
So's the chest x-ray.

478
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,840
I assume there's a positive coming.

479
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,730
Lumbar punctures revealed elevated
proteins and white counts.

480
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,989
CSF cultures?

481
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,139
Still growing. Nothing on Gram Stain.

482
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,400
It looks like meningitis.

483
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,569
We know it's definitely an infection.

484
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,990
And we know where it is.

485
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,310
Well, meningitis is nice and simple.

486
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,689
Get her in isolation and
start her on Ceftriaxone.

487
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,820
Either she gets better or she dies.

488
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,520
Let me know which one happens!

489
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,299
Oh my God. She was sedated.

490
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,310
It must have worn off.

491
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,170
I did it myself, a half hour ago.

492
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,780
I'll check the nurse's station.

493
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,780
Calendrica.

494
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,300
She's gonna die out there.

495
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,320
You don't walk out of a
room with ten milligrams

496
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,519
of Haldol in your system,
you don't walk at all.

497
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,006
It was ten milligrams,
I gave it to her...

498
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,030
It doesn't matter!

499
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,759
Bacterial meningitis,
highly contagious, if

500
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,979
she is out of the hospital,
we are so liable.

501
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,530
Not to worry. She'll be dead
before she can kill anybody.

502
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,400
Security tape confirms it,
she stole some clothes and she's gone.

503
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,599
Wrong coat.

504
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,980
The cape's in the closet,
I had it cleaned.

505
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
Funny.

506
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,950
You gonna save her?

507
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,469
In her comics, Mr. Fury
lives in Sloan Harbor.

508
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,570
The night she came in, she was
at a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.

509
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,240
You've been reading.
My, how you've changed.

510
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,819
You are a doctor;
Do what doctors do.

511
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,559
Pick up the phone, dial 911
and a cop on the other

512
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,840
end does what cops do and
finds the missing person!

513
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,080
I assume the rest of you have doctor
things to do... I know you do.

514
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,820
Cacchi-Ricci disease.

515
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,219
Do you even know what
that is, or are you just

516
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,070
guessing everything
that starts with 'C'?

517
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,239
The kidney problems could
result in weight loss.

518
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,590
Cacchi... C-A-C-
she's going alphabetically.

519
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,600
Doctor, why are you wearing that bird pin?

520
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,180
It sets off my eyes.

521
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,009
Hi, Jodi, I'm Dr. House.

522
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,670
What brings you to the hospital?

523
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,100
My wrist.

524
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
How did that happen?

525
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,430
I was riding the Ferris wheel and
this huge seagull flew right at me.

526
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,999
How horrifying.

527
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,400
I swung my arm at the bird,
but I hit the Ferris wheel.

528
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,629
She's making it all up?

529
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,530
No, her wrist really does hurt.

530
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,149
I'm not lying.

531
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,150
Of course you are.

532
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,710
You have no idea what happened.
You have no memory.

533
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,080
Korsakoff's syndrome.

534
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,299
Her brain is damaged by
excessive drinking or

535
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,420
insufficient diet. Pretty
obviously the latter.

536
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,859
She has no new memories,
no new ideas,

537
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,390
can't even process that idea.

538
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,739
So her brain fills the gaps as
best it can using visual clues.

539
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,280
The horse on your shirt led
her to the riding accident

540
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,050
and the surf scene on your
clipboard led her to the beach.

541
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,340
Korsakoff doesn't start with a 'C'.

542
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,960
I didn't say 'C'. Or did I?

543
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,129
Lesson to be learned...

544
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,650
treat everybody as if they have
Korsakoff's, we all lie anyway.

545
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,470
Give her Thiamine right away,
she'll bounce back pretty quickly.

546
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,870
And then get her to eat
some cake and ice cream.

547
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Yes?

548
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,600
Did you need to be so cruel?
I think she's crying.

549
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,739
Hi! Jodi, I'm Dr. House.
What happened to your wrist?

550
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,159
There was this weird old
guy, he had a cane...

551
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,090
See? It's like it never happened.

552
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,460
Perfect forgiveness.

553
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,530
Pulse is rapid.

554
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,410
You got a temp?

555
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:09,486
Don't know. She's warm, but...

556
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,229
That's something to look into;
She has meningitis.

557
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,310
Sorry, I was more worried
about her heart blowing up.

558
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,340
Pulse is 150.

559
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,030
Rhythm regular?

560
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,030
Yeah.

561
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,170
Ready. One, two, three.

562
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,560
Where'd you find her?

563
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,080
Battlefield State Park.

564
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,700
Narrow Complex?

565
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,900
- She wasn't at Sloan?
- She was just passed out on the grass.

566
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,360
Foreman... I need Foreman.

567
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,699
All right. Super ventricular tachycardias.

568
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,660
Get me Adenosine, one milligram, push.

569
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,270
Thank you.

570
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
Hang in there.

571
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,100
Her arrythmia stabilized.

572
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,450
It doesn't make sense.

573
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,579
What would push her heart rate over 150?

574
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,080
Dehydration? Fever?

575
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,209
Unlikely. By themselves,
neither one would do it.

576
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,140
We must be wrong about the meningitis.

577
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,529
Maybe it's structural heart disease.

578
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,110
Her heart rate dropped
when you administered the Adenosine.

579
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
Two seconds.

580
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,890
It's still meningitis.

581
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,250
If it is, with the delay in treatment,
she's got almost no chance.

582
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,450
Start the treatment.

583
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,150
Read the report.
I found her lying on the grass.

584
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,870
You should read my reports.
I make up stuff all the time.

585
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,730
What really happened?

586
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
Oh, since it's you...

587
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,300
I found her lying on the grass.

588
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,330
Wow. That is a great looking gun.

589
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,500
It's not a gun. It's a taser.

590
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,170
It's so cool looking.

591
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,130
What does it do?
Fire about 60,000 volts?

592
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,150
At least, that's what it would take
to jack someone's heart up to 150s.

593
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,310
Okay. Okay. Let's just say
I tell you what happened.

594
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,750
This stays between you and me, right?

595
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,190
I found her. Lying. On the. Grass.

596
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Fine.

597
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,130
Don't tell me.
Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.

598
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,590
I watch a lot of cop shows.

599
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,490
The good news is, the heart rate thing's
not connected to her condition.

600
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,730
Well then, she's dying.

601
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,580
The meningitis treatment isn't
helping her, she's getting worse.

602
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,780
Well, that brings us to the bad news.

603
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,950
The cop tasered her.

604
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Jerk.

605
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,450
Probably couldn't get to
his real gun fast enough.

606
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,750
The first time he hit her in the thigh,

607
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,360
and she just kept going,
like it was nothing.

608
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,510
Right about here.

609
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,620
She didn't feel the taser.

610
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,200
Localized numbness?

611
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,940
Yeah, in that one spot.

612
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,970
The diabetes?

613
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,010
I don't think so.

614
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,920
No alcohol. Not entrapment syndrome.

615
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,110
Can't be a vitamin deficiency.

616
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,860
We can't chase down every
sensory neuropathy.

617
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,690
Is that where she bit you?

618
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,950
Yeah.

619
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
What the hell?

620
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,940
Can't get angry if you don't feel anything.

621
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,350
First there's localized numbness,
then sensitivity to light,

622
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,130
disorientation, paranoia,
ineffectiveness of sedatives,

623
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,040
and then hydrophobia.

624
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,730
Fear of water.

625
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,850
Rabies.

626
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,139
There've only been, what,
20 cases in the last ten years?

627
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah.

628
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,040
That's because non-homeless people,
when they get bitten, they get shots.

629
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,340
There were bats.

630
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,960
She's dying.

631
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,620
There's no treatment.

632
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,920
How much time does she have?

633
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,390
A day, maybe two.

634
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,499
And if you don't get your shot in,
say, the next three hours,

635
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,820
I'm going to have to make another
affirmative action hire.

636
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,730
Come on.

637
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
Do it.

638
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,260
You want me to talk to her?

639
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,120
And say what?

640
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,660
There's some experimental treatment,
but it's not gonna work.

641
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,250
Don't worry, we can make you comfortable?

642
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,990
Doesn't matter how.
She's gonna die.

643
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,320
Yeah. That's what you say to her.

644
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,780
Keep that there and rest for a minute.

645
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,500
Tell House I need to go
out for about an hour.

646
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,440
She may not have that long.

647
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,800
I don't want her to die alone.

648
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,080
You're going to find James.

649
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,010
I'm gonna try.

650
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,090
Well, I must say...
he's done a lot with the place.

651
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Hello?

652
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,460
Hey... this is it.

653
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,620
Man, no one's been in here for a long time.

654
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,760
This has got to be James.

655
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,690
Maybe there's another address.

656
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,280
It's not James.

657
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Paul.

658
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,950
Paul Furia.

659
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,400
Mr. Fury.

660
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,850
Her husband.

661
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,110
Then who's James?

662
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,630
Her kid.

663
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,490
Oh, I just want to eat you up.
You're so delicious.

664
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,129
Look at me,
you're just like your papa.

665
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,900
Look at you. Just like your dad.

666
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,820
Foreman.

667
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Foreman.

668
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,570
They're dead.

669
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,560
That car crash two years ago...

670
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,540
she broke her arm...
and they were killed.

671
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,190
She was driving.

672
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,990
James.

673
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,270
No.

674
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,610
It's Paul.

675
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,220
You've come to take me.

676
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,210
No.

677
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,020
I've come to forgive you.

678
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,710
It wasn't your fault.

679
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,440
I'm so sorry...

680
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,690
I'm so sorry...

681
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I know.

682
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,750
It's okay Victoria.

683
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
It's okay.

684
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,040
You followed me?

685
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,650
No.

686
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,740
You were wearing rain boots today,

687
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,070
but you were parked in
the underground garage,

688
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,260
so the only reason you'd need boots was
if you were hitting the streets...

689
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,310
I followed you.

690
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,980
Didn't we have a conversation
about friendship?

691
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,780
Yeah. I had some follow up questions.

692
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,800
I've met your parents, and your brother...

693
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,390
I have two brothers.

694
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,380
Why wouldn't you tell me...

695
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,510
It was irrelevant.

696
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,450
Why not?

697
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,600
Because he's not in my life any more.

698
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,800
Well, that's relevant.

699
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,920
This was the last place I saw him,

700
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,400
nine years ago.

701
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,720
I don't even know if he's alive.
