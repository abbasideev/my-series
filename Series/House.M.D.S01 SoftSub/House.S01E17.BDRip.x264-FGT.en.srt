1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,410
And the only thing wrong...

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,530
the only thing wrong
with the American dream is people.

3
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:13,877
Too many people. Too many of us telling
young people that the dream is dead.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,870
They told me that when I was growing up in
the slums of Trenton,

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,610
and they were wrong.

6
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,712
They told me that
when I decided to run for Senator

7
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:25,947
with only $58 in my savings account
and they were wrong!

8
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:30,064
And they are still telling me that now,
that I don't have a chance:

9
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:33,138
Because I'm black,
because I don't have the right nose,

10
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:36,968
because I still have only $58
in my savings account.

11
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,903
With your help, we can
keep that dream alive.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,590
And in closing...

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,870
just...

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,590
let me say...

15
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:14,263
Let me say that you should
all donate the legal

16
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:18,210
maximum to the next President
of the United States!

17
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,658
Are you okay, do you need
some water or something?

18
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,918
No, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine, really.

19
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:32,438
A handsome guy like you,
I bet you get 70% of the women.

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,780
Here's hoping.

21
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:35,806
Of course, it helps
your wife died of cancer.

22
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,929
I mean, I'm sorry,
but the sympathy vote's in your pocket.

23
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,160
Yeah, I appreciate your support.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,830
Listen, Senator,
my union has a hell of a war chest.

25
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,309
I've always been strong on the union.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,969
The thing is, you always go
on in your speeches about

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,190
the workers in Indonesia,
Cambodia, Timbuktu...

28
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,459
Because I think we have... a moral, uh...

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,070
My union members are hurting.

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,480
They don't care about moral this
or moral that. Are you all right?

31
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,070
Senator?

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,160
Hey!

33
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,680
The guys are gonna love that.

34
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,089
Tell him to breathe!
Back off please! Give him some room!

35
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,170
Senator, are you all right?

36
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,599
The Senator's suffering from nausea,
headache, and mental confusion.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,030
Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,830
You're being childish.

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,249
Look, if his case is as
trivial as you think

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,010
it'll take you three
minutes to diagnose him.

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,650
Nope. I never liked
Cameron or Foreman.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,056
Do you know why I'm forcing
you to fire one of them?

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,129
Because you need to prove
to me that you're a team player.

44
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,370
Now, if you did that,

45
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,820
you wouldn't need to
go through this exercise.

46
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,909
Fine. I'll hold the Senator's hair
while he upchucks.

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,530
Oh, and by the way,

48
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,129
I need you to give a speech at
the National Cardiology Conference.

49
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,770
Next week.

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,329
I don't do speeches. I'm shy.

51
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,970
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has
developed a new ACE inhibitor.

52
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,910
I would like you to extol the virtues
of this breakthrough medication.

53
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,650
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals...

54
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,940
wait a second,
don't I own that company?

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,249
Oh, no, that's right, you do.

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,380
Viopril is a significant improvement
over the old version.

57
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,139
All there in study.

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,790
I know its price tag is
significantly improved.

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,389
You can either give one ten
minute talk and one three

60
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,450
minute diagnosis or you can
fire one of your pets.

61
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,668
My understanding was

62
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,040
that you believed
in rationality above all else.

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,530
Viopril...

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,530
I appreciate your keeping the media way.

65
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,270
We're keeping your staff away as well.

66
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,140
You're taking it easy, now.

67
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,469
I'm in the middle of a campaign.

68
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,370
The fast we can get you better,
the faster you can get out of here.

69
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,640
Anyone else at the fundraiser get sick?

70
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,869
I don't think so.
And I don't think that's it,

71
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,229
I mean, I've been under
the weather for weeks, you know.

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,570
Lots of traveling, supposed to be
in the Sudan next week.

73
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,510
Helps me concentrate.

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,070
Even better than drugs.

75
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,770
Open your mouth, please.

76
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,890
That's quite a scar.

77
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,729
When I was six,
I fell off the swings and bit my tongue.

78
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,390
Couldn't talk right
for the longest time.

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,169
Lots of teasing.

80
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,280
But, you know, it just made me fight
harder, speak up for those who can't.

81
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tongues heal too fast.

82
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,020
Your political consultants
have written you a nice story.

83
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
In a tight race the lispers alone
could put you over the top.

84
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,690
You a Republican, or
you just hate all politicians?

85
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,779
I just find being forced to
sit through drivel annoying.

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,710
You find sincerity annoying.

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,529
You're a black kid from
the ghetto who made

88
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,950
it to Yale Law and the
United States Senate.

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,070
That's a sufficiently mythical story,
you don't need to lie about your tongue.

90
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,850
Must have missed it.

91
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
What's wrong?

92
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,820
What is it?

93
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,180
It's not the food.
It's your brain.

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,490
Get an MRI and
a lumbar puncture.

95
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,330
Cancel your travel plans.

96
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,390
The senator's LP showed no sign of
infection and the MRI looks fairly clean.

97
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,419
I guess we can tell him
he's fairly healthy and can go home.

98
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,463
Well, there is something in Broca's area,

99
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,060
but it's small, low intensity.

100
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,949
Most likely just background nose.

101
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,410
Care to bet your job on that?

102
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
What was that?

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,319
What was what?

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,459
You got annoyed.

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,679
That was clearly an annoyed face.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,999
I get annoyed by glib remarks
about our futures.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,510
But last week you didn't get annoyed,
you made poopie in your pants.

108
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,590
It's weird, it's almost like now you know
you have nothing to worry about.

109
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,089
Chase has nothing to worry about?

110
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,050
None of you has anything to worry about.

111
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,780
What happened?

112
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,090
Vogler saw the error
of his ways and repented.

113
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,070
The lesion could be nothing.

114
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,879
It could also be
a brain tumor or infection.

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,590
There's only one way
to find out which.

116
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,840
You wanna cut into his brain.

117
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,100
Dangerous, I know.

118
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,100
Especially as he's a politician,
his brain's all twisted.

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,109
But I weighed that against the risk
of him stroking out before lunch.

120
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,930
Call surgery, get it scheduled.

121
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
You're not pregnant.

122
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,720
Well, I told you that.

123
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,979
But there's gotta be some other
reason I'm still spotting.

124
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,410
Sure. You were pregnant.

125
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,889
Based on your hormone levels,
you had a miscarriage.

126
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,709
I haven't even been on a date.

127
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,909
Right, since it's physically
impossible to have sex

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,149
without someone buying you dinner.

129
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,699
I haven't had sex
since I split up with my husband.

130
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,080
That was almost a year ago.

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,470
Fine, have it your way.
Immaculate conception.

132
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,870
What do I do?

133
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,760
Well, it's obvious.

134
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,990
Start a religion.

135
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
In my office.

136
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,850
Afternoon delight.
She just loves the hard wood.

137
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,810
You're not doing a brain biopsy
based on a spot on a MRI.

138
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,970
Where'd you get that?

139
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,730
Not on an United States Senator.

140
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,249
Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was
a janitor, that would be okay.

141
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,026
- Do you have a list?
- A brain biopsy

142
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,170
can cause permanent
neurological damage.

143
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,830
Where as tumors are really good for
brains, make 'em grow big and strong.

144
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,490
It's my call.

145
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,670
No, it's not.

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,970
You're pulling rank
on patient care?

147
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,080
It's not my call, either.

148
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,690
It's up to you.

149
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:53,209
Either it's a tumor or it's an infection
that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up.

150
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,549
Either way, if we don't treat it
immediately, it could kill you.

151
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,699
Or it could be nothing.
Reading brain MRis is not an exact science.

152
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,350
What caused my symptoms?

153
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,579
Wow, excellent question.
Many doctors wouldn't have gone there.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,890
It could be a transient ischemic attack.

155
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,249
You could make the argument
for watching carefully for the time being.

156
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,872
But you'd only make that
argument if you were an administrator

157
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:13,830
covering your own ass.

158
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,489
That's absurd, and insulting.

159
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,490
Insulting, yes.

160
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,930
What will the voters think?

161
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,210
If they find out
I've had a brain biopsy?

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,570
This could leave you brain damaged,
and you're worried about NASCAR dads?

163
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,130
It's not a brain tumor.

164
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,610
It's not a bacterial infection, either.

165
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,430
So you biopsied his brain for nothing.

166
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,110
If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's
mouth be contorted into that ugly shape?

167
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,290
It's toxoplasmosis.

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
You sure?

169
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,240
Which means the Great Black Hope
has full-blown AIDS.

170
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,310
They're gonna love that in Dubuque.

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Toxoplasmosis is a fairly
common fungus you can get

172
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,610
from eating undercooked
meat or touching cat feces.

173
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,129
In rare cases the fungi
travel up the blood stream

174
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,490
and into the brain causing
a lesion or inflammation.

175
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,570
So, what's the prognosis?

176
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,359
Toxo usually responds to treatment,

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,749
but it only causes a lesion
in your brain if your

178
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,930
immune system is extremely
weak to begin with.

179
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,070
Senator, I'm afraid you have AIDS.

180
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,139
- As I'm sure...
- No!

181
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,309
As I'm sure you know,
people with HIV can live a long time.

182
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,530
What else could do this to me?

183
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,439
Theoretically, certain cancers...

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,990
If you have toxo in your brain,
you have AIDS.

185
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,489
I do not have AIDS.

186
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,660
I don't shoot up drugs,
I don't sleep with...

187
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,989
This is very bad news.
I get that, and I sympathize.

188
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,309
But we've gotta speed through
the denial phase because

189
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,700
you need antiretrovirals
and you need them fast.

190
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,050
But... you haven't even
tested me for HIV!

191
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,990
We will.

192
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,900
But the toxo drugs are going to piss off
your fungi, and when fungi get pissed...

193
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,250
I am not gonna take the pills.

194
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,570
You're afraid word will leak out.

195
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,090
Trust me, you're not going to be
President either way.

196
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,910
They don't call it the White House
because of the paint job.

197
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,870
Here's what you're gonna do.

198
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,930
You're going to give me
the drugs for the toxo only.

199
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,459
You are going to test me
for HIV under a false name.

200
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,669
You are going to test me for cancer

201
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,500
and anything else that
could have done this to me.

202
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,600
If I have cancer,
I will deal with it.

203
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,350
But I do not

204
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,930
have AIDS.

205
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,169
"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals are pleased
to announce that Dr. Gregory House

206
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,930
will present the latest research on
their exciting new ACE inhibitor."

207
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,939
You're making that up.
That's Vogler's company.

208
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,010
Press release.

209
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,010
Doing an address at the
North American Cardiology Conference.

210
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,299
House never gives speeches.

211
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,489
But when I really believe in something...

212
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,630
Gosh dang it, I've got a chance
to make a difference here.

213
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,650
You made a deal with Vogler?

214
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,290
It's all the rage.
Everybody's doing it.

215
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,010
So, what's the deal?

216
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,089
You get to keep all of us
if you flog his products?

217
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,650
One speech, no biggie.

218
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,760
Foreman's doing a bone marrow
biopsy to check for cancer.

219
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,270
Cancer? The Senator's got AIDS.

220
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,599
Cancer sounds better
on a press release.

221
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,340
I need you guys to rush
the ELISA test for HIV.

222
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
Thank you.

223
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,070
For the speech.

224
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,829
When I said rush,
I meant, you know, fast.

225
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,270
Stat's the word you doctors use, right?

226
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,200
I know it's hard for you...

227
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Double stat?

228
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,570
This may sting a little.

229
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,650
Sorry.

230
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,570
It wasn't the shot, it's...

231
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,770
my head, it's killing me.

232
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,410
You know, Senator,
we don't have to do this now.

233
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,710
We can hold off until
your HIV test comes back.

234
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,090
Guess you figure
it's gonna come back positive.

235
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,710
Well, in my experience...

236
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,029
Patients lie.

237
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,410
Politicians lie more.
And black politicians...

238
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,080
I don't think black politicians lie
more than white politicians.

239
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,130
We lie less.

240
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,780
You figure we're morally superior?

241
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,130
I've got my theories.

242
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,080
No, we, we just can't
get away with it.

243
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,150
No one's gonna give us
the benefit of the doubt.

244
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,510
No one's gonna cut us
a second chance. And,

245
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,749
and when it happens it's not just
a bad politician, it's, it's,

246
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,750
it's a bad role model,
it's a discredit to the race.

247
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
You ready?

248
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,590
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,740
Take a deep breath.

250
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,859
Dr. House. I just wanted to...

251
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,159
You're welcome, again.

252
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,239
I want you to know how much I...

253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,190
Got it. You're grateful.

254
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,350
Apparently you seem to think
it'll mean a lot to me to know that.

255
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,460
Do you know
why people pray to God?

256
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,579
I thought you didn't believe in God.

257
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I don't.

258
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,599
Well, then you better be
making a very good point.

259
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,089
Do you think they pray
to Him and praise Him

260
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,890
because they want Him to
know how great He is?

261
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,390
God already knows that.

262
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,930
Are you comparing me to God?

263
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,040
I mean, that's great, but just so
you know, I've never made a tree.

264
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,930
I thank you because
it means something to me.

265
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,430
To be grateful
for what I receive.

266
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,880
You are the most naive
atheist I've ever met.

267
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,050
Dr. House,
you have a patient in Room One.

268
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,050
Thank God.

269
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,970
People pray so that
God won't crush them like bugs.

270
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,410
I'm not gonna crush you.

271
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,310
Petechial bruising?
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.

272
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,030
Gosh, the internet is
such a wonderful tool.

273
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,660
It could be leukemia.

274
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,130
Definitely possible.

275
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,110
The more likely diagnosis is hickey.

276
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,970
Well, it can't be a hickey.

277
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,510
Why is everybody so ashamed
of sex all of a sudden?

278
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,450
I'm not having sex.

279
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,340
I've barely even thought
about sex since my marriage.

280
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,170
I say you're having sex,
you say you're not.

281
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,870
Either you're lying,
or I'm wrong.

282
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,359
Or there's some middle ground.

283
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,860
You mean like oral?

284
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,350
I mean you're having sex
without knowing it.

285
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,469
I'm testing you
for booze, drugs and GHB.

286
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,310
I don't drink,
and... what's GHB?

287
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,260
The date rape drug.

288
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,550
It's positive.

289
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,050
Your T-cell count is eight,

290
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,460
which means there's
a good chance you'll die.

291
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,230
I'm telling you this because we need
to contact your sexual partners.

292
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,670
I've only had two girlfriends.

293
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:51,100
Two, after my wife died.
I used condoms.

294
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,170
You know the chances of you getting HIV
from heterosexual sex with a condom?

295
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Yes.

296
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,239
Some day there will be
a black president.

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,540
Some day there will be
a gay president.

298
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,729
Maybe there will even be
a gay, black president.

299
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,830
But one combination I do not see
happening is gay, black, and dead.

300
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,669
You need to stop lying to me.

301
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,490
It must be miserable,
always assuming the worst in people.

302
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,359
Oh, cut the crap, you're dying.

303
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,530
You're clever, you're witty,
and you are a coward!

304
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,400
You're scared of taking chances.

305
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,590
I take chances all the time,
it's one of my worst qualities.

306
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,630
On people?

307
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,949
Wanting to believe the best
about people doesn't make it true.

308
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,750
Being afraid to believe
it doesn't make it false.

309
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,960
Well, that's very moving.
It's a shame I don't vote.

310
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,249
This is who I am.
I believe in people.

311
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,509
I'm not hiply cynical and
I don't make easy, snide remarks.

312
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,350
I would rather think that people are
good and be disappointed once and again.

313
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,310
I need to draw some more blood.

314
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,930
Nurse!

315
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,030
The antiretrovirals aren't working.

316
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
That's not surprising.

317
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,430
He's just going to keep getting worse.
You realize that, right?

318
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,520
Why are you spying on my case?

319
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,040
Why are you giving
that speech next week?

320
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,629
We're both just doing
what we have to do.

321
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,150
And you don't see a problem with that?

322
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,320
Checking in on a patient?

323
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,089
Yeah, wow, how do I
look myself in the mirror?

324
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,969
You're not the one being asked to
perpetrate a fraud on the American people.

325
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,199
It's a ten minute speech!

326
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,509
That I've been ordered to give.

327
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,859
Vogler's drug works!

328
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,840
Don't care.

329
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,990
Oh, why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?

330
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,910
Because I'm a very
high-strung little lapdog.

331
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,630
No pills.

332
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,400
What's going on??

333
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,139
The antiretrovirals aren't working.

334
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
Why not?

335
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,240
Because you don't have AIDS.

336
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,240
The first test was a false positive.

337
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,860
Happens one time in every five thousand.

338
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,370
You ran a second test.

339
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah.

340
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,630
You're still dying.

341
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,960
The only difference is
now we don't know why.

342
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,009
He's continuing to lose control of
the muscles on his right side,

343
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,029
his brain is getting foggier, and his
T-cells are in the single digits.

344
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,300
Why are we doing this here?

345
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,930
So Cuddy can't find us.

346
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,339
Unless we figure out the underlying disease,
this guy's lied to his last constituent.

347
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,300
False negative on the PCR AIDS test?

348
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,490
Ran it twice.

349
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,679
Immunoglobulin deficiency?

350
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,230
No history of respiratory problems.

351
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,970
Ideopathic T-cell deficiency.

352
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,409
Ideopathic, from the Latin
meaning we're idiots

353
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,170
'cause we can't figure
out what's causing it.

354
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,329
Give him a whole body scan.

355
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,559
You hate whole body scans.

356
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,730
'Cause they're useless.

357
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,109
Could probably scan
everyone of us and find

358
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,340
five different doodads
that look like cancer.

359
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,299
But, when you're 4th-down, 100 to go,

360
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,389
in the snow, you don't
call a running play up the middle.

361
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,770
Unless you're the Jets.

362
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,950
I hate sports metaphors.

363
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,829
Why did you order the second AIDS test?

364
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,909
Standard procedure.

365
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,709
Oh, well, that's you.
Mr. Standard Procedure.

366
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,900
You suspected the first test
was a false positive?

367
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,429
I knew he was going to Africa

368
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,749
and I figured
he was vaccinated for Hep A and B.

369
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,069
That could cause a false positive.

370
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,069
Yeah, but you knew that before
you ordered the first test. What changed?

371
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,210
I should have ordered both.

372
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,030
You were sure he had AIDS, then you
talked to him, then you had doubts.

373
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,370
What, what did he say?

374
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,210
He said he had not engaged
in any risky behavior.

375
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,300
And you believed him.

376
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,469
Well, he didn't have any reason to lie...

377
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,600
Everybody lies,
except politicians?

378
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,210
House, I do believe
you're a romantic.

379
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,030
You just didn't believe him,
you believed in him.

380
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,860
Do you want to come over tonight
and watch old movies and cry?

381
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,890
Dr. Cameron's getting to you.

382
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,449
Well, I guess you can't be around that
much niceness and not get any on you.

383
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,890
Is that why you haven't
put the moves on her?

384
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,950
What makes you think
I haven't put the moves on her?

385
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,340
Oh. Oh, boy! You're in trouble.

386
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,970
You have restored my faith
in the human race.

387
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,630
You're lying.

388
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,049
No, I'm not lying.

389
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,550
I just got your results back.
No GHB, no nothing.

390
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,469
It means you're having sex,
and you're lying about it.

391
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,430
No, and I have a new symptom.

392
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,650
I have a rash on my butt.

393
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Do you want to...

394
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,310
What is it?

395
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,040
It's a carpet burn.

396
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,620
No! It can't be!
Doctor, I love sex.

397
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,060
I miss it.
I haven't had any in over a year.

398
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,919
Well, you managed to
keep this appointment,

399
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,550
so you have no
short-term memory problem.

400
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,030
Multiple personalities?

401
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,379
Do you find yourself
losing chunks of time?

402
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,460
Do you wake up and
you don't remember falling asleep?

403
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,880
No, I just wake up
really exhausted.

404
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,190
Is something upsetting you?

405
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,150
No.

406
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,329
My ex lives in the apartment downstairs.

407
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,680
He's always calling me,

408
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,850
always wanting to get back together,
complaining about mixed signals.

409
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,050
Get out of my life,
how much clearer can you get?

410
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,290
We have a sleep lab
in the basement.

411
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,670
If nothing else, it'll get you away
from your ex for a night.

412
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,090
Slightly enlarged lymph
node in his left armpit.

413
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,430
How slightly?

414
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,170
Quarter mil.

415
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,410
Lymphoma?

416
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,100
Sure, or he's had a cold
in the last six months.

417
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,910
What, you've got her on speed dial?

418
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,589
I just follow the scent of arrogance.

419
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,569
Another slightly enlarged node over here.

420
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,090
Two more in his neck
and one in his groin.

421
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,170
And there's a cyst in his liver.

422
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,689
Looks complex. Central necrosis?

423
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,890
Spontaneous bleeding, it's benign.

424
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,849
I was rooting for a really cool tumor,
instead we're stuck with this crap.

425
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,170
Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em,
ou've gotta check 'em.

426
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,200
Well, knock yourselves out.

427
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,060
I just saw Senator Wright,
he looks like hell.

428
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,700
That sushi must have been
a lot worse than you thought.

429
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,140
Mr. Vogler, would you like
a free whole body scan?

430
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,340
A man of your stature should get himself
checked at least three times a year.

431
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,400
Here's a few key points I want
you to cover during your speech.

432
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,510
Fourteen pages. The audience will
be comatose by paragraph two.

433
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,560
Throw in a joke.

434
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,170
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.

435
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,820
How do you see this ending?

436
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,470
What ending?

437
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,169
I can't fire you, so you
have no reason to fear me,

438
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,050
and therefore no reason to lie to me.

439
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,370
You told Cuddy where I was.
You told Vogler what I was doing.

440
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,510
Yeah.

441
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,830
So how can I work with you?

442
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,590
Well, you don't have a choice.

443
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,510
This might hurt a little.

444
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,740
Lie to me.

445
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,420
Okay. It'll, feel like
a gentle massage.

446
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:52,820
House is a lousy teacher.
You can't lie for beans.

447
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,780
Have you ever told
any really big ones?

448
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,229
Oh, I might be messed up,

449
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,699
but I'm not that out of it,
no no no no no...

450
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,770
Strap his arm down.

451
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,710
Am I gonna be okay?

452
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,730
I hope so.

453
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,730
I am selling my soul.

454
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,660
Just a little piece.

455
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,030
And you are getting something in return.

456
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,490
I said I was selling it.
I didn't say I was giving it away.

457
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,650
That would be immoral, and stupid.
All they've done is added antacid.

458
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,550
Does it work?

459
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,460
That's not the point!

460
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,840
Well, of course it's the point!

461
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,299
He's not asking you to lie, he's not
asking you to do something illegal...

462
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,019
He's not asking me to do anything.

463
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
He's not ordering you.

464
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,570
He gave you a choice.
You chose your staff.

465
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,530
I know this isn't easy for you.

466
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,680
You'll suffer. Vicodin sales
in Jersey will triple.

467
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,350
But you are doing a good thing.

468
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,530
Only you could feel like crap
for doing something good.

469
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,099
Kidney and liver cysts are both benign,
and lymph nodes all came back clean.

470
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,290
His left armpit node has
antibodies for CB 11.

471
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,190
Well, not enough to indicate lymphoma.

472
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,719
We never tested for hairy-cell leukemia.

473
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,560
No, but we would have picked it up
somewhere besides one lymph node.

474
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,380
And his spleen isn't enlarged.

475
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,530
Size isn't everything.

476
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,840
The spleen is the mother
load for hairy-cells.

477
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,300
Let's cut it open.

478
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,500
You can't biopsy his spleen.
It'll bleed like...

479
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,739
In the Senator's condition, a spleen biopsy
could easily cause sepsis and kill him!

480
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,950
Why do you do this to me?

481
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,319
Now, if I kill him, I can't tell the judge
I had no idea of the risks involved.

482
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,949
His brain's turning
into mush, and he's at

483
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,920
risk for more infections,
so we have to do it.

484
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,930
See, that'll sound much better in court.

485
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,930
Okay, go tell our human pincushion
we'll be sticking him one more time.

486
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Cuddy.

487
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,170
Don't you hate doing this?

488
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,190
Yeah.

489
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
What's up?

490
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,810
You like me.

491
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,970
Why?

492
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,330
That's kind of a sad question.

493
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,390
Just trying to figure out
what makes you tick.

494
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,369
I am not warm and fuzzy

495
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,370
and you are basically
a stuffed animal made by grandma.

496
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,150
I don't think that's why you're asking.

497
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,560
I think it's because of the speech.

498
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,369
Oh God,
don't try and pick me apart.

499
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,830
Then why are you asking?

500
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,260
What do you want to hear?

501
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,430
Hey, Senator. We need to do one
more biopsy, on your spleen.

502
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,790
I'll have to sign lefty,
my fingers aren't working.

503
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,229
You've been coughing a lot?
Does it hurt?

504
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:51,140
It's like I can't get air.
Is that from the toxo?

505
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,810
No, this is, this is new.

506
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,330
You don't need to sign,
we can't do the biopsy.

507
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,930
The Senator's breathing
is severely impaired.

508
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,019
His O2 stat levels are at 89.

509
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,010
His silver stain indicates
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

510
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,100
Another killer fungus.
It's consistent with hairy-cell leukemia.

511
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,410
But we can't biopsy his spleen.
Respiratory distress?

512
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,360
His platelets are 20 and dropping,
his blood won't clot worth a damn.

513
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,269
There's gotta be another way
to diagnose hairy-cell.

514
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,210
No, his bone marrow's indeterminate,
spleen's the only way to go.

515
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,570
You know, when the Inuit go fishing,
they don't look for fish.

516
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,380
Why, Dr. House?

517
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,800
They look for the blue heron,

518
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,520
because there's
no way to see the fish.

519
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,030
But if there's fish,
there's gonna be birds fishing.

520
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,700
Now, if he's got hairy-cell, what else are
we gonna see circling overhead?

521
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,940
He should have all sorts of weird viruses.

522
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,680
HTLV and ATLV.

523
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,520
We can test for them.
Run the titers.

524
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,340
These were your brain waves at 2:45 AM.

525
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,990
Now, here it comes, there's
an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep.

526
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,940
This indicates partial sleep arousal.

527
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,270
The most common type is somnambulism...

528
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,470
sleepwalking.

529
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,300
That would explain why I'm
so tired when I wake up.

530
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,010
Yes, and also why you were pregnant.

531
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,770
And the hickies.
And the carpet burn.

532
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,420
I had sex in my sleep?

533
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,250
Sexsomnia is a documented disorder.

534
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,179
You said your ex lives downstairs...

535
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,180
I'll kill him.

536
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,760
Okay, but he probably didn't know
that you were asleep.

537
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,990
Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal.

538
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,460
I'm going to write you a prescription
for a low-dose antidepressant.

539
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,960
It'll let you sleep better.

540
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,710
If you want to save yourself the $15 co-pay,
you can have sex while you're awake.

541
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,230
He's my ex, I...

542
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:55,629
You live in the same building,

543
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,510
you haven't had sex with
anyone else for a year,

544
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,650
you sleepwalk right into his arms.

545
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,680
Call me crazy, but
I'm sensing unresolved issues.

546
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,340
Negative for HTLV-1 and 2

547
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,260
and Negative for ATLV and
everything else. It's not hairy-cell.

548
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,220
Hey. You really gonna give that speech?

549
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,550
You've got an opinion, too?

550
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm a little surprised.

551
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,450
Frankly, I thought you were too much
of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.

552
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,440
You're welcome.
He's positive for Epstein-Barr.

553
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,210
So what? It doesn't point to
hairy-cell, it's irrelevant.

554
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,390
Hey!

555
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,370
You didn't fall off the swings
when you were eight.

556
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,390
Six!

557
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Ever.

558
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,370
Give that back!

559
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,170
We have to talk.

560
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,480
You had an epileptic seizure.
That's how you bit your tongue.

561
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,599
I haven't had a seizure since I was...

562
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,810
What medication did you take?

563
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:19,480
No seizure since I was six.
No drugs since I was ten!

564
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,770
Yeah, that's it.

565
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,069
Don't worry about what the question is,

566
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,550
don't worry that you're starting to
feel dizzy, just stay on message.

567
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:38,810
My mother used to call it physofin...

568
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,760
- Phenytoin?
- Yeah!

569
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,580
Okay, okay, you're okay,

570
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
it's okay.

571
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,960
Everybody lies.

572
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,110
Senator Gary H. Wright of New Jersey
had childhood epilepsy.

573
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,870
He took phenytoin.

574
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,279
That drug, with the Epstein-Barr
virus, is associated

575
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,909
with common variable
immunodeficiency disease.

576
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,820
T-cells down, B-cells down, it keeps
you from forming enough antibodies.

577
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,830
See, antibodies are basically
your defensive line.

578
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,130
And your brain is like the quarterback.

579
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,059
And then the fungi are like blitzing
linebackers, plunging up the middle.

580
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,679
Your lungs are like...
okay, you've got two quarterbacks...

581
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,140
CVID? That's a type of
immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.

582
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,040
Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea
when you said it.

583
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,850
Then he got the respiratory problem
and tested positive for Epstein-Barr.

584
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,929
That's pretty much a childhood disease.

585
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,350
Another reason why
Chase's suggestion was idiotic.

586
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,930
He got it when he was a kid.

587
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,030
Didn't get any symptoms
until now, it happens.

588
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,130
It gets triggered by stress,
like public speaking.

589
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,690
So you're basing your
diagnosis on a virus that's

590
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,270
relatively common and a drug
he took thirty years ago.

591
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,809
Start the senator on
IV immunoglobulin stat.

592
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,030
If he gets better, I'm right,
if he dies, you're right.

593
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Dr. House!

594
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,380
You faked that.

595
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
No.

596
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,219
Say "antiretroviral".

597
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,249
Antiretroviral.

598
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,920
Now say it three times fast.

599
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,260
We just got back your latest blood results.

600
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,049
Your white cells are up, your
T-cells are back over 100.

601
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,480
Well, that's good, right?

602
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,600
In a week? That's terrific.

603
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,186
You'll need medication for
the rest of your life, but

604
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,190
other than that, you're fine.

605
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,190
Am I well enough to run for president?

606
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,006
Well, why not run for pope
while you're at it?

607
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,380
Oh, come on.
Kennedy had Addison's, FDR had polio.

608
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,259
Two of the best presidents
in the last hundred years...

609
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,460
If they were running today
they wouldn't stand a chance.

610
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,760
So, you figure you'd be Surgeon General
if you didn't have the limp.

611
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,680
No, there's things I can't do, and
like you said, I have to live with reality.

612
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Well,

613
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,150
then I'm running.

614
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,150
Good for you.

615
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,980
No, don't get excited,
he's right, I, uh, I won't win.

616
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,850
Then why run?

617
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,780
Oh, I see, your point being the only way to
make a difference is to win every fight.

618
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,960
But hey, why listen to me?

619
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,350
I own the company,
I'm certainly not to be trusted, right?

620
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,620
Dr. Gregg House,
on the other hand, has a reputation.

621
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,580
For integrity, among other things.

622
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,450
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Gregg House.

623
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,539
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals'
extraordinary commitment to

624
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,619
research excellence is exemplified
by their new ACE inhibitor,

625
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,110
a breakthrough medical approach that
will protect millions from heart disease.

626
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,990
That's not a speech.

627
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,650
I thought it was pithy.

628
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,410
You got enough for a press release, anyhow.

629
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,210
Foreman or Cameron?

630
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,920
A few things I forgot to mention.

631
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,550
Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessman.

632
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,280
A brilliant judge of people, and
a man who has never lost a fight.

633
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,330
You know how I know
the new ACE inhibitor is good?

634
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,030
Because the old one was good.

635
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,210
The new one is really the same,
it's just more expensive.

636
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,630
A lot more expensive.

637
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,240
See, that's another example
of Ed's brilliance.

638
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,159
Whenever one of his drugs is about
to lose its patent he has his boys

639
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,790
and girls alter it just a tiny bit
and patent it all over again.

640
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:59,500
Making not just a pointless new pill,
but millions and millions of dollars.

641
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,420
Which is good for everbody, right?

642
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,840
The patients, pish. Who cares,
they're just so damn sick!

643
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,280
God obviously never liked them anyway.

644
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,330
All the healthy people in the room, let's
have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler!

645
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,860
I threw in a joke.

646
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm sorry.

647
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,469
I should have taken a couple of extra
Vicodin and just held my nose.

648
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,850
I'm guessing you did take
a couple extra Vicodin.

649
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
True.

650
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,320
You don't need to worry
about firing anyone.

651
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
I'm leaving.

652
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,510
Why?

653
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,320
Is this another noble,
self-sacrificing gesture?

654
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,009
You trying to protect Foreman?

655
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,010
No.

656
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,840
So this is just, "Don't fire me, I quit."

657
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,100
I'm protecting myself.

658
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,490
You asked me why I like you.

659
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,850
You're abrasive and rude,

660
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,510
but I figured everything you do,
you do it to help people.

661
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,930
But I was wrong.

662
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,840
You do it because it's right.

663
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,060
There are only two ways
I can deal with things.

664
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,150
One is in my control.

665
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,230
That's to leave.

666
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,650
Goodbye, House.
