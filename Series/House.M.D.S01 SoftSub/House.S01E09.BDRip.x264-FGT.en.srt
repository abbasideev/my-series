1
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:11,760
This is a really nice room!

2
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:14,270
Yeah, it sounds thick.
Too bad he's not coming.

3
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,930
Look, I talked to him myself.
He'll be here.

4
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:17,580
Right.

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,286
You're the one who said the song could
use a horn part, so I got the best.

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:21,992
John Henry!

7
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:23,113
Do you think I'm stupid?

8
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:25,150
Of course I do, but that's not the point.

9
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:27,177
He'll be here, okay?

10
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:36,717
Take a left up ahead.

11
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:40,160
South Street?
I canceled this gig.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,010
You said you didn't want to
do any sessions for a while.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,210
For a while.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,920
I called her, I un-cancelled it.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,950
But you up to it?

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,340
Let's find out.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,110
You lied to me, John Henry's
never gonna show up!

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Will you stop?

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,739
It's been, like, two hours.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,040
And we will keep waiting.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,099
I mean, you've heard this
guy play and you know

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
what he does, so can you
just shut up, Tommy?

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Oh, my God!

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Am I late?

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,340
You need to hear it again?

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,290
Nope, I get it. Let's try one.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,400
See what we get. Let's do it.

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,539
John! You okay? You okay?

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,280
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Call an ambulance!

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Now!

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
I want in.

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,300
John Henry Giles, you a fan of his music?

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
He's a musician?

35
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,979
That paralysis thing, guy
can't walk for two years

36
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,270
and nobody knows why, that
seems mildly interesting.

37
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,149
Forget his paralysis.

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,830
Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.

39
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,999
As far as this hospital is concerned,

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,699
this is a simple case of low-bar pneumonia.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,360
Boring.

42
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:22,519
But that “not walking” thing,

43
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,220
that could turn into something serious!

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,349
Marty Hamilton is his
primary physician out in California.

45
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,439
He's dealing with the paralysis.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,290
Know all about it.

47
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,399
Multiple treatments,
multiple surgeries.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,019
Making real progress.
Fixed everything but the legs.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,480
Dr. Hamilton already called
and asked for your team.

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,700
And by team, I don't mean you.

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,210
Like I always say, there's
no "I" in "team".

52
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,910
There is a "me", though,
if you jumble it up.

53
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,109
Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.

54
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,580
I know. I did accidentally glance
at his resume before I hired him.

55
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,479
He wants someone he can trust.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,259
He must have spoken to
Foreman's parole officer.

57
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,149
Someone who will stick to the pneumonia.

58
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,349
John Henry's on an experimental
protocol for the paralysis.

59
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,230
I respect that.
I'm not going to get in his way.

60
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
It's Foreman's case.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,020
It's pneumonia, he can handle it.

62
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,280
Guy's already paralyzed,
how badly can he screw it up?

63
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,920
So, what are his stats?

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,159
Staying in the 90s on the nasal canula.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,130
Coughing up much sputa?

66
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,059
Almost none, he seems to be stabilized.

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,639
Dr. House, is there
anything back from Micro?

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,870
Not yet. You gonna fire me?

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
You can make up for it by washing my car.

70
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,330
Oh, this is fun.

71
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,850
Let's keep him on the
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

72
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,279
and since he's displaying
septic physiology,

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,090
draw blood for adrenal
and thyroid function.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,430
How about the paralysis?

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
We're sticking to the pneumonia.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,809
Well, you certainly are, boss.

77
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,069
Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.

78
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,769
The paralysis has already been
diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton.

79
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,640
It's ALS.

80
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:05,160
Lou Gehrig's disease.
It's a lovely diagnosis.

81
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,440
They make movies about it.

82
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,869
No tests, no treatment.
It's a disease of exclusion.

83
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,670
Because Hamilton has
excluded everything else.

84
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,910
I haven't.

85
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,790
What else could it be?

86
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,620
Guillain-Barre, which would be reversible.

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,360
Excellent.

88
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,840
No, the progression of the
paralysis would be symmetric.

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,650
This wasn't.

90
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,959
Transverse myelitis.

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,359
Hamilton tested for it.
Negative.

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,419
And he was negative for
masses, and AVM, and...

93
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,989
Antibodies could be attacking the nerve.

94
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,479
Multifocal motoneuropathy.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
Uncommon, but it fits.
It's also treatable.

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,340
Did Hamilton try putting the guy on IVIG?

97
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,769
No, because the MRI showed...

98
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,230
Well, let's do an MRI of our own.

99
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,880
Guys? It's my case.

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,710
ALS fits. It even predicts the pneumonia.

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,480
The paralysis is progressive.

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,460
It's a death sentence.

103
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,920
That doesn't make it wrong.

104
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,380
So, you think the breathing
stuff is connected to my ALS?

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
It makes sense.

106
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,660
So, it's just gonna get worse, huh?

107
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,920
Well, Dr. Hamilton...

108
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,100
Great guy. Really smart doctor,

109
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,560
but his treatment obviously isn't working.

110
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,899
Do you think I'm gonna die here,

111
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
or you think I'm gonna
get to go back home first?

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,609
An MRI would give us a better idea...

113
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,959
An MRI? Come on. For pneumonia?

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,159
Well, Dr. House thinks
we should test for...

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,390
House? Yeah, I heard about him.
Obsessive son-of-a-bitch?

116
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
That's him.

117
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,880
So, who do you think is right?
Hamilton or House?

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
They're both excellent physicians.

119
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,650
Come on.

120
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,690
One of 'em says ALS, the
other one says not ALS.

121
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,890
You gotta pick one, son.

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,360
Everything points to ALS.

123
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Then no MRI.

124
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,279
And I want one of them
papers that say I, I

125
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,060
don't want nothin' done
if something go bad.

126
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,590
A DNR?

127
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,419
Mr. Giles, you don't want to rush things...

128
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,940
It's been two years, I ain't rushing.

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,700
I wanna sign one.

130
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,570
Now, while my arm still works.

131
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,560
He signed a DNR.

132
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,640
He rhymes with dinner?

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,310
He signed a DNR.

134
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,400
Oh. That makes more sense.

135
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,360
You tell him it might not be ALS?

136
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
No.

137
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,010
Well, no wonder he signed.
Who wouldn't?

138
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,900
I started him on IV
steroids and ancinthroid.

139
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,150
Great.

140
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,730
If it was my case, I'd be adding
a little IVIG to the mix.

141
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
For his pneumonia?

142
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,280
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,200
He doesn't want anything done.
No treatment.

144
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,520
DNR means "do not resuscitate",
not "do not treat".

145
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,250
You do nothing, it doesn't
matter which one of us is right.

146
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,320
And hang on to that DNR.

147
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,040
That signature could be worth
a lot of money real soon.

148
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,490
This is Dr. Foreman.
What's Mr. Giles's status?

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,710
Okay, increase the steroids
to 100mg every 12 hours,

150
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,850
and, ah, start him on IVIG.

151
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,150
Yeah, I'm sure. One gram per kilo.

152
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,830
My nature isn't what it used to be.

153
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,780
The little man has lost
some bounce in his step.

154
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,840
He needs to crank it up,
have himself some fun this weekend.

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,450
He wants the blue pills.

156
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,450
You're talking about your
penis in the third person.

157
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,670
Me and him, two people.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Separate vacations?

159
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,940
That'd be a drag for one of you.

160
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,710
I don't think you need the pills.

161
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,790
I think you have a conflict of medications.

162
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,340
You need to up your insulin to
"chocolate chip ice cream" levels.

163
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,630
Insulin?

164
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Yeah, you remember.

165
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,759
That's the stuff you take for the diabetes

166
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,460
that you forgot to tell the nurse about.

167
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,510
Your hands.

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,330
No hair, which means nerve damage.

169
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,969
And your shoes look about
two sizes too small

170
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,180
which means you've lost
sensation in your feet.

171
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,120
And then there's your pants.

172
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,260
My pants tell you I have diabetes?

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,790
No, they tell me you're an idiot.

174
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,210
Powdered sugar on the right pant leg.

175
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,450
Based on the two napkins
in your right pocket,

176
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm willing to bet it's not
your first donut of the day.

177
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,000
You're giving me the pills?

178
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,670
Sure, why not?

179
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,360
If you've got heart disease from
ignoring the diabetes they'll kill you.

180
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,220
Otherwise, you two have a fun weekend.

181
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,790
O2 stats are dropping.

182
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,660
Breath sounds?

183
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,450
Junky.

184
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,150
Mucus plug?

185
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:44,580
No, it's our mistake.
He's sludging from the IVIG.

186
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,079
Blood can't get through to his lungs.

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,789
Start Heparin. 500ccs, IV push.

188
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,730
He won't last long enough for it to work.
We've got to intubate him, stat.

189
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,770
We can't!

190
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,100
He's DNR.

191
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
What?

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Someone likes music.

193
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Oh, yeah.

194
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,089
His stats are in the 70s.
How long has he been like this?

195
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,950
10 minutes.

196
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,239
- Well, why aren't you doing?
- The IVIG put him

197
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,319
into respiratory failure.

198
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,479
You put him on the IVIG?

199
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
We did this.

200
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,370
So undo it! Chase!

201
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,090
It's too late! We killed him.

202
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,820
Nobody killed him!
He's not dead!

203
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Chase, intubate him!

204
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
He's DNR.

205
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,150
What are you doing?

206
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,090
You can't do this!

207
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,230
Bag.

208
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,079
You can't do this!

209
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Bag!

210
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,690
He had a bad reaction to
some medicine we gave him.

211
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,360
What did you just do?

212
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,460
He saved his life.

213
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,700
He's stable on the ventilator.
Oxygenating well.

214
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,699
The IVIG made him worse,

215
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,070
which means multifocal
motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis.

216
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,699
Okay, what's really wrong with him?

217
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,190
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,499
Everyone knows what's wrong with me.

219
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,139
What's wrong with him
is much more interesting.

220
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,200
You tubed him and he didn't wanna be tubed!

221
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,509
He has a legal paper saying just that.

222
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,490
To intubate or not to intubate,
that is the big ethical question.

223
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,519
Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it,
maybe just practice some medicine.

224
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,670
There's no question.

225
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,579
It's the patient's decision...

226
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,479
if the patient is competent to make it,

227
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,849
if his thyroid numbers
aren't making him sad.

228
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,319
Oh, my God.
You don't believe that.

229
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,619
His thyroid levels were a little...

230
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,219
It's nothing. Do not defend him.

231
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,610
Why did he sign that DNR?

232
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,130
I didn't talk him into...

233
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:10,299
No, he signed the DNR 'cause he didn't
want a slow and painful death from ALS.

234
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,259
What was happening to him had
nothing to do with his ALS.

235
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,960
Right! Exactly! It's the
IVIG, you screwed up!

236
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,860
You're not gonna let him die
because you screwed up!

237
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,990
Technically, your case.
You screwed up.

238
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,849
Is that what this is about?

239
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,729
Looking bad in front of your old boss?

240
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,969
You assaulted that man.

241
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,539
Fine. I'll never do it again.

242
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,140
Yes, you will.

243
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,110
All the more reason this
debate is pointless.

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,920
His lungs are worse. Any theories?

245
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,699
Oh, I'm sure he just went
to the little boys' room.

246
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,600
Come on, people.

247
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,360
Uh, vasculitis?

248
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,039
Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.

249
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
It could be Wegener's granulomatosis.

250
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Dr. House?

251
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,819
Cuddy sent me a stripper again?

252
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,060
Ah, love that woman.
So thoughtful.

253
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Sorry.

254
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,319
There are case reports of Wegener's
hitting both the lungs and the spine.

255
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,160
Well, it's not great, but
it's better than ALS.

256
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,460
At least it's treatable.

257
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,710
It's a restraining order.

258
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,279
You're not to come within 50
feet of John Henry Giles,

259
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,260
and they've asked the DA to file
criminal charges for battery.

260
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,000
Cameron, test the blood for C-anke.

261
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,359
These are criminal charges.

262
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,509
They aren't going to let you
take blood to make more tests.

263
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,890
He has blood left in the
lab, just add on the c-anke.

264
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,169
Foreman's still got you doing bronchioscopic
suctioning for the pneumonia?

265
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,150
Every four hours.

266
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,679
Well, while you're down in
his lungs, grab a biopsy.

267
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
We'll need it to confirm Wegener's.

268
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,039
And move the patient to
the second floor ICU.

269
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,510
Why?

270
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,631
It's right about the clinic.

271
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,140
I'm pretty sure it's 50
feet in any direction.

272
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,340
It's nice having a court order saying
you don't have to work clinic duty.

273
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,610
Dr. Cuddy!

274
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Excuse me.

275
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,740
You paged me.

276
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
Why the yelling?

277
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,320
His bed is behind that wall.

278
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
The plaintiff's.

279
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,630
I can't, you know, come any closer.

280
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,870
It's right over the clinic. Very cute.

281
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,480
Can we get the lecture over
with, because I've got a...

282
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,340
actually, I've got nothing to do.
Take your time.

283
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,370
You need a lawyer?

284
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,320
You don't have a problem with what I did?

285
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,539
When I hired you,
I knew you were insane.

286
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,619
I will continue to try and stop you

287
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,140
from doing
insane things, but once they're done...

288
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,099
Trying to convince an insane person

289
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,199
not to do insane things is,
in itself, insane,

290
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,219
so when I hired you

291
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,520
I also set aside
$50,000 a year for legal expenses.

292
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,190
So far you've come in under budget.

293
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Great.

294
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,220
Any chance you could
help me run some tests?

295
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,640
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton.
He's flying in from L.A.

296
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,850
You can talk to him.

297
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,450
Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend
of John Henry's to pull the plug.

298
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,610
Yeah. I need a lawyer.

299
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,269
Your Honor, on behalf of Gregory House,

300
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,019
we have convened an emergency
session of this court to bring

301
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,930
a motion requesting John Henry
Giles remain on life support.

302
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,670
Mr. House faces criminal charges for
battery against... John Henry Giles.

303
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,619
You beat up a guy in a wheelchair?

304
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,170
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube
down Mr. Giles' throat against his will.

305
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,940
A medical tube, saving his life.

306
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,020
Dr. House, please let your
attorney speak for you.

307
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm sorry, your Honor.
I was way out of line.

308
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,280
So, your client forced the
patient into this position,

309
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,460
and now he wants a court order to
force the patient to stay that way.

310
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,569
Without the tube, there's a high
likelihood that Mr. Giles will die.

311
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,600
Well, I assume the patient
knows that, he had a DNR.

312
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,620
That's why your client is
facing criminal charges, right?

313
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,820
Exactly.

314
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:26,350
And Mr. Giles' death will violate
my client's Sixth Amendment right.

315
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,790
His right to face his accuser.

316
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,400
That's clever, huh?

317
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,060
Your Honor, in Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania v. Hozelton,

318
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,029
the 3rd district ruled
that a defendant may not

319
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,719
use that status to rule
against a felony charge.

320
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,200
Why are you doing this?
It's not going to keep you out of jail.

321
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,930
No.

322
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:48,150
Even if you win, the restraining order
and battery charge stay in place.

323
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
What have you gained?

324
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Time.

325
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,040
To diagnose him?
You can't get near him!

326
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,810
I don't want to get near him.

327
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,739
You know how some doctors have the.

328
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,739
Messiah complex,
they need to save the world?

329
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,000
You've got the Rubik's complex,
you need to solve the puzzle.

330
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,820
Are you done, or do you have
more references to 1980s fads?

331
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,350
I'm trying to listen to this.

332
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,839
That DNR may not be valid.

333
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,859
The patient was suffering from depression
brought on from a thyroid imbalance.

334
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,360
The DNR order was witnessed by Dr.
House's own staff, a Dr. Foreman.

335
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,800
My staff are idiots.

336
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,076
I'm sure you know what
it's like, your Honor.

337
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,240
Sit down!

338
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,179
The validity of the DNR
is a question of fact.

339
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,880
Dr. House should have the opportunity
to make his argument at a full trial.

340
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,740
And this poor guy has gotta stay on life
support until we can schedule a trial.

341
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,520
Your Honor...

342
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,190
Dr. House, I will hold you in
contempt if you don't sit down.

343
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,579
I have a medical issue.

344
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,439
If it pertains to this case
your attorney should...

345
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
It doesn't.

346
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,540
Do you have any history of
heart disease in your family?

347
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,920
Your Honor!

348
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,020
Your fingers. They show signs of clubbing,
which indicate a health problem.

349
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,280
Remember Bart Giamotti?

350
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,700
Same thing, just dropped dead one day.

351
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,320
Please see your doctor.

352
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,710
He's admitted this isn't relevant.
Can we please get back to the motion?

353
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
Of course, I'm sorry.

354
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,569
Your Honor, a person's right to control
the treatment of their own body

355
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,610
is fundamental to understanding
this case. A long line of...

356
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,910
Congratulations, impressive legal argument.

357
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,530
I watched Matlock last night.

358
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,779
Oh, say no more. I didn't notice any
clubbing on the judge's fingers.

359
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
Neither did I.

360
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,790
So, the family history thing...

361
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,550
Every family has some
history of heart disease.

362
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,210
And mental illness.

363
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,110
Biopsy only shows inflammation.

364
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,290
Start him on Cytoxan.

365
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,061
You're diagnosis Wegener's based
on a little inflammation?

366
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,159
Well, unfortunately I think we've
exhausted all the tests we can do

367
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,000
in the capacity as the doctors he
doesn't want doing tests on him.

368
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:03,890
But you don't...

369
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,459
We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.

370
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,716
You can't do any more tests,
but you want me to treat him?

371
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,060
The medicine's in the pharmacy,
patient's immobilized in the ICU.

372
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,050
Sounds like a simple geography problem.

373
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,760
Are you asking us to jeopardize our
medical licenses for this treatment?

374
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,410
Can I help you?

375
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,550
Uh, I'm Dr. House, I'm...

376
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,470
Gregg, right?

377
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,470
I'm Marty Hamilton,
John Henry's doctor.

378
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
We should talk.

379
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,970
I'd appreciate any list of
medications, anything like that.

380
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,650
I've started him on Cytoxan.

381
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,140
For Wegener's, right?

382
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,980
Look, Gregg.
I checked you out, you know?

383
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,590
I know you're a good doctor.

384
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,090
You have to appreciate that
I'm a good doctor, too.

385
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Why?

386
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
Wegener's is one of the
first things I looked for.

387
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,190
The biopsy and the blood tests
were negative, just like yours.

388
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,210
There's an error rate, Marty.

389
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,080
And there's a time to let go.

390
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,979
Look, I'm gonna take him off the
ventilator, and John Henry's gonna die.

391
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
He's accepted that.

392
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,650
Dr. Hamilton.

393
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,170
Hey! How you doing?

394
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,729
Listen, Dr. Hamilton, I'm sorry.

395
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,409
I should have never put
your patient on IVIG.

396
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,110
It's not your fault, Eric.

397
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,269
No, it's mine. Eric.

398
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,340
That's not what I said.

399
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,679
Everyone asks about you back in L.A.

400
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,570
How's the old place doing?

401
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:50,620
Oh, this is wonderful.

402
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,759
But before you guys break out the oil,

403
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,350
I should point out you can't pull the plug;
I have a court order.

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,859
You used to, but...

405
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,519
I have the right to face my accuser.
Judge said so.

406
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,580
Not if no one's accusing you.
All the charges have been dropped.

407
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,600
He doesn't have to die.

408
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,880
It's not Wegener's.

409
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,980
If it's Wegener's, his lungs
won't be able to handle it.

410
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,690
As soon as they pull that plug he'll die.

411
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,890
That's why they call it pulling the plug.

412
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,820
I'm gonna miss you.

413
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,050
He's still breathing!

414
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,230
His O2 stats are holding.

415
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,210
He's holding his own.

416
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,570
He's still breathing.

417
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,640
It's not Wegener's.

418
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
Wrong again.

419
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,579
He's stable, but one of his
arms is now paralyzed.

420
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,739
The real question is,
why is he still alive?

421
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,300
Do you think he's just being stubborn?

422
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,540
He's alive because you were wrong.
It's not Wegener's.

423
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,079
Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately.

424
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,199
People keep living because of my mistakes.

425
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,679
Progression of the paralysis pretty
much confirms Hamilton was right.

426
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,500
It's ALS.

427
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:33,749
Assuming this is a progression
of his paralysis.

428
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,009
He can't move his arm.

429
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,489
Yes, his arm is paralyzed.
Yes, his legs are paralyzed.

430
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,140
Why is everyone so gung-ho to
connect those two conditions?

431
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,709
You could think I'm wrong,
but that's no reason to stop thinking.

432
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,149
How about this one?
He's not our patient.

433
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,839
Nope, not good enough.

434
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,960
He could have suffered a
stroke when he was intubated.

435
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,779
Well, blood clots are common
in paralysis patients.

436
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,949
The inactivity causes...

437
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,100
Not interested in why.

438
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,069
Let's get an MR-angiogram
for an embolic stroke.

439
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,449
He doesn't want you treating him!

440
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,569
They dropped the court order.

441
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,699
Yeah, and that girl dropped
the charges against Kobe.

442
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,079
Doesn't mean that he should call her
and see if she's free to get a sundae.

443
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
Good point, but I can go
within 50 feet of him now.

444
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,809
If you need anything, page me. Any time.

445
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,850
Okay.

446
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,350
Get outta here.

447
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,090
Sure. That makes sense.
You hate me for saving your life.

448
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,059
In fairness to your side,
you were also dying because of me, so...

449
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,539
You know I didn't wanna be saved.

450
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,690
That's what's interesting.

451
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,620
Your thyroid was low, but not
low enough to cause depression.

452
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,519
So, you came here to tell
me that even if I can't walk

453
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I can still hear the birds sing?

454
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,870
Enjoy the rainbow, and feeling
the sun shine on my face?

455
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,400
Those things are fun.

456
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,650
Okay, life sucks.
Your life sucks more than most.

457
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,120
It's not as bad as some,
which is depressing all by itself.

458
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,350
But do me a favor.

459
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,960
Just let me find out what's wrong with you.

460
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,810
And if you still want to kill yourself,
I'll give you a hand.

461
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,930
That sound fair?

462
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah, sure.

463
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll stick around to
indulge your obsession.

464
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,210
It's over. I lost my air.

465
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,299
The session the other
night, with those kids?

466
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,370
That was a test to see
if I could still play.

467
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,230
I can't.

468
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,830
And that's all you are?

469
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
A musician?

470
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,060
I got one thing, same as you.

471
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,650
Really?

472
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,210
Apparently, you know me
better than I know you.

473
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,710
I know that limp.
I know the empty ring finger.

474
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,200
And that obsessive nature of yours,
that's a big secret.

475
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,399
You don't risk jail and your career
just to save somebody who doesn't

476
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,750
want to be saved unless you got
something, anything, one thing.

477
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,540
The reason normal people got wives
and kids and hobbies, whatever.

478
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,580
That's because they don't
got that one thing that

479
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,020
hits them that hard and that true.

480
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,870
I got music, you got this.

481
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,330
The thing you think about all the time,

482
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,340
the thing that keeps you south of normal.

483
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,960
Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best.

484
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,960
All we miss out on is everything else.

485
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,999
No woman waiting at home

486
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,260
after work with the drink and the kiss,

487
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,160
that ain't gonna happen for us.

488
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
That's why God made microwaves.

489
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,780
Yeah, but when it's over, it's over.

490
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
Yeah.

491
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
What are you doing?

492
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,120
It's not over for me.

493
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,730
Either you're gonna call the
cops again, or we're doing this.

494
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,350
If you wanna die, you can do it just
as easily inside an MRI machine.

495
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,060
So, I go back to L.A. I'm going the
Dana lectures again this year.

496
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,510
Wow. That's quite an honor.

497
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,860
It's all political.

498
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,750
Don't be modest, you've earned it.

499
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,730
I got lucky on a couple
studies I was doing.

500
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,390
It all sells tickets.

501
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,539
You remember last year's
lectures, don't you?

502
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,360
I remember the cigar bar afterwards.

503
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,650
The only reason to attend
the thing: Cigars and pool.

504
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,890
You enjoy working with Dr. House?

505
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,940
Not the word I'd use.

506
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,710
We work too hard not to
enjoy ourselves, right?

507
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
You seeing anybody?

508
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,690
Kinda sorta.

509
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
Serious?

510
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
I don't know. Could be.

511
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,130
You think she would enjoy L.A.?

512
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,260
Hamilton offered me a job.

513
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,160
You gonna take it?

514
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,379
I haven't decided.

515
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,269
You already have the most
prestigious fellowship.

516
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,290
It's a partnership.

517
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,700
Three times the money, car allowance,
moving expense, pension plan,

518
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,659
the chance to work for a guy who gives
a crap what other people think.

519
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,460
So, why didn't you just tell him yes?

520
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,370
I made a commitment here.

521
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,070
Right.

522
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,976
House would let you out
of it in a heartbeat.

523
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,190
Or he wouldn't, just to jerk me around.

524
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,270
Would you guys have taken the job?

525
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,450
Don't need the money.

526
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm not like you.
I don't hate House.

527
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,970
You guys really don't have a problem
with him, with what he did?

528
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,249
He knows we disagree with his choice.

529
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:19,980
Choice?

530
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,510
Chase, it's not apples and
oranges, its right and wrong.

531
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,280
And he does it like he doesn't care!

532
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,579
He assaults the guy and
moves on to the next

533
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,589
differential diagnosis
like it's nothing...

534
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,660
What do you want from him?

535
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,519
More hand-wringing, more torment?

536
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,979
You want him to
cry himself to sleep at night?

537
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,479
Yeah! Yeah, I want some clue
that he knows it's a big deal.

538
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,739
That it scares him, that it matters.

539
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,150
Whoa, what's that?

540
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,290
It was a stroke!

541
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,930
Well done, Cameron.

542
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,680
House called it.
The arm and legs are unrelated.

543
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,040
You make enough calls,
one of them is bound to be right.

544
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,339
Yeah, he's
just a lucky, lucky guy.

545
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,580
Listen, listen, I just think it wouldn't
hurt him to learn a little humility.

546
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,100
So, what's the verdict?

547
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,300
Embolus.
The arm problem's caused by a clot.

548
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,060
There's a good chance we can
still bust the clot with TPA.

549
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,130
Do it. See
what happens to his arm.

550
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,310
We found a blood clot in your brain.

551
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,360
We'd like to start you on heparin,
it's a blood thinner.

552
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,690
What are the side effects?

553
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,870
Well, your lungs are kind of
chewed up from the pneumonia.

554
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,760
Good chance there'll be an infusion.

555
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Bleeding?

556
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,529
Into his lungs.

557
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,020
It's our best chance to give
you back the use of your arm.

558
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,050
I don't need my arm without my air.

559
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,730
The damage would likely be minimal.

560
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,230
No.

561
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,930
It's his call.

562
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,240
Or we could do an embolectomy.

563
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,070
Basically, we'd go in
and pull the clot out.

564
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,600
He's saying no to drugs and you're
recommending brain surgery?

565
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,950
Bypasses risk to the lungs.

566
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,379
It'll either help your arm, or...

567
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Or it'll kill me.

568
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,150
From your point of view,
it's a win-win.

569
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Okay.

570
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,820
We'll set up the procedure for today.

571
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,650
We're in your carotid artery.

572
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,990
This is going to take us all
the way up into your brain.

573
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
You all right?

574
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Yes.

575
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,819
The sludge is blocking the blood

576
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,900
flow to the part of
the brain that controls your arm.

577
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
All done.

578
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,650
You still okay?

579
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,000
I think so.

580
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
I don't know, I guess...

581
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,150
It's just with Dr. Hamilton here,
I notice a difference in styles.

582
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,010
His style involves humility.

583
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,240
Another difference in our styles:
I don't care much for apologies.

584
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,690
You can go.

585
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:21,209
I didn't know you were standing
there when I said that, okay?

586
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,240
It was completely rude.

587
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,339
Do you mean genuine humility?

588
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,969
You know, with all the self-doubt
and the self-questioning,

589
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,889
or Hamilton's polite, patronizing
"Aw, shucks" humility?

590
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,239
You're both excellent doctors.

591
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,120
Thank you.

592
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:37,190
And humility is an important quality.
Especially if you're wrong a lot.

593
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,190
You've been wrong every step of the way.

594
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,430
Of course, when you're right, self-doubt
doesn't help anybody, does it?

595
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
We gotta go.

596
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,120
Congratulations, Gregg.

597
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,360
Congratulations...

598
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Why, Marty?

599
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,860
John woke up, he can use his arm.

600
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Thank you.

601
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,090
Now look, I know we've had our differences,

602
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,440
but I think when a person does something
well it ought to be recognized.

603
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
The phone works.

604
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,240
Next time you want to make me feel
all warm and fuzzy, leave a message.

605
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,100
Don't get me wrong,
I'm overcome with joy.

606
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,140
Doc?

607
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:30,870
Yeah?

608
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,870
What?

609
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,930
You just touched my leg.

610
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,880
What, you gonna charge
me with assault again?

611
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,060
No, I felt it.

612
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,710
He now has feeling all the way up to calf.

613
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,000
This is the way medicine evolved.

614
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,630
Patients sometimes get better.

615
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,800
You have no idea why, but unless you
give a reason they won't pay you.

616
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,020
Anybody notice if there's a full moon?

617
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,449
You're saying he just
spontaneously got better?

618
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,070
No, I'm saying let's rule out the
lunar god and go from there.

619
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,670
Something he's on is working.

620
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,260
The enzyme replacement protocol
is working, reversing the ALS.

621
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,279
The timing doesn't suspicious to you?

622
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,200
Do you think Dr.
House will see it that way?

623
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,240
Figure it's his medication doing the job?

624
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,670
I'm sure he will.

625
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,140
It's one of ours.

626
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,470
How do we figure out which
drug is doing the trick?

627
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,680
Easy. We stop all of them.

628
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,269
One of those drugs is helping him.

629
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,270
And the rest?

630
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,219
Steroids, antibiotics,
anti-inflammatories,

631
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,826
they're toxic if we leave
him on all of them.

632
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,740
He'll walk again.

633
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:37,019
Yeah, to his own funeral.

634
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,759
But if we stop
everything, he'll get worse.

635
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,409
True. And then we'll add our
medications back, one at a time.

636
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,210
If he gets better, then
we'll have our answer.

637
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,420
And if he doesn't get better?

638
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,070
Then we're in trouble.

639
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,270
Not as much as he is.

640
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,660
I suppose that was your point.

641
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,490
I assume you want me to convince
Hamilton to stop his treatments, too?

642
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,650
Don't care.

643
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,569
You know at least five of the
medications are part of his protocol?

644
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,250
If his stuff was helping the guy would
be playing tennis months ago.

645
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,330
It's our round of treatment that's helping.

646
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,870
Right. So that's what you'll stop.

647
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,789
So your philosophy is,

648
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,196
"If they don't want treatment,
they get it shoved down their throat,

649
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,780
but if it might cure their paralysis,
whoa, better slow down."

650
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,410
Yeah.

651
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,130
My old philosophy used to
be "Live and let live,"

652
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,470
but I'm taking this needlepoint class and
they gave us these really big pillows.

653
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,979
What's your philosophy
on employee relations?

654
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,250
That's a very tiny pillow.

655
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,210
Great. Sounds like you
know what you're doing.

656
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,470
Gregg. Can I have a word?

657
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,880
Can it wait for the commercial, Marty?

658
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,110
Say "hi" to my friend, Jimmy.

659
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Pleasure.

660
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,120
Your diagnostic trial...

661
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,420
Seriously, commercial's
in about five minutes.

662
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,669
It's a dangerous game.

663
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,260
Only if we're watching in the bathtub.

664
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,149
I need to know exactly what
medications you were giving John Henry.

665
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,150
Forget it.

666
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,879
And if Foreman tells you what
John Henry used to be on...

667
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
You're gonna fire him?

668
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,309
Nope. Make him live out every
day of his two-year contract.

669
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,459
Foreman asked to leave?

670
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,240
Not yet.

671
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,289
But how do you know I made him an...

672
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,790
You're a polite twit,
but you're not an idiot.

673
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,420
I need to know what medications
you've taken him off of.

674
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,160
Wait a second.
You're not an idiot.

675
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,170
You need to know what medications
I've stopped, because...

676
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,170
He's getting worse.

677
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,630
Right now you still work for me.
Come on!

678
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,500
No feeling, no wiggling.

679
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,790
The bad news is, John Henry's
back where he started.

680
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,520
The good news is, Hamilton looks bad.

681
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,586
Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose,
it's whether the other guy loses.

682
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,909
What was the first thing we put him on?

683
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,369
Steroids, for the pneumonia.

684
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,049
Well, put him back on them.
Give them 24 hours, see what happens.

685
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,300
His lungs aren't great.

686
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,239
It might cause another
respiratory collapse.

687
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,800
Sure hope not.

688
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,279
I didn't much like that lawyer.
And get an MRI.

689
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,699
He already got one. And an MRA.

690
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,900
Well, obviously something is different now.
Do it again.

691
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,690
Chase, take care of the scan.
Cameron, put him on the steroids.

692
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,870
We should probably talk, huh?

693
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Thin cuts.

694
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,260
What levels?

695
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,410
T9 through the quarter-equinus,
same as the last time.

696
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,670
You really think House would let
Foreman out of his contract?

697
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,670
He has to.

698
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,790
If he doesn't, he's telling
Foreman he needs him.

699
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,500
House can't handle that.

700
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,850
Oh, my God!

701
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,810
I checked him out.

702
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,280
He's a great doctor.

703
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,460
You think he's better than I am.

704
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,680
This about your ego?

705
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,900
Answer the question.

706
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
It's not going to change
how I think about myself.

707
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,060
Might affect my opinion of you,

708
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,540
but that
shouldn't affect your opinion of yourself.

709
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,300
Now I'm getting confused.

710
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,560
If you think he's a better doctor than
I am, then you should take the job.

711
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,139
Otherwise, you should get
him to buy you two or

712
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,759
three more nostalgic lunches
and politely decline.

713
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,590
It's that simple?

714
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,089
I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?

715
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,719
Oh, how do I abuse you?

716
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,989
How do you not?
If I make a mistake...

717
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,919
I hold you accountable, so what?

718
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,219
Dr. Hamilton forgives.
He's capable of moving on.

719
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,639
That is not what he does!

720
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,069
I screwed up his case, he told me...

721
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,809
He never said you were forgiven.
I was there, he said it wasn't your fault.

722
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:42,200
So?

723
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:43,710
So, it was.

724
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,859
You took a chance,
you did something great.

725
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,009
You were wrong,
but it was still great.

726
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,610
You should feel great that it was great.

727
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,440
You should feel
like crap that it was wrong.

728
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,480
That's the difference between him and me.

729
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,020
He thinks you do your job,
and what will be, will be.

730
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,280
I think that what I do
and what you do matters.

731
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,150
He sleeps better at night.
He shouldn't.

732
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,879
Arteriovenous malformation.

733
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,850
Intradural, compressing his spine.

734
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,590
Causing his paralysis.

735
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,580
How could Hamilton have missed an AVM?

736
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,600
Well, we missed it, too.
'Cause it wasn't there before.

737
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,080
You saying it just grew overnight?

738
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,310
No. It was on the spine,
it wasn't on the MRI.

739
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,120
Same anatomic location.

740
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's not there.

741
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,790
Well, what is there?

742
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,970
Nothing.

743
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,580
Or something that looks like nothing.

744
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,729
Background noise, static.

745
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,620
Scar tissue? Inflammation?

746
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,260
If it's inflammation, the steroids
would have shrunk it down.

747
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,120
Revealing the AVM,

748
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,219
which has always been
there, hiding behind its

749
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,170
own swelling. We remove
that, he'll walk again.

750
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Dr. House!

751
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,280
Cora's meeting me outside with a limo.

752
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,910
I'm being discharged.

753
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,250
Fifty bucks says I can
beat you to the curb.

754
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,850
Thanks for sticking with the case.

755
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,660
I can't do anything else.

756
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,620
You're much more easily
amused when you can walk.

757
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,970
How bizarre.

758
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,499
I'm guessing you
weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine

759
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
even before your leg got messed up.

760
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,390
I want you to have this.

761
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,800
Wow.

762
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,370
You can sell it if you want to,
just promise me you won't play it.

763
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,170
How many of those pills you taking?

764
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,810
I'm in pain.

765
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,270
Yeah.

766
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,610
Aren't we all?

767
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,050
So, where do you buy these things,
do they have cane stores?

768
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,240
Oh, don't worry about it.

769
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:01,240
You'll be jogging before
you need a second one.

770
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,800
See you tomorrow, Eric.
