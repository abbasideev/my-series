1
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Visualizing?

2
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,570
All right. You're up, tiger.

3
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,490
You feel all right?
You look a little pale.

4
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,890
I'm fine.

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,540
Does your neck still hurt?

6
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,770
It'll be fine.

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Maybe you should do
the two and a half instead.

8
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,010
I'm gonna do the three.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,399
Well, it's better to nail
the two and a half than...

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm gonna nail the three.

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,210
All right.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,739
Well, let's show these senior citizens

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,760
what a well-coached
twelve-year-old can do, huh?

14
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,900
The next diver. Two-time National
Junior Champion Mary Carroll.

15
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,730
Damn it, you can do this,
come on. Just...

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,510
see it, see it.

17
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,740
Big jump, let it count. Rip it.

18
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,530
Call 911. We need an ambulance!

19
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,810
I saw the light on.

20
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,950
It's daytime.

21
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,260
Yeah, it's a figure of speech.
Always so literal.

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,450
Got a new cane.

23
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,230
Yeah. Guy in the store said
it was slimming. Vertical stripe...

24
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,070
Why are you here?

25
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,219
Vogler is dead.

26
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,870
What? What happened?

27
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,519
Again with the literal translation.

28
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,239
Vogler the idea, Mr. Destructo,
Mr. Moneybags, bow down before me.

29
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,140
He is gone from the hospital,
so things can go back to the way they were.

30
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,290
The way they were was kind of weird.

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,070
Weird works for me.

32
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,170
What are you saying? Literally?

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,590
I want you to come back.

34
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
Why?

35
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,510
Please unclench.

36
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,019
You're not on the clock,
and when you do that,

37
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,830
I clench, and then it's
the whole thing...

38
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,470
Could you look at your pager?

39
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,829
It's no big deal, some sort of epidemic.
Not my area.

40
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,280
You should go. It's important.

41
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,860
What I'm doing now is important.

42
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,220
Why do you want me back?

43
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,050
Because you're a good doctor.

44
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,150
That's it?

45
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,650
That's not enough?

46
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Not for me.

47
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,400
Go deal with your plague.

48
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,460
"You are in a quarantined area."

49
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,280
Please remain calm and stay in line.
A doctor will see you shortly.

50
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,749
When you see a doctor,
you will receive a blue or yellow form.

51
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,629
Patients with blue forms must
immediately enter the parking lot...

52
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,480
Dr. House! We need you here.

53
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,239
Sorry, lot of sick people.
I might catch something.

54
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,459
A judge at the campus
pool center collapsed,

55
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,449
LP revealed a virulent form
of bacterial meningitis.

56
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,479
Great, got it diagnosed,
you don't need me.

57
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,499
2500 people at the pool
center were exposed.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,739
They're being bused to
all the neighboring hospitals.

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,559
That's a problem of resources,
not diagnostics.

60
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,169
No, I'd be completely lost,
get in everyone's way.

61
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,170
Joe!

62
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,769
Dr. House doesn't have a blue slip.

63
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,180
No one leaves the quarantine area
without a blue slip.

64
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,400
You are a doctor at this hospital:
Act like one. And take these.

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,320
102. You win a trip to
the second floor. Next!

66
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,260
All right, no fever, no rash,
you're fine. Take these two pills,

67
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,760
and show this blue slip to Security
on your way out. Next!

68
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,420
Take these, go home,
talk to your daughter.

69
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
What?

70
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,319
Your pants, your blouse, your scarf
are all freshly dry cleaned.

71
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,699
Everything except your jacket,
it's got a smudge on it.

72
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,770
Probably two days old.

73
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,719
Which means you didn't know
the jacket had been worn.

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,580
So either your husband
is a crossdresser

75
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,169
or your daughter has been borrowing
your clothes without telling you.

76
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,160
Probably wants to
look older to get into bars.

77
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,230
I don't have a daughter.

78
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Next!

79
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,130
So I have it.

80
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,599
Yellow form to the second form,
you're gonna be fine.

81
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm gonna die!

82
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:39,440
It's treatable as long as
you go to the second floor. Next.

83
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,590
Yow.

84
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,580
Fever. Does that mean I have it?

85
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,130
You have a rash? Come on.

86
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,780
It's from my new bathing suit,
I've had it a week.

87
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,759
Yeah. Does your neck hurt?
If it does, you get the trifecta.

88
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,410
It's nothing. I pulled it trying
to do a three-and-a-half tuck.

89
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Where are your parents?

90
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,060
We live in Chicago.
I'm here with my coach.

91
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,140
I wanted to see what you were writing.

92
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Go like this.

93
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,150
Now like this.

94
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,370
Take these pills.

95
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,130
A blue slip will get you out of here.

96
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Next!

97
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
You're coming with me.

98
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,079
You're going to need a CT scan.

99
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,320
Second floor, take the elevators,
follow the parade. Next!

100
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,919
Maybe something systemic.

101
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,799
Or maybe it's meningitis.

102
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,129
She's had the rash a week.

103
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,509
If it was this meningitis,
she'd be dead by now.

104
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,129
You guys figure we're done down there?

105
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,279
The 800 people milling around are
just waiting for the bathroom?

106
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,439
12-year-old female. Fever,
rash, neck pains. Not meningitis.

107
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,309
It's the definition of meningitis!

108
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,509
Sure, pus in the spinal canal makes it
hurt to move your head up and down,

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,459
but her head only hurts
moving side to side.

110
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,649
Oh, side to side.

111
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,650
Doesn't fit.

112
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,169
The three of you, lobby, now.

113
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,789
Those little pills you're
passing out so efficiently

114
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,869
aren't going to do
Miss Louganis squat.

115
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,760
You just don't want to
deal with the epidemic.

116
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,619
That's right. I'm subjecting
a 12-year-old to a battery

117
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,900
of dangerous and evasive
tests to avoid being bored.

118
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,790
Okay, maybe I would do that, but I'm not.

119
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,129
If it turns out she does have meningitis,

120
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,220
you're right, you win, but if we
go back downstairs and she dies...

121
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,520
your face will be so red.

122
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
You have one hour.

123
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,209
Get a lumbar puncture.

124
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,899
Some brain infections can be
pretty clever at hide-and-seek.

125
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,620
- I'll get on her bloodwork.
- No you won't.

126
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,700
You, sir, will research all the causes
in the universe of neck pain.

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,820
The list is, like,
two miles long!

128
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,120
Start with the letter A.
And put her on rifampin.

129
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,279
Rifampin is for meningitis.
You just said...

130
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,100
In case I'm wrong.
It has happened.

131
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,029
Brenda, I need a CBC count 7 and 2046.

132
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,030
Hold on.

133
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,409
Hey, hey, there's a line here!

134
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,769
That's why I said 'excuse me'.
Brenda, I need a bed, and...

135
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,929
We all need stuff.

136
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,930
Push me again.

137
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,039
Brenda, I need a bed and
a nurse for a lumbar puncture.

138
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,989
No beds, no nurses for at least 4 hours.

139
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,730
I've only got one.

140
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,140
Your patient only has an hour to live
unless she gets a lumbar puncture?

141
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,830
Cuddy only gave us an hour
to work on the patient.

142
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Back of the line.

143
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,340
This novocaine will numb you
for the lumbar puncture.

144
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,680
Sorry this has to be so public, Mary.

145
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,460
Normally I'm in a bathing suit
with 5000 people staring at my butt.

146
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,820
I can block this out.

147
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,180
These kids are all very mature.

148
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,840
Travel around the country
from event to event.

149
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,649
Okay, I need you to hold
your knees and tuck your head.

150
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,650
Like a dive?

151
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Exactly.

152
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,360
Good, great. Don't forget to breathe.

153
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Sorry!

154
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,400
Geez! Coach, help me out here, play a little
defense before I poke the wrong thing?

155
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,820
Okay, here we go.

156
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,320
I feel, I feel it!

157
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,080
Try to relax, Mary, try to relax.

158
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,940
What letter are you up to?

159
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
A.

160
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,110
Torture combing through
all that stuff, ain't it?

161
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,820
Real dull. Awful.

162
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
It's no problem.

163
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,820
Well, thank goodness.

164
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,880
A lot of people would
resent having to do this.

165
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,960
Where's the 12-year-old
girl that was here?

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Needed the gurney.

167
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,379
She just had a lumbar puncture,
she's not supposed to be moved!

168
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,800
Sorry, we needed the gurney.

169
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,120
Hey.

170
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,550
Hey.

171
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,100
You okay? How's your head feeling?

172
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,399
She's got a headache,
and she's dizzy.

173
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
She shouldn't have been moved
after the procedure, I'm sorry.

174
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm fine, what did the test show?

175
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,539
No meningitis,
no other infections.

176
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,420
But you're not carrying a blue form.

177
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,119
I have something else, don't I?

178
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,600
Something's causing your symptoms.

179
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,840
We're going to keep you overnight.

180
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,279
I know it's a little crazy
here, but hopefully

181
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,200
things will settle down
and we'll get you a room.

182
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,130
I'm sorry. I'm not usually
all emotional like this. Just...

183
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,369
You're doing great.
Your folks will land in a few hours.

184
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,620
I just... I haven't slept, I'm so tired.

185
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,980
Oh my God, my eye's bleeding.

186
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,160
What is it, what's happening?

187
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,910
Oh, don't worry.

188
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,880
The antibiotic we gave you in case you had
meningitis can turn your tears reddish.

189
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
That's not blood.

190
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,220
But that... that's blood.

191
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
That's going into my stomach?

192
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,730
The vials showed blood in your GI tract.

193
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,940
We need to find out where it's coming from.

194
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,050
You won't feel it.

195
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,879
I'm going to numb
the back of your throat and.

196
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
Dr. Foreman is going to
give you a sedative. Open.

197
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,860
Swallow. Now lay on your side for me.

198
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,430
And here we go.

199
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,280
Yell "fire," or something.

200
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,869
People, this area is
highly contagious.

201
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,970
Please step back.
Highly contagious.

202
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,170
All right. Try to relax, Mary,
this shouldn't take too long.

203
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,650
Don't see any tears or lesions.

204
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,399
All right, I'm in her stomach.
There's no bleeding.

205
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,560
There was more than a tablespoon of blood
in her mouth, so it's got to be there.

206
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,780
Maybe her small intestine.

207
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,010
30 feet of digestive tract,
it could be anywhere in there.

208
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,210
We're not going to see it with this.

209
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,300
Believe it or not, this is a camera.

210
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,700
You swallow it, and it goes
all the way through your system.

211
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,560
The antennae pick up
the signal from the pill.

212
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,670
We're going to look at
the video of your intestines,

213
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,530
see where the blood is
coming from, and fix it.

214
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Alright?

215
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,820
Water? Down the hatch.

216
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,260
Think I've seen this movie.

217
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,540
The ending's kind of dark.

218
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,790
You want one?

219
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,960
How come you did the endoscopy?

220
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,019
He asked for help!

221
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,409
Her blood pressure was high,
I was worried...

222
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,940
Foreman is not your boss.

223
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,210
When I tell you to do something...

224
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,150
whoa. Hold it there. Back
it up a couple of frames.

225
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,280
Oh, yeah! That's your money shot.

226
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,940
I don't see anything.

227
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:39,959
Really? Ginormous thing on the right side

228
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,579
of her intestine doesn't even intrigue you?

229
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,839
Does ginormous mean really big or really,
really small, 'cause I don't see anything.

230
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,880
There? A Dieulafoy?

231
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,629
Oh. Well, we can burn off
the swollen blood vessel,

232
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,780
but it still doesn't account
for her other symptoms.

233
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,120
No, but it does tell us something.
Though I have no idea what.

234
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,520
Could be a precursor to
intestinal intussusception.

235
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,830
Precursor isn't causing all of
her other symptoms. What else?

236
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,899
You, in the lobby, now.

237
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,989
I hurt my leg. I have a note.

238
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,320
You had your hour. Three, actually.

239
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,510
Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us
when our time was up.

240
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,320
She has intestinal bleeding.

241
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,199
She'll wait. Two more buses just arrived.
We need you downstairs.

242
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,920
No, you need more nurses.

243
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,589
But you cut back on the
nursing staff so you could have

244
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,589
doctors doing what the
nurses should be doing.

245
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,590
That's true.

246
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,420
I wonder if that has anything to do
with you costing us $100 million.

247
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,260
Attention. If you do not have a blue form,

248
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,510
you will not to be allowed to be
in the quarantine area.

249
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Go, be free.

250
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,180
It's not the intussusception,
what about stomach cancer?

251
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,829
- Does she have any abdominal pain?
- No.

252
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,169
Then it's not stomach cancer.
Have you ruled out sepsis?

253
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,839
The LP and blood smear showed
no signs of infection.

254
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
Here. Take these two pills and you can go.

255
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,610
Well, the lab's working at double their
capacity, maybe someone screwed up.

256
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,969
No fever, no neck pain.
Take the elevator to the third floor.

257
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong form.
No fever, no neck pain, she's fine.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,880
Smell her hair, no chlorine.

259
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,790
Which means she wasn't at the pool.

260
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,590
Which means she's come to a quarantined
area because she's a idiot or she's insane.

261
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,070
No one is that stupid.
East wing, psych ward, bye-bye.

262
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,829
Neck pain could be
a symptom for bone cancer.

263
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,620
You up to Bs? Well done!

264
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,820
It would account for all her
meningial symptoms. Rash, fever...

265
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,879
You're fine. Take these two pills...

266
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,340
Get a sample of her bone marrow.

267
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
From here?

268
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,250
Break time.

269
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,939
Need more than 15 minutes.

270
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,240
Use Chase's break, too.

271
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Go.

272
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,320
You should just fire Chase.

273
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,780
What, and miss out on all this fun?

274
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,340
So you're going to torture him
for a while and then fire him? That's cold.

275
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,930
You don't think he has it coming?

276
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,640
Hey, I said fire him.

277
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,079
That's cold. All he did was save his job.

278
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,110
What? He completely screwed you over!

279
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Right rudder.

280
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,779
Bank, bank, bank!

281
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,819
Good coffee?

282
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,420
The rest of this hospital is
busting it's tail, and you're...

283
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,070
What are you doing?

284
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,440
Trying to think of anything except
the produce department at Whole Foods.

285
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,919
I am... working, it got hot,
stop acting like a 13-year-old!

286
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Sorry, you just don't usually see
breasts like that on Deans of Medicine.

287
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,919
Oh, women can't be heads of hospitals?
Or just ugly ones?

288
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,800
No, they can be babes.
You just don't usually see their funbags.

289
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,919
Your 3 o'clock interview for
Dr. Cameron's position is in your office.

290
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,600
Ah, not interviewing today.

291
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,389
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's this big time epidemic.

292
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,959
Many sick people puking
in the hallways, it's crazy.

293
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,619
I'll send the interview home,
we can reschedule.

294
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,609
No, you won't.
You will interview this person,

295
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,029
and if he can put two
sentences together you will

296
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,200
send him to the lobby
where he will do his job.

297
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,850
Unlike the two of you.

298
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,299
Come on, you know I can't do
a bone marrow aspiration in the hallway.

299
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,089
And I can't give you a procedure room.

300
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,719
I just need something at least
close to a sterile environment.

301
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,030
I need 10 more nurses.

302
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,420
Brenda, listen, listen. She'll die.

303
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
At least she'll have a bed, then.

304
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Put that over there.

305
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,530
Are there dead people in those cabinets?

306
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,760
I hope that's who's in there.

307
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,930
Just be calm, relax.

308
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Hang on.

309
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,470
Hang on. Almost done.

310
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,999
You know, I really admire the way
you don't care what anyone thinks.

311
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
You just do what you want,
the way you want.

312
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,579
So, you went to Hopkins for
both undergrad and med school?

313
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,210
That's right.

314
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,210
He's in a band.

315
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
You into music?

316
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,940
Totally.
What kind of music do you play?

317
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,569
Mostly blues, you know.
James Cotton, some original stuff.

318
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,560
Oh, dude. You are so hired.

319
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,950
Really?

320
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,590
Not a chance.

321
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Why?

322
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,170
Tattoo.

323
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,840
Wow. I thought you'd be the last person
to have a problem with nonconformity.

324
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,319
Nonconformity, right.

325
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,479
I can't remember the last
time I saw a 20-something

326
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,579
kid with a tattoo of an
Asian letter on his wrist.

327
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,409
You are one wicked free thinker.

328
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,240
You want to be a rebel?
Stop being cool.

329
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,990
Wear a pocket protector like
he does and get a haircut.

330
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,439
Like the Asian kids who don't leave
the library for 20 hours stretches,

331
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,280
they're the ones who
don't care what you think.

332
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,910
Sayonara.

333
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,870
So should I go through
all the resumes looking for Asian names?

334
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,459
Actually, the Asian kids are
probably just responding

335
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,580
to parental pressure, but
my point is still valid.

336
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,020
So when do they think
you're getting out of here?

337
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,180
I don't know.

338
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,530
You don't look sick.

339
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,239
Better hope you're not, this equipment
looks like it's 100 years old.

340
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,650
Just got it out of storage.

341
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,390
It is the previous generation,
but it works just fine.

342
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,060
Could you guys give us a sec?

343
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,470
If it's good news,
you can tell them.

344
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,890
Okay. We're pretty sure
it's not cancer.

345
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,020
Hey, that's great.

346
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,519
I'll call your parents.

347
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,869
Well, we still can't release her.

348
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,950
We still don't know yet
exactly what's causing the...

349
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,950
Mary?

350
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,780
What's wrong?

351
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:10,930
She's having an absence seizure.
Mary, you okay?

352
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,339
She looks fine.

353
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,460
I need some help over here!

354
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,320
Push two milligrams Ativan, stat!

355
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,840
Are you sure it was
an absence seizure?

356
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,909
Absolutely.

357
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,319
She was totally unresponsive

358
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,040
and unaware
of what was going on around her.

359
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,960
Do you mind?
We're trying to work.

360
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,659
We should get back out there.
Cuddy's going to be looking for us.

361
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,359
Looking, but not finding.
You do an EEG?

362
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,899
Seizure frequency's increasing.

363
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,139
They're almost constant now.
5 in the last half hour.

364
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,870
Which tells us...

365
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,179
It's definitely in the brain.

366
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,220
And it's getting worse.

367
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,930
And?

368
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,020
Good lord, are you having a
bowel movement or a baby?

369
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,349
Could be barbiturate withdrawal.

370
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,609
No, can't be drugs. She's tested
at every meet she competes in.

371
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,729
A bleed in the brain
can cause seizures.

372
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,079
Rat poison.
Could also cause the neck pain.

373
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,361
You think she's eating
off the floor of her folks' garage?

374
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,660
Doesn't have to be.

375
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,940
Who would poison a 12-year-old?

376
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,699
Well, let's see now,
there's the 18-year-old

377
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,009
has-been that she beat
out to make Nationals,

378
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,280
the has-been's parents,
jealous siblings, sociopathic swim fan,

379
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,620
and then there's just
your plain old garden variety whack job.

380
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,120
Hey! You know
what a hemorrhoid is?

381
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,570
No.

382
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Well, google it.

383
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,940
And try some Raisin Bran
instead of the donuts.

384
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,539
Okay, do a CT scan, check
for intercranial bleeding.

385
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,119
Not a chance,
radiology's totally swamped.

386
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,099
If our patient's bleeding into her brain,
she's gonna be dead in 8 hours.

387
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,900
She could be, but a meningitis
patient will be without a CT scan.

388
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,609
When I was in med school,
I had this old professor...

389
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,050
who touched you
in the naughty place?

390
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,029
Before the CT scan was introduced,
he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.

391
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,670
Ancient, but if there's
enough bleeding it might work.

392
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,880
Okay, do what the guy who didn't
specialize in neurology said.

393
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,290
It was my idea!

394
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,600
You've still got to cover Q-Z.

395
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,450
Sorry I'm late,
I was taking a dump.

396
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,730
I'm guessing I'm better off interviewing
right after than right before.

397
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,580
Dr. Petra Gilmar,
Dr. Gregory House.

398
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,679
You actually speak four
languages, or you just banking

399
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,650
on never being interviewed
by anyone who does?

400
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,790
It's true.
And I can swear in two more.

401
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,820
Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?

402
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,700
Did you fall for him and can't handle it,
or is it the other way around?

403
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,609
Yes, well, pretty much
every fellowship ends that way.

404
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,969
No, it was nothing like that.

405
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,970
You Jewish?

406
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,920
Yes.

407
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,761
Is it true what they say
about Jewish foreplay?

408
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,389
Two hours of begging?

409
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,310
I heard four.

410
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,340
Well, actually, I'm only half-Jewish.

411
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,160
Look, I know you like to
play games with people.

412
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,539
I know you like to say outrageous
things and study how they react.

413
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,219
What you should know about me
is that I grew up with four brothers.

414
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,759
Keep your hands to yourself,

415
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,800
I'm okay with anything
that comes out of your mouth.

416
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,580
Well, that's great.
I think that's all we'll need.

417
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,710
- Thank you for coming by.
- Thank you.

418
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,470
That's our Hitler!

419
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,310
No way.

420
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,999
Are you kidding?
Her background's perfect, she's smart,

421
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,679
she can obviously
deal with your insanity...

422
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,939
Did you see her shoes?

423
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,979
Her shoes?

424
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,059
What, did your horoscope in Vogue tell you
to avoid women wearing green shoes?

425
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,260
The eyes can mislead, the smile can lie,
but the shoes always tell the truth.

426
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,879
They were Prada.
It means she has good taste.

427
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,119
They were not Prada. You wouldn't know
Prada if one stepped on your scrotum.

428
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,549
Okay, well, they were nice, pointy...

429
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,109
Exactly, they were stylish,
and very painful to wear.

430
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,909
Only an incredibly shallow and
insecure woman would rather be in

431
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,619
pain all day long then wear a
decent looking, comfortable shoe,

432
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,959
and that's exactly the type
I don't need around here.

433
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,320
No, someone who can handle a lot of pain
is exactly the type you do need.

434
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,590
Excuse me.

435
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
What are you doing?

436
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,630
I'm ultrasounding your head.

437
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,439
You're still having seizures.

438
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,280
This should help us
figure out what's going on.

439
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,569
Blue form to the security guard.

440
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,170
You're not going to be
happy with anyone.

441
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,860
So what, your advice is...

442
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,789
hire someone I'm not
happy with and be happy?

443
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,740
No, my advice is much more subtle.
Stop being an ass.

444
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,039
You always find some tiny little flaw
to push people away.

445
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,029
Now it's people. I thought we were
talking about fellowship applicants.

446
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,269
You have a history of this.

447
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,269
Well, when I do decide
to push you away,

448
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,119
I hope there's a small
person kneeling behind you

449
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,760
so you fall down and hurt your head.

450
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,580
Take these, there's water over there,
blue form to the guard, and you're done.

451
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,800
You had the perfect person,
and you blew it.

452
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,589
You saw the shoes!

453
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,630
I'm not talking about her.

454
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,339
You're talking about Cameron.

455
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,299
I'm talking about every woman
you've ever given a damn about.

456
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,700
Cameron is so not perfect.

457
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,760
Well, nobody's perfect.

458
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,700
- Mother Teresa?
- Dead.

459
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,069
- Angelina Jolie?
- No medical degree.

460
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,249
Now who's being picky?

461
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,880
You're going to
wind up alone, House.

462
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,009
You were right, there's a significant
bleed in her temporal lobe.

463
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,159
No poisons. Did a tox screen on her blood,

464
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,880
urine and hair,
nothing. Did 'em twice.

465
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,220
He's a little dehydrated,

466
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:13,969
put him on a
saline drip and give him some orange juice.

467
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,240
I need an operating room
and a neuro surgeon.

468
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,279
Oh, well, given the current
crisis I'm tempted to say

469
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,439
no, but since you've been
so sweet to me today...

470
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,020
Our little mermaid is bleeding
into her temporal lobe.

471
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,069
How fast can you have her prepped?

472
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,800
20 minutes.

473
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,361
You'll have a surgeon
in the room in 10.

474
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,909
Mr. And Mrs. Carroll?

475
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,960
Are you Dr. House?

476
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,860
This is Dr. Foreman.

477
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,350
Is Mary all right?

478
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,960
The operation went well.

479
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,840
The intercranial pressure's been relieved
and the swelling's already going down.

480
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,070
Thank God.

481
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,270
Well, what happened?

482
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:03,999
Did she bang her head
at a meet, or did she...

483
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,340
No, nothing like that.

484
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,680
Then why is she bleeding?

485
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,300
Is she going to be all right?

486
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,270
We're sorry, we still don't know.

487
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,839
No toxins, no tumor,
no bone cancer.

488
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,359
Adrenal failure could cause
the rash, fever and muscle pain.

489
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,069
Maybe it's some sort of
genetic kidney disorder.

490
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,539
No family history, and
no blood in her urine or uremia...

491
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Not yet.

492
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,499
You want to do a differential based
on symptoms that might happen?

493
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,679
You got a better idea?

494
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Stop it.

495
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,519
Stop looking for things we don't know
and focus on what we do know.

496
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,940
What do we actually know
besides what's up there?

497
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,569
Come on, how hard can it be to
tell me what you already know?

498
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,500
She's 12.

499
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:11,269
She spends a lot of time at the pool,
so exposure to chemicals.

500
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,509
She travels a lot.

501
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,510
But never out of the country.

502
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,510
What else?

503
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,370
Come on!

504
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,600
We're missing something.

505
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,380
What?

506
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,640
Well, if I knew that
it wouldn't be missing.

507
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,399
Maybe she's adopted and
we've got the wrong history.

508
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,020
No, she's got her mom's eyes
and a red patch of hair just like dad.

509
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,749
What about an allergic reaction?

510
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,020
Could explain the rash and muscle pain,
but not the bleeding or seizures.

511
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,030
That's a lot of balloons.

512
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,580
Think she's allergic to polyester?

513
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,860
Not unless she's been competing
in the nude all these years.

514
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,100
Then what are you thinking?
What do the balloons mean?

515
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,070
What if the rash isn't a rash?

516
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,870
What are you talking about?

517
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,200
Who gave her the balloons?

518
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,169
Some of the girls from her team.

519
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,789
They've been visiting her pretty regularly,
but none of them are sick.

520
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,909
What about the guys?

521
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,139
None of them are sick either.

522
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,230
Which guys visited her?

523
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,790
Actually, none.

524
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,680
She's cute, she's nice,
she's a kick-ass diver.

525
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,239
You'd think the guys would be falling
over themselves to get close to her.

526
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,379
She's 12.
The youngest guy on her team is 16.

527
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,950
Okay, so maybe they're
just not interested. Or...

528
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
They're avoiding her.

529
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,140
There any cell fragments
in her blood smears?

530
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,980
No, red blood cells were intact.

531
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,310
Check 'em again.

532
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,700
Blood looks like it's been
put through the blender, now.

533
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,360
You done yet?

534
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:30,159
You were right. Rash wasn't a rash,
she's bleeding into her skin. It's purpura.

535
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,599
Thrombocytopenia purpura?

536
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,289
Starts with T.
You were so close.

537
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,749
What could have set it off?

538
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,769
She had no trace of
E. Coli in her cultures,

539
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,280
she's obviously not
menopausal, so no estrogen.

540
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,500
There is one other possible cause.

541
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,190
Oh, God.

542
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,490
Pregnancy cause all kinds of chemical
and biological changes in a woman's body.

543
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,830
Or a girl's body, as the case may be.

544
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,530
In extremely rare cases,
everything goes haywire. It's called TTP.

545
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Blood starts clotting like crazy, clogs
the vessels in your brain and kidneys.

546
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,199
Red blood cells end up
getting shredded as they

547
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,680
squeeze past the clot like
a fat guy in a crowed bar.

548
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,140
I'm sure you know what that's like.

549
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,170
You're only 12,
but you're all grown up, right?

550
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,400
Travel on your own,
hang out in hotel rooms

551
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,730
getting room service
with your teammates,

552
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,959
maybe someone sneaks
in a couple of beers,

553
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,689
you start playing spin the bottle...

554
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,170
next thing you know you're waking up
in nothing but your socks.

555
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,650
It wasn't like that.

556
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,700
Of course not. You wanted it.

557
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,459
Yeah, I did.
He turned out to be a jerk, but...

558
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,130
Actually, under New Jersey law
the term is 'felon'.

559
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:02,610
I knew what I was doing.

560
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,370
We're going to have to do
something called plasmapheresis.

561
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,690
It cleans the antibodies
from your blood.

562
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,400
We're also going to have to
terminate the pregnancy.

563
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,040
You're going to tell my parents?

564
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,890
Someone should.
Rock paper scissors?

565
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,860
They don't need to know.
I'll be all right.

566
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Of course you will.

567
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,260
If you're old enough to
bleed out of your vagina,

568
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,699
obviously you're mature enough
to handle a simple thing

569
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,820
like an abortion without
Mommy and Daddy's help.

570
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,440
You're going to tell my parents?

571
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,640
Under New Jersey law,
you're the boss.

572
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,910
Your daughter has TTP.

573
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,170
Don't worry,
it's curable, she'll be fine.

574
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,380
Well, wait! What does TTP stand for?

575
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,599
Some really big words that
you've never heard before

576
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,639
and when we're done we'll never
hear again. Have a nice day.

577
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,250
Well, when can we take her home?

578
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,099
Uh, in a few days.

579
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,650
She needs some minor surgery to remove the
underlying cause before we can do the...

580
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,469
another really big word.

581
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,210
What's the underlying cause?

582
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,949
She has an abnormal growth
in her abdomen.

583
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,109
What kind of surgery?

584
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,300
It's very simple.
We do it here all the time.

585
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,859
Could you be a little more specific?

586
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,040
Actually, no.

587
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Almost done.

589
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,790
Hang in there.

590
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,230
You're doing good.

591
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,190
Feeling okay?

592
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,600
Yeah.

593
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,970
You should be,
your platelet count's up.

594
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
How's your neck?

595
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Looks good.

596
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,000
Anything else we can get you?

597
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
No thanks.

598
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,690
Okay.

599
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Yeah.

600
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,510
Can I see my mom and dad?

601
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,440
Plasmapheresis is working,
she's going to be fine.

602
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
I know.

603
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,310
- Hi.
- I got these.

604
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,079
I checked all down the hall. It was
pretty much clear, you do the cleaning?

605
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Yeah.

606
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,210
I can't even tell you how much I appreciate
the opportunity to meet with you.

607
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,429
The moment I heard you had
another fellowship opening, I...

608
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,430
There is no opening.

609
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,500
House, you have to hire someone.

610
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,820
I know.

611
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,570
The position's been filled.

612
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,709
Why am I interviewing for a position
that's already been filled?

613
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,710
Exactly.

614
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,880
I called to confirm
the interview this morning.

615
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,999
You figure if you keep arguing

616
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,770
I'm gonna cave, admit it's
all a lie, and hire you?

617
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,800
Do you need your
parking validated?

618
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,120
I don't want to interview anyone else.

619
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,890
You're interviewing?

620
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,720
I thought you'd just have them
send a headshot along with their CV.

621
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
That's good.

622
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,800
And why I need you around.
To keep me in my place.

623
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,530
I can't come back,
I told you that.

624
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,590
Wasn't listening.

625
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Right.

626
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,790
You want me to listen to you more?
I can do that.

627
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,010
Right. I already accepted
a position somewhere else.

628
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
With who?

629
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,680
Yule, at Jefferson.

630
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,090
Unaccept it.

631
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Why?

632
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,090
Because Yule is boring.

633
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,320
He's pedantic and preachy.

634
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Because he's short.

635
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,630
Because I want you to come back.

636
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,470
Not good enough.

637
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
Want more money?

638
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,820
A car allowance,
better parking space?

639
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,370
Dinner.

640
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,280
And not just a meal
between two colleagues.

641
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,570
A date.

642
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,860
You'll come back to work
if I go out on a date with you?

643
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Yes.

644
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,030
Okay,

645
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
it's a deal.

646
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,940
See you tomorrow morning.

647
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,610
Don't be late.

648
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:19,990
I won't.
