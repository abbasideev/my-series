1
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,663
It's all about the tongue, man.

2
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:06,575
You stick it in their mouth.

3
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:09,748
Not all the way.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,497
They like that?

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,180
Dude, they love it.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,370
What're you doing?

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:17,703
Climbing.

8
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,671
Just deep enough to lick her teeth.

9
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:24,768
Slow, one at a time.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,243
Like you're painting them.

11
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:30,947
This girl, Rachel?
She's a junior, she's experienced.

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,972
Mom says I gotta be home by five!

13
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:36,359
Just chill, okay, and hop the fence
before someone sees you!

14
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,638
- Are you sure this is okay?
- Dave's mom's a realtor.

15
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,649
If it's for sale, and empty,
it's a clubhouse.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,520
And if you say anything, you're dead.

17
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:55,077
I told them you were cool.

18
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,767
These are very serious dudes.

19
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:06,386
Cub scout meeting's down the street, boys.

20
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,319
Oh, loser.

21
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,173
Gabe's cool, man.
He's one of us.

22
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:15,824
He better be.

23
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:22,571
Uh... I'm not thirsty.

24
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:25,727
What's this?

25
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:27,340
Club business, little man.

26
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:30,022
Put your hands on.

27
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:37,620
Oh, dark spirit!
Will any of us die in the year to come?

28
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:45,754
- You're moving it!
- Put your hands back.

29
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:48,389
Now.

30
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:56,161
Who among us will die?

31
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,261
G...

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,770
A...

33
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,192
Oh, man.

34
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,076
B...

35
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,890
E.

36
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,774
Gabe.

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,427
That blows.

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,990
That's it.
We're going to the hospital.

39
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,193
No, Mom. I'm too tired.

40
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,219
Oh.

41
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:54,530
Oh, my God! Gabe! Are you okay?

42
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,116
Baby, what's wrong?

43
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,406
I'm dying.

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,770
12 year old male, spiking
fever, congested chest,

45
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,379
coughing up green sputum,
pain in breathing...

46
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,110
Baffling.

47
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,230
Though I vaguely recall a disease
called noomonia, numania?

48
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,159
But his X-ray and CT scan show an
atypical patten for pneumonia.

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,580
Pneumonia! That's it.

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,500
Just a guess here, but are
his parents big donors?

51
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,320
No infiltrate!
Just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,870
Tiny unicorns goring his
bronchial tubes would be cooler.

53
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,640
And the way you're ignoring my question...

54
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,160
Wow, they're extremely big donors.

55
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,789
He's not responding to cefuroxime,

56
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,950
his pulsox is dropping much faster
than it should for pneumonia,

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,690
and plus, he's got an odd little rash.

58
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,220
Excessive irritation.
He's 12, he's on auto-stroke...

59
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,390
On his arm.

60
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,840
Papular lesion, one centimeter,
on top of a long thin scab.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,230
Ah, you need a dermatologist.

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,289
If it's dry, keep it wet,
if it's wet, keep it dry,

63
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,929
if it's not supposed
to be there, cut it off.

64
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,430
I never could master all of that.

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,360
There you are.

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,700
Are you scared?
It's okay. You're home now.

67
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
Fine.

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Cuddy.

69
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,070
As a special favor to you...

70
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,380
No! Admit it, I got you with the rash.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,310
The rash is a total snooze.

72
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,620
Unless it's connected to the pneumonia,

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,300
then it's party time.

74
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,620
Purulent sputum, dyspnea,
bronchi bilaterally.

75
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,780
What causes this kind of rash?

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,010
Legionnaire's disease?

77
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,949
Usually means industrial
ventilation systems,

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,730
convention centers.
He's twelve years old.

79
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,349
Send off a urine antigen and check
if he's joined the Elks. Next?

80
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,970
Fungal.

81
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:32,390
Excellent. Maybe the Elks went spelunking.

82
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,430
Chlamydia and pneumonia.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,850
Twelve year olds don't have sex.

84
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,390
Their mistake.

85
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,340
That's it? Other possibilities?

86
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,399
What if you're thinking
about this backwards?

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,980
The rash came first, caused
the pneumonia. Nice.

88
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,909
Rickettsial. Tick bites.

89
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,890
Nymphal ticks are out now,
they're bloodthirsty little bastards.

90
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,499
Rash would be more pustular.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,580
Not always. And there's
only one rash, which fits.

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,390
New Jersey, it's most likely Lyme disease.

93
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,930
All right. Let's keep him on
fluids and cefuroxime to be safe.

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,499
And biopsy that rash.
And take another history.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,869
Even if we don't learn out what's
causing this we definitely

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,250
need to know if 12 year olds
are getting any action.

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,660
What are you doing now?

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,859
We're collecting fluids from the rash.

99
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,670
Why?

100
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,016
They know what they're doing, Jeffery.

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,659
Oh, great endorsement coming from the woman
who thought it was a nasty cold.

102
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,200
- If I'd had him last week and...
- This isn't helping.

103
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,030
We're checking to see
if your son has a tick bite.

104
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,160
Gabe, have you been camping recently?
Playing sports outside, anything like that?

105
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,820
I'm not that good at sports.

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,689
No hanging out anywhere new?

107
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,876
- Strange places?
- We've been through this.

108
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,430
We don't let him run wild through
the neighborhood. Right?

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,350
Okay, this might be a bit delicate.

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,749
We need to know if you're sexually active.

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,869
I beg your pardon?
Who do you think my son...

112
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,290
- Mr. Reillich, we need to...
- No!

113
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,030
Nothing like that.

114
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,010
We've got to get another CT
scan, check his lungs again.

115
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,579
Third floor, right?

116
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,430
- Yeah, Radiology is just...
- Sorry, medical personnel only.

117
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,919
Where's the machine?

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,500
We passed it, actually.

119
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,740
Little tension in the room back there.
Thought you could use a break.

120
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,309
Your dad's a pretty high-powered guy.

121
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,050
Yeah. He was an Air Force test pilot.

122
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,920
Real top-gun stuff.
Flew a Mach 3.

123
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,290
Hard to deal with, sometimes?

124
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,010
I guess I'm more like my mom.

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,110
Listen, I promised to keep my mouth shut,
but I need to know.

126
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,890
You definitely haven't had any
sexual contact of any kind?

127
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,070
I wish.

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,700
Know what?
Girls like the cool guys now.

129
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,530
You give it a few years,
they start liking the smart guys.

130
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
You'll be all right.

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,730
Can you keep a secret?

132
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,650
I have to, it's my job.

133
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,239
I'm cursed. I'm not kidding.

134
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,330
This seance thing the kids did?

135
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,510
It spelled out my name,
said I was gonna die.

136
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,330
First name and last name?

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,869
We've got a Gabe upstairs.
He's very old, very sick.

138
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,460
No! It's me.
I have the worst luck.

139
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,360
One time, I broke this mirror.

140
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,950
The next week,
my parents got separated.

141
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,980
My parents got split up, too.

142
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,280
Every kid feels like it's
his fault, it never is.

143
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,900
So what about the rest of the stuff?

144
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,380
Any playing outside that your parents
don't know about, anything like that?

145
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,140
Maybe you were somewhere
you weren't supposed to be?

146
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,560
Oh, man.

147
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,870
Gabe, it's important.

148
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,630
Secret club.

149
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,250
What's the secret,
they're all morons?

150
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,530
He fell on something in the attic,
scraped his arm, got the rash the next day.

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,430
Said it smelled really moldy up there.

152
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,460
Fungal pneumonia without the cave.
Clever.

153
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm gonna get a sample.

154
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,490
Dr. Chase.
You have a few moments.

155
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,710
Sorry, I've gotta go.

156
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,120
These young doctors.

157
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,770
It's like they don't care about people.
No manners.

158
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,520
My fault, probably.

159
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,330
That's an interesting
accent you have there.

160
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,470
I'd say Czech, with about
thirty years of Aussie.

161
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,180
You have quite an ear.

162
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,530
You're Chase's dad.

163
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,190
Hard to miss, you know, the big hug
and how happy he was to see you.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,540
Need a consult.

165
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,380
With a patient.

166
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,910
Urgent doctor stuff.

167
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,859
26-year-old male,
sudden loss of the ability to speak...

168
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,319
Just because you got out of clinic duty
doesn't mean everybody did.

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,090
To his father.
Differential diagnosis?

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Chase?

171
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,050
Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out.

172
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,909
Dad say why he was here?

173
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,460
See? You asked.

174
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,090
Dad comes 5000 miles and
you're more curious than Junior is.

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,440
Can't just be about the divorce.

176
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,270
It's been fifteen years and
mom's been dead for ten of them.

177
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,280
You think Daddy murdered her?

178
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,146
You want to get to the bottom of this,
you're doing it exactly right.

179
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,389
Don't talk to the people
involved, drag your buddy

180
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,619
away from work for some
pointless speculation.

181
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,420
You want to know how two chemicals
interact, do you ask them?

182
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,730
No, they're going to lie
through their lying little chemical teeth.

183
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,180
Throw them in a beaker and apply heat.

184
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,730
Even I don't like you.

185
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,200
You know, words can hurt!

186
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, guys,
I don't care that you're up here!

187
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,440
You a cop?

188
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,660
Doctor. I'm treating Gabe Reillich.

189
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,190
He said he fell over near some pipes?

190
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,470
Yeah, over there.

191
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
What, here?

192
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Yeah.

193
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,440
Right, any of you guys
been feeling sick lately?

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,749
Rash, cold, anything?

195
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,750
No.

196
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,969
Oh, crap. He is a cop!

197
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,970
Damn it!

198
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,420
He fell on it.
Some weird kind of insulation.

199
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,130
It's old, house was built in the sixties.

200
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,820
What's it made of?

201
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,500
Felt. Fibers are made of what, cotton?

202
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,330
Sorry, forgotten how funny your dad was.

203
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,020
Not as funny as you.

204
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,270
High praise.

205
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,190
I know how protective kids
can be of their parents.

206
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,630
Not cotton, animal hair.

207
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,530
Get me the CT scan.

208
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,580
First, find the name of company
that made the insulation

209
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,950
and second, tell me what I'm seeing that
makes me want to short their stock.

210
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,680
Uh, enlarged hilar lymph nodes.

211
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,010
Parabronchial thickening.

212
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Purile effusions.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,530
Less obvious, more scary.

214
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,360
Well, the mediastinum doesn't look right.

215
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,610
Slightly widened.

216
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,170
Oh God, it can be transmitted
through infected animal hair.

217
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,449
But the gram stain would have shown...

218
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,910
No, the cefuroxime would have killed
some of it, clouded the result.

219
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,610
We've gotta get this kid on levaquin.

220
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,140
What does he have?

221
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Anthrax.

222
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,090
This house belonged to old man Hussein?

223
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,200
Maybe he is cursed.

224
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,869
Anthrax. So, what, you think
there were terrorists in that attic?

225
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,909
It's a naturally occurring bacteria.

226
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,760
We believe it was in the insulation.

227
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
How sick is he?

228
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,240
Anthrax is very dangerous,
but we've caught it early.

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,550
He's on levaquin,
it's the best antibiotic we have.

230
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,590
Lisa, you buy this?

231
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,040
Jeff, you've helped our hospital a lot.

232
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,659
I wouldn't have assigned Dr. House to your
case if I didn't have every confidence in...

233
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
Then who's this guy?

234
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,650
Jeffery!

235
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,929
There's all these weird
diseases that can cause a rash.

236
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,170
What about leishmaniasis
and filariasis?

237
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,560
Where'd you hear about those?

238
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,909
The internet. I did some research.

239
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,710
Well, those are very rare conditions.

240
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,679
Oh, and anthrax grows
along the interstate?

241
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,179
Leishmaniasis doesn't cause
pneumonia and filariasis...

242
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,089
Just look into everything,
this is my son, all right?

243
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,489
And I'm going to stay on top of you
until I know he's safe.

244
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,000
I wouldn't expect anything else.

245
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,640
Everyone's a doctor.

246
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,519
Breathe, baby. It's okay.

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Breathe, honey.

248
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,520
His breathing! It's on the inhale!

249
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,170
What does that mean?

250
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,940
It means his airway's closing up.

251
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,820
Is the anthrax doing it?

252
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,900
All right, hold still, Gabe.
This is going to be a little uncomfortable.

253
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,780
We've got you, it's okay.

254
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,430
Two nodules in his throat.

255
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Airway's inhibited?

256
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,240
We've got to intubate. Ativan!

257
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,640
Pushing 3 ccs.

258
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,690
Airway's too tight.

259
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,566
What's wrong? What's wrong?
No. You're killing him!

260
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,469
Jeffery! Jeffery, let them do their job!

261
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,120
Airway's too tight,
get me a smaller tube.

262
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,980
We're traching.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Smaller tube!

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
His lips are cyanotic.

265
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,110
Oh my God, he's not breathing.

266
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:01,300
Foreman! We're traching!

267
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,080
No, I can do it, I'll get it.

268
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,880
Foreman, you're not getting through!

269
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,990
He's not getting air.

270
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,270
Oh, we have to trach him right now.

271
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
- No, I can do it.
- Betadine.

272
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,260
I'm doing this.

273
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,630
Got it!

274
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,170
He's okay.

275
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,039
Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?

276
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,120
I don't think so.

277
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,200
We switched him to rifampin and
there was no change in swelling.

278
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,090
We should try another antibiotic...

279
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,360
You really think he's
allergic to two antibiotics?

280
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,310
I want to know what Dr. Chase thinks.

281
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,409
It's possible to think he's
allergic to both anti...

282
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,970
Oh, I'm sorry! Not you.

283
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,390
Understandable mistake.
The other Dr. Chase.

284
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,850
Boy gets anthrax, but happens to
be allergic to two antibiotics.

285
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,740
Hate to step on anybody's toes, but is it
possible that your guys got this one wrong?

286
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,099
The rash is classic anthrax.

287
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,070
Except the color.

288
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,990
The rash hasn't turned black yet.
No necrosis, no anthrax.

289
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,130
Necrosis can theoretically take
as long as two weeks.

290
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, it's not a competition!

291
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,340
It's a diagnosis! Okay.
Who thinks Junior wins?

292
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,220
Four to one, it's not anthrax.

293
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,749
So we start over, what's changed?

294
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,250
What do the nodules tell us?

295
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,750
Sarcoidosis.

296
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,880
Excellent. Send an ACE level.

297
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,910
If it comes back positive,
put him on methotrexate.

298
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,910
We ran some tests, and
the results point toward sarcoidosis.

299
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,860
It makes the body's tissue swell up.

300
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,480
It seems to have gone after Gabriel's skin
and lungs, and given him this fever.

301
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Doctor.

302
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,350
We don't know what causes it.

303
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,310
But you're sure he has this one.

304
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,460
We have a world-renowned doctor consulting.

305
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,730
He's convinced this is sarcoidosis.

306
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,730
Is it treatable?

307
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,580
Very, actually.
See, this is IV methotrexate.

308
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,230
It's an anti-inflammatory,

309
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,940
which should make all the swelling go down,
and get you all better.

310
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,710
Stop!

311
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,680
My God, it's black.

312
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,130
Necrosis.

313
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,150
It's definitely anthrax,
and it definitely can't be anthrax.

314
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,750
It doesn't cause throat nodules.

315
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,869
The only explanation is
this kid has got anthrax and sarcoidosis!

316
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,340
Right, two incredibly rare diseases
just happening to strike at once.

317
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,239
Unless you've got a better theory.

318
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,999
Anthrax plus an allergic reaction.

319
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,629
Call the Lancet, because
that's one bizarre allergic reaction.

320
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,200
Come on, there's no reason
you both can't be wrong.

321
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,769
It's not allergy,
but it's not coincidence, either.

322
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,100
Disease number one set
off disease number two.

323
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,700
Anthrax weakened his immune system.

324
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,840
And triggered a dormant sarcoidosis.

325
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,449
Keep him on antibiotics
for the anthrax and

326
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,319
start him on methotrexate
for the sarcoidosis.

327
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
See what happens.

328
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,450
Fine.

329
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,890
Better go with him.

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,010
Make sure he doesn't
snap and hurt somebody.

331
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,330
You... you're treating
him for both diseases?

332
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,870
We're covering all the bases.

333
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,530
What, throw everything against
the wall and see what sticks?

334
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,710
Works for spaghetti.

335
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,010
Are you being funny?

336
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,320
Apparently not.

337
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,160
You know why I give money to this hospital?

338
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,830
It's the only way to get attention.
You see this?

339
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,119
Is this a magic trick?

340
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,549
Because I am a total David Copperfield fan,

341
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,779
although that "Tornado of Fire",
that seemed a little fake...

342
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,200
Pain in the wrist.
Won't go away for months.

343
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,160
Six doctors' brilliant
conclusion is to take it easy.

344
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,609
I write a check, name goes on a plaque,
and forty-eight hours later

345
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,080
I've got two MRis, a bone scan,
and a diagnosis: Carpal tunnel.

346
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm in surgery that afternoon.

347
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,460
Fascinating story.

348
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,870
You thought of adapting it for the stage?

349
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,920
I love my... look at me! Love my son, I love
him more than anything else in the world,

350
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,670
and you're going to start
paying attention to this case,

351
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,549
- or I'm going to make things miserable for...
- Go back to your son's room.

352
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,370
I'm not leaving here until you

353
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,171
- get your ass in gear...
- There's a problem.

354
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,180
What is it?

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I don't know.

356
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,060
Skin lesions are spreading
all over his body.

357
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,480
They're opening and the fatty
tissues are oozing out.

358
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,380
He'll be septic in a matter of days.

359
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,300
Death by dermatitis.

360
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Where's Robert?

361
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,039
He has clinic duty this morning.

362
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,620
No, he doesn't.
I rescheduled you guys...

363
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,550
- so you'd be free.
- Yeah, but he re-rescheduled himself.

364
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,530
It doesn't hurt yet.

365
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Keep going.

366
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,900
You page me?

367
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
No, I don't need you.

368
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,669
Oh, come on.
We all need help now and again.

369
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,360
You're getting a consult.

370
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,159
Okay, we've got new skin lesions, bigger
and uglier. What would cause that?

371
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,329
My hand hurts.

372
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,129
What if his body worked so hard attacking the
anthrax that it started attacking itself?

373
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,040
Auto-immune.

374
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,530
Wouldn't present this aggressively.

375
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,529
It's not likely, but it is possible.

376
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,300
What, in a twelve-year-old male?

377
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,140
This isn't about me, is it?

378
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,899
Gabe's dad found leishmaniasis and
filariasis on the internet yesterday.

379
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,940
They didn't fit then, but
now they kind of do.

380
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,250
Sure, except for the nodules and
we're not working out of Calcutta General.

381
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,080
Multiple neurofibromatosis.

382
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,740
You think this is neurological?

383
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,650
The only reason you're thinking auto-immune
is because you're a rheumatologist!

384
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,050
If you were a proctologist
you'd think rectal cancer.

385
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,990
Gotta go with Senior.

386
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,540
He literally wrote the book with this one.

387
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,129
Auto-immune is a big universe.

388
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,809
It could be anything from
scleroderma to churg-strauss.

389
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,310
Whatever it is, we should start him
on steroids, keep the swelling down.

390
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,050
And 100 mg. Of cytoxan, it
treats most auto-immunes.

391
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,140
We'll give it to him now, before the
fat starts dripping out his eyeballs.

392
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,430
Hey! My fingers are numb!

393
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,610
Your watch is on too tight.

394
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,010
You're messing with my head.

395
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,329
Your relationship with your dad is messing
with your ability to do your job.

396
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,520
Only because you made
my dad part of my job.

397
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,480
Good point.

398
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,879
Haven't seen him in years,
he flies across the Atlantic to see you...

399
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,650
Pacific.

400
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,029
You breeze by him like he's a
Hare Krishna at the airport.

401
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,530
You don't even ask why he's in town.

402
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,370
It's probably a conference.

403
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,060
Probably.

404
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,609
I was hoping to do this
by sheer manipulation,

405
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,460
but if you insist on
talking, fine, talk.

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,170
What did he do to you?

407
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,580
How would you feel
if I interfered in your personal life?

408
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,710
I'd hate it. That's why I
cleverly have no personal life.

409
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,910
I'm going to biopsy his skin lesions.

410
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,920
Good thinking! Prove your dad wrong.
That'll solve everything.

411
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,359
Who extubated him?

412
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,490
I did. Temperature's down two degrees
and the swelling's almost gone.

413
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,270
And his skin looks better, too.

414
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,740
The cytoxan is working.

415
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,070
Feeling better, Gabe?

416
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,910
Yup, a lot.

417
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,750
Dr. Chase, can you and I have a word?

418
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,700
Your diagnosis is wrong.
No auto-immune disease.

419
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,629
The swelling's probably just down
because we've got him on steroids.

420
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,330
It's masking whatever's really wrong.

421
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,789
ANAs are unreliable.

422
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,710
Phospholipid antibodies are
negative, so no lupus.

423
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,060
Same for churg-strauss.

424
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,450
You're arguing with a rheumatologist.

425
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,529
There's about twenty distinct
auto-immune diseases...

426
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,960
Why are you here?

427
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,480
SLE conference.

428
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,659
You were in New York last
year for the scleroderma

429
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,430
conference, I didn't
hear anything from you.

430
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,520
Just wanted to say hi this time.

431
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,590
You said it, you're still here.

432
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,120
I miss you.

433
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,080
I was 15 years old
when you walked out.

434
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,400
Now you're walking back in?

435
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,320
I left your mother.
I didn't leave you.

436
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,749
Mum was living on gin and tonics,
how was I supposed to take care of her?

437
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,090
- She wasn't your responsibility.
- I know! She was yours.

438
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,080
I'm sorry she died.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.

439
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,540
But she was falling apart long before...

440
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,650
I've got to talk to House
about this treatment.

441
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,970
But the patient's getting better.

442
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,170
In spite of the cytoxan.

443
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,359
On the other hand, getting better.

444
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,440
Cytoxan makes him more
susceptible to infection.

445
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,359
The anthrax could relapse
and be more resistant.

446
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Better!

447
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,330
You want a negative test for
every auto-immune disease known to man?

448
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,300
Fine, I'll get them!

449
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,650
Be home by midnight or
he can't have the car this weekend.

450
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,740
You guys talk?
Did he tell you why he's here?

451
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,370
The SLE conference.

452
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,600
Going back to the conference?

453
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,740
Afternoon panel.
I hope I can stay awake.

454
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,700
I hope you can get in.
You're not registered.

455
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,860
I get it. You had to make up a lie.

456
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,560
Can't just tell your kid
you're here to see him.

457
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,470
What father does that?

458
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,060
That little blue dot under your collar.

459
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,830
It's a tattoo for guiding
radiation treatment.

460
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,969
I was looking for it after I saw
what you had for breakfast:

461
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,730
Brown rice and vegetables,
macrobiotic diet.

462
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,200
Popular with Hollywood
starlets and cancer patients.

463
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,630
Lungs, stage four.

464
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,510
You look good.

465
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,310
I'm not.

466
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,750
Came to the States to go to
Sloan-Kettering, and to see Dr. Wilson.

467
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,970
What'd he say?

468
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,670
Three months.

469
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,990
But you haven't told Robert.

470
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,380
You don't want to burden him
because you were such a lousy dad.

471
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,340
I'd prefer you not tell him.

472
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,110
Yeah, it's better.

473
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,790
I'll get to see his face
when he reads his dad's obituary.

474
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,770
It's not your business.

475
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,070
I suppose it isn't.

476
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,660
You sure do a lot a tests.

477
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,869
If we figure out exactly
which auto-immune

478
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,200
condition it is, we can
get you better quicker.

479
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,580
Was that your dad before?

480
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,470
Yeah.

481
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,250
That's so cool.
Do you guys work together a lot?

482
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,370
Not really.

483
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,530
When can I go home?

484
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,169
We'll see. Looks like you
got your appetite back.

485
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,170
That's a good sign.

486
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,869
Want some water?

487
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,870
Yes.

488
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,400
Okay.

489
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,959
Whoops.
It's all right. Water's cheap.

490
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,030
Oh, God.

491
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
What?

492
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,630
I can't, I can't move my hand.

493
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,960
Squeeze my fingers for me, Gabe?

494
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,689
He's getting worse.

495
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,289
Now his entire right hand
and forearm are paralyzed.

496
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,140
And his fever's back,
it's back over 105.

497
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,510
If we don't stop the nerve deterioration
quickly, he'll be paralyzed for life.

498
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,260
Well, luckily, at this rate,
that should only last about a week.

499
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,810
Okay, so...

500
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:31,010
I told you we should get
him off the cytoxan.

501
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,290
This is toxic neuropathy.

502
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,259
We've been shoving drugs into his system
for a disease he doesn't have!

503
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,110
Well, it could be neurological.

504
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,009
What kind of brain process
would cause a paralyzed hand

505
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,900
skin lesions, and
swollen throat nodules?

506
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,990
Robert was right.

507
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,389
You said multiple neurofibromatosis.

508
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,409
Are you saying that for
the chance of a beautiful

509
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,790
family moment, or is there
some medicine involved?

510
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,210
Fits better.

511
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,540
Too bad. I was hoping for the other reason.

512
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,460
I was gonna go get my camera.

513
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,720
Get a CT scan. His brain this time.

514
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,910
You think three copies
will be enough, right?

515
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,920
One's always been more than enough for me.

516
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,640
Why didn't you tell me that
Rowan Chase was in to see you?

517
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,650
Excuse me.

518
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,570
Ethics, confidentiality?
Does any of this ring a bell?

519
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,350
You could have covered yourself.
Called me in for a consult.

520
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,490
It is a juicy piece of gossip.

521
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,720
You know what happened?

522
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,780
I got all focused on his cancer
and lost perspective.

523
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,720
You can't tell Chase, but I can.

524
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,870
What should I do?

525
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,059
Oh! This is where I give
you advice and

526
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,220
pretend you're going to listen to it.
I like this part.

527
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,950
Did Rowan ask you not to tell?

528
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,310
I promised I wouldn't.

529
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,640
My fingers were crossed,
though, so I'm wide open.

530
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,790
I was wrong! This is the
musing-out-loud part!

531
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,220
Do I actually need to be here?

532
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,250
Telling him,
now that's got real entertainment value.

533
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,090
Hmmm, he might even cry.

534
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,090
On the other hand,
there is the "do unto others" thingy.

535
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,750
Then I should definitely tell him!
I'd want to know.

536
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,950
You want to know everything.

537
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,820
There's also the "keeping
your promises" thingy.

538
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,300
Oh, you never run out of thingies.

539
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,890
Like that blonde thing
you were chatting up.

540
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,680
She's the hospital accountant!

541
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,460
We were going over billing procedures!

542
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,260
Double-entry bookkeeping?

543
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,810
What are you going to do?

544
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,430
Billing procedures.

545
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,970
They're so complicated, aren't they?

546
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,540
You know, parents are never
as bad as kids think they are.

547
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,750
You like my dad so much, ask him out.

548
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,130
I'd make an excellent
step-mom, I'm very lenient.

549
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,850
He's your father, you never
see him, and he's here.

550
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,350
Unless he's done some unspeakable thing,
you should lighten up.

551
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,340
Right, thanks for the tip.

552
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
Okay.

553
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,970
He beat your mom. He beat you.

554
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,780
What did he do?

555
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:24,630
Really, don't push it.

556
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,010
All this hate. It's toxic.

557
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,330
Then stay away.

558
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,910
There's nothing there.

559
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,970
No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.

560
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,410
It's not neurofibromatosis.

561
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,230
Drs. Chase are 0 for 3.

562
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,790
Even when they agree they're wrong.

563
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,130
So, next. What else could cause neural
damage as well as all the nodules?

564
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,030
Burger's disease.

565
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,239
He's never been out of the country.

566
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,320
Have his parents?
They could have brought it back.

567
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,930
- I don't think so.
- Doesn't matter.

568
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,776
His lesions are in the wrong place,
his feet are the one clear spot.

569
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,949
Kid's dad mentioned leishmaniasis.

570
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,239
Yeah, and filariasis, but the throat
nodules still don't fit with that.

571
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,640
Two diseases pretty much exclusive
to Southeast Asia.

572
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,430
What if the anthrax didn't
set off the second disease?

573
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,239
We're back at coincidence again?

574
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,089
No. What if something else was the trigger?

575
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,479
Nothing else happened.

576
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,540
We happened.

577
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,600
Antibiotics?

578
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,810
We've been through this,
it's not an allergy.

579
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,650
I've gotta pee.

580
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,740
What did the CT scan tell you?

581
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,010
Nothing.

582
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,789
On a scale of one to ten, how painful?

583
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,876
About half as painful as when
I punch you in the face.

584
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,980
Don't do that. It'll hurt you.

585
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,549
Carpal tunnel surgery
obviously didn't work.

586
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,629
Who are you?

587
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,950
The little ones call me Uncle Gregg.

588
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,610
Your dad never had carpal tunnel.

589
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,039
You mentioned two obscure
diseases to Dr. Chase.

590
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,069
How'd you know about them?

591
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,629
I read about them on the internet.

592
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,520
So, what'd you search for?

593
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,139
"Diseases from Asia that don't
match my son's symptoms"?

594
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,360
You heard about them in Asia.

595
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,410
I've never been there.

596
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,800
Well, you probably just forgot.

597
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,310
Let me refresh your memory.

598
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,099
Some remote, dusty village, close quarters,
at least a year... starting to come back?

599
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,490
I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.

600
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,740
Excuse me, what does this
have to do with our son?

601
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,660
Your dad's pissed off.
He should be.

602
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,429
Comes here, expecting us to
do an extra good job because

603
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,390
he gives a whole lot of
money to this hospital...

604
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,666
Don't talk to my son like that!

605
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,579
Just telling him my job,
my obligation to this...

606
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,810
Stop! What's going on?

607
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,170
There's only one thing that
you guys have got to do.

608
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,090
Tell the truth, or your son will die.

609
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,290
How long were you in Asia?

610
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,970
Jeff, it's a simple question.

611
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,780
Two years, in India.

612
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,109
Why would you lie about
something like that?

613
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,050
It was '87 and '88.

614
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,710
This, uh, this guru,
I thought he had some answers.

615
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:53,890
I went to his ashram, and,
ended up with no money and no answers.

616
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,700
I was embarrassed,
I didn't want anybody to know.

617
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,550
No. No, you were a test pilot.

618
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,210
I'm so sorry, Gabe.

619
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,300
What does this have to do with my son?

620
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,670
Clue number one:

621
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,020
If I were Jesus, curing this kid would
be as easy as turning water into wine.

622
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,040
Demonic possession?

623
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,190
Close, but no wafer.

624
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,440
Clue number two:

625
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,250
Rheumatology Rowan was almost right.
It causes auto-immune symptoms.

626
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Leprosy?

627
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,030
Yeah, that's real big
in the Jersey suburbs.

628
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,800
It's leprosy.
Run a FITE stain, it'll be positive.

629
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,090
Daddy hung out on the wrong
kind of Indian ashram.

630
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,030
But it's obviously dormant in the dad,
how could the kid catch it?

631
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,679
It's not dormant in the
dad, it's just slow.

632
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,410
Damaged his ulnar nerve, was
misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.

633
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:59,750
Never trust doctors.
Run a FITE stain.

634
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
No wonder he got anthrax.

635
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,389
The leprosy weakened his immune system.

636
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,740
Vicious circle.

637
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,229
The leprosy made him
vulnerable to the anthrax, and

638
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,680
the anthrax treatment put
the leprosy in overdrive.

639
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,199
But the antibiotics we gave him,
they cure leprosy.

640
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,260
Yeah, that's where the trouble starts.

641
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,720
The antibiotics hit the nerve strands,
they kill the leprosy bacteria.

642
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,710
The corpses get tossed into the system.

643
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,339
And as fascinating as our bodies are,
they're also stupid.

644
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,380
They produce antibodies
to beat dead bacteria.

645
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,750
And these aren't the polite antibodies,

646
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,500
they're the ones that won't sit still,
kick during naptimes.

647
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,849
They attack his neural and
fat cells, cause some

648
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,390
inflammation and all the
rest of his symptoms.

649
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,020
So the cure's killing him!

650
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,629
I want you to call down
to Carville, Louisiana,

651
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,320
home of the last leper
colony in the lower 48.

652
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,600
Get them to send up some thalidomide.

653
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,430
Thalidomide?

654
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,790
Twelve year olds don't have sex, right?
So he can't be pregnant. Make the call.

655
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,110
I need to speak to your boy.

656
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,180
Why does everybody need
to know my business?

657
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,230
People like talking about people.

658
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,480
Makes us feel superior.

659
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,500
Makes us feel in control.

660
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,810
And sometimes, for some people,
knowing some things makes them care.

661
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,140
I'd tell you my dad left,
my mum drank herself to death...

662
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,909
you gonna care about me more?

663
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,140
Cameron would.

664
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,790
Me, I just like knowing stuff.

665
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,990
I know you hate your dad,
but I'm gonna tell you something...

666
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,140
I don't hate him.

667
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,170
I loved him until I figured out
it hurts a lot less to just not care.

668
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,650
You don't expect him to turn up
to your football match?

669
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,230
No disappointments.

670
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,970
You don't expect a call on your birthday,
don't expect to see him for months?

671
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,530
No disappointments.

672
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,950
You want us to go make up?

673
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,430
Sink a few beers together, nice family hug?

674
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,450
I've given him enough hugs.

675
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,990
He's given me enough disappointments.

676
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,890
Okay.

677
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
That's it?

678
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,750
That's it.

679
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Breathe.

680
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,850
Breathe again.

681
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,730
Breathe again.

682
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,910
You gonna have to tell
my friends I'm a leper?

683
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,600
You had the antibiotics.
You're not contagious any more.

684
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,680
What if they already caught it?

685
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,679
Leprosy is incredibly hard to catch.

686
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,850
Even your mum didn't get it.

687
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,630
All right, I want you to make a fist.

688
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,130
It's still kinda stiff.

689
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,950
It'll get back to normal in a month or two.

690
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,790
Your skin, two or three weeks.

691
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,710
You haven't asked about your dad.

692
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,830
He lied about everything.

693
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,590
He lied to my mom. He lied to his boss.

694
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,350
He's just a liar.

695
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
He loves you.

696
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,090
I don't love him.

697
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,990
Yeah, you do.

698
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,050
Nothing you can do about it.
He's your dad.

699
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,750
It doesn't matter what he does,
you're gonna love him.

700
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,810
Here. Thanks.

701
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:30,970
Hey!

702
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,230
When's your flight?
You got time for a drink?

703
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,710
Wish I did.

704
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
Dr. Chase!

705
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,450
I've got it.

706
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,130
You're going to be getting
down to Oz any time soon?

707
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,290
Not too long. Next autumn, I hope.

708
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,720
I'll call you.

709
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,270
Well, you're all set.

710
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,250
I'll see you.

711
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,910
Yeah. I'll see you.
