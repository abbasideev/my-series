1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,860
I gotta go.

2
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,839
No, no, he'll be here.
I'm sure he's just running a little late.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,519
He's cancelled two exams,
he's not gonna...

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,010
He's scared of you.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,230
Sure. The ex-boy-toy.
Eh, that makes sense.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,540
He wasn't scared before.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,819
Right, you think being afraid of me
is a symptom of a serious ailment.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,929
Sudden mood swings,
infantile regression,

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,279
abdominal pain, he's
passed out twice, yeah!

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,716
I think it might be a medical problem.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,599
He's twenty minutes late.
I'm outta here.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Please.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,350
He'll be here.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,950
Why? Because he loves you
and does everything he's told?

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,140
Because I didn't tell him
you'd be here.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,690
He likes to see.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
Yes, he does.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Stace?

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,610
What's going on?

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,610
Hey...

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,190
Hi. I'm Gregg House.
You must be Matt.

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,810
Mark.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,810
Mark Warner.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
Don't get up.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,620
Sorry, pair of conferences.

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,930
- It's okay.
- Hi.

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,649
Wow. Gregg House.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,210
Yeah. Wow.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,050
No, I haven't been avoiding you,
I just didn't want to waste your time.

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,110
The other doctors checked me out
and they said it was just stress.

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,769
College season, kids,
parents, they're all over me.

32
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,770
Makes sense to me.

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,350
Gregg...

34
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,080
What do you want me to do?

35
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,090
You said you'd check him out!

36
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:30,619
He says he's healthy.
What's to check out?

37
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,740
Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad
you two got a chance to catch up.

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,850
Looks like you're having fun.

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh, he's good.

40
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,230
If you can fake sincerity,
you can fake pretty much anything.

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,779
I can't tell you how
much I like your fella.

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,620
Yeah, me too.

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,260
You know, I thought you'd be
all sarcastic, bitter, you know,

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,380
because Stacy married me.

45
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,179
You know, we should do things together.

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,639
Maybe throw a ball around
or something. Guy stuff.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,880
We could go for a run together.

48
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,260
He's Oscar Wilde!

49
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,909
Wow, this pissing contest is
really turning me on.

50
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,419
He needs to go to the hospital.

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,240
Here's to women.

52
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,479
You can't live with 'em,
you can't kill 'em

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
until the neighbors are stripping
in Atlantic City.

54
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,760
Damn straight.

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,909
I'm definitely taller.

56
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,349
I have more hair.
And I think that... oh...

57
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,350
Mark?

58
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,439
Someone call 911 for a wagon
to Princeton-Plainsboro?

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Garcon!

60
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,370
What happened?

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
It's okay, ladies and gentlemen,
nothing to worry about.

62
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,760
Unless you had the veal.

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,870
You dosed him!

64
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,310
I told you, I'd check him out.

65
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,240
I was a little worried they were gonna
get here before he'd passed out.

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,980
Would have been tougher
to get him to drink.

67
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll give you a ride.
We can talk.

68
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,090
Tummyache, cranky,
no apparent source.

69
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,200
Any thoughts?

70
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,070
Foreman, you gonna contribute,
or you too tired from stealing cars?

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,969
I'm being House. It's funny.

72
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,980
I know. You made milk come out of my nose.

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,160
Morning. You guys got the file?

74
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,280
What's wrong?

75
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,368
Previous tests revealed

76
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:53,210
of nothing that would cause
abdominal pain or the mood swings.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,210
Then we're done!

78
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,080
What do you think,
ball game, zoo?

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,046
I don't care, I just want
to hang with you guys.

80
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,000
What about drugs?

81
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:02,330
His tox screen on admission showed
a massive amount of chlorohydrate.

82
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,530
Yeah, sorry, that was me.

83
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,070
I had to dope him up
to get him in here.

84
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,750
Guy doesn't think he's sick.

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,160
Who does?

86
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,350
His wife.

87
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,960
The woman you used to live with.

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
That's her Indian name.

89
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,720
On her driver's license it's Stacy.

90
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,379
I assume you have a point.

91
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,489
You believe her over the patient himself.

92
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,849
That's why we're taking this case.

93
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,140
The truth, I hear voices.

94
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,870
All the time.
Telling me to do stuff, it's crazy, huh?

95
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,650
What happened to "everybody lies"?

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
I was lying.

97
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,939
Do the things, the, you
know, blah blah blah

98
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,700
blah blah, all that stuff
the other docs did.

99
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,359
If that's negative, ultrasound his belly.

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,970
If that's negative, CT his abdomen and
pelvis, with and without contrast.

101
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,970
Did I miss anything?

102
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,920
Kitchen sink?

103
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:47,399
Well, we could certainly
give that a... oh, you minx.

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,049
What you're thinking is, you're going
to save him, be a hero, and win her back.

105
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,749
It's always impressive,
that level of twisted narcissism.

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,690
She's married.
Big clue I lost the game.

107
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,110
You can't be within
fifty feet of Stacy Warner.

108
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,630
I thought she wanted me to treat him.

109
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,339
Treat the husband.
Stay away from the wife.

110
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,436
But what if they get close to each other?
What do I do then?

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,960
Hey, you have to treat this
like a regular case.

112
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Be yourself:
Cold, uncaring, distant.

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,280
Please, don't put me on a pedestal.

114
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,980
We CTed your abdomen. Nothing that
would explain the stomach pain.

115
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,770
What's the next move?

116
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,430
Leaving.
How many more tests do I need?

117
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,590
How many more doctors need to clear me
before we can get back to our life?

118
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,470
Just one.

119
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,510
House.

120
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,030
It must be awkward being treated by a man
who used to be involved with your wife.

121
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,780
Well, it's awkward being in a hospital
when there's nothing wrong with me.

122
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,559
MRAs were clean,
which means he's probably fine.

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,650
He doesn't seem paranoid,
he shows no signs of...

124
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,930
No, it means we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

125
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,050
Ben Goldstein says the schedule's locked.
He can't do it before tomorrow.

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,530
No, today. Call him.
Tell him I'll make it work.

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,560
You're cutting him open?

128
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,610
Whoa, hold it!

129
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,639
There's no need for exploratory surgery,
Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis.

130
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,699
No, I just think it's premature
and maybe irresponsible to

131
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,139
do exploratory surgery before
we know he's actually sick.

132
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,480
No, it's premature to put him
on a list for hospice care.

133
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,919
And it's maybe irresponsible to imply my
actions are not rationally supported.

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,339
All we have is his wife...

135
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,289
Who says that his stomach hurts.
Works for me.

136
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,439
The patient doesn't even think he's sick.
Why would he consent...

137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,360
His wife's a lawyer.
She's very convincing.

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,600
Call Goldstein, surgery's on.

139
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,649
Leslie vs. Leslie seems to be right
in point, but I'm sure they're going

140
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,500
to try to distinguish it by...

141
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,990
Sorry, they'll try to distinguish it
by relying on the minority opinion.

142
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,660
Double milk, no sugar.

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,720
I like sugar now.

144
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,040
Some people would be
annoyed by that.

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,640
You know why people
sit in waiting rooms?

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,410
This is gonna be good.

147
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,480
People think the closer they're sitting to
the operating room, the more they care.

148
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
That's why I'm here.

149
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,830
I'm not moving
until everybody sees me.

150
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,590
Are you doing anybody besides Mark?

151
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,600
It's a medical question.

152
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,939
Because if I am his paranoia isn't
paranoia, it's a justified response?

153
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,840
Therefore, not a legitimate symptom?

154
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,670
Knew you'd understand.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,969
On the other hand, if it
was really just a medical

156
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,776
question you would have
sent one of your people.

157
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,960
Why just push my buttons
when you can push theirs, too?

158
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,760
'Hey, Dr. Mandingo, go ask the wife
if she's been messing around.'

159
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:19,430
You were asking because,
if I am unfaithful, I might sleep with you.

160
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,160
The answer's
'no, I don't sleep around'.

161
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,090
Make sure you note that in his file.

162
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,980
Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well.
he's in recovery, you can see him now.

163
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,240
Goldstein found nothing
but a distended bladder.

164
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,319
Neurogenic bladder
isn't causing the pain.

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,200
Also doesn't cause
personality changes.

166
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,199
On the other hand, it would completely
account for Cameron's diagnosis...

167
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
the patient's completely healthy.

168
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,880
Give me the video for the surgery.

169
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,080
Dr. Mandingo, you're needed
at the plantation house.

170
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Well, don't everybody talk at once.

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,170
There's nothing there.

172
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,970
Stop looking at the suspiciously
empty bottle and look at the screen.

173
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,800
Here's why I get the big bucks.

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,420
This is nothing.
An enhanced version of nothing.

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,450
This is the problem.

176
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,840
Unbelievable.

177
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,509
Tremors in the muscle fiber.

178
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,380
That's not peristalsis.
That's abdominal epilepsy.

179
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,620
Means there's some sort of
neurological problem.

180
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,130
A time bomb in his brain.

181
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,080
I forget, who said it was nothing?

182
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,019
Saw a very small diffuse abnormality
in the brain waves.

183
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,320
Probably white matter.

184
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,320
Means his axonal nerves are dying.

185
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,910
Explains the neurogenic bladder.

186
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,710
Enough nerves die, he dies.

187
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,650
Global axonal nerve death.

188
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,309
Likely causes are
encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

189
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,349
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.

190
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,600
He won't die right away.
He'll just want to.

191
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,010
We'll check his blood
for Alzheimer's protein markers.

192
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,060
Last I heard Alzheimer's
had a genetic component.

193
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,660
Patient have parents?

194
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,579
Parents died in a car crash.
No history of dementia.

195
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,639
Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies
to rule out encephalitis,

196
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,950
and get Tal proteins
to check for Alzheimer's.

197
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,870
And this still feels a little light.

198
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
I took a complete medical history.

199
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,189
Check out their house.
Take Sparky with you.

200
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,359
They live in Short Hills,
two hours away.

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,570
You can expense the tolls.

202
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,880
You're not interested
in the medical history.

203
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,569
You're a Peeping Tom
trying to spy on your ex.

204
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,470
Her secret diary:
That's the main thing.

205
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,559
But as long as you're there,
take a peek in the medicine cabinet.

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,059
Check for toxins, heavy metals...
anything that might

207
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,650
explain this other than
encephalitis or Alzheimer's.

208
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,890
And get receipts for the tolls!

209
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,850
Making lunch?
I assume that's for Mark.

210
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,079
You know about his parents.
What about further back?

211
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,939
Grandparents, uncles, aunts,
how's their health?

212
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,090
Gregg hates fishing.
He's got a theory.

213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,220
Mostly likely candidate
right now is Alzheimer's.

214
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,700
No. There's been no memory loss.

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,520
I mean, he forgets where
he left his keys, but who doesn't?

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,090
Any family history?

217
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,300
Of? Whacked-outness?

218
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,210
His sister voted for Nader, twice.
That's about it.

219
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,630
You were with House?

220
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,620
When it happened? To his leg?

221
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,670
You're interested in him.

222
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,859
We went on one date.
It didn't go very well.

223
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,819
Our first date didn't, either.
I was never going to see him again.

224
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,950
Week later I moved in. 5 years.

225
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
What would you like to know?

226
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,310
What was he like before his leg?

227
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,290
Pretty much the same.

228
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,350
He's clear. No Alzheimer's.

229
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,570
Yeah, that's what I figured.

230
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,409
Serious mountain bike.
Hasn't been used in a while, though.

231
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,160
He switched to yoga.
Brand new yoga mat and tape.

232
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,130
Man's getting older.

233
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,669
Or it might indicate back pain.

234
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,830
Wife would have mentioned it.

235
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,990
Yoga's good for picking up the ladies, too.

236
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,120
Not when you do it in your own home.

237
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,610
The change could just be a change,
not a symptom.

238
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Chase!

239
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,910
"Dear House boys, a snack
for your highly illegal search.

240
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,260
Hope you like oatmeal raisin. Love, Stacy."

241
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,510
Whoa.

242
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,490
In a desk drawer, hidden in the back
under some papers. Secret stash.

243
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Amphetamines.

244
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,690
Regularly used,
could lead to neurotoxicity.

245
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,740
Explains the axonal nerve damage
and the personality issues.

246
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,500
On the other hand,
prescribed to W. Brown.

247
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,290
Fake name, fake prescription.

248
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,540
Could be, but the prescribing doc,

249
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,499
his name's real. This guy's
just had his license pulled

250
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,169
for writing illegal prescriptions
to high school kids.

251
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,719
Mark's a high school guidance counselor.

252
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,679
And Mr. Brown's birth date
makes him 17-years-old.

253
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,180
You think maybe these were confiscated
by a high school guidance counselor?

254
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,230
Anything else?

255
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,879
Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking
to yoga, could have been indication...

256
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,569
He's getting older.
What did the CSF say about encephalitis?

257
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,569
Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells,
no white cells, serology's negative.

258
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,090
Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.

259
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,740
I told her he didn't have it.
The marker tests were negative.

260
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,596
Well, then you should have told her that.

261
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
He could still have it.

262
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,899
PET scan will reveal any
change in metabolic

263
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,880
activity in the cerebral
cortex, run him through.

264
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,360
And check his memory.

265
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,230
We're going to inject
a chemical marker called FDDNP.

266
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,409
Then I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

267
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,140
Test my memory.

268
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:48,880
Yeah. First we're gonna map out
some specific brain functions,

269
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,630
check out the engine before
we take the car for a drive.

270
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,830
Checking up on me?

271
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,790
I like all the pretty lights.

272
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Yeah.

273
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,810
Okay, here we go. Your full name?

274
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
Mark Warner.

275
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Is your mother living?

276
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,550
No.

277
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,320
Limbic system's intact.

278
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,770
Okay, say you find a stamped envelope
on the street. What do you do?

279
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,160
Find a mailbox and mail it.

280
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,100
Jeez, what a guy.

281
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,140
His frontal lobe is working
way better than mine.

282
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,390
You remember when you got married?

283
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,900
Three years ago this July, who is that?

284
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,410
What? There could be a problem
with his long-term memory.

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,600
- Big church wedding?
- Is that House?

286
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,100
He remembers voices.

287
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,659
This serves no diagnostic purpose.

288
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,650
I thought you skimped
on the limbic system, there.

289
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,150
Emotional reactions,
I just want to be thorough.

290
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,030
Did the atheistic bride wear
a pretty, white dress?

291
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,620
Was she thinking of you?

292
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,550
Is that what you medically need to know?

293
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,359
What jewelry did your bride wear?

294
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,690
She never wears any jewelry.

295
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,770
Except that cross her mother gave to her.

296
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,590
No underwear, either.
At least, not that day.

297
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,830
I remember because she ripped
her pretty, white dress off in the car.

298
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,460
Is that the sort of answer
you're looking for, Doctor?

299
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,420
I think I upset him.

300
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:22,909
You gotta to stop this, now.

301
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,710
I remember the honeymoon was in Paris.

302
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,970
I remember because we didn't
leave the room for two weeks.

303
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,210
You want the details on that?

304
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,790
A little defensive.

305
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,300
It's not paranoia
if someone's out to get you.

306
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Here we go.

307
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,969
He's sick, paranoid, and you keep
hammering him about me?

308
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,919
The questions were
designed to define

309
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,139
the operational parameters
of his limbic system...

310
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,899
Elevate the words all
you want, you were just

311
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,989
screwing with him. Low
even by your standards.

312
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,920
Medical screwing.
It's what I do.

313
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,866
And then you run away
like a 12-year-old.

314
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,570
Go hide on the roof
like you always do.

315
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,760
I haven't been up here in five years.

316
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,170
I don't know what's wrong with him.

317
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,640
It's not Alzheimer's,
it's not encephalitis,

318
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,789
it's not environmental,
it's not immunological.

319
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,070
Every test is negative, every time.

320
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,240
He's perfectly healthy,
but his brain is dying.

321
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,640
It never occurred to me that
you couldn't figure out what's wrong.

322
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,300
I haven't given up.

323
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,000
So what do we do?

324
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,130
We wait.

325
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
For what?

326
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,840
Something to change.

327
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,650
It's one of the great tragedies of life,
something always...

328
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,110
something always changes.

329
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,560
Nurse! Nurse!

330
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,650
What happened? What's wrong?

331
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,270
My toes. They were numb,
tingling, then nothing.

332
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,930
No pain, nothing.

333
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,099
It's okay.
They're gonna take care of you.

334
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,860
I'm scared, Stacy. Hold my hand.

335
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
What?

336
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
What's happening?

337
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,240
Time marches on. He's paralyzed.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,409
His symptoms mimic
a peripheral nervous system under attack.

339
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,139
But he's experiencing
significant paresthesias,

340
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,859
and he can't move
his hands or toes.

341
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,319
It's peripheral. Guillain-Barre
syndrome attacks there, not the brain.

342
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,399
No, no. I already did an
indirect Coombs' test.

343
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,410
No glutination, no antibodies!

344
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,330
Initiative! Like that.

345
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,179
Start him on IV immunosuppress?

346
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,620
No antibodies means
he doesn't have Guillain-Barre, period!

347
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,080
Period? More like dot dot dot.

348
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,239
What if he has the virus but
isn't producing those antibodies?

349
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,379
Come on, the chances of that are...

350
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,479
I didn't ask about the Vegas line,
I said "what if?"

351
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
It would mean he's sick and
his body's not doing anything about it.

352
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,540
So we either fight it
for him or it's fatal.

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,859
Fatal sounds very bad to me.

354
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,110
But without the antibodies
we can't even test for it.

355
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,900
We don't know if we're right.

356
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,859
The treatment isn't all that dangerous,
plasmapheresis and IVIG.

357
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,600
If it works, we're right.
If he dies, it was something else.

358
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,440
So the paralysis
might not be permanent?

359
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,210
That's our hope, but the brain's tricky.
You never know.

360
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
What was that?

361
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,630
What?

362
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,890
With the head, the look.

363
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,880
He just wants to talk to me.

364
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Well, if it was medical
he should be talking to me!

365
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,969
I'll be just outside the door.

366
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,520
Leave! Go talk to him!
You're gonna leave me anyway!

367
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,039
No, that's not gonna happen.

368
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,500
You left him, and he had a limp. If I can't
walk, or hold you...

369
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,789
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going to talk to him.

370
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,019
If I can't feed myself?

371
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,310
Mark, what you're feeling,
it's not real. It's the virus.

372
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,250
Mark? His throat's closing up,
he can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!

373
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,460
He's having a reaction
to the IVIG, I need epi stat!

374
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,609
I can't get the scope in his throat!

375
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,610
Stop that.

376
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,249
He's having an allergic reaction
and he's crashing!

377
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,920
No, he's not. Look at his vitals.

378
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,460
O2 stats are within range.

379
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,330
I'm betting the only abnormal sign
is sweaty palms.

380
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,340
Push two milligrams Ativan.

381
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,470
Not an allergic reaction.
Just a panic attack.

382
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,980
Something obviously freaked him out.

383
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,080
Can we talk now?

384
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,459
You couldn't just come into the room?

385
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,510
He's had five visitors drive down.

386
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,460
I didn't recognize any of them.

387
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,719
Six more have sent him
flowers, candy and a teddy bear,

388
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,610
which I'm sure he
finds very comforting.

389
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,899
But I didn't recognize
any of the names on the cards.

390
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,070
Shockingly, Mark has friends,
and I have some new ones.

391
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,100
No, it's not shocking
that you have new friends.

392
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,529
But it is shocking that
you apparently dumped all your old ones.

393
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,530
I haven't.

394
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,260
No, I didn't think so.

395
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,440
I just think you didn't tell any of them
that you were down here.

396
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,930
Now why would that be?

397
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,790
Why would you not tell your oldest friends

398
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,539
that you were taking Mark
to Princeton-Plainsboro.

399
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,599
Teaching Hospital to
try to save his life?

400
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,659
I've been busy! I haven't kept
track of who knows what.

401
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,630
See, my old friends are
telling me to be careful.

402
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,160
They seem to think...

403
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,240
He. And he sent me the bear.

404
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,290
Figures. He seems to think
that I'm not over you.

405
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,130
And it might be dangerous
for me to spend time with you.

406
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm thinking your friends
might have similar concerns.

407
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,600
And so you didn't tell him
you'd be here, with me.

408
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,399
What's your point?
That I'm still in love with you?

409
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,430
I should abandon my dying husband
and we should head for Rio?

410
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,950
No.

411
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,660
Gregg, I appreciate what you're doing
for us, but I think maybe Wilson's right.

412
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,190
Maybe you should just
stay away from me.

413
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
What's up?

414
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,400
Love the bear, it was adorable.

415
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,629
My wife's going to kill me.
We're having company, she cooked.

416
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,660
I got Mark's latest blood work,

417
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,340
he's not responding to treatment.

418
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,520
I was happy.

420
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,500
He's my patient.

421
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,430
I'm sure he's a good guy,
he's probably a great guy.

422
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,920
Probably a much better guy than I am.

423
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,510
And some part of me wants him to die.

424
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,260
I'm just not sure if it's because...

425
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,280
I want to be with her

426
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,400
or if it's because I want her to suffer.

427
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,790
Hey. Is it okay if I talk
to Stacy for a minute?

428
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,330
I'll be just outside, honey.

429
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,170
You two are good together.

430
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,540
You know nothing about Mark.

431
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,310
He took you to Paris,
that's good enough for me.

432
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,880
We never went to Paris.

433
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,670
Your honeymoon.

434
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,439
It's been your dream
city, you wanted to go

435
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,200
since you were sixteen,
he actually took you.

436
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,100
No, I had to work.

437
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,790
We spent the night in New York,
then went back to Short Hills.

438
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,050
What is it?

439
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,740
When did Mark switch
from mountain biking to yoga?

440
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,140
About a month ago.

441
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,750
The same time he started getting sick,
what is that mean?

442
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,380
We have two more symptoms.

443
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,670
Patient was asked a series of questions to
determine the functionality of his brain.

444
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,730
You grilled him about Stacy.

445
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,540
Whatever.

446
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah, point is he told us everything
we needed to know to diagnose him,

447
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,969
that is if we use your
fancy PET scan as a lie detector.

448
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,000
See, it's a very creative process, lying.

449
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,580
Now, telling the truth is
a much simpler process. See here.

450
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,479
Question nine, this is
where Mark gives a long,

451
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,540
rambling answer about
taking Stacy to Paris.

452
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,380
What does the PET scan say?

453
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,469
Minimal involvement.
Just the frontal and temporal lobes.

454
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,340
He said he went to Paris and
the PET confirms it, so what?

455
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,330
They didn't go.

456
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,849
They didn't go to Paris,

457
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,039
and yet Mark's brain apparently
thinks that he really

458
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,510
did spend 40 francs on a
tour of the Bastille.

459
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,209
So we have an intermittent syndrome
that presents with

460
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:42,540
abdominal pain, polyneuropathy,
paranoia and delusions.

461
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
Now, here's the thing about
Acute Intermittent Porphyria.

462
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,780
It'll jump you in a dark alley, beat the
crap out of you, leave you bleeding.

463
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,669
But it leaves gloves,
so no fingerprints.

464
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,150
Doesn't show up in blood tests,
urine tests, nothing.

465
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,480
Unless you catch it red handed
in the middle of an attack.

466
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,129
But there are other symptoms of AIP.

467
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,130
Such as?

468
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,500
Light sensitivity?

469
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,979
Yeah, well, one of the true tragedies
of this condition is it makes

470
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,739
you want to stick your cool, new
mountain bike in the garage

471
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,120
and take up an indoor
sport like, say, yoga.

472
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,359
Start the treatment:
Hematin and glucose.

473
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,779
If you give him hematin now and
you're wrong, he dies today.

474
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,269
There's only one way to confirm AIP:
Urine sample made during the attack.

475
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,840
And there's no way to predict
when he'll have another attack.

476
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,390
Sure there is.

477
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,959
Acute Intermittent Porphyria
has very specific triggers.

478
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,980
Barbiturates, alcohol,
high levels of protein set off an attack.

479
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,409
Which trigger do you think set off Mark's?

480
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,360
Not the faintest idea, that's why I'm going
to give him the combo plate. All of it.

481
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,920
So if he has this, and you trigger the
attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?

482
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,510
Yeah. But then we'll know
what it is and we can treat it.

483
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,150
What if I don't have this thing
and you give me that shot?

484
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
What happens?

485
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,140
No idea. If we don't know what's messing up
your brain we don't know how you'll react.

486
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,650
Okay, I need a minute
with my husband.

487
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,290
He doesn't want the trigger.

488
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,190
He wants to wait, see if we can
come up with another explanation.

489
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,289
If it is the AIP,
how much time does he have?

490
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,060
No idea. Next attack could be fatal.

491
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,630
Could be six months from now,
could be five minutes from now.

492
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,230
I want you to test him.

493
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,890
Fine. I'll send for a HMB
synthetase mutation, genetic test.

494
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,250
Lab will get back to us in a month.

495
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,550
Give him the cocktail,
set off an attack.

496
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,240
No.

497
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Why not?

498
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,249
Because he doesn't want me to.

499
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,099
I'm not going to sue you.
I'm not going to report you.

500
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,680
He might.

501
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,539
He's paralyzed! Either you cure him,
or he won't be writing any letters.

502
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,430
I'm not gonna do it.

503
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,430
Why not?

504
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,589
You keep asking me that question.
my answer doesn't change.

505
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,410
I gave him the parameters,
it's his call.

506
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,599
- You want him to die.
- I diagnosed him, I did my job.

507
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,679
You want somebody to tie him
down and force him into treatment,

508
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,320
well, you're way
better at that than I am.

509
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,800
Is that what this is?

510
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,040
Payback for your leg? How many times have
we been over this. I saved your life.

511
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,469
Yeah, maybe.

512
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,840
You're going to kill my husband
to teach me a lesson?

513
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,769
No, he's going to die because
he's too stubborn to make the right choice.

514
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,960
Now we're in your territory.

515
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,679
I'm respecting your husband's decision, I
don't see why you've got a problem with that.

516
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,920
Because it's crap!

517
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,399
Because you browbeat patients,
intimidate them, lie to them.

518
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,920
If you think you're right
you don't give a damn what they think.

519
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,820
I did what you do all the time,
the only difference is I did it to you.

520
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,050
He'll never forgive you.

521
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,750
Yeah, he will.

522
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,250
Still no change.

523
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,720
He's not getting worse?

524
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,220
No, no change at all.

525
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,449
And that's consistent with AIP, right?

526
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,719
Until he has another attack
his condition's stable?

527
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Yeah.

528
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,820
Mark, you've got to...

529
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:55,160
I don't want to take that test.
Not until they're sure.

530
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,110
- You don't know Gregg.
- Not like you do.

531
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,380
I only met him
when he drugged me.

532
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,220
Boy, are my ears burning.

533
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
What's that?

534
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Cocktail hour.

535
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,059
Just because you can't hoist a few
doesn't mean you should be left out.

536
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Get away from me.

537
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,419
Mark, this is what he thinks
is wrong with you.

538
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,959
You trust his judgment
more than mine?

539
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,279
His medical judgment.

540
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,319
And you'd bet my life on that.

541
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
I would.

542
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,090
I don't.

543
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,940
Smart. It's too bad you're paralyzed.

544
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,470
Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman!

545
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Leave the room.

546
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,719
- It's not your problem.
- You need the consent from him.

547
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,679
Doc, he ain't right in the head!

548
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,889
Then you need a court order.

549
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,730
Okay, then get one.
We'll wait here. I won't do nothin'.

550
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,520
Oh, love the Musketeer thing.
I got goosebumps.

551
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,110
Give me the syringe.

552
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,140
Please, if you're right
this may be his only shot.

553
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,770
So what's your plan?

554
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,129
You take the big, dark one,
I've got the little girl

555
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,950
and the Aussie will run like a
scared wombat if things turn rough.

556
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I can't do it.

557
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,990
You son of a bitch!

558
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,650
See what I did there?

559
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,370
When does it happen?

560
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,169
If he had AIP, it should have
already happened.

561
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,100
Everyone's different.

562
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,270
This is not good. He could have
embolism, tachycardia, stroke...

563
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,470
What's happening?

564
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,749
Two milligrams of Ativan!

565
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,750
Is that an attack?

566
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,820
No, you'll pollute the sample!

567
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,820
Chase, get urine
from the catheter.

568
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,550
It's not an attack,
he's stroking!

569
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
He needs Ativan!

570
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,760
This is not a stroke! Delta wave
bursts just at the base of the spasm.

571
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,149
Catheter's out, there's no way
to collect the sample.

572
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,869
Heart rate's in the 40s,
bradycardia, we're losing him!

573
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,619
- Hold him down!
- Give him something!

574
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,270
- No pain killers!
- You were wrong!

575
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,580
Straight from the bladder,
that's as fresh as it gets.

576
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,230
Will you give him the Ativan already?
He doesn't need to be awake for this.

577
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
It's still yellow.

578
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,530
Move.

579
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
What?

580
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,880
You think another light's
gonna make the difference?

581
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Organic chem..

582
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,590
More lights, more oxidation.
Does it ring any bells?

583
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,090
Start the patient on 150 milligrams
glucose, 75 milligrams hematin.

584
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,650
Hey.

585
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Hey.

586
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,800
You want to thumb wrestle?

587
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,830
Come on.

588
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,480
- He's still a maniac.
- I know.

589
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,250
Dr. House? How's he doing?

590
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Never better.

591
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,700
I thought you were
too screwed up to love anyone.

592
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,390
I was wrong.

593
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,010
You just couldn't love me.

594
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,090
It's good.

595
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,500
I'm happy for you.

596
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,470
You fixed him.

597
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,570
De nada.

598
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Thank you.

599
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,110
You were right.

600
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,300
He's gonna be fine.

601
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,580
No, about me.

602
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,540
I'm not over you.

603
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,050
You were, you were the one,
you always will be.

604
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,760
But I can't be with you.

605
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,548
So I'm the guy,

606
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,300
but you want the other guy,
who by definition can never be the guy.

607
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,759
What's so great about you?
You always think you're right.

608
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,810
What's so frustrating about you is
you are right so much of the time?

609
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,620
You are brilliant,
funny, surprising, sexy...

610
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,410
but with you I was lonely, and
with Mark there's room for me.

611
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,570
Okay.

612
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,530
I want to run something by you.

613
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,520
I will not have sex with you!
Not again! Miserable, that first time.

614
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,259
All that desperate,
administrative need...

615
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,800
Stacy's husband is going to need
close monitoring at the hospital.

616
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,449
And since we can definitely
use her back here,

617
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,510
I've offered her a job.
General Counsel.

618
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Did she say yes?

619
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,070
She said only if it was okay with you.

620
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Yes or no?

621
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
Fine. Good.
