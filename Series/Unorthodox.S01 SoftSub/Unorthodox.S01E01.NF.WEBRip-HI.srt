[in Yiddish] Esty! You can't go out!

00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,916
- Why?
- [woman] The <i>eruv </i>is broken.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,291
High winds broke a wire
just down the street.

11
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,166
- Someone will fix it.
- [woman 2] Tomorrow. Not on the sabbath!

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't go to my mother's for lunch!

13
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,083
And I have an excuse
to avoid my mother-in-law!

14
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,916
[woman 2] Where are you going, Esty?

15
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,166
You know, Esty's not trapped like we are!
She doesn't have a baby to carry.

16
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,416
Good point! Just leave your bag upstairs.

17
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,684
- [in English] Right.
- [man] Excuse me.

18

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,916
- Where are you going?
- To my parents-in-law. For lunch.

27
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,500
Don't they live that way?

28
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,416
[in English] I'm sorry.

29
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,745
[in Yiddish] I've got to go.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,250

Good Sabbath.

34
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,958
What's up, kiddos?

35
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,708
Nice!

36
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,916

Where's Esty?

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,500
She's not here?

[suspenseful music playing]

41
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,375
Is she sick?

42
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,958
[Yanky] I don't know.

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,416
She wasn't sick when I left this morning.

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,625
It's always something with Esty, isn't it?

OK, your ticket.

49
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,083
Your passport.

50
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,791
I'm calling you a car.

51
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,208
- Thank you for helping me.
- Of course!

52
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,333

- What terminal?
- Five.

61
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,583
Is everything all right, Miss?

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,833
Go the long way
around Williamsburg, please.

63
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,166
Esty.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,833
Esty.

Yanky, shouldn't you be at the synagogue?

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,708
Esty's gone.

70
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,916
What do you mean, gone?

71
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,750
She wasn't home after lunch yesterday

72
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,291
and she never came home last night.

73
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,833
[Yanky sighs]

74
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,041
[man 4] Yanky, good!

75
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,833
- Let's head over together.
- Esty's missing.

76
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,083
Missing?

77
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,291
Disappeared!

78
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,791
- Where would she go?
- That's the question!

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
Has she been in an accident?

80
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,416
We would've heard something.

81
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,750
Maybe she just left.

82
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,000
Left where?

83
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,166
Left me, Mommy.

84
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,791
She wasn't happy.

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,625
Not happy?

86
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,083
That girl was never good enough for you!

87
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,208
- [man 4] Mimi!
- [Mimi] She was trouble from the start.

88
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,416
No mother, the strange father...

89
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,416
A year of marriage and not even a baby!

90
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,625
We shouldn't have agreed to the match.

91
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
Fine.

92
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,958
I'll go see the rabbi.

[Esty's grandma sniffs]

106
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,333
He had a wonderful voice, Esty.

107
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
Your great-grandpa.

108
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,125
All the men in his family did.

109
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,916
In Hungary,

110
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,458
before the war?

111
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,666
So many lost.

112
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,791
But soon you'll have children of your own.

113
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,000
[woman 5] Mommy?

114
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,375
Malka spoke to the matchmaker.

115
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:44,958
Really?

116
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,458
- Grandpa will be home any minute.
- [Esty] He's not here yet!

117
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,375
So he'll hear women singing
when he arrives? No.

118
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,500
Grandma's pills.

119
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,750
[Esty] Thanks.

120
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,833
[sirens wailing outside]

121
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,916
[in English] Listen.

122
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,458
[in Yiddish]
The matchmaker made a suggestion.

123
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,416
Who?

124
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,625
The Shapiros near the Navy Yard.

125
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,916
- From the jewelry business?
- Yes. The brothers.

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,875
But the father has never worked.

127
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,000
- He sits and studies!
- [Esty's grandma in English] That's good!

128
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,958
- [in Yiddish] What's the boy like?
- What's the boy like?

129
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,208
He's like everyone else. Normal.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Esty!

131
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,458
Your marriage will mark
the beginning of a new life!

132
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,125
[Malka in English] Hold on a minute.

133
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,458
[in Yiddish] Let's wait till the Shapiros
agree to the match, all right?

134
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,000
After all, Esty is an orphan.

135
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,458
I'm not an orphan.

136
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,083
What would you call it?

137
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,625
Good Sabbath.

138
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,333

[scoffs] Good Sabbath.

142
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,375
You're not staying for the meal?

143
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,625
What a disgrace!

144
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
[shouts] Good Sabbath!

145
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,410

[door closing]

148
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,791
[woman 6 in English] Leah.

149
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,458
Red or white?

150
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,166
[Leah] It's my favorite. Thanks.

151
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,375
[in Yiddish] Tell us everything
about your wife, Yanky.

152
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,458
I'm in Manhattan during the day.

153
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,750
I work with my brothers
in the business now.

154
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,583
Esty does what all the other wives do.

155
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,458
She shops, she cooks,
she visits her grandmother...

156
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,625
Esty isn't like the other wives.

157
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,076
What's that supposed to mean?

158
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,208
Yanky, come on!
She doesn't even visit with them.

159
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,833
The others all have babies!

160
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,916
So?

161
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,250
It makes her feel bad!

162
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,250
Yanky, admit it.

163
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,416
You have no idea how Esty spends the day.

164
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,375
Gentlemen. The point is,
we can't have our people losing their way.

165
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,000
It sets a dangerous precedent.

166
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,875
We need to find this young woman
and bring her back to her husband!

167
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,625
- I've asked your cousin Moishe to help.
- Moishe?

168
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,500
- Over my dead body!
- Mimi!

169
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,833
The rabbi understands
that Moishe has his own problems, right?

170
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,583
Not to mention, in his marriage.

171
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,958
"A Jew, though he sinned, is still a Jew."

172
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,416
Just recently, Moishe wasn't even...

173
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,416
Trust in God, Symcha!

174
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,500
Moishe is the one to find your son's wife.

175
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,875
How far can she possibly have gone?

176
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,458
[sentimental music playing]

177
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,166

178
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,458
What are we doing here?

179
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,458
Miriam Shapiro wants to see you.

180
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,958
How will I know which one she is?

181
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,416
You won't.

182
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,833
Now walk as if you're looking
for something. With a smile.

183
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,416
Go!

184
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,833
[dance music playing]

185
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
[barista in German] Can I help?

186
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,625
[Esty in English] Yes.

187
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,083
[man 6 in German] Thanks.

188
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,916
[in English] Coffee.

189
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,291
- Flat white? Cappuccino?
- Just coffee?

190
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,976
[barista] Would you like to see a menu?

191
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,416
Americano.

192
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,541
Me?

193
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,125
- No, I meant the coffee, actually.
- Oh.

194
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,750
Americano.

195
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,333
- [barista] Sure.
- Thanks.

196
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,125
You have a lot of friends.

197
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,333
Yeah. A lot of tired friends.

198
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,833
- [barista] That will be two euros twenty.
- Yes.

199
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,666
I can help you.

200
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,083
Really?

201
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,041
It's just around the corner.

202
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,333
I have time.

203
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,166
[in German] Thanks.

204
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,333
[violin music playing]

205
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,541
- [in English] Here we are. Coffee!
- [man 7] Oh, nice!

206
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,041
[excited murmuring]

207
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,291
Oh, coffee!

208
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,458
Of course...

209
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,416
Which one can I take?

210
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,875
- They're all the same.
- [woman 7] Thanks. You're so sweet.

211
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:42,958
[man 6] You're welcome.

212
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,958
And who is this?

213
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,250
Americano, right?

214
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
I'm Esty.

215
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,958
Esty.

216
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,491
- [in German] We'll start in a minute.
- OK, I'm coming.

217
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,263
[in English]
We have to bring these inside,

218
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,583
because we have a rehearsal now.

219
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,458
Thanks so much again.

220
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,208
- See you around.
- [woman 8] See you around, Esty.

221
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,708
See you around.

222
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,458
[classical music playing]

223
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,416
Good morning.

224
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,708
I'm assuming you all stayed in last night
and practiced your parts?

225
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,333
Can anyone think of a better way
to spend a Saturday evening in Berlin?

226
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,958
[woman 8] Or a Sunday afternoon?

227
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,708
- [teacher] Aha!
- [students laugh]

228
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,791
[teacher] Ready?

229
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,083
Let's start from the trio
of the second movement.

230
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,708
[classical music playing]

231
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
[classical music continues playing]

232
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,416
[in Yiddish] Peace be upon you!

233
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,916
Peace be upon you! How do you do?

234
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,166
Don't forget, Esty. He speaks first.

235
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,083
[chattering]

236
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,041
[Yanky clears throat]

237
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:02,666
My father took me and my brothers
to Europe last spring.

238
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,583
That sounds exciting.

239
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,125
We visited the graves
of all the famous rabbis.

240
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,833
You went all the way to Europe
and all you saw were graves?

241
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,666
Nothing else?

242
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,166
I wanted to...

243
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,041
but my father didn't allow it.

244
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,791
I want to go back someday.

245
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,041
They say London and Paris are beautiful.

246
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,416
I've never been anywhere but New York.

247
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,375
There's no place like home.

248
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,583
Do you like music?

249
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,166
Oh, I love music!

250
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:54,916
My brothers and I sometimes perform
together with my father.

251
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,125
And you?

252
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,541
If I perform?

253
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,500
Of course not!

254
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,125
I mean, do you like music?

255
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,125
Yes.

256
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:16,000
I bet you sound beautiful
when you play together.

257
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,333
I hope to see it one day.

258
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,916
[chattering]

259
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,458
She doesn't want any.

260
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,583
But you should know...

261
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,250
I'm not like the other girls.

262
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,250
I mean, I'm... normal.

263
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,750
But...

264
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,625
I'm different from the other girls.

265
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,833
Different is good.

266
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,583
[chattering]

267
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,356
[in English] I'll get the car, guys.

268
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,416
[chattering]

269
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,750
It was a beautiful concert.

270
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,250
It was just a rehearsal.

271
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,916
It was the most beautiful thing
I have ever heard.

272
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,375
- [woman 8 laughs]
- Thank you.

273
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,166
[in German] Come on. Let's go!

274
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,208
- [man 8 in English] I'm ready.
- Let's go! Come on. Dasia!

275
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,583
Are you coming?

276
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,791
I have to practice.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

277
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,166
[students chattering]

278
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,375
Where are you going?

279
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,250
Wannsee. The lake.

280
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,375
- Can I come with you?
- Come on!

281
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,250
- [woman 8 chattering]
- Sure.

282
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,208
- See you later!
- [woman 8] Bye!

283
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,980
[in Yiddish] You spoke to her mother?

284
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,333
You know she doesn't have a mother.
Just a grandmother and an aunt.

285
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,875
They won't know anything.

286
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,533
[Moishe] We'll see about that.

287
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,750
[in English] Please...

288
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,000
[in Yiddish] Be polite.

289
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,875
[door unlocks]

290
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,541
Oh, Yanky.

291
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,143
- [Yanky] Good day.
- [Moishe] Good day.

292
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,958
Who is this?

293
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,833
My cousin, Moishe Lefkovitch.
You remember him.

294
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,833
So he's back.

295
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:39,666
Where's Esty?

296
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,750
We're here to ask you and your mother
that question exactly.

297
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,666
Now it's my job to keep track
of your wife?

298
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,250
Malka?

299
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,625
She hasn't been home since yesterday.

300
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,791
What?

301
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,583
- Why?
- I don't know.

302
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,416
[Malka] Nobody can find out about this.

303
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,791
- Can we ask your mother a few questions?
- [Malka] No!

304
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,000
You want to scare an old woman?

305
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,833
Her life hasn't been difficult enough?

306
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:08,916
[Esty's grandma] Malka?

307
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,083
Coming, Mommy!

308
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,708
Go search her room.

309
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,250
Esty's room?

310
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,750
It's as she left it
when she moved out to get married.

311
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,083
Not you. You wait here.

312
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,208
[siren wailing outside]

313
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,208
[game playing over phone]

314
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,166
[woman in English]
<i>Yeah, I'm teaching a class!</i>

315
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,833
What is this?

316
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Who are you?

317
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,166
I am Mordecai Schwartz.
This is my daughter.

318
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,916
You're late, I'm here.

319
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,833
We're here to collect the rent.

320
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:17,416
I have a tour coming up in two weeks, OK?
It's two weeks in the Midwest.

321
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,833
I'll get paid right after.
And then I can pay you the back rent.

322
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,583
And then I'll pay you
three months in advance, OK?

323
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,041
My father needs rent.

324
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,458
Yeah, I'm good for it.
I just need two weeks.

325
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,708
[cell phone ringing]

326
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,791
[in Yiddish] Daddy...

327
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,491
[in English] Answer the phone.

328
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:37,791
[cell phone continues ringing]

329
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,750
- [Mordecai in Yiddish] Hello?
- [woman sighs]

330
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,000
[in English] George?
I'll just be one more minute, OK?

331
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,043
- Sorry about this.
- [Mordecai in Yiddish] Dad...

332
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,333
[woman sighs]

333
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,916
- [Mordecai in Yiddish] So what? What?
- [in English] Do you play?

334
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:52,708
The piano?

335
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,333
No.

336
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:55,708
I mean,

337
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,750
sometimes when nobody sees.

338
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,791
Anyway, we don't have one at home.

339
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,675
[in Yiddish]
Why did you send me? Go yourself!

340
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:06,408
- [in English] You're welcome to play here.
- [Mordecai in Yiddish] I don't know!

341
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,303
[in English]
If you want, I could teach you.

342
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,708
- Hmm?
- [Mordecai in Yiddish] Good!

343
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,291
[in English] Really?

344
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,208
[man 8]
Is this your first time in Berlin, Esty?

345
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,916
- Yes.
- Oh, welcome.

346
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,180
[in German] Let's show her something nice.

347
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,267
- [in English] Let's go!
- Like what? Hitler's bunker?

348
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,416
- It's still there?
- No, she's just messing with you.

349
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,666
Or we can take selfies at the memorial
to the murdered Jews of Europe.

350
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,250
That, Yael, is a superb idea.

351
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,000
And the memorial to the murdered
homosexuals is just across the street.

352
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,250
And while we're at it,

353
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,791
there's one to the murdered
Sinti and Romas nearby, too.

354
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,708
[man 8 laughs]

355
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,833
Where are you from, Esty?

356
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
Ah, New York.

357
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,000
- [woman 7] You don't sound like it.
- I've never been anywhere else.

358
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,083
Where are you from?

359
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,916
Yemen. But I grew up near Munich.

360
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,125
And I'm from Israel,
Ahmed is from Nigeria,

361
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,333
Clemens... is German,
but your parents came from...?

362
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:56,041
- Poland.
- Poland, right.

363
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,125
And Robert is the only one of us
who is actually from Berlin.

364
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,000
So he can answer
all your burning questions about the war.

365
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,583
My grandparents
lost their whole families in the camps.

366
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,500
So did half of Israel.

367
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:13,250
But we're too busy defending our present
to be sentimental about our past.

368
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,865
[Robert] You know what's funny?

369
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:18,017
- Yael always talks big, big, big...
- A lot of talking.

370
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,166
[Robert] Yeah, a lot of talking.
But she's never been in military combat.

371
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,208
She was playing the violin
in the military orchestra.

372
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,208
- Oh, was it?
- Yeah.

373
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,041
Like Vivaldi's "Four Seasons"
every weekend, madam?

374
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,458
[Yael] No, no, that's not true.

375
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,958
- Sometimes we played "Beethoven's Ninth."
- [laughter]

376
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,166
Okay?

377
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,708
Are you a musician?

378
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,750
- Not like you.
- Robert...

379
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,166
I play some piano.

380
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,916
Well, at least you have a life. [giggles]

381
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,708
[Ahmed] Robert! [grunts]

382
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,166
[Ahmed grunting]

383
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,250
[Ahmed] Whoa.

384
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,166
[women chattering]

385
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,666
No, it's... Come on.

386
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,875
Wait! No... Shit!

387
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,208
[Yael shouts excitedly]

388
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,125
[Yael] Come on!

389
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:10,958
[laughter]

390
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,833
It's nice, right?

391
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,500
Do you see that villa?

392
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,875
The conference where the Nazis decided to
kill the Jews in the concentration camps

393
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,458
took place in 1942...

394
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:36,958
in that villa.

395
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,166
And you swim in this lake?

396
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,333
Well, the lake is just a lake.

397
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,750
There's more, actually.

398
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,291
When the Berlin Wall was up,

399
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:53,208
East German guards shot anyone who tried
to swim across this lake to freedom.

400
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,166
And now?

401
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,208
Now you can swim as far as you like.

402
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:08,500
[child laughing]

403
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,125
GERMANY

404
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,708
You go in. I'll watch everyone's stuff.

405
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,458
- [Esty] Are you sure?
- Yeah.

406
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,291
Don't worry. I've got it.

407
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:16,041
[sentimental music playing]

408
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,666
[panting]

409
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,708
[exhales heavily]

410
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,791
[panting]

411
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,375
You can't just come
into my apartment like this!

412
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,833
I've been paying my rent on time!

413
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,916
- [Moishe] Where is she?
- Who?

414
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,708
You know exactly who I'm talking about.

415
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,916
- Moishe!
- Jesus! What is wrong with you people?

416
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,458
You're the husband.

417
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,125
She told you about me?

418
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,958
She quit the piano lessons for you.

419
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,375
Tell me where to find her.

420
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,083
- I don't know.
- [Moishe] All right, Ms. Vivian Dropkin.

421
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,766
If you don't tell us where she is,
we'll cut off your electricity.

422
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:38,791
Moishe, stop!

423
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:41,083
[in Yiddish]
Maybe she doesn't know anything.

424
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,806
[in English] We'll cut off your internet.

425
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,916
And then we'll cancel your lease.

426
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,750
And then what?

427
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,125
- [Dasia] <i>Ahmed doesn't know any German.</i>
- [Esty] <i>Really?</i>

428
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:55,666
Yeah, but he thinks he can fake
speaking German with just three words.

429
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,750
OK.

430
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,250
"Really," "exactly" and "correct."

431
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,458
<i>Echt, genau</i> and <i>stimmt.</i>

432
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,375
We have the same words in Yiddish:

433
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,458
<i>Echt, genau, stimmt.</i>

434
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,833
<i>Echt, genau, stimmt?</i>

435
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,416
I will try that,
if I ever go to a dinner party.

436
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
POTSDAMER PLATZ STATION

437
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,291
So you're really going back
to practice now? What, so late?

438
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,875
Yeah, I have to.

439
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,958
The academy is open till midnight.

440
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:25,916
Where are you staying?

441
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,041
Not far from here.

442
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,958
- OK.
- OK.

443
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,916
- [Esty] Mm...
- You've got my number.

444
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,750
- I hope to see you around, Esty.
- Yeah.

445
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:40,875
- Good luck with Dvorak.
- Thank you!

446
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,291
[chuckles]

447
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,000
[in Yiddish] Why Germany?

448
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,541
What do you expect?

449
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:04,000
Huh?

450
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,000
Yanky, one thing leads to another.

451
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,375
You let her take piano lessons
with that non-Jew, right?

452
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,708
[in English] So what?

453
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,231
[in Yiddish] There are greater sins!

454
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,947
Schlomo Moskowitz takes his wife
out to bars in Manhattan!

455
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,958
You hardly know her.

456
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,083
She is my wife!

457
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,250
[Moishe] Exactly.

458
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,500
When you left the community,

459
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,875
did you leave everything behind?

460
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,916
I mean, even your clothes? Your phone?

461
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,583
Esty took nothing because it was
the sabbath and the <i>eruv </i>was broken.

462
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,666
She had no choice.

463
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,458
Did you already check her phone
for funny numbers?

464
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:47,791
Funny numbers?

465
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,000
Bring me her phone.

466
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,000
She has an unchecked voicemail.

467
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,333
Then listen to it.

468
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:15,958
Me?

469
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:18,958
I'm scared.

470
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,833
So?

471
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,791
The doctor's office
called about blood test results

472
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,333
and offered an appointment
for an ultrasound next week.

473
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,583
Ultrasound?

474
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,458
She's pregnant.

475
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,500
[door buzzer sounding]

476
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:05,916
- [guard in German] Good evening!
- [Dasia] Good evening!

477
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:20,750
[woman 10] Do you dance?

478
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,125
[students chattering]

479
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,791
[classical music playing inside]

480
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,583
[in Yiddish] Germany!

481
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,583
It's too much!

482
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,750
And she didn't even
take anything with her!

483
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:04,625
- That depends how you look at it.
- She took the baby!

484
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,041
But why Berlin?

485
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,958
- Think about it.
- What?

486
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,916
Her crazy mother lives in Berlin!

487
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,500
I thought she came from England?

488
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,791
Sure. But she's a German Jew.

489
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,375
She came from Manchester to Williamsburg,

490
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:19,500
but when she left Yanky's father-in-law,
she moved to Germany.

491
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,416
[Symcha sighs] Oy, oy, oy!

492
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,291
We shouldn't have agreed to this marriage.

493
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,750
Mommy, please!

494
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,958
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

495
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,041
[Symcha] Mimi!

496
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,958
He is suffering.

497
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:31,958
You can leave tonight.

498
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,291
The rabbi wants me to go to Berlin?

499
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,416
[rabbi] You've been there before.

500
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,625
Yes.

501
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,791
It wasn't pretty.

502
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,166
[rabbi] Life is a never-ending battle
between good and evil.

503
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,333
God is always testing us.

504
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,916
Anyway, the boy can't handle
a trip to Berlin on his own.

505
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,958
The rabbi wants me to go to Berlin
with Yanky?

506
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,291
Of course he's going with you, Moishe!

507
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,791
That baby is Yanky's baby!

508
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,208
What is she doing here?

509
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,750
I heard you're getting married.

510
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,875
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- No.

511
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,083
Don't go.

512
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,166
You're a bride now, Esty.

513
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,041
I will wait in the kitchen.

514
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:04,291
Thank you.

515
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,333
[woman] <i>You're getting married.</i>

516
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,291
Congratulations!

517
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:18,741
[in English] What do you care?

518
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,958
Esty...

519
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,958
[in Yiddish] I'm your mother.

520
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,809
[in English] You stopped being my mother
the day you left Williamsburg.

521
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,458
[in Yiddish]
No. I will always be your mother.

522
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,901
[in English] No matter where I go.

523
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,416
I wanted to give you this.

524
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,041
What is it?

525
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,291
[Esty's mom] It's paperwork.

526
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,375
Proves your right to German citizenship.

527
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,083
Because my parents, your grandparents,
were born there.

528
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,416
It's just in case you need
somewhere else to go.

529
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,208
Somewhere else to go?

530
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,916
I'm getting married. Don't you get it?

531
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,250
<i>I'm going to make a family
with Yanky Shapiro.</i>

532
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,791
<i>Lots of children. A real home.</i>

533
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,583
I won't ever need anywhere else to go.
This is what I want.

534
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:14,958
OK.

535
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,691
- OK, you think that now...
- Don't you tell me what I think.

536
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:21,125
- You don't even know me.
- [Esty's mom] Maybe not.

537
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,208
But you keep those documents safe, please.

538
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,416

- [Esty's grandma] Esty?

541
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,000
[in Yiddish] How was it?

542
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,541
[Esty sighs]

543
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,291
Let's see the dress.

544
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,583
Don't be scared, Esty.

545
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,583
You'll be so happy.

546
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,666
Rabbi, I don't know if I'm the right...

547
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,875
Bring back Esther Shapiro
and God will take care of you.

548
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,916
He will pay your debts.

[suspenseful music playing]

551
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,833
The rabbi will do all that for me?

552
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:34,708
Moishe, bring back the girl!
