How can we do this if it hurts you?

Be patient.

It's only been three nights.

17

We'll keep trying.

I'm sure this happens to lots of couples.

[Miriam] You tell me.

25
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,958
Yanky left for work half an hour ago.

26
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,166
[Miriam] I know.
He called me from the street.

27
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,875
[Esty] Oh.

28
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,250
So, you didn't finish again last night?

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,708
Yanky told you?

30
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,541
Of course. He tells me everything.

31
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,625
I'm his mother.

32
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,225
It's only been a week since the wedding!

33
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,325
How many times have you tried?

34
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,750
I'm not sure.

35
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,750
Well...

36
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,208
I've brought something that will help you.

37
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,541
What is this?

38
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,541
Read the instructions on the box.

39
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,833
It makes things easier... down there.

40
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,083
You should figure this out

41
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,000
before that boy loses his confidence.

42
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,750
Do you understand?

43
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,875
- [Esty] I...
- Yanky is... very sensitive.

44
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,208
- You have to make him feel...
- Like a king.

45
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,250
I know.

46
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,875
A man should feel like a king in bed.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,708
My Yanky should always feel like a king.

48
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,916
Does that make me a queen?

[Esty] Hello.

57
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,875
I submitted an application.

58
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,041
[secretary] I remember.

59
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,125
I'd like to withdraw it now
and cancel my audition.

61
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,541
You think you are the first person
to panic before a live performance?

62
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,208
No, but I...

63
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,291
When is your audition?

64
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,875
I don't know.

65
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,116
[secretary] <i>You must have received
a letter in the post.</i>

67

[Esty] <i>Yes. Esther Shapiro.</i>

Do you know how difficult it is
to get these experts in a room? Hmm?

00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,666
Our professors are famous musicians.

70
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,875
Show some respect.

71
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,416
[man in Yiddish]
Thank you for coming, Rabbi.

72
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,125

74
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,708
She's been like this all day!

75
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,041
With all she's lived through...

76
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,541
And now this business with Esther...

77
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,916
Heaven protect us.

78
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,041
What business with Esty?

79
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,416
What happened?

80
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,750
[rabbi] Don't worry. Please.

81
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,791
Her husband's gone
to fetch her from Berlin.

82
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,625
And she's pregnant. That's a good thing!

83
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,625
- [Malka] Pregnant?
- [Esty's grandpa] Pregnant?

84
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,791
Did you know?

85
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,000
If Esty's pregnant,
then why did she leave?

86
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,083
They tried for so long.

87
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,708
We should have been kinder to her.

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,125
To Esty?

89
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,125
To the mother.

90
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,291
What was her name again?

91
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,958
[Malka] What do you mean, Mommy?

92
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,416
She was so young

93
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
when she came from England...

94
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,000
She was a dishonorable woman.

95
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,750
She abandoned Esty
and left Motty in a scandal!

96
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,208
Motty's a drunk.

97

Why are you thinking about her?

100
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,416
Esty called me.

101
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,333
- When, Mommy?
- From Germany?

102
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,708
Far away, she said.

103
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,625
And what else did she say, Mrs. Schwartz?

104
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,958
I don't know.

105
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,375
I hung up.

106
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,541
Did you know that during the war,

107
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,375
Jews hid from the Gestapo here?

108
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,666
In the vault of a famous singer
named Schwartz.

109
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,125
Like your Esty!

110
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,541
They also hid Torah scrolls
and ceremonial objects here.

111
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,500
Even if we find Esty in this city...

112
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,041
How do you know she'll come back?

113
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,625
They always come back.

114
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,166
Look at me.

115
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,708
You?

116
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,291
You can't even find the author
of the holy vessel's grave.

117
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,541
We'll find the grave
and pray for guidance.

Um...

The pregnancy test at home was positive

121
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,833
and then I had a blood test last week.

122
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,625
But I left New York
before I got the results.

[Yanky in Yiddish] <i>Where to?</i>

124
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,083
Wait a minute.

This is the largest
Jewish cemetery in Europe.

126
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,083
There are more than 100,000 graves here!

127
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,625
What do you want?

128
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,666
I want to go back and speak
with Leah Mandelbaum as soon as possible,

129
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,291
since you're so sure she's lying.

130
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,750
But I told you, she's at work.

131
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,375
I looked her up on my phone.

132
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,250
She works at an old folks' home.

133
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,625
So I'll go to the old folks' home.

Options?

Termination is only legal in Germany
until the end of the first trimester.

138
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,791
But I don't wanna terminate the pregnancy.

139

00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,283
[student in English] Hi, Esty.

186
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,708
Salim.

187
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,625
I didn't expect...

188
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, I work here. It's my student job.

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,916
Robert went after you last night,
but you had disappeared.

190
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,166
- It was late.
- Mmm.

191
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,750
I guess Yael was too harsh.

192
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,875
But she didn't mean it
the way she said it.

193
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,125
I think she did, actually.

194
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,750
But I guess I had to hear it.

195
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,000
Anyway, can I help you with anything here?

196
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,333
Yeah...

197
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,291
I need some... information.

198
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,958
How does this work?

199
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,666
You've never used a search engine before?

200
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,166
Well, it's not complicated.

201
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,833
Look...

202
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,458
You open this window
and you type a question up here,

203
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,541
in this bar.

204
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,833
[Esty] Anything?

205
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,250
- Anything.
- Okay...

206
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,625
Is there a god?

207
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,166
[sniggers] Start small.

208
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,791
There are too many answers.

209
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,375
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

210
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,791
You can ask, but you still
have to choose the right answer.

211
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,791
Here.

212
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,500
In case you need to write anything down.

213
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,250
And, hey...

214
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,791
you should give Robert or Dasia a call.

215
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,750
They were worried about you.

216
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,761
[in Yiddish]
Moishe, what are we doing here?

217
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,333
This is a tradition, Yanky.

218
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,333
First, you pay respects to Rabbi Samuel,

219
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,541
then you pay respects to Igor Idov!

220
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,105
[Igor in Russian] I'll call you back.

221
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,125
[in Yiddish] The good rabbi's ghost
watches over this place.

222
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,875
[both men laughing]

223
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,750
[Igor in English] Oi! Good to see you!

224
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,375
My little cousin Yanky.

225
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,220
Your wife ran off
to join the circus, right?

226
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,625
You've come to the right place.

227
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,041
[in Yiddish] On the road,
there's a different Torah.

228
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,250
What do you mean by that?

229
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,541
[in English] What happens in Berlin,
stays in Berlin. Don't worry.

230
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,458
[in Russian] Ah, Trine.
Come over here, please, and meet Yanky.

231
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,041
[in English]
Hi, Yanky. What's your pleasure?

232
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,458
- She will take good care of you.
- Mmm... Yanky...

233
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,833
[Igor in Russian]
Come on, Yanky! Hurry up!

234
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,500
[Igor and Moishe laugh]

235
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,833
[Trine] There we are. Nice.

236
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,125
- [in English] Let's take off some clothes.
- Don't touch me. Please.

237
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,458
I can't do this.

238
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,250
[in Russian] Damn it...

239
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,375
Get up.

240
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,041
[in English] Stand up. Come on. Stand.

241
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:29,916
Stay.

242
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,376
[in Russian] Stand.
You don't need to do anything.

243
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,476
- [in English] Don't do anything.
- No, no! I mean it.

244
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,666
I cannot touch any woman but my wife.

245
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,750
[Trine sighs]

246
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,250
So how is the family?

247
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,250
I wouldn't know.

248
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,570
I didn't expect to see you again.

249
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,958
I try not to question
God's mysterious ways.

250
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,791
So what can I do for you?

251
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,708
I want you

252
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,958
to call a poker game.

253
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,583
[Igor laughs]

254
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,000
- [laughs] Moishe...
- [Moishe] Just do it.

255
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,125
[in Russian] No risk, no champagne.

256
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,458
[in English] I'm not sure.

257
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm feeling lucky.

258
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,291
I don't know anything... about women.

259
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,458
If I...

260
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
could touch you...

261
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,000
what would you like?

262
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,750
I can do whatever <i>you </i>like.

263
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,541
No.

264
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,541
Yes, I mean...

265
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,291
[Yanky sighs]

266
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,541
Tell me what...

267
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,333
you like.

268
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,208
What gives you...

269
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,041
pleasure?

270
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,291
You need to touch her first.

271
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,541
To touch her face...

272
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,875
[in Russian]...there.

273
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,208
You touch her head

274
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,583
and then very slowly...

275
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,375
[in English]...her boobs.

276
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,833
[choir singing]

277
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,125
[in German] We'll do Mendelssohn's
"Hebe deine Augen auf" next, please.

278
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,666
[singing continues]

279
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,666
POLICE

280
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,958
[in German] If we put the curls in,
we can put it up a bit.

281
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,833
Did you take your medicine?

282
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,316
[Yanky in English] Mrs. Mandelbaum?

283
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,625
What are you doing here?

284
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,291
- I'm working.
- I know.

285
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,291
- Yeah, then you have to go.
- I'm alone.

286
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,958
[in Yiddish] Mr. Katz, I'll bathe you now.

287
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,541
Who is he?

288
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,041
I'm her son-in-law.

289
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,958
I didn't even know you had a daughter.

290
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,125
[Leah] All right, Mr. Katz?

291
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,333
Close your eyes!

292
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,085
[in English]
You said you no longer speak Yiddish.

293
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,916
- Only at work.
- [Yanky] Why?

294
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,833
What else was I to do?

295
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,708
No education, no skills...

296
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,583
I didn't speak Yiddish as well
as everyone else in Williamsburg,

297
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,546
but I spoke it well enough
to get me a job here.

298
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,166
You have no idea
how the real world works.

299
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,650
You could have stayed in our world.

300
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,458
We take care of women in Williamsburg.

301
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,541
Do you? Really?

302
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,416
My husband was a drunk who could barely
take care of himself, let alone a family.

303
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,260
I didn't see you people
come running to help.

304
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,696
[in Yiddish] And the other side.

305
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,416
[in English] So...

306
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,000
you miss nothing?

307
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,375
I miss plenty.

308
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,416
But I thank God every day for my freedom.

309
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,583
God?

310
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,250
What? You think you own him, too?

311
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,416
So much damage done in Brooklyn
in the name of God.

312
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,041
All the rules. All the gossip.

313
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,416
No wonder Esty couldn't stand it.

314
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,833
[children chattering]

315
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,708
[cups clattering]

316
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,625
[cutlery clattering]

317
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
[in Yiddish] I want to go home.

318
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,666
Your home is here with Yanky now!

319
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,291
You just got married a few months ago!

320
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,500
What would people say?

321
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,041
Please let me go
back to Grandma's for a while.

322
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,583
Is it the marital relations?

323
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,083
It just doesn't work.

324
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,083
We try but it hurts so much.

325
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:48,625
Non-Jewish couples must get instructions
on YouTube or something...

326
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,708
YouTube?

327
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,458
Jewish women have ten times
as many babies as non-Jewish women.

328
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:57,083
And no one in Williamsburg has YouTube!

329
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,791
You think they had YouTube
in the old country?

330
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,125
In Hungary?

331
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,875
In the displaced persons camp
where Grandpa married Grandma?

332
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,833
What is wrong with you?

333
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,666
I don't know.

334
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,833
You're not going back to Grandma.

335
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,500
We can't have Miriam Shapiro
telling the whole world you're defective.

336
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,541
What do you want?

337
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,791
To give Grandma and Grandpa
more bad news?

338
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,625
In their old age?

339
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,791
And fragile condition?

340
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,541
You will have no leverage
in this marriage until there's a baby.

341
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,083
Understand me?

342
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,250
You have to focus.

343
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,416
Okay.

344
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,875
I'll give up the piano.

345
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,958
You still take lessons
with that non-Jew teacher?

346
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,750
[in English] No more lessons.

347
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,958
[Malka] This is the right attitude, Esty.

348
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,301
[in Yiddish]
Now you're Yanky Shapiro's wife.

349
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,625
A man can derive great pleasure
from these parts of his body.

350
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,666
By doing the deed, you can give him
pleasure in a permitted way.

351
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,291
And pleasuring your husband's body

352
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,416
will get you what you want, which is?

353
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,208
[in English] A baby!

354
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Exactly.

355
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:36,041
[in Yiddish] Now this machine
will assess your anxiety level.

356
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,791
I don't have any anxiety.

357
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,083
We'll see about that.

358
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,125
Give me your hand!

359
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,666
[machine whirring]

360
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,375
[woman] Oh, my.

361
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,166
- [machine beeping]
- What?

362
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,708
In fact, your anxiety is out of control.

363
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,958
You're saying it's my fault
the sex hasn't worked?

364
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,333
[in English] Your mind and your body
are not communicating with each other.

365
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,708
[in Yiddish]
You have what I'd call vaginismus.

366
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:21,833
Is it a disease?

367
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,416
Not like the measles or anything...

368
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,458
Is there a cure for it?

369
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,250
[in English] Well...

370
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,541
[in Yiddish] Kind of.
Where's your bedroom?

371
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,500
Close your eyes.

372
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,750
Now inhale through your nose and imagine

373
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:46,750
you are smelling a fragrant rose
for four seconds.

374
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,250
[Esty inhales]

375
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:55,125
Then breathe out from your mouth
for seven seconds.

376
00:30:55,541 --> 00:31:01,041
[Esty exhales]

377
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,666
[Esty inhales]

378
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:10,583
[Esty exhales]

379
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,458
[woman inhales]

380
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,125
[woman exhales]

381
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,291
[in English] That's it?

382
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,000
[in Yiddish] I want you to do this
every night before bed. Okay?

383
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,666
And I'm going to give you
a series of exercises

384
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,208
to do at the same time.

385
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:44,208
We'll have you pregnant in no time.

386
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,916
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Katz.

387
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,625
Have a good one, Leah!

388
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,833
- [in English] I want to believe you.
- Then believe me.

389
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,750
Esty isn't staying with me.

390
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,628
And if you knew where she was,
you would tell me?

391
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,916
Again. Yes. But you have to leave now.

392
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,250
I have things to do.

393
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,333
- But Moishe says...
- Moishe's a<i> schmuck.</i>

394
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,000
[sighs]

395
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,541
- Just call me if you hear anything.
- Sure.

396
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,041
[footsteps approaching]

397
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,416
[women chattering]

398
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,125
[women laughing]

399
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,000
[women whooping]

400
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,666
[whoops]

401
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,291
[whoops]

402
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,250
[speaks indistinctly in Yiddish]

403
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,500
- [Robert in English] Hey, stranger.
- Hi, Robert.

404
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,125
We were really
worried about you last night.

405
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,541
I needed some air.

406
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,708
Well, I'm glad you're back.

407
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,708
Me too.

408
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,375
And... I need your help with something.

409
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,083
My audition is Thursday morning.

410
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,250
You're going through with it?

411
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,666
I need this scholarship.

412
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,791
More than anything.

413
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
I can't go back where I came from.

414
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,166
[door opens]

415
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,166
[in Yiddish] I thought you were clean.

416
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,708
Didn't you go to the <i>mikvah </i>today?

417
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,833
Yes.

418
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,166
[Yanky] Come over here, then.

419
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,291
It's so hard, Yanky.

420
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,458
- I don't know...
- Have you been doing the exercises?

421
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,708
Yes, of course.

422
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,458
What do you think?

423
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,375
And honestly?

424
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,583
They hurt.

425
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,250
They hardly make the idea
of the real thing very appealing.

426
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Appealing?

427
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:11,916
Esty!

428
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,833
We've been married for almost a year!

429
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,166
Procreation is the first commandment
in the Torah.

430
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,958
We have to make a family,
whether that appeals to you, or not.

431
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,833
So I'm selfish
because I don't want it to hurt?

432
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,708
Even the Talmud promises

433
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,250
some pleasure from making a family.

434
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,875
The Talmud says very clearly

435
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,958
that a husband should make sure

436
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,625
his wife experiences pleasure.

437
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,541
Women aren't allowed to read the Talmud!

438
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,583
[Yanky sighs]

439
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:51,916
Look...

440
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,416
I'm sorry...

441
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,791
about the exercises.

442
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,375
I don't want to hurt you.

443
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,708
Really?

444
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,750
Then tell your mother and sister

445
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,958
not to check in on us all the time.

446
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,416
"Have they? Haven't they?"

447
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,416
"Will they seal the deal
or is Esty defective?"

448
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,458
"Should they go straight for IVF?"

449
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:23,750
I hear their voices in my head, Yanky.

450
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,625
How will we ever do this successfully?

451
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,625
Your whole family is in bed with us!

452
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,416
They mean well.

453
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,708
[in English] Fine!

454
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,833
[Esty exhales]

455
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,916
[Esty inhales]

456
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,291
[Esty exhales]

457
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,791
[in Yiddish] Ready?

458
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,125
[Esty continues breathing loudly]

459
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,958
[Esty gasps]

460
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,000
[Esty breathes heavily]

461
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,250
[Esty] Keep going.

462
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,250
Are you sure?

463
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,333
- [Yanky groans]
- [Esty gasps in pain]

464
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,875
[Esty panting]

465
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,208
- Push harder.
- [Yanky groans]

466
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,375
Don't stop!

467
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,958
- [Esty gasping in pain]
- [Yanky panting]

468
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:56,541
[both panting]

469
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,875
[in English] Wow.

470
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,458
[in Yiddish] That felt so...

471
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,791
amazing.

472
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,875
[Yanky breathes heavily]

473
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:23,958
[Yanky laughing]

474
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,916
[printer whirring]

475
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:29,875
Esty!

476
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,726
- [Esty] Hey.
- [Dasia in English] How are you?

477
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,470
- [Esty] Good.
- [Dasia] What are you doing?

478
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,250
[Esty] Big secret.

479
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,791
Thank you for dinner last night.

480
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,666
Sorry I rushed out.

481
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,416
Are you coming tonight?

482
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,291
Where?

483
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,000
Yael is performing...

484
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:53,791
at a club.

485
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,583
[Esty chuckles]

486
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,791
We've got to get changed first, though.

487
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,250
- [Esty] Here?
- [Dasia] Come on.

488
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,125
[suspenseful music playing]

489
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:12,416

[techno music playing]

491
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,458
[in German] Hello.
Our friend put us on the guest list.

492
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,375
- [bouncer] Her name?
- Yael Roubeni.

493
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:25,041
- [bouncer] Here's your stamp.
- [in English] Yep.

494
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:00,041
[Robert] Two beers and two waters.

495
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,958
[techno music continues playing]

496
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,750
[in English] Esty. It's just me!

497
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,000
Guys!

498
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,375
[Robert] Oh, hey! Are you okay?

499
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:26,416
- I've never seen anything like this.
- [Ahmed] But isn't it splendid?

500
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,166
[Esty] I don't know yet.

501
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,791
All my life, I've been warned
that all this would kill me.

502
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,208
Which part?

503
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,916
- [Mike] The sweaty people? Smoking?
- Techno?

504
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Sex?

505
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,000
[laughter]

506
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:41,083
- You're here! Hey!
- [Ahmed] Hey!

507
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,041
- Yay!
- I'm so excited for you to perform.

508
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm excited... No, I'm not excited at all!

509
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,583
[Ahmed] Are you nervous?

510
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,750
- Ah... No, not water.
- You get a beer.

511
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,000
To us! Yeah!

512
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,625
Cheers, guys!

513
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,500
- Cheers!
- We'll cheer together, okay?

514
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:55,416
Hey, hey, hey!

515
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,541
Where's the eye contact?

516
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:01,458
Oh, Esty. Toasts are accompanied by deep
and meaningful stares in this country.

517
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,666
- [women laughing]
- [Ahmed] Cheers!

518
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,750

[woman sings]

521
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,125
- [in German] My assistant?
- [woman] Your ascendant.

522
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,208
It defines how you affect
your environment.

523
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,041
I'd prefer an assistant.

524
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,791
Nice haircut.

525
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,750
[in English] What?

526
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,458
[woman] Nice haircut.

527
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,375
Thank you.

528
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,166
I love your red lipstick.

529
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,541
You want some?

530
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,416
Looks good!

531
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,000
- [in German] Thanks!
- You're welcome!

532
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,208
