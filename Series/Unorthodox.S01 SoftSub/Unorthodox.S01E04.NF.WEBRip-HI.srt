1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,625
[in Yiddish] Time for the four questions.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,083
Come on, dear.
You were so excited for this.

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,958
"Dear Father,

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:22,291
I'd like to ask you four questions.

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,916
Dear Father,
I asked you the four questions.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,083
Now please give me an answer."

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,708
"And the answer is:

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,750
we were slaves to the pharaoh in Egypt.

9
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,541
And the Lord took us out of there.

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:49,416
And if He didn't take
our forefathers out of Egypt,

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,416
then we and our children
and our children's children

12
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:00,000
would still be enslaved
to the pharaoh in Egypt."

13
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,125
We tell ourselves the story of Passover

14
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,875
to remind us of our suffering.

15
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,666
Not only from the Egyptians.

16
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,875
But also the inquisition,

17
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,958
the Chmielnicki uprising, the Pogroms,

18
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,625
the Nazis.

19
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875
May their memories be erased.

20
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:25,833
In every generation,
they rise up against us.

21
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:31,583
When we trusted our friends and neighbors,

22
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,666
God punished us.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,500
When we tried to wear their clothes
and speak their tongue, God punished us.

24
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,875
When we forget who we are,

25
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,875
we invite God's wrath.

26
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,500
It's why we are all sitting here now.

27
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,750
Now we accept who we are.

28
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,333
And that is the only way

29
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,375
to be free.

30
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,458
[sentimental music playing]

31
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,416
[Esty's grandfather continues praying]

32

[sentimental music continues playing]

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,083
[Esty breathes heavily]

34
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,333
[sighs]

35
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,041
[whispers Yiddish prayer]

36

[guests praying in Yiddish]

[baby gurgling]

38
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,458
[woman cooing]

39
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,875
[woman] Isn't he cute?

40
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
He's very cute.

41
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,166
If you ever want to talk,

42
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,666
let me know.

43
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,416
[baby crying]

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,916
At the beginning, it was hard for me, too.

45
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,041
But now I've got five and six on the way.

46
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,625
Thank God!

47
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,708
[Esty] I'm so happy for you.

48
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,333
[baby continues crying]

49
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,416
[in English] I'm sorry...

50
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,333
[in Yiddish] I need some air.

51
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,000
[baby continues crying]

[melancholic music playing]

53
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,041
Yanky!

54
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,708
I have something to tell you.

55
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,666
[Yanky] You left me alone
with your entire family tonight.

56
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,416
Sit down!

57
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,500
My mother says we can't go on like this.

58
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,708
Like what?

59
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,916
We have to change something.

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,916
Your mother told you that?

61
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,750
I want a divorce.

62
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,375
A divorce?

63
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,500
She says you'll never
be a good wife to me.

64
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,833
- But...
- We finished once!

65
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Only once.

66
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,625
It always hurts you.

67
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,666
It's always something with you.

68
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,958
And I'm still young enough to remarry.

69
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,000
What else can I do?

70
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,791
You're asking me?

71
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,716
Has your mother
already called the matchmaker?

72
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,916
Has she?

73
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Calm down!

74
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,250
Fine!

75
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,166
[shouts] God help me!

76
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,041
[suspenseful music playing]

77
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,125
Where were you?

78
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,625
So a Jew is stranded on a desert island.

79
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,833
A ship shows up to save him.

80
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,500
He shows the captain around.

81
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,791
The Jew points out a house he's built
and says, "That's my synagogue."

82
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,375
They walk around

83
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,041
and the Jew points out another house.

84
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,978
"That's the other synagogue," he says.

85
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,083
The captain is confused and asks him,

86
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,833
"You're only one guy,
so why do you need two synagogues?"

87
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,458
The Jew says,

88
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,583
"Oh, I never go into that one."

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,541
You stink like an ashtray.

90
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,583
- [Mike in English] They read the review...
- [Ahmed] It's gonna be a... two-plus?

91
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,083
[Mike] A two-plus...
From one to five, or from one to ten?

92
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Esty!

93
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,000
What a lovely surprise!

94
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,958
No worries.

95
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,625
Your secret is safe with us.

96
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,166
Which secret?

97
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,666
[both chuckle]

98
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,791
- Mike's just made coffee. Have a seat.
- [Mike] Yeah.

99
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks, but... Have you seen Dasia?

100
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,208
No, I think...
Yeah, I think she already left for school.

101
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,291
Do you think I can get my things
from her room?

102
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,625
Of course.

103
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,791
Thank you.

104
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,375
I'll be back in a minute.

105
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,041
[Moishe exhales]

106
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,868
[in Yiddish] So I found Esty.

107
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,583
What?

108
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,083
Where?

109
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,416
Exactly where I told you she'd be.

110
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,333
That's impossible.

111
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,250
Leah Mandelbaum said she'd call me
if she heard anything.

112
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,041
That woman is a deviant, Yanky.

113
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,958
Why would you believe anything she said?

114
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,500
Why would I believe anything you say?

115
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,083
Who is that?

116
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,166
[Moishe] Who do you think?

117
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,083
[sentimental music playing]

118
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,958
Who's she with?

119
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,791
[Moishe] Ask her yourself.

120
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,875
How do I make this bigger?

121
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,166
[in English] Audition?

122
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,000
[in Yiddish] That letter was addressed

123
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,916
to Leah Mandelbaum's apartment.

124
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,583
[Ahmed in English]
So, are you ready for your audition?

125
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,250
No.

126
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,583
When is it?

127
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:03,916
Tomorrow morning.

128
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,458
9:00 a.m.

129
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,333
Well, that gives you exactly
23 more hours to panic.

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,791
Coffee first, panic later.

131
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,166
Okay?

132
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,083
Well, much more importantly,
what are you going to wear?

133
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,166
This...

134
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,541
[Ahmed] Okay.

135
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,541
But add some lipstick.
It looked great on you last night.

136
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,791
[Robert] Hi.

137
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,166
Good morning.

138
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,666
- Hungry?
- [Robert chuckles]

139
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,255
Do you still want to do...
what we talked about?

140
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,916
- Because I just saw...
- Yes, yes.

141
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,666
Yes, please.

142
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,458
May I ask
where you're taking this young lady?

143
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:49,833
Uh-uh.

144
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,916
You'll see.

145
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,458
Did you tell him about me?

146
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,125
Of course. He's a really nice guy.

147
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, hi, Esty. Nice to meet you. Come in.

148
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

149
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,333
Yes...

150
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,916
[Malka in Yiddish] <i>Mommy!</i>

151
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,541
They had nice cherries
at Mr. Silverman's for 50% off.

152
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,125
We can bake a pie for tomorrow.

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mommy?

154
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,125
Malky,

155
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,500
my heart...

156
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,416
[Malka] What's wrong?

157
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,416
- What is it?
- [Esty's grandma moans]

158
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,458
Hold on to me.

159
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,208
- Hold on to me.
- [Esty's grandma moans]

160
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,791
Mommy, hold on to me.

161
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,791
[footsteps running upstairs]

162
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,833
[Yanky in English] You lied to me.

163
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,625
I know she's here.

164
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,333
[Leah] She's not!

165
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,708
[Yanky] Then where is she?

166
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,625
I know about the audition.

167
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,750
[shouts] Tell me the truth!
Where is my wife?

168
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,833
[Leah shouts] Stop it!

169
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,916
[both breathe heavily]

170
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,166
[Yanky cries]

171
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,583
[sobs] I'm sorry.

172
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,250
[Yanky crying]

173
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,291
[Yanky breathing heavily]

174
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,625
I asked her for a divorce.

175
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,708
Why?

176
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,416
Because I didn't think
she could get pregnant.

177
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,333
But then she did.

178
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,000
Esty's pregnant?

179
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,458
That's why you're chasing her, isn't it?

180
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,166
That's why the rabbi
sent your cousin after her.

181
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,916
I have to take her home.

182
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,666
That's my child she's carrying.
What else can I do?

183
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,708
Ask Esty what she wants.

184
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,875
[tires squealing]

185
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,875
[Esty panting]

186
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,916
[Esty yells]

187
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,916
[Esty yelling]

188
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,561
- [Esty whimpers] No!
- [woman in German] Do you need help? Hey!

189
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,916
[Esty shouts]

190
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,666
[in Yiddish] Don't touch me!

191
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,208
God's watching you.

192
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,291
Me?

193
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,375
Both of us.

194
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,958
And what does God think of you, Esther?

195
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,208
Who is this person?

196
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,208
[in English] Igor,
say hello to my cousin's wife, Esther.

197
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,250
I don't think you properly met.

198
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,041
[Igor] Shalom.

199
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,625
[Esty in Yiddish] Don't touch me!

200
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,708
Go!

201
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,458
Sit.

202
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
What are we doing here?

203
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,833
Sit.

204
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,875
Do you know Mr. Auerbach?

205
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,041
From the bakery?

206
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,478
[in English] Is this a trick question?

207
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,096
[in Yiddish]
Of course I know Mr. Auerbach.

208
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,208
He was born here.

209
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
What?

210
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,625
On this playground?

211
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,166
[Moishe] More or less.

212
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,708
There was a building here before the war.
It was bombed.

213
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,625
He was born in the building.

214
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,250
[in English] In 1932.

215
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,375
[in Yiddish] His parents got him out
on the last train to Rotterdam.

216
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,375
He made his way alone to England
and then to New York.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,916
Everyone else was rounded up
on the street over there...

218
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,583
and taken away and killed in the camps.

219
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,166
Mr. Auerbach never saw his parents again.

220
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,916
That's a terrible story.

221
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,333
But Mr. Auerbach now has 13 children
and 30 grandchildren...

222
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,541
And a thriving bakery in Williamsburg.

223
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,791
Because he got out of this place!

224
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,583
This place is full of Jewish souls, Esty.

225
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,916
The souls of a million dead!

226
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,333
You want to raise a child
among all these dead?

227
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,000
The dead are with us anyway, Moishe!

228
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,666
It doesn't matter where we live.

229
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,625
You think my grandma doesn't eat
every single meal of her life

230
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,541
with the souls
of her dead parents and siblings?

231
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
No.

232
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,291
But thanks to your selfish ways,
now she's got another soul to feed.

233
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,041
Yours.

234
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,291
- [in English] In the kitchen?
- You shouldn't have!

235
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,323
[in Yiddish] How's your mother?

236
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,208
Not good. The doctor says
she's had a series of heart attacks.

237
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,500
But she wants to stay home.

238
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,666
She refuses to go to the hospital.

239
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,125
Let me know if we can help.

240
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,750
Thank you.

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,250
[in English] By the way...

242
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
[in Yiddish] Yanky's found Esty.

243
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,875
Did he tell her my mother's dying?

244
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:49,791
Of course not.

245
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,125
He has enough to worry about, chasing
down his crazy wife in a foreign country!

246
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,666
[in English] It takes two.

247
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,708
[in Yiddish]
Esty didn't ruin the marriage alone.

248
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,833
[Moishe] What will you do here?

249
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,666
With no skills, no money,
no experience, no contacts.

250
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,500
The world is a scary place.

251
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,375
You still have
a little cash in your pocket.

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,083
Your body is still warm from the meals
Yanky provided for you.

253
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,250
Give it a few months.

254
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,083
Talk to me when you're cold and hungry,

255
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,833
a world away
from anyone who ever cared for you!

256
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,375
I'll still have my mother.

257
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,333
Your mother?

258
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,750
The one who abandoned you

259
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,333
to wipe old peoples' asses
halfway around the world?

260
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,958
You think she'll welcome you
and your baby

261
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,125
into the home she shares
with her non-Jew lover?

262
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,125
No, Esty.

263
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,291
You've made your bed.

264
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,666
And now you're all alone in it.

265
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,000
Eventually, you'll come crawling back
to the community, of course.

266
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,041
But then it will be too late.

267
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,750
Things will never be the same.

268
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,333
What is that?

269
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,708
Come back now, Esty.

270
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,375
Or you'll always be
the Jew who lost their way,

271
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
waiting for God's final judgment.

272
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,125
There is one other way out.

273
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,375
Moishe.

274
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,750
Put it down!

275
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,583
Foolish girl.

276
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,541
I'm not going to shoot you.

277
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,541
If you don't come back,

278
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,375
you'll do it yourself.

279
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,541
[Esty breathes nervously]

280
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,791
[melancholic music playing]

281
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,333
[Vivian in English]
So, tell me everything.

282
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,625
How are you?

283
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,458
Pregnant.

284
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,041
But isn't that what you wanted?

285
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,708
Not like this.

286
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,750
This is America, Esty.

287
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,375
- You can make your own decisions.
- Williamsburg is not America.

288
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,416
You don't know the rules.

289
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,125
The rules are imaginary.

290
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,958
The <i>eruv </i>wires around the neighborhood
aren't electric,

291
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,791
there's no moat around the kingdom
of Williamsburg filled with crocodiles...

292
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,583
Their power is just in your head.

293
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,958
The Talmud says...

294
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,583
If not me, then who?

295
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,625
If not now, then when?

296
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
[Vivian] What is this?

297
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,916
Documents from my mother,

298
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,250
proving my right to German citizenship.

299
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:20,916
So...

300
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,666
will you help me?

301
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,833
[Esty] Hello.

302
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,250
How are you doing?

303
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,208
Good.

304
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
Um...

305
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,625
- This is my...
- Jewelry?

306
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,541
- Yeah.
- [man] Right.

307
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,375
All right, let's see what we've got here.

308
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:58,166
Two pearl necklaces, diamond earrings,
and pearl earrings?

309
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,375
How much for all of this?

310
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:16,458
I can give you 2,000 on consignment,
or 1,300 if you want the cash up-front.

311
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,125
I'm in a really tight spot here.

312
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,625
Is that really all you can do?

313
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,708
You, me, and everyone else, right?

314
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,666
Tight spots are my specialty.

315
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,708
All right, I'll give you 1,500 cash.
That's all I can do.

316
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Okay.

317
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,291
[door buzzer sounds]

318
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:56,833
[Leah in German] <i>Hello?</i>

319
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,458
[in English] It's Esty.

320
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,083
[Leah] <i>Esty?</i>

321
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,916
[door buzzer sounds]

322
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,916
What happened?

323
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:18,333
Oh, Esty. Come, come inside.

324
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,666
[Esty breathing heavily]

325
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:34,958
[Esty sniffling]

326
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,791
[Leah] Oh, my God.

327
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,208
Okay...

328
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,830
- Can I take this?
- No, no.

329
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,291
[Leah] Okay, don't worry.

330
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,958
Don't worry.

331
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,625
- [Leah exhales]
- [Esty sniffling]

332
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,375
He chased me.

333
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,208
He wants to take me back to Williamsburg.

334
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:54,625
Moishe?

335
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,916
Did Moishe give you this?

336
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,458
- Did he follow you here?
- You know Moishe?

337
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,458
There's always a Moishe.

338
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,646
They would do anything, say anything,

339
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,666
to make you believe
you will not survive in the outside world.

340
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,333
But he's right.

341
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,583
I'm pregnant,

342
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,500
and I have no money, no education.

343
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,541
I have nothing to give this child.

344
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,291
You're its mother.

345
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:21,791
You'll give it your love.

346
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,458
Like you gave me yours?

347
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:33,625
- I don't even know what mothers do.
- I'll help you.

348
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:34,541
[Esty] Stop it.

349
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,958
- I promise I'll help you.
- I said, stop it!

350
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,250
No,

351
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,750
I won't stop.

352
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,208
This is the first time in 15 years
I get to speak to you without a chaperone.

353
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,166
No Malka, no <i>Babby.</i>

354
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,291
Listen to me.
I love you, and I'll help you.

355
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,500
- You left me.
- [Leah] No, I didn't.

356
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,708
You left when I was three,
and <i>Babby </i>and Malka had no choice...

357
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,250
You were taken from me.

358
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,333
- That's a lie.
- [Leah] No.

359
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,833
No, it isn't.

360
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,750
Look...

00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,375
Thank you.

542
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:16,833
[Yanky] Listen...

543
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,791
I know about the baby.

544
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,125
It's a miracle, actually!

545
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,208
That's true.

546
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,625
Come home with me.

547
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:50,208
We'll be a family.

548
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,083
It's everything we always wanted.

549
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,208
- Esty...
- Is it?

550
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,291
Today,

551
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,333
when you sang that song,

552
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,083
I was reminded of our wedding.

553
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,458
We were so happy that day.

554
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:12,083
I was happy because I thought marrying you

555
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,666
was the beginning of a new life.

556
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,583
- But instead...
- We'll start over again!

557
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,541
You asked for a divorce.

558
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,333
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

559
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,000
Not just that...

560
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:29,000
Everything will be different
now that we have a child.

561
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,541
- It's not that simple.
- I know!

562
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,000
You were unhappy all the time.

563
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:40,583
I told myself
something was wrong with you.

564
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,958
But nothing

565
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,458
is wrong with you.

566
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,916
You're just different.

567
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,000
You said it yourself when we met.

568
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:55,708
So...

569
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:03,041
I can't go back.

570
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,083
Yes...

571
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,666
Yes, you can.

572
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,833
You'll see.

573
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,583
I can be different, too.

574
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,583
- Stop! Yanky!
- You don't believe me?

575
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,875
Stop!

576
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,500
Yanky, stop.

577
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:30,583
[cries] No.

578
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,916
[Yanky sobs]

579
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:47,166
[Esty moans]

580
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,458
- How about now?
- [Esty sighs]

581
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,083
Will you stay with me now?

582
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,833
[whispers] It's too late, Yanky.

583
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,916
Don't you understand?

584
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,916
It's too late.

585
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,000
Esther Shapiro.

586
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,791
Will you stay with me now?

587
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,083
We'll be back for that baby.

588
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,875
[Moishe laughs]

589
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,958
[sentimental music playing]

590
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,916
[chattering]

591
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,791
[child laughing]

592
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,291
[child in German] Mummy...

593
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,208
[sentimental music playing]

594
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,125
There she is.
