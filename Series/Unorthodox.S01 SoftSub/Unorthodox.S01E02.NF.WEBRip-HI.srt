00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,875
[in Yiddish]
Next week, after your wedding,

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,125
God willing, you'll begin
a new life with your husband.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,416
I'm here to teach you how to be a wife.

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,083
The physical relationship

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,875
between husband and wife is holy.

6
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,666
Its purpose is to create a family.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,166
And family is everything.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,625
But...

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,625
how does it work?

10
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,288
[woman] It's basic physics.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,458
The man is the giver,
the woman is the receiver.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,625
Understand?

13
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,416
So he must be on top

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,625
and she must be on the bottom.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,291
You should have marital relations
every Friday night,

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,541
if you are clean.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,125
Clean?

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,041
Each month, when you bleed,

19
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,708
you'll sleep apart from your husband,

20
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,166
and don't go to the <i>mikvah.</i>

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,333
After you finish bleeding,

22
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,041
inspect yourself twice a day

23
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,125
with one of these cloths.

24
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,781
[in English] When the cloths...

25
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,375
[in Yiddish]
...have been clean for seven days,

26
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,291
you can return to your husband's bed,

27
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,333
after you've been to the <i>mikvah.</i>

28
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,791
But...

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,416
that means we only share a bed
for half the month.

30
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,958
[in English]
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

31
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,041
[in Yiddish] You'll see.

32
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,333
God made it this way
to keep the relationship fresh.

33
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,583
And it's your duty to uphold God's wishes.

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,666
That's why we need to guarantee

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,666
that your wedding night will be a success.

36
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,750
Right?

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,041
Husband and wife

38
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,250
fit together like pieces in a puzzle.

39
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,333
Understand?

40
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,083
No.

41
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,625
You have a hole inside you,

42
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,750
leading to a hallway,

43
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,083
leading to a little door,

44
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:06,208
opening to a womb, the source of all life.

45
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,666
When the man enters the hallway with his...

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
No!

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,583
I don't have that hole.

48
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:16,916
What?

49
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,645
There must be something wrong with me.

50
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,375
Nothing is wrong with you.

51
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,250
Go to the bathroom and look, Esty.

52
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,250
There are two holes.

53
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
One for pee and the other...

54
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,416
You'll see.

55
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,458
- Now?
- Yes, go!

56
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,666
[sighs]

57
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,625
[gasps]

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,875
[suspenseful music playing]

59
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,416
MIKVAH

60
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,875
[in English] Hello!

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
[woman in Yiddish] Good day.

62
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,166
[in Yiddish] I am Esther Schwartz.

63
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,583
Ah, the bride!

64
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,375
Here is your robe.

65
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,041
And here are the rules.

66
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,541
Use the left door!

67
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,500
Ring the bell when you're ready.

68
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,916
[sighs]

69
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,458
That was quick, dear.

70
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,458
Come here!

71
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me see.

72
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,708
There can be nothing
between the water and your skin.

73
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
Good!

74
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,083
Now you are ready, dear!

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
[woman] Kosher.

76
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,333
"Blessed are You, God.

77
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,000
King of the universe.

78
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
Who sanctified us with His commandments.

79
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,916
And commanded us to immerse ourselves."

80
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Amen.

81
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,041
[clattering]

82
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,458
[bucket clattering]

83
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,583
[bucket clattering]

84
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:46,916
[cleaner humming outside]

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,083
- [door opening]
- [cleaner continues humming]

86
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,583
[cleaner gasps]

87
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,375
[in Polish] What the heck...
What are you doing here?

88
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,638
[in German]
No one's allowed to sleep here.

89
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,000
[in Polish] Don't you know that?

90
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,041
[in German] I'm going to report you!

91
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,455
[in English] See you later.

92
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,833
[cleaner in German]
Wait! I found a girl down there!

93
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,625
She slept there overnight!

94
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,041
[teacher] Wait a minute!

95
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,541
And you are?

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
[in English] I'm Esther Shapiro.
I'm... I'm sorry.

97
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,916
You can't sleep in there.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,958
It was just one night, I promise.

99
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,583
- Okay.
- I won't do it again.

100
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,901
[teacher] Where did you come from?

101
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,375
New York.

102
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,375
- Why don't you pack your things now?
- I don't have any things. I'll go now.

103
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,291
[teacher] Wait!

104
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,041
[sighs] Come with me.

105
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,125
[Yanky in Yiddish] We've landed, Mommy!

106
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,166
Yes. I've got all my luggage.

107
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,875
Yes. The sun is shining.

108
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll call you later.

109
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,708
What did you bring your <i>shtreimel </i>for?

110
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,041
So everyone can admire how Jewish we look?

111
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,875
Just put on a yellow star, why don't you!

112
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,658
We brought <i>shtreimels </i>to Europe
when we came with Daddy!

113
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,458
This isn't Antwerp, Yanky.

114
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,416
This isn't even London. This is Berlin.

115
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,458
The capital of Germany!

116
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,000
Germany! Look around.

117
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,416
What if we're still here on the sabbath?

118
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,270
[Moishe] We'll be gone by the sabbath.

119
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,291
[Yanky] Are we going
straight to her mom's house?

120
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,208
[Moishe] No.

121
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,125
POTSDAMER PLATZ STATION

122
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,125
[in English] I would love to play music
like your students.

123
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,541
I've never seen a concert like that.

124
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,208
They don't have concerts in New York?

125
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,500
Bands at weddings and bar mitzvahs, maybe.

126
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,250
And my piano teacher
used to play for me sometimes.

127
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,958
You play the piano?

128
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,291
- Yes.
- [teacher] Seriously?

129
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,291
What's in this sandwich?

130
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,750
Ham.

131
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,125
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,000
[teacher] Are you all right?

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,750
I thought the ham would make me sick.

134
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,571
- It didn't.
- [teacher chuckles]

135
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,125
Are you relieved?

136
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,500
Where I come from, there are many rules.

137
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,458
In music, often, you have
to break the rules to make a masterpiece.

138
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,250
Half of Bach's sonatas
don't follow the official rules of Bach.

139
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,416
[Esty chuckles]

140
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,041
I wish I could afford to study here.

141
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,791
We have a special training program
at our conservatory

142
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,041
for students from...

143
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,750
difficult circumstances.

144
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,333
Difficult circumstances?

145
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,250
War zones, for example.

146
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,416
Does Williamsburg count as a war zone?

147
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,750
I don't know.

148
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,875
You tell me.

149
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,500
What would I have to do?

150
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,806
You have to fill out an application form.

151
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,916
That's it?

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,041
[teacher laughs] No.

153
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,916
Then you have to audition live
in front of a panel of experts.

154
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,958
Are you prepared to do that?

155
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,083
Yes.

156
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,458
[notification music plays
over cell phone]

157
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,826
[in Yiddish] Does the rabbi know
you have a smartphone?

158
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,518
I have a kosher phone for personal use.

159
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,566
I need the smartphone for business.

160
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,641
The rabbi gives me special dispensation.

161
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,583
It has all the functions?

162
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,000
- Internet?
- Of course.

163
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,333
So,

164
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,458
you can look up anything?

165
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,625
I guess so.

166
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,208
Anything in the whole world?

167
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,583
[Moishe] I guess so.

168
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,875
- Can you look up a person?
- What?

169
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,333
Ask if it knows where my wife is.

170
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,416
I mean it!

171
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,231
Say it.
[in English] "Where is Esty?"

172
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,583
Where is Esty, telephone?

173
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,500
[Moishe chuckles]

174
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,625
[in Yiddish] You're crazy, Yanky.

175
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,750
[Moishe laughs]

176
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,875
[women chattering indistinctly]

177
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,708
[in German]
Welcome. Checking in, fellows?

178
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,583
- Moses Lefkovitch.
- [in English] Lefkovitch. Right.

179
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,106
May I have your credit card, please?

180
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,958
[in Yiddish] You've got cash, right?

181
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,375
Uh... yes.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,360
[in English] First time in Berlin?

183
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,536
- [Moishe] No.
- [Yanky] Yes.

184
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,958
It's always a great pleasure to host
guests from Israel here in Germany!

185
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,291
<i>Shalom!</i>

186
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,041
Israel?

187
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,666
[in Yiddish] Zionists!

188
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,945
[in English] We're from New York.

189
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,166
The United States of America.

190
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,666
Did someone leave a package for me?

191
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,041
[male clerk] Yes. Here it is.

192
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,250
[Yanky recites prayer]

193
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,166
[both recite prayer]

194
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,083
[Moishe in English] So...

195
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,875
[in Yiddish] I brought enough
instant ramen to last us a week.

196
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,833
Otherwise we'll just eat fruit and nuts.

197
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,666
And Coca-Cola, of course.

198
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,041
You're sure it's kosher in Germany?

199
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Everywhere.

200
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,708
[in English] Yankees or Mets?

201
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,500
Yankees.

202
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,833
[Yanky sighs]

203
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,875
[notification music plays
over cell phone]

204
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,020
[in Yiddish] What if Esty's in danger?

205
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,291
Of course she is in danger, Yanky!

206
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,000
That's why we're here.

207
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,708
I have to make a call.

208
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,125
[door opens and closes]

209
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,375
[Moishe in English] <i>Igor!</i>

210
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,416
<i>Igor... Yeah, thank you very much.</i>

211
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,125
[Moishe continues speaking indistinctly]

212
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,458
[melancholic music playing]

213
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,166
[woman in English] Yep...

214
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,791
[in German] Sosena, do you have a minute?

215
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,625
A new applicant.

216
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,166
What can I do for you?

217
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,583
[in English] I'm Esther Shapiro.

218
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,625
I would like to apply
for the special training program.

219
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,125
[Sosena] Did you fill out
an online application?

220
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:05,083
- I don't see anything.
- I... filled out a paper application.

221
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,250
Professor Hafez
told me to bring it to this office.

222
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,083
He didn't tell you
to send an audition tape first?

223
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,000
[Esty] No.

224
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,458
- Piano.
- [Esty] Mm-hmm.

225
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:22,000
But do you understand that this program is
meant to be for highly talented students

226
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,125
from extraordinary circumstances?

227
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,208
My circumstances are extraordinary.

228
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
Just read my application.
Please. It's all in here.

229
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,333
There's no address.

230
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,750
I don't actually
have an address yet, but...

231
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,458
Wait.

232
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,666
IMMIGRATION OFFICE

233
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,666
So you can receive post at this address?

234
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,500
Okay. Then we'll be in touch
about the audition.

235
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,875
Thank you.

236
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,208
Thank you so much.

237
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,875
And, um, Esther?

238
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,083
[Esty] Hmm?

239
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,500
Our acceptance rate is only eight percent.

240
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,083
Please don't get your hopes up.

241
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,750
[door buzzer sounds]

242
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,958
[Leah in German] <i>Hello?</i>

243
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,125
- <i>Hello, who's there?</i>
- [in English] Hello?

244
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,056
[Leah in German] <i>Hello, is someone there?</i>

245
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,583
[in English] This is Jacob Shapiro.
I'm Esther Shapiro's husband.

246
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,833
[door buzzer sounds]

247
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,791
[Yanky in Yiddish] She let me in.
That's good. Right?

248
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,458
[Moishe] It's something.

249
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,291
[in English] I'm Jacob.

250
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,666
I know who you are, Yanky.

251
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,250
I was at your wedding.

252
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,916
Really?

253
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,458
So is she here?

254
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Esty?

255
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,416
- No.
- [in Yiddish] Do me a favor, lady.

256
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,125
[in English] English.
We speak English in my house.

257
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:29,916
And you are?

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,791
[in German] I'm his cousin, Moishe.

259
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,363
- [in English] Why did you come to Germany?
- [Moishe in Yiddish] Enough with this!

260
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,333
- [in German] Because Esty is here.
- [woman] Leah! Who is it?

261
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,601
[in Yiddish] If she's not here,
where else would she go?

262
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,185
[Leah in English] What happened, Yanky?

263
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,276
Things must be bad
for to you to believe she'd run this far.

264
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,416
- Are they bad? Tell me the truth.
- [in Yiddish] No, you tell us the truth!

265
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,017
[in English] This is not your world.
You can't threaten me here.

266
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,976
- [woman] Who are you?
- Nobody. They were leaving.

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
- I need to talk to Esty.
- [Leah] I told you.

268
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,791
I have no idea where Esty is.

269
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,375
[Leah breathes heavily]

270
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,041
[dog barking in distance]

271
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,958
[footsteps retreating]

272
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
[woman] Leah,

273
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,375
we have to call the police.

274
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,750
- No. No police.
- [woman] This isn't Williamsburg.

275
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,083
Nina, she isn't missing.

276
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,875
She's 19 years old.
I have to wait for her to come to us.

277
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,250
The younger one is her husband,
by the way.

278
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,958
He doesn't know that chasing her
will only make her run further.

279
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,375
[Esty praying in Yiddish]

280
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,666

[children laughing]

283
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,708
What's keeping you?

284
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,208
I'm just a bit nervous.

285
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,208
Grandma.

286
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,875
To see you married is my greatest joy.

287
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,291
[Esty continues praying]

288
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,000

[in Yiddish]
You are betrothed to me with this ring

296
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,750
according to the laws of Moses and Israel.

[Karim speaking Arabic]

303
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,958
- [in English] Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,208
[Karim speaking Arabic]

305
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,531
- [in English] Go in. I'll be right there.
- [Esty] Okay.

306
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:31,791

308
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,541
[Dasia] Esty?

309
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,750
[Robert in English] Yeah.

310
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,750
- Do you think she has cancer?
- [Dasia] I wondered that, too.

311
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,500
[Ahmed] When she took off the wig,
she looked totally fine.

312
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,958
She doesn't have cancer, come on.
She's ultraorthodox.

313
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,125
- [male student] Ultraorthodox, what?
- [laughs] Jewish!

314
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,125
- [male student] Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,105
I didn't know there was such a thing.

316
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,500
They're, like, the lunatic fringe.

317
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,438
They don't even get proper education.

318
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,958
The men just study the Torah
and the women are baby machines.

319
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,458
- [male student] Really?
- I'm not a baby machine.

320
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,833
[Karim in German] Good morning!

321
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,625
[in English] Have a chair.

322
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,125
Esther here is a pianist from New York

323
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,708
who has applied
to our special training program.

324
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,833
She'll be sitting in
on our coaching session today.

325
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,958
So, you have an audience.

326
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,416
Be on your toes, hmm?

327
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,458
Esther, if you have any questions
about life in the program,

328
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,375
you can ask anyone here after class.

329
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:38,875
Thank you.

330
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,791
[Karim]
So let's start from the top this time.

331
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,916
[classical music playing]

332
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay.

333
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,583
You are playing in a chamber music
orchestra here, people.

334
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,708
Hmm?
You are no longer separate individuals.

335
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,791
You are one symbiotic being. One organism.

336
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,958
Feel each other's movement.
Anticipate each other's breaths. Okay?

337
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,291
Try again.

338
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:49,208
[classical music playing]

339
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,076
[Karim speaking indistinctly]

340
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:05,708
Dasia,

341
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,083
where are you today?

342
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,041
Stay with us, please.

343
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,416
Read the music.

344
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,541
Who heard that?

345
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,041
Hmm?

346
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,666
- I played the wrong bowings.
- [Karim] That's right.

347
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,458
Overthinking.

348
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,166
Okay. From the top, everyone, again.

349
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,916
[classical music playing]

350
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,250
[chattering]

351
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,333
[Esty] Dasia.

352
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,666
Are you okay?

353
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,250
You play so well.

354
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,125
No, honestly,
everything Professor Hafez said is true.

355
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:09,958
[cell phone buzzes]

356
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,750
I need to go to the hospital.

357
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,791
Hospital?

358
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:19,625
My uncle's a doctor. He asked me

00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,708
Then let's hear you.

536
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:31,625
What?

537
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:34,875
It's good practice and you heard us.

538
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,333
We play in front of each other
all the time.

539
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:41,250
- Like, all the time.
- [Dasia]...time.

540
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,166
Really, too much. It's too much.

541
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,083
[Ahmed]
Basically, every Saturday, we play.

542
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,333
[laughter]

543
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,416
Okay.

544
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,458
- [Yael] Yay! Woo!
- [Mike] Very good!

545
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,833
[melancholic music playing]

546
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,375
- That was beautiful, Esther.
- [Yael] Stop it.

547
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,250
That won't help her.

548
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,833
- Yael, come on.
- She's not a child.

549
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,750
That was nice.

550
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,291
Really, that was nice.

551
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,958
Nice enough to entertain the boys
at a few bar mitzvahs, maybe.

552
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:22,083
But you'll never make it
into the conservatory.

553
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,250
Was that really necessary?

554
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,166
What? I'm just being honest!
Which is what she deserves.

555
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:30,041
Maybe she's musical,
but she's not a pianist.

556
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,083
[Yael scoffs]

557
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:36,500
Every one of us here has been practicing
our instruments every fucking day

558
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,041
since we were children.

559
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:41,000
Look, an ear for music
might be a God-given gift,

560
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:44,250
and there are singers
who are born with beautiful voices,

561
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:48,416
but no one comes out of Brooklyn
after a few lessons on the piano

562
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,291
all ready to play the <i>Philharmonie!</i>

563
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,500
You clearly have a knack for music.

564
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:02,541
And things might have been different
for you in different circumstances.

565
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,958
But you'll never catch up.

566
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,125
Not on the piano, not ever. I'm sorry.

567
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:16,791
Where's the bathroom?

568
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,833
It's down the hall to the right.

569
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,291
Army general Yael Roubeni
at your service, right?

570
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:34,916
[Robert] Esty.

571
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,250
Esty!

572
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:41,333
[melancholic music playing]

573
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:57,291
[telephone ringing]

574
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,208
[in Yiddish] Hello?

575
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,625
Grandma?

576
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,291
Grandma, it's me. Esty.

577
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,958
[Esty cries] <i>I'm so far away, Grandma.</i>

578
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:17,125
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

579
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:19,500
<i>I don't know what to do...</i>

580
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,083
Hello?

581
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:34,875
Grandma?

582
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:40,958
