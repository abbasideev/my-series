3
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,362
‐ No idea what you're
talking about.

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,947
‐
He's out of cigarettes.

5
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,661
That's why he's bugging out.

6
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,912
Kid has a serious
nicotine addiction.

7
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,622
‐ No, I do not.

8
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,207
‐ If you need to smoke that
bad, you know who has them.

9
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,917
‐ No, nope.
Not talking to her.

10
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,210
Plus, she's pissed at me.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,546
Look, fellas, I am good.

12
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,050
I bet she'd bum a few
to Pudgie.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,760
Least she could do
after stomping on his heart.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,470
‐ No way.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,013
I'm not talking to her either.

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,975
If you haven't noticed,
I'm not even saying her name.

17
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,770
Plus, I'm not the one
with a cigarette addiction.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,897
‐ Neither am I.
Hey, wake up!

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,941
Wake up, God damn it!
Where's the stash?

20
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,735
Don't hold out on me!

Where's it at?

You're supposed to be

I want to apologize

I'm not proud
of the way I acted

26
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,919
and I am ready to seek the help
I so desperately need.

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,879

to ask Alaska for cigarettes?

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,381
Never.

29
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,758
‐ I thought we agreed that
we weren't gonna use her name?

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,468
‐ I tried to do this
cold turkey

31
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,387
and I am, admittedly,
too weak,

32
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:39,182
so we pool our resources
together and go to Coosa's.

33
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,309
‐ How is that gonna work?

34
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,019

- It's never worked.

36
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,855
You never tried.

37
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,273
Because it will
never work.

38
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,608

She's sweet and kind
and she was into me.

Operative word, there.

41
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,490
Maybe find another girl
and leave Lara alone.

Alaska would be the first

That's just wonderful.

358
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,299
‐ Is it?
You sound surprised.

359
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,301
That son of mine,
he listens to his mama

360
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,469
more than he lets on.

361
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,096
Tell him that
dinner is in the oven

362
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,639

363
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,932
Okay, thanks.

00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,725
Lovely woman, your mother.

365
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,644
Although, it's too bad
you'll be missing the dance.

366
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,021
I for one have been
dusting off

367
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,356
some of my classic moves.

368

‐ No, true.

369
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,362
Historically,
I have avoided
school social functions,

370
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,614
but I find myself with an
excess of free time these days

371
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,616
and, I actually found
the perfect tie

372
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,411
when I was clearing out, um...

373
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,252
Well...

374
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,170
just in time
to shake things up.

375
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,048
I knew my moms
would come through.

376
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,384
Just hope she forgives me
when she finds out the truth.

377
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,302
Which is why
you need to call her.

378
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,430

379
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,098
Women find you irresistible.

380
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,850
‐ Or we actually spend
the weekend at your mom's,

381
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,810
because from where
I'm standing,
this plan's a bust.

382
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,770

Wait. Wait. What do you mean?

383
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,021
‐ Did you not hear the man?

384
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,481
The Eagle is gonna be
at the dance,

385
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,068
and that was not
a part of the plan.

386
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,320
‐ Maybe this is
actually better.

387
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,114
I mean, everybody we need
to be worried about

388
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,074

one sad disco ball.

389

390

391

I want to.

But what I'm about to ask you
is important.

397
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,429

with Lara.

398
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,307

You're completely over Alaska.

to flash this little guy

- Casualty!

713
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,437
We have a casualty!

714
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,106

715
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,149
Our hero's
left butt cheek
was dinner for the swan.

716
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,318
And there ain't much
meat on that scrawny thing.

an infection or‐‐or rabies.

No, but he could
get the bird flu, though.

to the hospital,
we all get busted,

724
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,044
so quit being a baby,
pull down your pants,

now the antiseptic.

I can sew.

We had just moved here

790

barely spoke English

792

it was like...

right next to the
Weekday Warriors' parents.

to say good‐bye.

827
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,610

for a soccer team,

828

My grandmother died

845
