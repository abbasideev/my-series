182
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,794
I like it.

183
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:28,216
It's just ambiguous enough,
unquantifiable.

184
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:32,303
Kind of magical,
hell of a metaphor.

185

It's also a pretentious way
of saying you wanna get laid,

186

French poet to tell me that.

187

188

this Great Perhaps,

189

to upset

190

191

that's a good quality.

192
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,995

those in charge of us.

193

First, fast, hard.

Pudge, if you wanna walk away,

In order to be an escort,

283

‐ Why did you even invite me?

289
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,687
‐ Because, Chip,
it's important to me.

290
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,313
You're important to me.

291
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,731

my whole life.

295
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,990

00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,737
I'm serious.

715
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,114
Shit, hide.

716
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,908
‐ Good evening.

717
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,868
Everybody enjoying
their Saturday night?

718
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,957
Mr. Halter, I just wanted
to check and make sure

719
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,250
that you could make it
back into your room

720
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,920
since you seem to be
missing these.

721
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,346
Keep up, Mr. Halter.

722
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,478
To the right.

723
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,562
God damn it.

724
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,855
How could he have been
so sloppy?

725
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,148
Turns out
Pudge's choice of key chain

726
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,900
was unfortunate
on a number of levels.

727
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,235
‐ Not sure
that's what matters here.

728
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,778
Disagree.
You know what they say.

729
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,905
Never trust a man with a need
to draw attention to his keys.

730
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,532
‐ I'm certain no one's
ever said that before.

731
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,908
It was a rough translation.

732
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,826
‐ I'm surprised to hear
that you're doubting Pudge.

733
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,453
Was he not a pivotal part
of one of the greatest

734
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,039
counterinsurgencies ever
carried out on foreign soil?

735
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,541
He was
the least coordinated

736
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,292
and expressed the most doubt...

737
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,588
But he was a key
to its success.

738
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,631
Pun intended.

739
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,882
This is true.

740
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,801
And he did just face off
against some explosive

741
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,969
and deadly assholes.

742
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,470
All puns intended.

743
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,305
‐ Wordplay while our friend's
future hangs in the balance?

744
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,266
‐ Look, I wish I shared
your confidence

745
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,767
in his ability to withstand
the Eagle,

746
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,353
but what do we really know
about Miles Halter?

747
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,021
Other than the fairly
damning fact

748
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,940
that he's from Florida.

749
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,942
‐ There is one thing I know
about Pudge Halter

750
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,652
that makes me think
he'll keep his mouth shut.

751
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,529
Yeah.

752
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,573
Good point.

753
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,199
‐ Well, what's that?

754
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,289
The Sunshine State.

755
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,999
I like that you have
so much pride in your home,

756
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,459
Mr. Halter.

757
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,004
‐ I just got it for, like, 99¢

758
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,672
with the purchase
of a Slim Jim.

759
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,756
‐ But surely
you must miss Florida.

760
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,049
No, not really.

761
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,260
I mean,
if my parents moved tomorrow,

762
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,720
I'd happily never go back.

763
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,680
‐ Well, then, let's hope
you don't have to return there

764
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,098
any time soon.

765
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,018
‐ Noted, sir.
Thank you.

766
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,854
Do you know
where you are, Mr. Halter?

767
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,733
You are in my home where
we can speak in confidence.

768
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,571
Actually,
it belongs to the school.

769
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,907
‐ I see, and are you
renovating the place

770
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,868
or you just move in?

771
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,662
‐ No.

772
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,917
If you must know,
my wife is moving out.

773
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:32,130
Well, she already moved out.
Quite hastily, if you ask me.

774
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,465
She sure didn't.

775
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,175
‐ I‐I didn't mean to pry.

776
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,886
‐ No, we were only together
for 13 years.

777
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,056
You know, it'll be fine.

778
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,769
I mean... eventually so.

779
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,936
But the good news is,

780
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,190
I have more time
to focus on my job.

781
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,735
Now, as you may already know,

782
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,446
there have been a spate
of pranks at Culver Creek,

783
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,947
all clearly related.

784
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,409
Now, the bad news for you is
that you are the only student

785
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,244
that I can connect
to these pranks.

786
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,998
Which means the full weight
of the punishment

787
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,794
for all of them will fall
squarely onto your shoulders,

788
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,923

789
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,634

791
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,512
‐ No.

792
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,392
I see it did not take long
for you to get indoctrinated.

793
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,559
That's not a surprise

794
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,645

is your roommate.

is that good men do nothing."

00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,222
Was I unaware
that you recently bought

892
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,140
a winning lotto ticket?

893
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,517
Unlike those assholes,

894
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,228
we still need our scholarship
money to stay here.

895
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,479
And I don't know
about you boys,

896
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,398
but planning and executing
these elaborate

897
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,360
albeit brilliant pranks
is not really enhancing my GPA.

898
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,322
It's over.
We won.

899
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,865
‐ We haven't won yet.

900
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,826
<i>Mr. Halter, please rise.</i>

901
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,039
The jury has heard
your testimony

902
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,291
and has deliberated the facts
presented to them,

903
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,627
and they have come
to a decision.

904
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,170
Ms. Rowinksi.

905
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,133
‐ Given this is a first offense

906
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,759
and the fact
that no other students

907
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,428
have filed complaints
against you,

908
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,596
not to mention
your clear remorse,

909
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,640
we have decided on a sentencing

910
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,768
of two weeks cafeteria
cleanup duty,

911
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,937
mostly for the offense
of buying

912
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,230
that hideous key chain.

913
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,070
‐ To the rest of the jury,

914
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,322
do you agree
with this sentence?

915
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,200
‐ Yes.

916
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,120
‐ Very well.

917
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,247
You can report to Maureen
in the cafeteria.

918
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,832
She'll show you
where the hairnets are.

919
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,126
I do hope you enjoy
the smell of wet sponges.

920
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,421
And Mr. Halter, please remember
that the next time

921
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,589
you are in front of the jury,

922
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:30,923
you will not be
a first‐time offender,

923
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,302
so consider your actions
carefully.

924
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,555
‐ I got off
with a slap on the wrist.

925
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,932
I mean, I wasn't sure
how it was gonna go.

926
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,310
But I really spoke
from the heart,

927
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,562
and I think
the jury connected with it.

928
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,108
‐ Look at him,
so proud of himself.

929
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,735
‐ I almost don't even
wanna tell him.

930
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,404
‐ Then don't.
Just let him have this.

931
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,989
‐

932
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,075
Have‐‐have‐‐have what?
What's going on?

933
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,453
‐ I'm sure the jury let you off
because of your stirring words

934
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,038
and those puppy dog eyes,

935
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,748
but probably doesn't hurt

936
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,374
that I'll be writing
free term papers

937
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,501
for jurors two and five.

938
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,336
‐ Or that I agreed
to teach juror one

939
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,629
how to master "Halo 2"

940
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,672
and provide
all relevant cheat codes.

941
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,841
‐ And I promised
juror number seven

942
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,302
you'd go on a date with her,
Lara.

943
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,137
You might remember her
from our study group.

944
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:22,892
‐ Or her great breasts‐‐
perky breasts.

945
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,061
‐ You guys tampered
with the jury on my behalf?

946
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,938
Tell me they read
the part about your key chain.

947
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,398
It cost me extra,
but I just couldn't resist.

948
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,026
I told you, Pudge.
You're one of us now.

949
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,402
Don't start crying,
