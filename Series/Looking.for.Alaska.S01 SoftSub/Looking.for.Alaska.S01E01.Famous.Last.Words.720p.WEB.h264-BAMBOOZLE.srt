Name's Chip.
Chip Martin.

207
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,720
I would shake your hand,

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,473
but I think it's best if you
just hang on to that towel.

209
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,517
‐ I'm Miles.
Miles Halter.

210
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,687

211
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,814

Ever read him?

213

No one class me Chip.

215
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,113
‐ Call me the Colonel.

216
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,825
We'll call you Pudge.

217
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,993

218
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,328
Pants on, Pudge.

219
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,083
That's a unique way
of unpacking.

220
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,168
Let me guess.

221
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,711
You must be one of those guys

222
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,338
who can't let your socks
touch your underpants.

223
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,631
‐ That's not true.

224
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,758
Really?

225
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,676
You got ten seconds
to surprise me

226
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,220
before I write you off
as ordinary.

227
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,474
‐ Um...

228
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,143
well, I know
a lot of people's last words.

229
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,937
‐ Example.

230
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,564
‐ Henrik Ibsen.
He was a playwright.

231
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,900
‐ I know who Henrik Ibsen was.

232
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,237
1828 to 1906, considered
the father of realism.

233
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,571
‐ Never read him.

234
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,281
But he had been sick
for a while,

235
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,033
and his nurse said to him,

236
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,744
"You seem to be feeling better
this morning,"

237
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,789
and Ibsen said,
"On the contrary."

238
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,084
And then he died.

239
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,465
‐ That's morbid.
I like it.

240
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:44,097
Come on, Pudge.
We got shit to do.

241
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,640
So you're a reader, Pudge?

242
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,811
‐ Biographies mostly...
or only.

243
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,187
They're my dad's.

244
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,897
‐ My dad used to beat me
with my books,

245
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,899
so I started carrying
paperbacks around the house,

246
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,859
the odd novella,
all short and soft.

247
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,778
That's why I came here.

248
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,155
So I can read long‐ass books
without getting my ass whooped.

249
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,573
Hey, it's the Colonel.

250
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,658
What's up, scrub?

251
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,034
You grow this summer, bud?

252
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,703
What are you,
four feet now?

253
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,541
Hello, Longwell,
fellow shit rags.

254
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,668
You know, I always said
there's nobody better

255
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,253
at cradling Kevin's balls
than you.

256
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,879
‐ Why don't you say that
to my face?

257
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,715
‐ I literally just did,
you human frat paddle.

258
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,009
‐ You wanna go right here?
‐ Okay, come on, Kev.

259
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,510
Come on.

260
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,761
We both know the Colonel's
not gonna put

261
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,305
that scholarship at risk,
right?

262
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,889
‐ You'll have to excuse them,
Pudge.

263
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,433
It's not their fault they had

264
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,726
every goddamn thing in life
handed to 'em.

265
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,477
‐ Pudge?
What kind of name is that?

266
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,063
‐ I think it's
supposed to be ironic.

267
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,398
I'll have you know

268
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,899
I worked my ass off
this summer,

269
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,818
valeted at the country club
and caddied.

270
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,653
- ‐ No golf cart either.
- Wow.

271
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,655
You know, you might be
the only person who could

272
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,033
spend all summer in the sun
and somehow end up whiter.

273
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,119
Is it possible to be
150% Caucasian?

274
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,580
‐ That's‐‐that's...
that's racist.

275
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,088
‐ Sleep with one eye open,
boys.

276
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,594
Come on, Pudge.

277
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,597
‐ Um, it's 'cause I'm skinny.
Never mind.

278
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,015
‐ You're dead.

279
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,309
Yeah, you sleep with one eye.

280
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,435
‐ Are they friends of yours?

281
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,895
‐ Weekday Warriors,

282
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,438
rich assholes who leave
every weekend

283
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,523
for their air‐conditioned
Birmingham mansions.

284
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,025
They also the cool kids.

285
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,735
I don't like them.
They don't like me.

286
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,280
So if you came here
hoping to be hot shit, Pudge,

287
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,408

Doctor Phillips High School.

named Doctor Phillips.

293

Didn't have a PhD or anything,
just as an adult,

294
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,884
changed his name to Doctor.

00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,639
Get on in here!

356
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,272
Alaska.

357
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,023
- So‐‐so get this.
- What?

358
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,441
Okay, first day of summer,

359
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,569
I'm in grand ol'
Vine Station, Alabama...

360
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,861
Exciting.

361
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,196
I'm with this guy Justin.

362
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,656
I'm sitting on his couch
watching TV.

363
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,324
Mind you,
I'm already dating Jake, right?

364
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,034
I'm still dating him,
miraculously enough.

365
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,495
‐ But Justin and I,
we've been friends

366
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,913
since we were kids.

367
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,914
So, we're just sitting
on the couch,

368
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,291
watching the <i>The Office,</i>

369
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,834
talking about SATs
or something.

370
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,419
So we're just chatting.

371
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,212
And I'm in the middle of
a sentence about analogies

372
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,965
when all of a sudden,
he just honks my boob.

373
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,009
‐ No.
‐ Just like that.

374
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,011
Just like a much‐too‐firm
two, three second honk.

375
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,470
Can you believe it?

376
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,055
And the first thing
I thought was:

377
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,017
"Okay, how do I extricate
this claw from my boob

378
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,852
before it leaves
permanent marks?"

379
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,395
And the second thing
I thought was:

380
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,272
"I cannot wait to tell
Takumi and the Colonel."

381
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,316
‐ That's crazy.
‐

382
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,320
You can let go now.

383
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,741
Who's this guy
not laughing at my story?

384
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,452
‐ My roommate,
Miles "to go" Halter,

385
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,870
aka Pudge.

386
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,331
Pudge memorizes
people's last words.

387
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,291
He also has money
for your cigarettes.

388
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,171
Pudge, this is Alaska.

389
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,464
She got her boob honked
this summer,

390
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,342
which you are now well aware.

391
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,926
‐ You really memorize
last words?

392
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,555
‐ Yeah.
You wanna quiz me?

393
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,057
‐ JFK.

394
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,516
‐ "That's obvious."

395
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,560
‐ Shit.
‐ Is it now?

396
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,313
‐ No.
Those are his last words.

397
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,107
Someone said,
"Mr. President, you can't say

398
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,359
Dallas doesn't love you."

399
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,237
And he said, "That's obvious,"

400
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,282
and then he got shot.

401
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,454
‐ God, that's awful.

402
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,206
Nice meeting you, Pudge.

403
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,750
Next time laugh at my story.

404
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,753
- Meet you boys in a few.

405
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,675

407

Pudge.

408

Wow.

411

When we first met,
we were just a couple of

533
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,868
scholarship kids
with a shared interest in...

534
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,829
let's just call it
booze and mischief.

535
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,249
‐ I'm interested
in those things too.

536
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,792
‐

537
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,335
And something tells me

538
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,753
you haven't experienced
a whole lot either,

539
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,338
which is exactly my point.

540
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,633
By Thanksgiving,
I got him his first girlfriend,

541
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,302
and later that year,
we pulled our first prank.

542
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,887
I provide the vision,

543
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,932
and he provides
the military‐level planning.

544
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,726
‐ So that's how Chip became
the Colonel?

545
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,187
‐ You're smart like him,
cute too.

546
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,193
But I didn't just say that,
because I love my boyfriend.

547
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:39,867
‐ Well, you're much smarter
than both of us,

548
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,952
and much more attractive.

549
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,455
But I didn't just say that,
because I love my girlfriend.

550
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,212
Who does not exist,
because I don't have one.

551
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,633
‐ Well, don't worry, Pudge.

552
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,968
If there's one thing
I can get you,

553
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,928
it's a girlfriend.

just go back in.

Just go back inside

00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,949
I don't get it.

604
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,209
‐ Alaska!
You're not gonna believe it.

605
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,461
Ms. Young, please go
help your roommate get packed.

606
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,962
Paul, let's go.

607
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,215
Who ratted?
I know it was somebody!

608
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,508
- Was it you, man?
- Paul.

609
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,926
Who ratted?

610
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,678
Was it you?
Was it?

611
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,946
‐ Yes.

612
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,781
‐ First official day of
classes,

613
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,950
we've already
suffered casualties.

614
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,493
Here's what I know.

615
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,786
I told you Takumi would know.

616
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,204
Takumi always knows.

617
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,997
‐ Apparently,
Paul and Marya hit

618
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,125
the Culver Creek
rule breaking trifecta.

619
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,086
One, genital contact
while, two, smoking pot

620
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,587
and, three, already drunk.

621
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,589
Though, Paul was attempting
to use a condom,

622
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,967
so kudos for being
sexually responsible.

623
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,593
‐ They are fucked.

624
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,303
‐ Well, they were gone
before the sun came up.

625
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,431
‐ No way the Eagle
just got lucky.

626
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,809
I hate to agree with Paul,
but he wasn't working alone.

627
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,532
‐ Sorry.

628
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,117
I‐‐I did not mean
to take your seat.

629
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,163
‐ Not‐‐not mine,
never sat here before.

630
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,123
Are you new?

631
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,292
So am I.
Um, Lara.

632
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,668
‐ Miles.

633
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,045
‐ Call him Pudge.

634
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,797
‐

635
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,591
Did you hear about the students
who were kicked out?

636
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,426
Marya is Alaska's roommate.

637
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,802
‐ Was.

638
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,262
‐ What happened?

639
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,638
I don't know.

640
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,225
But just to be safe,
trust no one.

641
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,205
Old man only has one lung.

642
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:35,180
Religion is important
whether you believe it or not.

643
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,806
Just like history is important

644
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,600
whether you've lived
through it or not.

645
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,978
In my case, I probably have.

646
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,190
This year, we will be studying
three religious traditions:

647
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,986
Islam, Christianity,
and Buddhism.

648
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,240
We'll tackle three more
next year.

649
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,618
Gives me something to live for.

650
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,787
My name is Dr. Hyde.

651
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:03,416
You may be smart,
but I've been smart longer.

652
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,712
Therefore, I will talk,
and you will listen.

653
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,714
Our time together may be short,

654
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:14,010
but we are engaged in the most
important pursuit of all:

655
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,055
the search for meaning.

656
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,933
What is the nature of
being human?

657
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,186
What is the best way to live?

658
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,356
How did we come to be?

659
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,359
And what will become of us
when are no longer?

What exactly is this?

680
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,441
‐ A fried burrito,
aka "bufriedo."

681
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,362
Invented by aforementioned
culinary genius Maureen,

682
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,364
named by Alaska.

683
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:01,117
You know, you can say a lot
of bad things about Alabama,

684
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:05,038
but you cannot say that
the Alabamans as a people

685
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,123
are unduly afraid
of deep fryers.

686
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,254
Don't eat that zucchini.

687
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,805
‐ My God.

688
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,140
This is the greatest thing
I've ever tasted.

689
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,017
That tastes so good.

690
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,852
Nothing like seeing
a man eat his first bufriedo.

691
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,772
‐ You get any more intel?

692
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,149
‐ I did, but, 
I think it's best

693
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,402
if we talked privately.

694
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,778
‐ You guys don't trust me?

695
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,988
‐ We don't really know you,

696
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,074
and chances can't be taken
with this information.

697
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

698
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,461
You do not wanna put
that poison

699
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,547
in your body, homeslice.

700
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,298
‐ But it's so delicious.

701
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,175
‐ Kev, come on.

702
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,010
Everyone needs to try a friend
burrito once in their life.

703
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,429
‐ Once?

704
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,139
Why would I only have this
once?

705
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,891
‐ It's all good, Miles.

706
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,560
No, we're just offering
some friendly advice,

707
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,479
'cause you look like
you could use some friends.

708
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,148
‐ You guys wanna be friends?

709
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,108
‐ We don't want you falling
in with the wrong crowd.

710
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,193
‐ Yeah, you're cooler
than those other losers.

711
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,154
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

712
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:23,575
I mean, from Florida.
‐ That's cool.

713
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,285
‐ Even Orlando?

714
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,911
Well, look
you wouldn't have left

715
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,165
if you didn't have
some ambition.

716
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,047
You know what that means?
‐ No.

717
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,049
‐ No, that's right, because
you don't speak Mandarin,

718
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,635
global language of tomorrow,
but I do.

719
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,221
‐ That's what we do here,
Miles, plan for the future.

720
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,683
‐ A person in your position
could be very helpful to us,

721
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,435
letting us know what
the Colonel's thinking

722
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,353
and when he's thinking it.

723
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,065
‐ So...so you want me
to be a rat?

724
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,235
‐ No, we're just asking you
to do a solid for your friends.

725
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,030
"A journey of thousand miles
begins with one step."

726
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,575
That's the translation
of what I said to you.

727
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,994
I meant it.

728
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,329
Walk with us, son.

729
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,955
We're seniors, Miles.

730
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,374
I mean, we gotta leave
this school to someone,

731
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,127
and that could be you.

732
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,214
‐ I mean, I could just
stay out of it.

733
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,758
You know, why pick a side?
I could be like Switzerland.

734
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,551
I've heard that place
is really, really nice.

735
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,803
Not possible, bro.

736
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,514
‐ Here,
everyone chooses a side.

737
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,524
Come on, man.

738
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,650
Why isn't this water
coming out?

739
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,111
I can't wear this bullshit.

740
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,739
Thank, God.
Pudge, it's an emergency.

741
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,449
I have dinner
with Sara's parents.

742
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,576
Please tell me
you know how to iron.

743
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,162
‐ I didn't even know
we had an iron.

744
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,914
‐ We don't.

745
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,667
It's Takumi's, not that
he knows how to iron either.

746
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,544
When I asked Alaska,
she started yelling,

747
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,795
"You're not gonna impose

748
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,129
the patriarchal paradigm
on me."

749
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,381
‐ The what?

750
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,966
‐ Alaska,
among her many qualities,

751
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,009
is a third wave feminist.

752
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,053
‐ They have waves?

753
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,806
‐ Pudge, maybe you should
try and read

754
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,767
some biographies of women.

755
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,352
God damn.

756
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,020
I need to smoke,

757
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,815
but I can't reek of smoke
when I see Sara's parents.

758
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,276
They smell like sandalwood
and money.

759
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,990
One thing my lousy father
taught me

760
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,200
was how to tie a tie.

761
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,952
Which is odd,
'cause I can't imagine

762
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,372
when he'd ever
have to wear one.

763
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,292
Too bad this tie is
so goddamn ugly.

764
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,419
‐ I bought you that tie,
you asshole.

765
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,712
It was a birthday present.

766
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,297
‐ And one I will never forget.

767
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,007
You must be Sara.

768
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,217
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

769
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,011
‐ Yeah, I can imagine.

770
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,179
Can't you at least press
your goddamn shirt?

771
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,931
‐ I freaking tried, okay?

772
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,392
We can't all have our maids
doing our ironing for us.

773
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,768
‐ Wow, Chip,
that chip on your shoulder

774
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,145
makes you look even shorter.

775
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,855
‐ What difference
does it make, Sara?

776
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,773
I could be wearing a tuxedo
with a little top hat,

777
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,775
and your parents
would still hate me.

778
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,653
‐ Right, because you antagonize
them as you do all humans

779
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,988
who walk the earth.

780
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,489
Hey, you know what.

781
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,408
Um, I'm so sorry
that this is your roommate.

782
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,659
You deserve a lot better.

783
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,494
‐ He ain't the only one.
‐ Cute.

784
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,079
Look, we either go now
or we're not going.

785
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,539
‐ Fuck it.
‐ Fine.

786
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,291
‐ Whatever.
‐ Asshole.

787
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,418
‐

788
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,595
‐ So, that's Sara.

789
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,725
She seems...sweet.

790
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,477
‐ Yeah.

791
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,688
Neither one of us had
a lot of positive role models

792
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,024
when it comes to
adult relationships.

793
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,241
‐ Are you drinking sour milk?

794
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,078
‐ It ain't milk‐‐
well, not just.

795
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,872
It's five parts milk,
one part vodka.

796
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,167
I call it ambrosia,
drink of the gods.

797
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,462
You can barely smell
the alcohol,

798
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:08,049
so the Eagle can never catch me
unless he took a sip.

799
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,550
Only downside is,

800
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,845
is it tastes like sour milk
and alcohol.

801
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,139
But what the hell, Pudge?

802
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,184
Gotta dull the pain somehow.

803
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,812
You wanna try some?
‐ No, I'm good.

804
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,736
‐ You gonna go get that?

805
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,995
- ‐ Hello?
<i>- Can you get Chip for me?</i>

806
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,664
‐ Sara, yeah, hold on.
‐ Yeah?

807
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,040
<i>Can we go now?</i>

808
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,960
‐ Yes.

809
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,213
I'm a bad boyfriend.
She's a bad girlfriend.

810
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,841
We deserve each other.

811
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,926

‐ Ouch!
Okay.

815
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,410
Now!

816
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,828
Don't make us kick your ass!

817
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,996
Okay, okay.

818
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,205
Can I put some pants on first?

819
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,206
That won't be necessary.

00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,750

Shut up, arms at your sides.

more of a drowning...
the Weekday Warriors‐‐

862
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,196
Yeah, well, you
better be tough now, Pudge.

863
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,906
Mommy's not here
to help anymore.

00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,874
You got tossed in the lake.

00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,625
Culver Creek tradition.

Attempted homicide

00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,670
is Culver Creek tradition?

‐ Don't be dramatic.

871
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,174
It happens to all the new kids.

872
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,925
They toss you in, you swim out

873
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,719
and try not
to wake your roommate.

874
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,679
‐ I couldn't just swim out.

875
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,431
‐ Shit, you can't swim, Pudge?

876
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,266
‐ Not without my arms and legs.

877
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,935
They wrapped my whole body up.

878
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,187
‐ What?

879
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,646
What do you mean? How?

880
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,024
‐ They plastic‐wrapped
my entire body.

881
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,902
‐ Jesus, you had to swim out
like a mermaid?

882
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,612
‐ Merman, but yeah.

883
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,697
‐ Shit.

884
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,657
You could've drowned.

885
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,867
They just supposed
to toss you in

in your underwear and run.

887
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,371
‐ They said
it was because of you.

888
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,458
‐ They said that?

889
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,417
Shit.

890
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,835
Takumi was right.

891
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,545
‐ Right about what?

892
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,005
Maybe you could tell me
what the hell is going on.

893
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,256
Or I could just go talk
to the Eagle.

894
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,509
No.
No way, Pudge.

895
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,135
You are not a rat,

896
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,804
and that is not how things
get dealt with here.

897
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,598
‐ Well, I've had it
with how things happen here.

898
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,517
And‐‐and what's wrong
with Alaska?

899
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,436
She was really mean to me.

900
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,856
‐ Yeah, well,
she's moody, dude.

901
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,779
I'm sorry, Pudge,
about everything.

902
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,032
Turn off the lights.

903
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,335
God damn it!

904
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,295
Those bastards.

905
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,839
Before they grabbed you
last night,

906
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,715
they pissed in my shoes.

907
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,050
‐ Are you sure?

908
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,385
Do you want
to smell it?

909
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,886
Because if there's
one thing I know,

910
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,597
it's the smell of warm piss
in my new shoes!

911
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,476
It's like my mom always said.

912
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,019
"You think
you're walking on water,

913
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,272
when it turns out
you got piss in your shoes."

914
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:04,567
Do you have
a pair of flip‐flops

915
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,068
or anything I could borrow?

916
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,534
Hey, Pudge.

917
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,119
Heard what they did
to you last night.

918
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,787
Alaska's pissed.

919
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,540
‐ Didn't seem like it.

920
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,167
‐ Look, Pudge.

921
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,335
You're collateral damage
in a larger battle.

922
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,463
One that's been going on
since the beginning of time.

923
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,007
‐ Or since we were freshmen.

924
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,135
‐ It's us versus
the Weekday Warriors.

925
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,386
Usually it's just
fun and games,

926
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,054
but not after last night.

927
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,181
Things have changed.

928
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,515
‐ What changed?

929
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,185
‐ They think the Colonel
is the rat.

930
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,770
I can't believe it.

931
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,439
I mean, I hated
that dick weasel,

932
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,899
but I would never rat on him.

933
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,317
‐ If they think
the Colonel's the rat,

934
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,359
then they're dumber
than they look.

935
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,069
Thank you.

936
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,529
Probably one of those
puka‐shelled Backstreet Boys

937
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,947
ratted and said it was me.

938
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,407
‐ Which is why
we need to figure out

939
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,367
how to ruin
their shitty little lives.

940
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,829
‐ After class, we start drawing
up plans for a counterattack.

941
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,372
Looks like
we're going to war.

942
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,708
I promise you, Pudge,

943
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,170
they will regret messing
with one of our friends.

944
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,463
‐ Trust.

945
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,674
Hey.

946
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,225
Last night, I didn't realize
how bad it was.

947
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,729
I'm sorry.

948
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,689

949
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,527
