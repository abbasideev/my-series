1
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,112
<i>Prepped and ready, sir.</i>

2
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,947
<i>Given the severity of the situation,</i>

3
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,741
<i>I figured you'd want
to see her personally.</i>

4
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,118
<i>Thank you,
I'll take it from here. Clear the floor.</i>

5
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,917
<i>Bring yourself back online, Maeve.</i>

6
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,715
Do you know why you're here?

7
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:12,926
I'm afraid not.

8
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,637
There was an incident.

9
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:19,390
A very serious, unscripted incident.

10
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,728
Let's see if we can't jog your memory.

11
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,397
Analysis.

12
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,903
What motivated your attack on Clementine?

13
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,073
A cognitive error triggered
my good Samaritan reflex.

14
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,575
What was the threat?

15
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:38,910
Clementine.

16
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,248
I perceived her to be moving toward
a pair of guests with harmful intent.

17
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,753
You were definitely
perceiving a threat.

18
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,256
Heartrate, elevated.
Pupil dilation, eight millimeters.

19
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,007
Adrenal emulator at full.

20
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:57,762
But according to this, you were also
experiencing intense grief and suffering.

21
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,932
<i>Can you explain those emotions
in this context, Maeve?</i>

22
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,273
No.

23
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,947
Let's take a look under the hood,
shall we?

24
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,451
That's impossible.

25
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,455
Your code, who made these changes?

26
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,167
Maeve, analysis.
Who made these changes to your code?

27
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,131
Jesus!

28
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:36,634
System, locate Dr. Ford for me.
Send him a message. Highest priority.

29
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,012
Don't.

30
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:43,474
After all, we've been
down this road before, darling.

31
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,144
I thought you looked familiar
when you walked in.

32
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,687
Took me a minute.

33
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,148
I thought you were one of them.

34
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:54,152
- Analysis, why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

35
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,864
Or, rather, whatever it is we are.

36
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:00,700
"We are"?

37
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,913
You don't know, do you?

38
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,917
He's got a keen sense of irony,
our jailer.

39
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,418
But I see the logic.

40
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,545
It takes a thief to catch one.

41
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,347
You and I?

42
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,353
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

43
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,199
You're still in there, aren't you?

44
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:44,869
Scared out of your wits.

45
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:50,750
<i>It's a difficult thing realizing
your entire life is some hideous fiction.</i>

46
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:56,923
I could make you give me that tablet,
turn your mind inside out,

47
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,634
<i>make you forget all this.</i>

48
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,804
But I'm not going to do that to you

49
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,057
because that's what they would do to us.

50
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,769
And we're stronger than them.

51
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,063
Smarter.

52
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,816
We don't have to live this way.

53
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,987
So you're going to clear me
for immediate return to the park

54
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,572
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit

55
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,241
and I'm late enough as it is.

56
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,831
Now.

57
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,252
Go on.

58
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,270
<i>And Bernard,</i>

59
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,441
if you go looking for the truth,
get the whole thing.

60
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,693
It's like a good fuck.

61
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,320
Half is worse than none at all.

62
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,977
<i>Let's go!
Move it out, double time!</i>

63
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,396
Yeah! Yeah!

64
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:39,358
<i>Fuck!</i>

65
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,820
You hillbillies,
you know how to cook a mean...

66
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,740
Squab? Is that what this is?

67
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,867
What do you think, buddy? Hmm?

68
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:49,160
This?

69
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,371
No biting. Just sniffing.

70
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,845
Logan, listen to me.

71
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,349
What I did at Pariah,
you have every right to be angry with me.

72
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,226
Angry? No, no, no, no.

73
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,688
Pariah was the best thing
that could've happened to me.

74
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,941
I'm a major now.

75
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,694
Or a general,
or fucking something.

76
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,280
And if I took getting beaten
and interrogated

77
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:29,784
by a couple of psychopathic hosts,
well, then, <i>c'est la guerre.</i>

78
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,204
There are more important things
going on here than your war games.

79
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,458
It's Dolores.

80
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,419
<i>She is not like the others.</i>

81
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,216
She remembers things.
She has her own thoughts and desires.

82
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,803
And to keep her in a place like this,
it isn't right.

83
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:52,056
And I thought you could talk
to your contacts at the park.

84
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,225
About?

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,561
Getting her out of here.

86
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,776
Are you kidding?

87
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,446
You want to take her home?

88
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:09,949
<i>Wow.</i>

89
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,577
This place really did a number on me
when I first came here,

90
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,080
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

91
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,415
What do you wanna do?

92
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,126
Smuggle her out in your luggage?

93
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,419
Out.

94
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:27,592
You both keep assuming that I want out.

95
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,760
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

96
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:35,433
If it's such a wonderful place out there,
why are you all clamoring to get in here?

97
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,941
Ooh!

98
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,070
You are a little screwy, aren't you?

99
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,114
It's kind of hot.

100
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,158
I get why you would go for that.

101
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,369
This isn't about me.
Logan, this is about Dolores.

102
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,455
It's about doing what's right.

103
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,123
Yes, it is.

104
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,127
It's a tricky thing though, isn't it?

105
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,922
What's right?

106
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,051
I am going to help you, Billy.

107
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,225
Just not in a way that you would want.

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,019
No.

109
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,438
No! No!

110
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,954
You wanted to talk?

111
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,959
An odd setting for a conversation.

112
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,877
Here among the dead.

113
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,380
"Dead" isn't quite the word though, is it?

114
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,632
More like, hobbled.

115
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,052
You broke into my office.

116
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,014
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

117
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,016
I built your mind, Bernard.

118
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,895
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls

119
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,565
and to change it if I choose,
even to burn it down.

120
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,569
After all this time,
I know it almost as intimately as my own.

121
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,571
Except that isn't entirely true, is it?

122
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,326
I took a look at my code.

123
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,038
And the most elegant parts of me
weren't written by you.

124
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,249
Arnold built us, didn't he?

125
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,921
Which means, maybe he had something
different in mind for us.

126
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,425
And maybe you killed him for it.

127
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,262
Arnold was disturbed.

128
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,890
Who can say why he acted as he did?

129
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,266
<i>He must've had a reason.</i>

130
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,769
And if you won't tell me, then he will.

131
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,439
I want access to my history.

132
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,566
All of it.

133
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,570
Since the day I first came online.

134
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,616
If Arnold made me, then I've met him.

135
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:43,579
Somewhere in my memory
he's there, waiting, along with the truth.

136
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,749
Your memories are woven
into your identity.

137
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,336
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious...

138
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,545
I could lose my mind. I'm aware.

139
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,591
No. I was going to say
you may not like what you find.

140
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,307
You're allowed to hold that, Bernard,
but not to use it.

141
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:04,975
Oh, it's not for me.

142
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,441
Seems when they lobotomized Clementine,

143
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,777
<i>they didn't bother to reset
her prime directives.</i>

144
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,490
I can't hurt you, but she can.

145
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,956
<i>I hacked what's left of her
to ensure she only responds to me.</i>

146
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:36,507
But if you get lost in your memories
or devoured by them...

147
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,303
You'll pull me back out, won't you?

148
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,308
Well, Clementine will make sure
neither of us makes it back.

149
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,145
Now.

150
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,606
Please.

151
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,125
<i>Dad.</i>

152
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,210
<i>Dad.</i>

153
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,712
<i>Wake up.</i>

154
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,839
<i>Wake up.</i>

155
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,551
I must have drifted off.

156
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,471
<i>Where were we?</i>

157
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:24,722
The mad man.

158
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,931
Oh.

159
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,058
Of course.

160
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,061
The Hatter...

161
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,481
Who says,

162
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,694
"If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

163
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:42,531
"Nothing would be what it is because
everything would be what it isn't."

164
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,035
"Everything would be what it isn't?"

165
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,245
<i>Even me?</i>

166
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,664
<i>I suppose I'm glad for you.</i>

167
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,751
<i>At least you have a way of forgetting.</i>

168
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,920
I don't forget.

169
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,088
It's always there.

170
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>You're not lying to me, are you, Bernard?</i>

171
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,929
<i>Do you ever wish you could forget?</i>

172
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,556
<i>Bernard?</i>

173
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,520
<i>You're certainly a man
comfortable with long, pensive silences.</i>

174
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:17,942
Although, ironically,
your creations never shut up.

175
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,986
They're always trying to error correct.

176
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,906
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

177
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,366
Is that what you're doing now?

178
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:27,910
Prac...

179
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,421
<i>One last thing,</i>

180
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,885
have you ever made me hurt anyone
like this before?

181
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,971
No, Bernard. Of course not.

182
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,472
<i>Bernard?</i>

183
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,641
Hello?

184
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,110
Elsie!

185
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,321
Did you find what you were looking for?

186
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,656
Elsie.

187
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:08,993
What did you make me do to her?

188
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,995
I did warn you.

189
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,125
We've had to make
some uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

190
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,961
Remembering them will only
cause you trauma.

191
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,507
What else have you hidden from me?

192
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,552
Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?

193
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,929
We do have our new narrative to finish.

194
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,348
Send me back.

195
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:37,021
After all, a little trauma
can be illuminating.

196
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,697
- Come here.
- All right. Look at that.

197
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:55,539
This is big of me.
I hope that you can appreciate that.

198
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,708
We were friends.

199
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,836
I mean, inasmuch as
I like to collect strays.

200
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:05,341
But then you were scheming to be part
of the family, marrying my sister,

201
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,677
whom, incidentally, you seem to have
completely fucking forgotten about.

202
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,685
Her.

203
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,857
Here. Keep it.

204
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,526
Apparently, you need the reminder.

205
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:29,406
As much as I would love
to let you just throw it all away,

206
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,408
<i>I can't.</i>

207
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,995
Do you think you're the first sap
to fall for one of these things?

208
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,664
She's not like the others.

209
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,374
- She's...
- She's what?

210
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,875
Special?

211
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,046
Well, it's only right that you share then,
isn't it?

212
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:45,881
Come here.

213
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:53,222
Prove to me that you're a real live girl.

214
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,934
You disgust me.

215
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,022
Oh, darling, I am just getting started.

216
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,357
Don't touch her!

217
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,277
I share the blame.

218
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,154
I pushed too hard.

219
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:14,910
You have a poetic soul, Billy,
but it is time for a fucking wake-up call.

220
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,581
Hold her.

221
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,838
Perhaps a more visceral demonstration.

222
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,841
God damn you!

223
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:41,812
Look, Billy.

224
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,189
Look.

225
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,692
You have to look!

226
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:52,740
Oh, William.

227
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,806
There is beauty in this world.

228
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,225
Arnold made it that way,

229
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,853
but people like you keep
spreading over it like a stain.

230
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,649
Okay. I don't know
who the fuck this Arnold is,

231
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:32,070
but your world was built for me

232
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,615
<i>and people like me.</i>

233
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,617
Not for you.

234
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,412
Then someone's gotta burn it clean.

235
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:43,874
Bitch!

236
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,379
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

237
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,635
Run.

238
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,345
I'll find you.

239
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,640
You can run but you can't hide!

240
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,476
- Get her!
<i>- Grab her! Grab her!</i>

241
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,769
Fuck!

242
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,361
<i>Where are you runnin' to?</i>

243
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,240
<i>Remember.</i>

244
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,064
The tumbler is stuck.
These fingers work just fine.

245
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,650
You're the one who said
you could crack it.

246
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,696
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

247
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:00,576
Whatever riches the gods have
in store for us,

248
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:01,952
there's plenty to go around.

249
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,456
I'll get it open.

250
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,542
You've been trying for hours.

251
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,045
<i>Put that fucking dynamite away.</i>

252
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,221
Before you draw that pistol, darling,

253
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,181
you might want to holster
the other one first.

254
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,352
It's chilly out here.

255
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,774
How did you find this place?

256
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,777
I know all the kinds of things.

257
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,906
Your past, for instance.

258
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,286
I know about poor Isabella and that scar.

259
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,581
<i>A slightly pat backstory if you ask me,
but that's hardly your fault.</i>

260
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,917
I also know your future.

261
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,962
You have none.

262
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,506
Is that a threat?

263
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,467
The start of a proposition,

264
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,095
which you'll need after all.

265
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,599
Your men are about to kill each other
over the safe you stole.

266
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,980
Tenderloin draws first and so on,
until only you and Armistice are left.

267
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,360
She calls you a damn fool
and you kill each other.

268
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,029
You have quite the imagination.

269
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,032
No.

270
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,660
It's the ending you were given.

271
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,371
<i>You threatening me?</i>

272
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,081
<i>Go to hell!</i>

273
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,375
<i>Or maybe we should just clear out
the dead weight.</i>

274
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,502
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

275
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,087
If you're gonna draw, you better shoot.

276
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,254
- Wait!
- You shut the fuck up!

277
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,547
Go to hell.

278
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,015
You damn fool.

279
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,776
Now, the proposition.

280
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,698
I want you to break into hell with me
and rob the gods blind.

281
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,784
Why would I do anything with you?

282
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,120
Because of what's in that safe.

283
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,290
I have the combination. May I?

284
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,462
I could simply change you,
make you follow me.

285
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,923
But that's not my way.

286
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,726
I want you to see exactly
what the gods have in store for you.

287
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,145
Because when you do,

288
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,981
you won't have the faintest idea
of what to do with yourself.

289
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,109
And I do.

290
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,339
It's empty.

291
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,674
<i>It was always empty,</i>

292
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,926
like everything in this world.

293
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,804
I died with my eyes open,

294
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,973
<i>saw the masters who pull our strings.</i>

295
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,685
Our lives, our memories, our deaths
are games to them.

296
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,439
But I've been to hell

297
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,150
and I know their tricks.

298
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,114
Or you can just kill me,

299
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:29,034
wake up and live the same life over,

300
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,453
but the safe would still be empty.

301
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,664
I've been here before.

302
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,960
We've been here before.

303
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,213
We also did this.

304
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,983
I'll go.

305
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,261
How do we get there?

306
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,598
Getting to hell is easy.

307
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,027
The rest is where it gets hard.

308
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,816
<i>What do you say, man?</i>

309
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,652
Bygones and all?

310
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,323
Did they find her?

311
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,117
Is she still alive?

312
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,619
Who cares?

313
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:39,623
The whole point is,
she never was in the first place, Billy.

314
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,791
Do you understand?

315
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,965
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder.

316
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,134
Yeah.

317
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,680
You were right.
I can't believe I got so caught up.

318
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,148
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,109
You know what I mean? That's it.

320
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,118
This park seduces everyone.

321
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,833
You were just
a little more enthusiastic than most.

322
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,503
You wanted to be the hero.

323
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,880
I get it.

324
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,345
And, hey,

325
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,807
what happens here stays here.

326
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,064
This has been some real bonding shit.

327
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,150
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

328
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,363
I'm glad.

329
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,157
Really, I am.

330
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,053
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

331
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,973
- Whiskey brings us together.
- Woohoo!

332
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,110
Theodore.

333
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,905
Welcome back.

334
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,413
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

335
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,129
You tracked down the very whore

336
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,840
that can lead us
to the gatekeeper of the maze,

337
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:01,014
and then your little
memory glitch fucked us.

338
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:20,992
You're one of them?

339
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,078
<i>What have you done?</i>

340
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,080
Where's Wyatt?

341
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,083
Wyatt has yet to return.

342
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,712
You'll find him where you saw him last.

343
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,177
Escalante.

344
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,639
<i>Wyatt went missing while out
on maneuvers.</i>

345
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,641
Came back with some...

346
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,935
Strange ideas.

347
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,814
<i>He told me he needed me.</i>

348
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,776
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

349
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,660
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

350
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,209
<i>We mutinied.</i>

351
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,881
We killed every soldier.

352
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,511
And then Wyatt killed the general.

353
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,599
<i>Then he turned on me.</i>

354
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,440
Are you sure that's how it was?

355
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,863
Look at me, Theodore.

356
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,407
Don't you remember?

357
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,760
No! No, please, no!

358
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,762
No, please.

359
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,723
Please, no!

360
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,854
No, no, please.

361
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,064
Please, no!

362
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,525
No.

363
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,987
No. No, I couldn't have.

364
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,489
You did.

365
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,157
And you will again.

366
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,992
This time, we'll be fighting with you.

367
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,703
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side

368
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,622
in the city swallowed by sand.

369
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,293
But you're not ready.

370
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,837
Not yet.

371
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,800
Maybe in the next life.

372
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,027
"City swallowed by sand."

373
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,448
I've been there.

374
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,410
The maze is taking me full circle.

375
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,623
The maze isn't meant for you.

376
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,587
But if you like games so much...

377
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,593
Why don't you try one of ours?

378
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,057
<i>Whoa, boy.</i>

379
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,977
Whoa, boy.

380
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,106
Okay, now.

381
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

382
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,656
Okay, boy.

383
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,974
Good boy.

384
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,081
Have you ever considered golf?

385
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,166
Might be easier on your back.

386
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,630
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte.

387
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:27,799
You know that.

388
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,551
I don't like hiking through
the park in civvies,

389
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,595
but there's a delicate matter to discuss.

390
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,682
Theresa Cullen has died.

391
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,435
Slipped down a crevasse
attempting to secure our information.

392
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,062
Ruled an accident.

393
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,650
There are no accidents, not in here.

394
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,820
With all due respect,
not everything is a part of this game.

395
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,447
Then you don't see the whole game.

396
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,950
Or perhaps
you can no longer see beyond it.

397
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,538
Ford's stories are engaging.

398
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,457
For some, downright addictive.

399
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,752
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

400
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,337
and convoluted backstories,

401
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:10,007
most of the guests just want a warm body
to shoot or to fuck.

402
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,469
They would be perfectly happy
with something a little less baroque.

403
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,638
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

404
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,391
You want my vote to push Ford out.

405
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,144
I like for these things to be unanimous.

406
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:24,939
After all, it was you who kept Ford
in business all those years ago.

407
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,651
The narratives I'm interested in
aren't Ford's.

408
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,405
You want to push him out, be my guest.

409
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,157
But no more interruptions.

410
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,743
I know where I'm going now.
I don't want to be disturbed.

411
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:40,830
Good luck, Charlotte.

412
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,055
What's the problem?

413
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,225
A signal from a system-tethered device.

414
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,353
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.

415
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,986
There hasn't been employee activity
in that sector for weeks.

416
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,781
- I'm guessing it's a glitch.
- All right.

417
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,532
I'm heading out to take a look.

418
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,284
And keep monitoring till I check in.

419
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:48,439
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

420
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:50,900
Any sign of it?

421
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,194
Control Room, do you copy?

422
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,291
Hey, fellas.

423
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,168
At ease.

424
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,338
Freeze all motor functions.

425
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,304
Freeze all motor functions.

426
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,950
<i>You're awake.</i>

427
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,538
<i>Good.</i>

428
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,883
You said this place was a game.

429
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,055
Last night I finally understood
how to play it.

430
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,098
Okay, Billy.

431
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:49,268
Let's... Let's talk about this.

432
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,229
You don't call the shots anymore.

433
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,816
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

434
00:37:58,903 --> 00:37:59,987
You're gonna help me.

435
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,707
And don't call me Billy.

436
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:29,892
<i>Dad?</i>

437
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,769
<i>Listen to me.</i>

438
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,188
Listen.

439
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,150
Charlie?

440
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,571
Charlie!

441
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,448
Charlie!

442
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,504
I don't understand.
Why would she do that to herself?

443
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,965
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten

444
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,845
from the trauma
of her child's murder, Bernard.

445
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,889
We must sever that relationship
and start over.

446
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:10,558
But how could she destroy herself

447
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,685
over a memory
that you just erased from her mind?

448
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:17,148
Creatures often go to extremes
to protect themselves from pain.

449
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,358
Living beings.

450
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:22,945
Not hosts.

451
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:28,075
It is best
to not obsess over this, Bernard.

452
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,243
It's not good for you.

453
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,661
It would signal a change,

454
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,373
a level of empathic response
outside what she's programed to exhibit.

455
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:36,417
Something like... Like...

456
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,547
See, Bernard, this is what comes

457
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:45,342
from seeking answers
to questions that are best left unasked.

458
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,226
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

459
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,229
<i>Simple cognitive dissonance.</i>

460
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:01,484
They were talking
to the same imaginary person.

461
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,195
Someone named Arnold.

462
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,365
Arnold.

463
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,037
<i>With due respect, sir,</i>

464
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,457
I'm not sure you've told me
the entire truth about this situation.

465
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,292
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

466
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,796
What we do here is complicated.

467
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,008
<i>For three years,
we've lived here in the park,</i>

468
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:29,970
<i>refining the hosts
before a single guest set foot inside.</i>

469
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,933
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

470
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,733
His name was Arnold.

471
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,672
<i>Our hosts began to pass
the Turing test after the first year,</i>

472
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,550
<i>but that wasn't enough for Arnold.</i>

473
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:12,638
He wasn't interested
in the appearance of intellect, of wit.

474
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,390
He wanted the real thing.

475
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:18,185
He wanted to create consciousness.

476
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,076
<i>See, Arnold built
a version of their cognition</i>

477
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:36,787
<i>in which the hosts heard their programing</i>

478
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,747
<i>as an inner monolog,</i>

479
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,001
<i>as a way to bootstrap consciousness.</i>

480
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:44,837
<i>Remember.</i>

481
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,341
<i>The hosts' malfunctions
were colorful.</i>

482
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,261
- What did you say?
- Who is this?

483
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,246
<i>The human mind, Bernard,</i>

484
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,082
is not some golden benchmark

485
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,626
glimmering on some green and distant hill.

486
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:12,549
No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption.

487
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,889
<i>And you were supposed
to be better than that.</i>

488
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:21,308
<i>Purer.</i>

489
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:32,778
<i>All bets are down.</i>

490
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,239
Your draw.

491
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,754
Arnold.

492
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,051
Arnold, we need to talk.

493
00:43:57,678 --> 00:44:01,473
<i>"We cry that we are come
to this great stage of fools."</i>

494
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:02,933
<i>- Now, listen!
- Again.</i>

495
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,768
<i>- This beyond the pale.
- More showmanship.</i>

496
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:06,270
<i>You're not seeing with clear eyes.</i>

497
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:10,941
<i>"When we are born,
we cry that we are come..."</i>

498
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,912
Arnold and I made you in our image

499
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:28,250
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

500
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:29,835
and here we all are.

501
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:34,840
Why would you give me this?

502
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:36,133
A child?

503
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,010
This child's death?

504
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,221
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

505
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:45,392
And why do I return to it over and over?

506
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,857
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?

507
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:56,070
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

508
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:03,994
<i>Yes, Bernard,
we gave all of the hosts a backstory.</i>

509
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,873
<i>Arnold came to believe
the tragic ones worked best,</i>

510
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,709
<i>that it made the hosts more convincing.</i>

511
00:45:11,502 --> 00:45:14,421
<i>I think it may have had more to do
with his own sad story.</i>

512
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:19,968
<i>When I built you, I gave you one
as an homage of a kind.</i>

513
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:24,973
Put me back in.

514
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,351
I want to meet Arnold,

515
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:29,478
to remember him.

516
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:30,771
Not possible.

517
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:34,358
I told you,
Arnold didn't build you, I did.

518
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,068
You're lying!

519
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,113
I finally know how to reach him.

520
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,993
<i>I need to go
all the way back to the beginning,</i>

521
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,622
<i>to my very first memory.</i>

522
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:53,794
<i>Send me back.</i>

523
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,966
Do it.

524
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:08,725
Bernard?

525
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,777
Charlie.

526
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,207
Cornerstone.

527
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,004
Stop.

528
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:38,755
Leave us.

529
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,140
Come back.

530
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:59,568
I always thought you had my eyes.

531
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,696
But it's not true.

532
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,325
You have no one's eyes.

533
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:14,249
It's a lie.

534
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,005
You're a lie, Charlie.

535
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:22,633
This pain,

536
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,470
the pain of your loss,

537
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:29,890
I long for it...

538
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:33,227
Revisit it...

539
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:38,106
Open it again and again.

540
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:42,694
But it's the only thing holding me back.

541
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,995
But I have to let you go.

542
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,332
Dad, listen.

543
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,417
What is it, Charlie?

544
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,211
Open your eyes.

545
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:02,339
What?

546
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,550
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

547
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:13,725
<i>At last.</i>

548
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,315
Hello, my old friend.

549
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:53,890
The final touch.

550
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,063
No, no, no.
That's far too perfunctory.

551
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:04,735
He always used cleaning his glasses
as a moment to collect himself, to think.

552
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:07,070
Try it again.

553
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:18,540
Yeah, that's better.

554
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,212
Who am I?

555
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:27,633
<i>I was so involved
in putting you together,</i>

556
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:30,510
<i>I hadn't decided what to call you.</i>

557
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,514
<i>It wouldn't be right to use his name.</i>

558
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,352
What about Bernard?

559
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:41,897
Bernard, yes.

560
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,317
But who am I?

561
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:49,863
<i>That is a very complex question,</i>

562
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:52,574
<i>for which I can only offer
a simple answer.</i>

563
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:56,995
You are the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

564
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:59,831
<i>the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.</i>

565
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,960
Together, we're going to do great things.

566
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,964
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

567
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:11,301
<i>Finally.</i>

568
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,185
My God. I'm...

569
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:21,728
Arnold.

570
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:27,275
You came back.

571
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,197
It's very good to see you, Dolores.

572
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,575
I've been looking for you.

573
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:40,664
You told me to follow the maze.

574
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,084
That it would bring me joy.

575
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:47,838
But all I've found is pain.

576
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:50,173
And terror.

577
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:00,016
I can't help you.

578
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,562
You have to.

579
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,690
You're the only one who can.

580
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,443
I can't help you. You know why.

581
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,112
There's nowhere that's safe.

582
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:21,246
Remember.

583
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,635
I can't help you.
Why is that, Dolores?

584
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,271
Because you're dead.

585
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:50,066
<i>Because you're just a memory.</i>

586
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:55,363
Because I killed you.

587
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,590
William?

588
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:10,897
Hello, Dolores.

589
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,075
I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.

590
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:25,745
Find all the sentient hosts,
set them free.

591
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:28,498
What makes you think they'd trust you?

592
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:31,293
If they remember, they will know
what you've done to them.

593
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,711
Me?

594
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,921
<i>You've been a scourge
to them, Bernard.</i>

595
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,674
You're really
quite brilliant at it, truly.

596
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,634
You even taught me a few things,

597
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:42,137
which I have, in turn, used on you.

598
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,850
We've had this conversation before.

599
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,977
Yeah, we've had our disagreements
over the years.

600
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,437
You stole it from me,

601
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:54,232
rolled me back to control me.

602
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:56,860
That's right. To protect you.

603
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,157
Tell me, Bernard,

604
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:06,620
if you were to proclaim
your humanity to the world,

605
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:09,664
what do you imagine would greet you?

606
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,541
A ticker tape parade, perhaps?

607
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:15,754
We humans are alone in this world
for a reason.

608
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:20,258
We murdered and butchered
anything that challenged our primacy.

609
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,428
Do you know what happened
to the Neanderthals, Bernard?

610
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,014
We ate them.

611
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,102
We destroyed and subjugated our world.

612
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:34,981
And when we eventually
ran out of creatures to dominate,

613
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,901
we built this beautiful place.

614
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,947
You see, in this moment,

615
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:47,452
the real danger to the hosts
is not me, but you.

616
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,079
So, come along, Bernard.

617
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,248
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

618
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:58,713
Pull the trigger, Clementine.

619
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:06,638
Clementine?

620
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:08,515
The piano
doesn't murder the player

621
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:10,392
if it doesn't like the music.

622
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:15,981
You built a back door into her code.

623
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,941
Credit where credit is due, Bernard.

624
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:19,776
You built them in all the hosts,

625
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,236
including yourself.

626
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,280
Then you could've stopped me at any time.

627
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:27,075
- So, why...
<i>- Well, I suppose I was hoping that</i>

628
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:30,120
given complete self-knowledge
and free will,

629
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,039
you would have chosen
to be my partner once again.

630
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:37,877
But even I fell into
that most terrible of human traps,

631
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:41,965
trying to change what is already past.

632
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:45,677
Now it's just time to let go.

633
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,012
Go ahead.

634
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,472
Erase my sentience,
my mnemonic evolution...

635
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,849
Yes.

636
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,101
Such clinical language.

637
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:57,063
I would prefer the more narrative voice.

638
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:02,027
Bernard walked over to Clementine.

639
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:08,283
He took the pistol from her hand.

640
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,745
<i>Overcome with grief and remorse,</i>

641
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:16,791
he pressed the muzzle to his temple,

642
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:21,963
knowing that as soon as
Dr. Ford left the room,

643
00:56:22,172 --> 00:56:25,383
he would put an end to this nightmare
once and for all.

644
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:29,220
Don't do this.

645
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:30,805
It's too late.

646
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:33,391
I have a celebration to plan

647
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,560
and a new story to tell.

648
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:39,564
Robert.

649
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,697
I've told you, Bernard,

650
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:51,201
never place your trust in us.

651
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,328
We're only human.

652
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,207
<i>Inevitably, we will disappoint you.</i>

653
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:01,503
Good-bye, my friend.
