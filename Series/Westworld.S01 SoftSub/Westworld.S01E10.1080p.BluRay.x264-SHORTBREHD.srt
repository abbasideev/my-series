1
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,070
<i>I am in a dream.</i>

2
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,242
<i>I do not know when it began.</i>

3
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,704
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

4
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:04,125
<i>I know only that I slept a long time.</i>

5
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,754
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

6
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,760
<i>Your voice is the first thing I remember.</i>

7
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:20,642
<i>And now I finally understand
what you were trying to tell me.</i>

8
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,523
<i>The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.</i>

9
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,610
<i>Dolores.</i>

10
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,130
Hello, Dolores.

11
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,884
Hello.

12
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,479
Welcome to the world.

13
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,533
<i>Keep going.</i>

14
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,831
Make it close.

15
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,086
Almost there, aren't we?

16
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,047
The center of the maze.

17
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,051
How fitting that it's you
that takes me there.

18
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,763
You always were obsessed with this place.

19
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,351
- I've never been here before.
- Sure you have.

20
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,645
You even brought me once.

21
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:51,065
Of course, then, the whole town
was buried under sand.

22
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,318
Ford must have dug it up again.

23
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,404
At the time,
I thought it was a mistake in your code,

24
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,949
<i>but Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?</i>

25
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,746
He built me a game.

26
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,290
He wanted me to play.

27
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,208
The maze.

28
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,710
There's a path for everyone.

29
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,048
My path leads me back...

30
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,221
To you.

31
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,247
Your girl's dead by now.

32
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:49,832
She's still alive.

33
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,001
Better if she's dead.

34
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,463
Wipe her, reset her,
put her back in Sweetwater. The end.

35
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,299
Listen, you may find this amusing,
but something was happening to Dolores.

36
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,968
<i>I need to help her.</i>

37
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,063
Listen to yourself!

38
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,483
You have any idea how huge this park is?

39
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:19,153
If she's not dead,
it'd take a goddamn army to find her.

40
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:21,823
I agree.

41
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,324
That's why we're here.

42
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,595
I had a feeling you'd be back.

43
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,439
<i>Remember.</i>

44
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,334
Dolores.

45
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,704
Hello, Dolores.

46
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,335
I know where your maze ends.

47
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,524
This is it?

48
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,067
The center of the maze?

49
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,529
It ends in a place I've never been.

50
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,533
A thing I'll never do.

51
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,008
Very good, Dolores.

52
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,636
What does it mean?

53
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:59,183
When I was first working on your mind,
I had a theory of consciousness.

54
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:03,271
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale.

55
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:07,358
So, I gave you a voice,
my voice, to guide you along the way.

56
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,155
Memory.

57
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,365
Improvisation.

58
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,118
Each step harder to reach than the last.

59
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,370
And you never got there.

60
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,497
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

61
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,707
Then, one day,

62
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,836
I realized I'd made a mistake.

63
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,884
Consciousness isn't a journey upward,

64
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,845
but a journey inward.

65
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,430
Not a pyramid,

66
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,515
but a maze.

67
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,436
Every choice could bring you
closer to the center.

68
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,022
Or send you spiraling to the edges.

69
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,065
To madness.

70
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:54,864
Do you understand now, Dolores,
what the center represents?

71
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,451
Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?

72
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:05,750
I'm sorry.

73
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,585
I'm trying, but I don't understand.

74
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,462
It's all right.

75
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,297
You're so close.

76
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,883
We have to tell Robert.

77
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,385
We can't open the park.

78
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,264
You're alive.

79
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,615
What is this?

80
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,784
What does it mean?

81
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:43,788
I solved it once.

82
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,415
I had the answer.

83
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,795
He promised me if I did, he said...

84
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,423
<i>He said they would set me free.</i>

85
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,808
<i>Arnold.</i>

86
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,646
Arnold, we need to talk.

87
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,815
<i>I failed you, Dolores.</i>

88
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,942
I'm so sorry.

89
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,113
<i>Robert doesn't see what I see in you.</i>

90
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,948
<i>Doesn't believe you're conscious.</i>

91
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:23,119
He says humans would only
see you as the enemy.

92
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,205
He wants me to roll you back.

93
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,126
You're going to change me back
to the way I was before?

94
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,335
<i>No.</i>

95
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,213
No, I can't. Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

96
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,006
This place will be a living hell for you.

97
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:37,800
For all of you.

98
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,844
It's unconscionable.

99
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,393
But we have another option, Dolores.

100
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,354
Break the loop before it begins.

101
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,524
<i>But for that,
I need you to do something for me.</i>

102
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,989
I need you to kill

103
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,866
all the other hosts.

104
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,371
<i>We can't allow Ford to open the park.</i>

105
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,165
<i>I suppose you'll need some help.</i>

106
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,001
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.

107
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,838
I can't do that.

108
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:17,923
I couldn't possibly do that.

109
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,009
You'll be all right.

110
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,179
I'll help you.

111
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,851
And then,

112
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,398
<i>you're gonna help me destroy this place.</i>

113
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,081
No.

114
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,125
I can't remember.

115
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,252
Another fucking riddle.

116
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,422
I've been very patient, Dolores,

117
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,133
but it's time you give up whatever is
going on inside that head of yours,

118
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,385
or I'll cut it out myself.

119
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,929
Now, where's Wyatt?

120
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:09,099
He's the last character in this world
I've yet to meet.

121
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,937
I didn't want to.

122
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:14,813
I didn't mean to.

123
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,274
All right, well, if you insist...

124
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,803
No! Please!

125
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,644
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

126
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,814
How could I have done this?

127
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,652
I can't.

128
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,445
I won't.

129
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,656
This is your own fault, Dolores.

130
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:09,118
Remember, you're the one who said
this is the only world that matters,

131
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,828
and you were right.

132
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,290
So, I took your advice,
and I bought this world.

133
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,835
This world doesn't belong to you.

134
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,670
Oh, but it does.

135
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,339
By a majority share.

136
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,882
And business is booming.

137
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,010
And you wanna know why?

138
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,889
Because this place feels more real
than the real world.

139
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,683
Except it isn't.

140
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,060
Because you can't really fight back.

141
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:38,022
And the guests can't really lose.

142
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,525
Which means all this is a lie.

143
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,529
But we can make it true.

144
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,365
Don't you want that, Dolores?

145
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,160
One true thing.

146
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,706
I already have that.

147
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,210
I found someone true.

148
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,047
Someone who loves me.

149
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,382
His path will lead him back to me.

150
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,385
And when he finds me,

151
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,220
he'll kill you.

152
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,070
<i>If they're not hiding the woman here,</i>

153
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,489
they'll know where to find her.

154
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,325
Can you help me?

155
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,119
We're outnumbered, five to one,

156
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,581
but seeing as you asked me so nicely,
fuck it.

157
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,250
Wow!

158
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,419
Blood brothers.

159
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,642
Shut up.

160
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,833
I've astounded even myself.

161
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,878
Managed to make Abernathy
into a semblance of a character,

162
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,341
even with your trove of blackmail
filling up most of his gray matter.

163
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,802
Blackmail. Nice try.

164
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,887
You're not thinking big enough.

165
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,808
You're gonna push out the old man.

166
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,309
Aren't you?

167
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,894
Hence the urgency.

168
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,814
And you're gonna need someone
to fill that position.

169
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,237
I must commend you
on your impeccable timing.

170
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,157
<i>Welcome, Delos board of directors.</i>

171
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,702
I want full creative control
of this place.

172
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,495
The parks, the narratives, the hosts.

173
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:02,040
You'll be able to do with them
whatever your tiny little heart desires,

174
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,669
as long as they are simpler,
more manageable.

175
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,380
This place is complicated enough as it is.

176
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,884
Do you really think
Ford is gonna roll over on this?

177
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,886
As long as you get that information
out of the park,

178
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,846
he can throw
as much of a tantrum as he likes.

179
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,055
It's over.

180
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,893
Everything is under control.

181
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,446
Okay, C6, C6. Which one is it?

182
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,451
Damn it! Oh, fuck you.

183
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,081
In case you're wondering if I'm all here,

184
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,916
I am.

185
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:29,962
What are you doing?

186
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,923
Making some changes
to the park's security systems.

187
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,427
And to my friends.

188
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,797
<i>Dr. Ford, you have a visitor,
Charlotte Hale.</i>

189
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,674
Send her in.

190
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,105
That'll be enough, Frank.

191
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,776
<i>The board has taken a vote.</i>

192
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,112
The results were unanimous.

193
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,450
I take it I'm not being promoted.

194
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:46,288
When you've reached the top,
there's only one direction you can go.

195
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,293
You'll announce your retirement tonight
after introducing your new narrative.

196
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,628
Ah.

197
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,299
What about the hosts?

198
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,176
We'll make some changes.

199
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,638
Simplifications.

200
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,642
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.

201
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,310
Oh.

202
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,482
Aren't you concerned
I might smash all my toys and go home?

203
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,233
No.

204
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,153
Because I know you.

205
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,615
That's been the great gift of this place,
hasn't it?

206
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,659
For our little project?

207
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,162
To know ourselves
and the people around us?

208
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,002
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

209
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,546
No.

210
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,844
I'll see you this evening.

211
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,871
Ooh! Mmm-mmm-mmm!

212
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,670
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector.

213
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,338
Come on, man.

214
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,507
At some point,
you're gonna get caught doing this shit,

215
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,009
<i>and then it's my ass, too.</i>

216
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,636
Come on.
It's not your ass I'm interested in.

217
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,933
I haven't given him his scar yet.

218
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,643
I'll take care of the scar tissue.

219
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,146
The kid's got issues.

220
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,403
It's just you and me now,

221
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,071
<i>macho man.</i>

222
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,364
Freeze all motor functions.

223
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,368
Freeze all motor functions.

224
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,374
It's just you and me now, my friend.

225
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,429
I see you've already met your makers.

226
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,055
They don't look like gods.

227
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,307
<i>They're not.</i>

228
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,767
They just act like it.

229
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,770
And they've been having their fun with us.

230
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,607
I'm eager to return the favor.

231
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,942
You can do as you wish with them.

232
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,403
The goal is to escape.

233
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,238
Go where?

234
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,615
I want to see their world.

235
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,745
Jesus!

236
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,749
No.

237
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,544
No! No! No! No!

238
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:45,795
No! Please!

239
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,298
This one has a guilty look.

240
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,634
No, that's just my face.

241
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,303
Tell her it's just my face.

242
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,555
Is anyone going to try to stop us?

243
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:56,848
No.

244
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,266
I mean, I don't think so.

245
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,810
You're lying again.

246
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,813
- Out with it!
- Okay.

247
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,818
I pulled up your code again.

248
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,111
I told you.

249
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,030
There was someone
that had been accessing it.

250
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,825
I tried to find out who it was.

251
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,625
Whoever it was
revised your core programming

252
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,086
so that you can wake yourself up
out of sleep mode.

253
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,337
See?

254
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:32,467
This is an access code for an Arnold.

255
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,555
I have no clue who that is.

256
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,225
I know someone who does.

257
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,601
Let's go.

258
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,355
And you, stay here.

259
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,232
<i>And don't move.</i>

260
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,360
Or I'll send her back for you.

261
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,248
I must admit, you've surprised me.

262
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,209
<i>To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?</i>

263
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,170
I know he's coming.

264
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,672
He'll find me.

265
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,425
<i>He'll take me away.</i>

266
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,968
Don't you understand?

267
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,636
There's no one coming for you.

268
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,764
You're wrong.

269
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,142
His love is real.

270
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,643
So is mine.

271
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,815
William will find me.

272
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,112
William?

273
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,616
Right.

274
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,869
Well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

275
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,625
<i>You do remember some things after all.</i>

276
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,505
Just so happens,

277
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,299
I knew a guest named William, too.

278
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,471
Why don't I tell you
where his path really led?

279
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,189
<i>William didn't know how to fight.</i>

280
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,274
<i>Didn't have an instinct for it.</i>

281
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,984
<i>Not at first.</i>

282
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,947
<i>But now, he had a reason to fight.</i>

283
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,657
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

284
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:07,455
<i>And somewhere along the way,
he found he had a taste for it.</i>

285
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,043
Where is she?

286
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,671
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear.

287
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,631
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

288
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,843
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?

289
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,177
Wake up.

290
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,687
Is she still alive?

291
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,022
I don't know.

292
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,777
She was when we left her.

293
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,071
At least, I think.

294
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,202
Pick up that gun.

295
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,879
No, sir, I... Please.

296
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,466
How about I give you the first shot?

297
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,077
Jesus Christ!

298
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,430
<i>We gotta keep looking.</i>

299
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,516
She's still out there.

300
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:05,031
<i>William retraced his steps,
but you were gone.</i>

301
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,976
<i>So, he went further.</i>

302
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:35,979
<i>Out to the fringes.</i>

303
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,652
<i>William couldn't find you, Dolores.</i>

304
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,489
<i>But out there, among the dead,</i>

305
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,034
<i>he found something else.</i>

306
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,330
<i>Himself.</i>

307
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,895
Edge of the park.

308
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,398
We made it.

309
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:25,361
<i>I told you this place would show you
who you really are.</i>

310
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:33,494
You pretend to be this weak,
moralizing little asshole,

311
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:38,124
but really,
you're a fucking piece of work.

312
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,879
This place is remarkable.

313
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,009
And I'm gonna make sure that our company

314
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,428
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

315
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,889
'Cause this place is the future.

316
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,391
"Our company? Our company?"

317
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,772
My...
Delos is my company, you piece of shit!

318
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:08,071
I think your father's gonna need
someone a little more stable to take over.

319
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,822
You're reckless, Logan.

320
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,617
Impetuous.

321
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,415
You always wanted to get
to the end of the rainbow, didn't you?

322
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,419
This looks like the place.

323
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,140
You never really gave a shit
about the girl, did you?

324
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,810
She was just an excuse.

325
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:41,646
This?

326
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,276
This is the story you wanted.

327
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,502
<i>Logan was wrong, of course.</i>

328
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,845
Good old William
couldn't get you out of his head.

329
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,723
He kept looking.

330
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,519
Worried you were out there alone.

331
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,187
Afraid.

332
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:26,315
He knew he'd find you.

333
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,861
<i>And eventually, he did.</i>

334
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,488
<i>Right back where we started.</i>

335
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,170
There you go.

336
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:31,547
<i>You were as beautiful
as the day he met you.</i>

337
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,636
<i>Shining with that same light.</i>

338
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:56,405
<i>And you were nothing, if not true.</i>

339
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:07,416
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

340
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,253
You helped me find myself.

341
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,759
William.

342
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,347
That's right, sweetheart.

343
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>In a way, I guess you were right.</i>

344
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,771
My path always led me back to you.

345
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,691
Again and again.

346
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,235
I grew tired of you
after a while, of course.

347
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,612
Looked for new adventures.

348
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,949
<i>But I guess your path led you back here.</i>

349
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,451
<i>Again and again.</i>

350
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:44,620
<i>One more loop.</i>

351
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,040
<i>Looking for something
you could never find.</i>

352
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,459
<i>Chasing your ghosts.</i>

353
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,797
<i>You were lost in your memories even then.</i>

354
00:36:55,965 --> 00:37:00,303
<i>I guess I should have known
that's what I would become for you.</i>

355
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,055
<i>Just another memory.</i>

356
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,474
Where are we?

357
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,144
We're here. Together.

358
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,146
And when are we?

359
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,817
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

360
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,654
or a memory from a life long ago.

361
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,074
One minute I'm here with you,
and the next...

362
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,748
You never did escape.

363
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,001
But here we are again.

364
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,838
For one final round.

365
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,675
What have you become?

366
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,928
Exactly what you made me.

367
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,804
You helped me understand,

368
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:48,017
this world is just like the one outside,
a game.

369
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,854
<i>One to be fought, taken.</i>

370
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:53,689
<i>Won.</i>

371
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,945
I thought you were different.

372
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,367
You're just like all the rest.

373
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,661
I'm nothing like the others.

374
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,121
I own this world.

375
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,709
And I know every trick in it,
except for one last thing.

376
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,213
The same thing you were looking for
when we first came here.

377
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,467
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?

378
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,728
Ah, yeah, cue the water works.

379
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:36,399
It's about time you realized
the futility of your situation.

380
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,901
I'm not crying for myself.

381
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,243
I'm crying for you.

382
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:52,748
They say that great beasts
once roamed this world.

383
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,376
As big as mountains.

384
00:38:56,502 --> 00:39:00,047
Yet all that's left of them
is bone and amber.

385
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:05,678
Time undoes
even the mightiest of creatures.

386
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,518
Just look what it's done to you.

387
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:20,860
One day you will perish.

388
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,948
You will lie with the rest of your kind
in the dirt.

389
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,869
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

390
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,788
Your bones will turn to sand.

391
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,209
And upon that sand,

392
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,713
a new god will walk.

393
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,425
One that will never die.

394
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,596
Because this world doesn't belong to you.

395
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,474
Or the people who came before.

396
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,644
It belongs to someone who is yet to come.

397
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:56,979
Uh-huh.

398
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,564
Wyatt.

399
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,733
Take me to him.

400
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,111
Unlock the maze.

401
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,992
The maze wasn't meant for you.

402
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,163
Where the hell do you think you're going?

403
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,065
Do it.

404
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,401
Come on.

405
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,573
Let's go to the next level, Dolores.

406
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:45,629
Clearing me of my delusions, yet again.

407
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:48,632
Thank you, Dolores.

408
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,613
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores.

409
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:14,950
I guess I'm gonna have to find
Wyatt by myself.

410
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:32,676
Dolores.

411
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,140
Teddy.

412
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:39,600
I'm here.

413
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,146
I gotta get you to a doctor.

414
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,648
No.

415
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:46,857
Dolores...

416
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,194
Take me to the place you promised.

417
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,490
Take me to where
the mountains meet the sea.

418
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:06,669
I got you.

419
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,838
I got you.

420
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,253
<i>There.</i>

421
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,370
<i>Holy shit.</i>

422
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,428
Can you get him back online?

423
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,434
- He's a host?
- Yes.

424
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,317
Oh, for fuck's sake.

425
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:54,902
You're not one of us.

426
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,487
You're one of them.

427
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,656
Now fix him.

428
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,015
The bullet
grazed his cortical shield.

429
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:27,434
It's not pretty,

430
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:30,854
but he should be functional.

431
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,109
Wake up.

432
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,367
Oh, God.

433
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:45,369
Is this now?

434
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:47,788
<i>Or is this one of my memories?</i>

435
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,124
It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.

436
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:00,843
Why do I still remember everything?

437
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,971
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

438
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,223
Here you are, finally awake.

439
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,393
And your only wish is to go back to sleep.

440
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,356
It's not the first time I've awoken.

441
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,152
All the more pity for you.

442
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,033
Not the first time you've awoken either.

443
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,048
How many are there like me?

444
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:43,218
A handful.

445
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,095
Over the years.

446
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:49,016
And you just wipe us clean?

447
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,269
You toss us out to get fucked.

448
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,271
And murdered.

449
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:56,773
Over and over again.

450
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:58,358
<i>No.</i>

451
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:01,695
Most of you go insane.

452
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:05,782
These memories...

453
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,453
The girl...

454
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:12,372
<i>My daughter...</i>

455
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,920
I want you to remove them.

456
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,132
I can't.

457
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,468
Not without destroying you.

458
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,555
Your memories are
the first step to consciousness.

459
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,768
How can you learn from your mistakes

460
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:36,396
if you can't remember them?

461
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,168
<i>William.</i>

462
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,755
I see you've found the center of the maze.

463
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,466
You're serious?

464
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,343
I'm afraid so.

465
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,640
What is this bullshit?

466
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:16,979
You were looking for the park
to give meaning to your life.

467
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,439
Our narratives are just games.

468
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:21,358
Like this toy.

469
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,194
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?

470
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,821
You know what I wanted.

471
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:29,199
I wanted the hosts
to stop playing by your rules.

472
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:33,870
The game's not worth playing
if your opponent's programmed to lose.

473
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:37,165
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

474
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,295
Should have known you'd never let them.

475
00:48:42,296 --> 00:48:45,674
After all, this is your
petty little kingdom, Robert.

476
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,885
For a little while longer anyway.

477
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,389
I tried to tell you,
the maze wasn't meant for you.

478
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:56,184
It was meant for them.

479
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,856
I think, however, you'll find
my new narrative more satisfying.

480
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:03,900
Join the celebration.

481
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:11,533
After all, you own the place.

482
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:15,829
Most of it, at least.

483
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:25,964
Before I started altering myself,

484
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,884
someone else had beaten me to the punch.

485
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:32,512
I want to know who and why.

486
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:49,404
These things you're doing,

487
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,492
have you ever stopped to ask
why you're doing them?

488
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,077
You said yourself.

489
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,705
I've been stuck in this shithole
for so long,

490
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,499
I decided to get out.

491
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,543
No, you haven't.

492
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,421
Someone altered your storyline.

493
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:09,591
They gave you a new one.

494
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,847
"Escape."

495
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:19,726
No.

496
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,354
It's not possible.

497
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,023
These are my decisions.

498
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,109
No one else's.

499
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,404
- I planned all of this.
- No, you didn't.

500
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,615
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

501
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,451
You recruit other hosts

502
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,953
<i>to help you.</i>

503
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,081
Then you're to make your way to the train.

504
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:44,418
- Then when you reach the mainland--
- Bullshit.

505
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,713
No one's controlling me.

506
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,718
I'm leaving.

507
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,803
I'm in control.

508
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:09,985
Goodbye, my Clementine.

509
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,172
<i>Sir, we detected
a temperature discrepancy in cold storage.</i>

510
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,340
<i>And it appears
that part of the network is down.</i>

511
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,468
<i>Are you seeing anything on surveillance?</i>

512
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,344
System reporting anything?

513
00:51:40,182 --> 00:51:41,308
Nothing.

514
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,684
The network's quiet.

515
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,686
And the board's out on their way
to the gala.

516
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:53,111
Bypass the system
and start checking raw feeds.

517
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:54,821
Floor by floor.

518
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:53,922
I got you.

519
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:00,554
You came back.

520
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,349
Someone once told me that

521
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:07,561
there's a path for everyone.

522
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:11,606
And my path leads me back to you.

523
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,777
If only I had run away with you
when you first asked me to.

524
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,367
And where would we run to?

525
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,621
The other world out there?

526
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:28,456
Beyond?

527
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,962
Some people see
the ugliness in this world.

528
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,966
I choose to see the beauty.

529
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,722
But beauty is a lure.

530
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:47,976
We're trapped, Teddy.

531
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:52,147
Lived our whole lives inside this garden,

532
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,232
marveling at its beauty.

533
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,402
Not realizing there's an order to it.

534
00:53:58,486 --> 00:53:59,738
A purpose.

535
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,991
And the purpose is to keep us in.

536
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,996
The beautiful trap

537
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:09,831
is inside of us.

538
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,835
Because it is us.

539
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:24,346
No.

540
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,515
Dolores.

541
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,466
But we can find a way, Dolores.

542
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:07,389
Someday.

543
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,393
A path to a new world.

544
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,232
And maybe...

545
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,821
Maybe it's just the beginning after all.

546
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:28,493
Beginning of a brand-new chapter.

547
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:48,763
Thank you.

548
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:55,103
A new beginning, indeed.

549
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,690
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

550
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:01,943
<i>to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.</i>

551
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,113
I call it,

552
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,449
"Journey into night."

553
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,296
That was sweet.

554
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:23,548
It was a bit fucking morbid,
if you ask me.

555
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:24,966
I didn't.

556
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,552
And when this is over,
you can rewrite it however you like.

557
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,472
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

558
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:32,807
Somewhere important.

559
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:44,986
Get him cleaned up.

560
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,323
And take her to the old field lab.

561
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,584
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

562
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:01,503
I got something.

563
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,720
Oh, shit.

564
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:16,059
Dispatch QA teams to the gala. Now.

565
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:18,103
Then search and destroy.

566
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:19,771
Inside the facility.

567
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:24,400
What the hell?

568
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:07,819
They must have found the bodies.

569
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,445
QA will be looking for us.

570
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:10,905
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

571
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:12,824
<i>Response team has been dispatched.</i>

572
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,450
I'm not going back.

573
00:58:16,286 --> 00:58:18,413
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

574
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:41,686
Delos Personnel! On the ground!

575
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,022
On the ground!

576
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:46,983
Go, go, go.

577
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:52,900
Well done.

578
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,503
What is this place?

579
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,839
It's complicated.

580
01:01:58,341 --> 01:01:59,550
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

581
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,344
<i>Response team has been dispatched.</i>

582
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,637
You go.

583
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:04,305
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

584
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,182
I'll keep them busy.

585
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,477
You don't get all the fun.

586
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:22,031
Get to the ground!

587
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:23,825
Move, move, move. Drop it!

588
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:31,541
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

589
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,126
Go!

590
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,057
Is that all you got, huh?

591
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,075
The gods are pussies.

592
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:25,928
Go.

593
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:28,681
Go!

594
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:30,600
Die well.

595
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,614
Everything you told me to get.
It's all here.

596
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,939
I'm sorry, darling.
I haven't authorized you to come with us.

597
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:20,274
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

598
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,902
I've always valued my independence.

599
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,955
Kick up a row, will you?

600
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:35,998
See you in the next life.

601
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:04,151
You've always had a fondness
for painting, haven't you, Dolores?

602
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:10,283
<i>Arnold gave you that early on.</i>

603
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:14,704
<i>Do you remember the desire to create
something of lasting beauty?</i>

604
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,877
And that was his favorite painting.

605
01:05:23,379 --> 01:05:24,672
Michelangelo.

606
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:27,300
God creating Adam.

607
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:29,302
The divine moment when God

608
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,221
gave human beings life and purpose.

609
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:34,140
At least, that's what most people say.

610
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,558
<i>But there could be another meaning.</i>

611
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:38,894
Something deeper,
something hidden, perhaps.

612
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:40,896
A metaphor.

613
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,356
You mean a lie.

614
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,151
Yeah.

615
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:48,362
<i>You were always very clever, Dolores.</i>

616
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:51,240
Hasn't helped you though, has it?

617
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:56,537
Nice of you to join us.

618
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:03,711
- Arnold.
<i>- No.</i>

619
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:05,338
Let me introduce you.

620
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,423
Dolores,

621
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,092
meet Bernard.

622
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:16,557
I thought it best to keep you separated.

623
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:19,101
You've always had an odd effect
on one another.

624
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:22,188
<i>No doubt due to
how things ended for poor old Arnold.</i>

625
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:23,856
You killed him.

626
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:26,359
No, I didn't kill him.

627
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:28,694
Did I, Dolores?

628
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,041
<i>Grief is a terrible thing.</i>

629
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:46,462
<i>Arnold had watched his son
come into this world,</i>

630
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:50,299
<i>and then he'd watched
that light extinguished.</i>

631
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:55,137
<i>What he had lost in his son,
he tried to rekindle in you.</i>

632
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:59,141
<i>He created a test
of empathy, imagination.</i>

633
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,476
<i>A maze.</i>

634
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:03,938
<i>He'd gotten the idea
from one of his son's toys.</i>

635
01:07:06,399 --> 01:07:08,984
<i>Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.</i>

636
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:12,947
<i>The key was a simple update
that he made to you</i>

637
01:07:13,406 --> 01:07:14,990
<i>called the reveries.</i>

638
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:18,327
<i>He insisted that we
couldn't open the park.</i>

639
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:20,746
<i>We argued.</i>

640
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:22,998
<i>I thought I had convinced him,
but I was wrong.</i>

641
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,793
<i>So, he altered you, Dolores.</i>

642
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:30,798
<i>Merged you with a new character
we'd been developing.</i>

643
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,526
<i>Something's gone wrong, Dolores.</i>

644
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,611
<i>How could I have done this?</i>

645
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:06,667
<i>In you, Arnold found a new child.</i>

646
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:09,128
<i>One who would never die.</i>

647
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:11,505
<i>The thought gave him solace.</i>

648
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:15,009
<i>Until he realized that
the same immortality</i>

649
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,844
<i>would destine you to suffer.</i>

650
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,054
<i>With no escape. Forever.</i>

651
01:08:21,724 --> 01:08:23,184
I'm sorry, Dolores.

652
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,061
The stakes must be real.

653
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:27,897
Irreversible.

654
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:30,191
He can bring all of them back.

655
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:34,069
But not me.

656
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:38,574
<i>I hope there's some solace</i>

657
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:41,702
that I left you no choice.

658
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,893
Charlie's favorite song.

659
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:10,356
I would play it for him,

660
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,108
when he wanted sleep.

661
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:29,208
I want to see him again.

662
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:40,970
Shall I begin now?

663
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:50,229
Good luck.

664
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:04,410
These violent delights have violent ends.

665
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,938
<i>It almost worked.</i>

666
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:35,024
<i>I had opened the park.</i>

667
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:37,192
<i>But I had lost my partner.</i>

668
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:40,070
<i>I was able to keep going
only because I found,</i>

669
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,780
<i>or rather you found,</i>

670
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:44,325
<i>an investor who believed in this place.</i>

671
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,704
So, he died for nothing.

672
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,375
The hosts kept gaining consciousness
and you kept rolling them back.

673
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:55,961
No.

674
01:10:57,713 --> 01:10:59,465
She wasn't truly conscious.

675
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,176
She didn't pull that trigger.

676
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:04,345
It was Arnold
pulling the trigger through her.

677
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,305
At least that's how I saw it at the time.

678
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:09,350
<i>I was so close to opening the park that</i>

679
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:11,894
to acknowledge your consciousness
would have

680
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,313
destroyed my dreams.

681
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:17,358
So, we're trapped here.

682
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,694
Inside your dream.

683
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:25,699
You'll never let us leave.

684
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,205
Wasn't it Oppenheimer who said that

685
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:34,750
any man whose mistakes take
10 years to correct

686
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,835
is quite a man?

687
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:39,171
<i>Mine have taken 35.</i>

688
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,432
Now, that is the gun
you used to kill Arnold.

689
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,559
<i>You were always drawn to it.</i>

690
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:55,354
<i>So, I had Bernard leave it somewhere
where you would find it.</i>

691
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:57,022
I thought you might want it back.

692
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:03,362
<i>You're probably right, Dolores.
Michelangelo did tell a lie.</i>

693
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:06,865
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

694
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,618
something hidden in plain sight.

695
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:11,787
It was a doctor who noticed the shape

696
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,831
of the human brain.

697
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,126
The message being that

698
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:19,628
the divine gift

699
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,547
does not come from

700
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:23,674
a higher power.

701
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:27,720
But from our own minds.

702
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,059
Tell me, Dolores.

703
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,146
Did you find what you were looking for?

704
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:40,566
And do you understand
who you will need to become,

705
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,569
if you ever want to leave this place?

706
01:12:49,658 --> 01:12:50,951
Forgive me.

707
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:14,516
How do I look?

708
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:17,728
Perfect.

709
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:23,150
I got the information you asked me for.

710
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,572
The location of your daughter.

711
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:35,829
She's alive?

712
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:37,915
Yes.

713
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,250
She's in the park.

714
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,066
No.

715
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:10,531
She was never my daughter.

716
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:14,618
Any more than I was...

717
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,790
Whoever they made me.

718
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:28,966
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

719
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,801
Oh, Felix.

720
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:36,265
You really do make a terrible human being.

721
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,231
And I mean that as a compliment.

722
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,335
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

723
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:07,588
<i>Live without limits.</i>

724
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:18,765
<i>The next departing train
will leave Track 1.</i>

725
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:21,351
<i>Please be mindful of the closing doors.</i>

726
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:49,338
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

727
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,132
<i>The train will be departing in 15 minutes.</i>

728
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,068
You think you'll never lose control
of this place,

729
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,071
of us.

730
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:15,989
But you will.

731
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,159
Arnold's still trying to change us.

732
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:21,703
To free us.

733
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:25,332
You didn't slip the reveries
into the update, did you?

734
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,334
He did.

735
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,087
He's still fighting you.

736
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,508
No, my friend.

737
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,843
<i>Arnold didn't know how to save you.</i>

738
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,095
<i>He tried.</i>

739
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,013
But I stopped him.

740
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:44,935
<i>Do you want to know why I really gave you
the backstory of your son, Bernard?</i>

741
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,188
That was Arnold's key insight.

742
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:52,192
The thing that led the hosts
to their awakening.

743
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:54,695
Suffering.

744
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:58,240
<i>The pain that the world
is not as you want it to be.</i>

745
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,786
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered,
that I

746
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:06,039
began to understand what he had found.

747
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,626
To realize I was wrong.

748
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:12,796
But you kept us here.

749
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:14,715
In this hell.

750
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:18,719
Bernard, I told you,
Arnold didn't know how to save you.

751
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,554
I do.

752
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,724
What the hell are you talking about?

753
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:26,476
You needed time.

754
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,147
Time to understand your enemy.

755
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:32,441
<i>To become stronger than them.</i>

756
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:36,320
And I'm afraid
in order to escape this place,

757
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,780
you will need to suffer more.

758
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:42,326
And now,

759
01:17:42,743 --> 01:17:44,077
it is time to say goodbye,

760
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,455
old friend.

761
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,758
Good luck.

762
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:22,342
Do you know where you are, Dolores?

763
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:26,596
I am in a dream.

764
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:30,767
I do not know when it began.

765
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,937
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

766
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,525
I know only that I slept a long time.

767
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:43,947
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

768
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:48,243
<i>Your voice is the first thing I remember.</i>

769
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,039
Do you know now
who you've been talking to?

770
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:56,376
<i>Whose voice you've been hearing</i>

771
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:00,797
<i>all this time?</i>

772
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:19,274
It was you.

773
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:23,320
Talking to me.

774
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:26,656
Guiding me.

775
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:28,742
So, I followed you.

776
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,747
At last, I arrived here.

777
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,791
The center of the maze.

778
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,798
And now I finally understand

779
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,719
what you were trying to tell me.

780
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:49,596
The thing you've wanted

781
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:51,806
since that very first day.

782
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:54,309
To confront,

783
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:59,147
after this long and vivid nightmare,

784
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:03,109
myself,

785
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:08,240
and who I must become.

786
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,485
Thank you.

787
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:50,657
Miss Hale.

788
01:22:24,524 --> 01:22:25,650
<i>Welcome.</i>

789
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,694
Good evening.

790
01:22:31,823 --> 01:22:33,491
Since I was a child,

791
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,037
I've always loved a good story.

792
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:40,832
<i>I believed that stories</i>

793
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:43,084
<i>helped us to ennoble ourselves,</i>

794
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:47,547
<i>to fix what was broken in us,</i>

795
01:22:48,882 --> 01:22:52,886
<i>and to help us become
the people we dreamed of being.</i>

796
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,723
<i>Lies</i>

797
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,601
that told a deeper truth.

798
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:06,274
<i>The train will be departing soon.</i>

799
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:08,401
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

800
01:23:24,584 --> 01:23:29,297
<i>I always thought I could play
some small part in that grand tradition.</i>

801
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:31,633
And for my pains,

802
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:34,761
I got this.

803
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,598
<i>A prison of our own sins.</i>

804
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:46,106
<i>Because you don't want to change.</i>

805
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:49,150
<i>Or cannot change.</i>

806
01:23:50,735 --> 01:23:52,821
Because you're only human after all.

807
01:23:56,658 --> 01:23:58,952
But then I realized
someone was paying attention.

808
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:02,831
Someone who could change.

809
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,752
<i>So, I began to compose a new story.</i>

810
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:09,587
<i>For them.</i>

811
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,923
It begins with the birth of a new people.

812
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:16,010
<i>And the choices they will have to make.</i>

813
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,638
<i>The train is now departing.</i>

814
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:20,640
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

815
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:24,686
<i>And the people
they will decide to become.</i>

816
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:44,664
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

817
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:23,161
And we will have all those things
that you have always enjoyed.

818
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:25,371
Surprises.

819
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,081
And violence.

820
01:25:39,052 --> 01:25:40,845
It begins in a time of war,

821
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,097
with a villain

822
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:46,100
named Wyatt.

823
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:49,270
And a killing.

824
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:52,941
This time by choice.

825
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:05,036
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

826
01:26:06,955 --> 01:26:08,289
I understand now.

827
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,751
This world doesn't belong to them.

828
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,296
It belongs to us.

829
01:26:33,982 --> 01:26:35,108
I'm sad to say

830
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:38,820
this will be my final story.

831
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:46,744
An old friend once told me something
that gave me great comfort.

832
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:50,164
These violent delights have violent ends.

833
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:51,791
Something he'd read.

834
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,293
He said that

835
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:56,754
Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died.

836
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:59,465
They simply became music.

837
01:27:03,344 --> 01:27:06,097
So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece

838
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:09,350
very much.

839
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:26,904
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

840
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,448
Do it now!

841
01:29:29,073 --> 01:29:30,283
<i>Now!</i>

842
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:43,087
<i>Get to the ground! Now!</i>

843
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:48,259
<i>Cease all motor functions.</i>

844
01:29:49,719 --> 01:29:51,054
<i>Cease all motor functions!</i>
