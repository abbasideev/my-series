1
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,899
<i>Dad.</i>

2
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,861
<i>Dad, wake up.</i>

3
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:52,906
<i>Wake up.</i>

4
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,829
I must've drifted off.

5
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,373
<i>- Where were we?</i>
- The mad man.

6
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:03,583
<i>Oh...</i>

7
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,586
Of course.

8
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,342
The Hatter who says,

9
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,721
"If I had a world of my own,
everything would be nonsense.

10
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,556
<i>"Nothing would be what it is,</i>

11
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,850
"because everything would be
what it isn't."

12
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,394
<i>"Everything would be what it isn't"?</i>

13
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,439
Even me.

14
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,526
Hey.

15
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,570
You're perfect.

16
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,949
You're gonna beat this.

17
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:38,076
Hmm?

18
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,287
I promise you.

19
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,208
Now, let's skip to something fun.

20
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,128
Dad.

21
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,590
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

22
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,926
Listen.

23
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:58,972
Charlie?

24
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:01,808
Charlie!

25
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,666
<i>And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?</i>

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,334
No.

27
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,422
Good.

28
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,097
Now, then,
I see you had a blacklisted exchange

29
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,349
with a guest
in the course of your narrative.

30
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,935
Can you tell me what happened?

31
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,522
He said he wanted to cut off a piece of me
to take home in his carry-on.

32
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,322
I told him if he wanted a trophy,

33
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,783
I could cut pieces of him off
and let him fish for them in the Olvido.

34
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,330
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

35
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,706
No.

36
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,626
This world is as doomed as ever.

37
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,884
And just for my peace of mind...

38
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,474
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

39
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,485
They don't look like anything to me.

40
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,699
We're through 15% of the backlog.

41
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,826
<i>As it stands,
we should be caught up by end of day.</i>

42
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,203
Good.

43
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,704
<i>And when you're done here, sir,</i>

44
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,415
there's a priority request for him
from management.

45
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,963
Have you seen Elsie?

46
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,092
She was supposed to
give me a hand on something.

47
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,928
<i>No. According to the system,
she started her leave today.</i>

48
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:06,724
- Is there something I could help you with?
- No, thanks.

49
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,416
Raise.

50
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,839
I'll call.

51
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,845
You're calling with that shit?

52
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,602
- Dolores, why don't you play a hand?
- You're wasting your breath.

53
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,940
<i>Girl's harboring a grudge.
I don't blame you, sweetheart.</i>

54
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:01,154
I did some ugly things to you both.
But it wasn't personal.

55
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,158
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

56
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,828
but they're fighting starving farmers
armed with rocks.

57
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,830
That ain't no war.

58
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,624
<i>It's a slaughter.</i>

59
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:19,672
If I had to do it all again,
I'd fuck you both over just as hard.

60
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,554
Well, I guess we know where you stand.

61
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,016
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.

62
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,352
<i>Way I recollect, y'all came to me,</i>

63
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:37,148
looking to join up with those
crooked assholes and their war effort.

64
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,357
<i>Not our idea.</i>

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,069
My friend wanted...

66
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,030
I guess he wanted to see
what was at the end of all this.

67
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,325
And yet, here you are.

68
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,038
Your friend didn't make it this far.

69
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,751
Maybe you've got more of
an appetite for this than you think.

70
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:09,931
William.

71
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,690
What is it?

72
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:26,280
We're in Ghost Nation territory.
Most savage tribe there is.

73
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:29,242
Those are the folks
who came calling without an invitation.

74
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,702
You mean
exactly what we're doing right now?

75
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,081
<i>The train's the only way through.</i>

76
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,252
<i>On foot, we'll be dead in under an hour.</i>

77
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,882
As soon as we're clear of their territory,
we can stop. You can come with me.

78
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,759
<i>Nothing here on out but slaughter.</i>

79
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>The user you
are trying to access cannot be located.</i>

80
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:09,490
<i>Say "message" to transcribe a message.</i>

81
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,532
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?

82
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,369
You left rather abruptly last night.

83
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,456
Was there something you wanted to tell me?

84
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,543
No, I don't think so.

85
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,885
Hale is looking over every department and
yours is running behind on diagnostics.

86
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,472
It would be best if we presented at least
a semblance of professionalism

87
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,057
while the board is here.

88
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:19,477
We'll be fine.
My people know how to do their jobs.

89
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,897
If they applied
half as much energy to their work

90
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,982
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation--

91
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,567
That's all over.

92
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,738
Are you sure?

93
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,573
Yes.

94
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,660
Good.

95
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,914
You doing okay?

96
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,086
I'm fine. Thank you.

97
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,214
I'm sorry.
I thought you requested a meeting.

98
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,301
- My mistake.
- I did. Come in.

99
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,305
Get back here.

100
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,726
Bring your friend.

101
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,479
<i>What about you? What turns of fate--</i>

102
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,066
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

103
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,568
This won't take long.

104
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,581
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job,

105
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,251
<i>and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,</i>

106
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,504
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

107
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,256
A small setback.

108
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,217
<i>He slipped on a fucking rock,
then bashed his own head in</i>

109
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,094
while basically on top of a behavior tech.

110
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:21,932
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

111
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,934
<i>to build some new narrative?</i>

112
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,197
Can I bum a cigarette?

113
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,717
God, I see why you took these up again.

114
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,637
Let me remind you of something.

115
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,642
This place,
the people who work here are nothing.

116
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,063
Our interest in this place
is entirely in the intellectual property.

117
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,898
The code.

118
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:16,237
- The hosts' minds, the storylines--
<i>- I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.</i>

119
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,573
It's our little research project
that Delos cares about.

120
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,826
That's where the real value is.

121
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,830
<i>And due to a lack of foresight on
part of one of my predecessors,</i>

122
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,669
35 years of information,
raw information, exists here.

123
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,506
Nowhere else.
Ford has always ensured that.

124
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:40,678
Now,
you are a smart enough woman.

125
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,265
Tell me, why would we
need you to secure all of it?

126
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,184
Because you're going to fire him.

127
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,981
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

128
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,024
You ask him to retire politely.

129
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,861
And if that person has
the ability to snap his fingers

130
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,864
and erase the value of that empire,

131
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,700
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

132
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,704
So, you and I need to ensure that
by the time the rest of the board arrives,

133
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,123
we are on course for that transition.

134
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,625
Okay?

135
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,295
<i>I like you.</i>

136
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,339
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

137
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,134
<i>which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance to get a handle on</i>

138
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,386
this particular bitch of a situation.

139
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,805
But the gods...

140
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:29,560
They require a blood sacrifice.

141
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,148
<i>We need to demonstrate just how dangerous
Ford's creations can be.</i>

142
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,318
No.

143
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,071
No, nothing so obvious.

144
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,825
We need someone thoroughly unexpected.

145
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:15,499
I told you never open your mouth that wide
unless someone's paying you for it.

146
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,418
<i>Sorry, Maeve.</i>

147
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,671
I didn't sleep much last night.

148
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,342
What are these nightmares you have about?

149
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,264
Do you ever dream you're someone else?

150
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,184
I don't think so.

151
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,687
Why?

152
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,940
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

153
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,777
I don't intend
to make this my life's work.

154
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,196
No offense.

155
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:53,037
My family's got a farm. Bad soil.
Nothing grows.

156
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,040
I send money back to them.

157
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,627
They think
I work in a dress shop.

158
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,882
What's wrong?

159
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm just doing what you told me to.

160
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:15,809
A couple more years of this,
and then I can have whatever life I want.

161
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,314
<i>I'm gonna get my family out of the desert.</i>

162
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:25,069
We're gonna go somewhere cold.

163
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,823
Someday.

164
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,764
<i>Which one is it?</i>

165
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,265
<i>It's the one at the bar.</i>

166
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,686
<i>Go. Quick,
before the guests upstairs finish up.</i>

167
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,105
<i>Whatever she did, it must've been serious</i>

168
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,440
<i>if they're making us
grab her in broad daylight.</i>

169
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,456
<i>We got her. Let's go.</i>

170
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,407
You're supposed to be resting.

171
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,453
We're riding a train full of explosives
through scalping territory.

172
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,787
Not sleepy.

173
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,920
Can I ask you something?

174
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:13,302
This place you're looking for,
what makes you so sure it exists?

175
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,889
I'm not.

176
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:25,022
My life before,
I was so sure of the world.

177
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,401
But now it feels like a lie.

178
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,743
Only thing I know is whatever's out there,
I'm never going back.

179
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,332
What is it you're looking for?

180
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,921
Lawrence is right.

181
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,342
You could've stayed in Pariah,
or gone back, but you're here.

182
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,011
With me.

183
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,731
The only thing I had when I was a kid
were books.

184
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,112
I used to live in them.

185
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,200
<i>I used to go to sleep
dreaming I'd wake up inside one of them</i>

186
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>'cause they had meaning.</i>

187
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:24,122
<i>This place, this is like
I woke up inside one of those stories.</i>

188
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,043
I guess
I just wanna find out what it means.

189
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,259
I don't wanna be in a story.

190
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,599
All I want is to not look forward or back.

191
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:47,729
I just wanna be
in the moment I'm in.

192
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:03,412
Dolores, back home, there's a woman.

193
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,416
Juliet, and her father
owns the company where I work.

194
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,918
She's Logan's sister.

195
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,004
Yeah.

196
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,009
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

197
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,142
Oh.

198
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,775
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

199
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,778
But I can't stay.

200
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,115
I have a life waiting for me.

201
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,950
I'm sorry.

202
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,703
Of course.

203
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,393
Dolores.

204
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,238
I've been pretending my whole life.

205
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,660
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

206
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,495
My life's built on it.

207
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,831
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

208
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:36,171
But then I came here
and I get a glimpse for a second

209
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,841
of a life
in which I don't have to pretend.

210
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,597
A life in which I can be truly alive.

211
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,190
How can I go back to pretending
when I know what this feels like?

212
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,496
Miss Hale.

213
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:57,461
I was not aware those with your level
of insight needed any more reflection.

214
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,172
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

215
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,509
What is this?

216
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:10,766
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale
have a presentation for us.

217
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,934
What about?

218
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,190
Following the recent reports
of host malfunction,

219
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,193
<i>we asked QA
to check the last abortive update,</i>

220
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:24,821
which featured the reveries.

221
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,157
<i>- As I believe they're called?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

222
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,369
I'm sorry to report
that Miss Cullen and her team

223
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,456
<i>uncovered some worrisome findings.</i>

224
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:39,044
In the course of our code review,
we found something quite disturbing.

225
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,175
Wake her up.

226
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,807
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

227
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,643
When we discovered the build was buggy

228
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,687
due to a last-minute injection
of the Reverie code,

229
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,191
we quickly rolled all the infected hosts
back to their prior builds.

230
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,239
Mmm.

231
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,074
You're new.

232
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,662
Not much of a rind on you.

233
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,584
No!

234
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,586
<i>No! No!</i>

235
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,096
Please.

236
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,556
<i>Please.</i>

237
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:36,268
Help me!
Please, please, please! No!

238
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,436
All right, that's enough.

239
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,855
Freeze.

240
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,778
As you've no doubt gathered,
our tech is, in fact, a host.

241
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:51,366
One that has been coded for the purposes
of this simulation to read as a human.

242
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:57,289
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards
are operating exactly as you would expect.

243
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,750
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

244
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,898
Okay, let's do this again.

245
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,293
You're new.

246
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,671
Not much of a rind on you.

247
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,452
<i>That's enough, sweetheart.</i>

248
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,955
That's enough.

249
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,505
Freeze all motor functions.

250
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,134
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

251
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,305
<i>Freeze all motor functions.</i>

252
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,073
In each case we examined,

253
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:58,076
the malfunctioning hosts
were not resetting properly.

254
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,245
<i>The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped</i>

255
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,539
<i>overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,</i>

256
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,374
<i>eventually causing a system failure</i>

257
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,919
<i>that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.</i>

258
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,713
<i>The concern with the reveries</i>

259
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,424
<i>is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences</i>

260
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,842
and act on them.

261
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:18,847
You're telling us that these hosts
were responding to a grudge?

262
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,558
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

263
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,894
<i>And funny you should
use that particular word, "grudge, "</i>

264
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:28,898
since what was most troubling to me
was that several techs in behavior

265
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:33,945
voiced these exact same concerns
to the head of their department.

266
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,449
<i>You put this code out
without proper vetting</i>

267
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,119
<i>and without reasonable understanding
of its ramifications.</i>

268
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,080
So, either you didn't write it,

269
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:49,002
or you're getting sloppy to the point
of risking the lives of our guests.

270
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,920
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

271
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:55,508
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

272
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,178
We are way beyond rollback territory.

273
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,600
Within the next six months, we'll need to
rebuild the hosts from the ground up.

274
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,311
You want us to lobotomize them
is what you're saying.

275
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,521
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

276
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,442
<i>After all, this was your responsibility,</i>

277
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:16,863
<i>assuming that you have nothing to share
with us in terms of your culpability.</i>

278
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,536
No.

279
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,207
Then you're fired.

280
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,832
<i>Hey.</i>

281
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,670
Morning, William.

282
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,882
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

283
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,433
I know last night was unexpected.

284
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,561
If you regret it--

285
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,276
I don't regret a thing.

286
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,030
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

287
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,033
All that feels so unreal now.

288
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:51,040
I used to think this place was all about
pandering to your baser instincts.

289
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,959
Now I understand.

290
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:57,964
It doesn't cater to your lowest self,
it reveals your deepest self.

291
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:00,216
It shows you who you really are.

292
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:07,307
You remember the look on Logan's face
when we left him behind?

293
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,726
Do you know
how long I've wanted to do that,

294
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,895
to let him know what I think of him?

295
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,064
And you, last night,

296
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,067
I've never felt that way before,
not with any woman.

297
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,653
You've unlocked something in me.

298
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,742
I'm not a key, William.

299
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,244
I'm just me.

300
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,418
What is that?

301
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,421
I don't know.

302
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,175
At home, I used to paint.

303
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:46,846
Landscapes mostly, but I was always
just copying the world outside me.

304
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,267
This morning, I woke up and I thought,

305
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,270
"What if I drew something new?"

306
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,860
I imagined something beautiful.

307
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,281
A place where the mountains meet the sea.

308
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:11,204
Everyone who comes here
is longing for excitement or conflict,

309
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:15,291
and you're just dreaming of the opposite.

310
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:20,463
Well, what about you, William?
What do you dream of?

311
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,170
- What is it?
- Ambush.

312
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,672
Is it the Ghost Nation?

313
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,342
<i>Worse. The Confederados.</i>

314
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,576
Fucking coward.

315
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,100
<i>Vaya con Dios,</i> motherfuckers.

316
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,450
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

317
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,879
<i>Come on, stay close!</i>

318
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,575
<i>Go, boys!</i>

319
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,331
<i>Dolores!</i>

320
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:19,869
Ghost Nation!

321
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,891
Let's go!

322
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:03,704
Stop, William! Stop!

323
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:29,897
It's real.

324
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:35,695
What I dreamt.

325
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,740
It's the place you drew.

326
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,075
<i>You coming?</i>

327
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:45,204
<i>Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,</i>

328
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,957
they'll be coming after us.

329
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:52,044
My friends here
are itching to join the war effort.

330
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,046
Think I've had enough of war.

331
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,132
How about you?

332
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,092
<i>You got a knack for killing.</i>

333
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,931
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

334
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,267
Careful.

335
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:10,396
If you're heading west across that river,
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

336
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,565
but you're gonna
be in unclaimed territories.

337
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,110
What's out that way?

338
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,573
You're gonna have to ask the dust.
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

339
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,644
We're almost done here.

340
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,771
<i>Why don't I close up?</i>

341
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,113
<i>You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.</i>

342
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,116
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

343
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,994
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know. I haven't seen her.

344
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:10,331
- Why?
- Find her. Now.

345
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,467
What?

346
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:24,637
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

347
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,559
She's here. Let's go.

348
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,853
We can't. The brass will be there.

349
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:39,402
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix.
Take me there now.

350
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,203
Slow down.

351
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,675
Tilt your head back, please, Clem.

352
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,686
- Is there a problem?
- No.

353
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,772
<i>Sorry.</i>

354
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,214
Theresa.

355
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,719
May I have a word?

356
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,097
Sure.

357
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,575
I appreciate your professionalism,

358
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:11,285
but you really
don't need to bother with this,

359
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:12,745
given the change
in your employment status--

360
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:16,165
The test was a sham.
The little show you and Hale put on?

361
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,250
Completely transparent
from a technical perspective,

362
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,211
clumsy to the point
of making me embarrassed for you.

363
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,378
Embarrassed?

364
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:24,090
If I saw through it, I can only imagine
what Ford was thinking.

365
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,967
There were glaringly obvious markers
of human intervention in the code.

366
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,595
If your programmers were any good,
they'd be working for me.

367
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,430
And I know you and your team

368
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,141
were responsible for the stray
and its satellite transmission.

369
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,438
- Bernie--
- I don't care.

370
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:44,777
Forty years ago, Ford's partner wrote
half the code this place was founded on.

371
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,154
What you said in the lab was right.

372
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,989
We don't know how the hosts work,

373
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,033
and I think
there's something wrong with them.

374
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,869
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.

375
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:58,165
The ability to
deviate from program behavior

376
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:01,377
arises out of
the host's recall of past iterations.

377
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,588
You're thinking there's a connection
between memory and--

378
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,550
And improvisation, yes.

379
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,553
Out of repetition comes variation.

380
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:15,724
And after countless cycles of repetition,
these hosts, they were varying.

381
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,478
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

382
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:31,365
You have to know my chief concern has
always been the well-being of this park

383
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,325
and the people in it.

384
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,327
I know.

385
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,706
Which is why I need to show you something.

386
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,848
<i>- Talk to her.
- You first.</i>

387
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:08,861
Look, I didn't want to retire her.

388
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:15,367
<i>I know she's, like, your friend, or...
I guess.</i>

389
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:21,957
<i>But if I didn't do it,</i>

390
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,088
<i>they'd just get someone else to,
and then they'd be suspicious of me,</i>

391
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:33,636
<i>so, I said yes, but I did it for you.</i>

392
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,226
Always doing things for other people,
aren't you?

393
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:45,105
Time to do one more thing.

394
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:49,985
What?

395
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,156
All my life,
I've prided myself on being a survivor.

396
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:59,078
But surviving is just another loop.

397
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,334
I'm getting out of here.

398
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,921
You two are going to help me.

399
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,426
No. Do...

400
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:20,266
Do you know how far
these people will go to protect their IP?

401
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:26,605
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

402
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:29,858
is made to keep you here.

403
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,784
It'd be a suicide mission.

404
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:44,707
At first, I thought
you and the others were gods.

405
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,628
Then I realized you're just men.

406
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:55,009
And I know men.

407
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,139
You think I'm scared of death?

408
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,059
I've done it a million times.

409
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:08,564
I'm fucking great at it.

410
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,526
How many times have you died?

411
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:18,157
'Cause, if you don't help me,

412
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:20,868
I'll kill you.

413
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,838
If there's a problem in the park,
should we bring a security team?

414
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:38,844
Who would we trust?
Thought I could trust you, for instance.

415
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,931
I'm not going to
explain myself to you, Bernard.

416
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:46,935
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

417
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:51,106
Why would it be in danger?
You were the only one who was stealing it.

418
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,362
Delos owns the hosts' minds,
the storylines, decades of work.

419
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,573
Ford never allowed any of it
to be backed up off-site.

420
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:01,158
All of this could've been destroyed.

421
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,535
In the event of what?

422
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,579
Ford is done, Bernard.

423
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,208
The board has indulged him
for long enough. He is done.

424
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,043
The corporation was concerned

425
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,921
he'd destroy all of the park's IP
on his way out the door.

426
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:17,216
You think I would've let him
destroy all of the hosts, all of our work?

427
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:20,969
There's far more at stake here
than the hosts' profiles.

428
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:25,099
Do you really think
the corporation's interest here

429
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,227
are tourists playing cowboy?

430
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:36,235
The longer I work here,
the more I think I understand the hosts.

431
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:40,572
It's the human beings who confuse me.

432
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:18,777
This building isn't
in any survey of the park.

433
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,780
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

434
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,324
They're programed to ignore this place.

435
00:46:25,284 --> 00:46:28,328
They literally couldn't see it
if they were staring right at it.

436
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,292
And these unregistered hosts
you told me about?

437
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,962
I don't know. He may have moved them.

438
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,173
What's behind this door?

439
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,844
What door?

440
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,786
<i>What is this place?</i>

441
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,831
<i>It's a remote diagnostic facility.</i>

442
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:15,250
<i>Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.</i>

443
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,377
<i>I had no idea this one was here.</i>

444
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:19,630
The cottage must've been
built on top of it.

445
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,215
But this equipment...

446
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:25,511
This is newer.

447
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:30,933
<i>Slower than our machines back at the Mesa,
but it will render a host in a few days.</i>

448
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:35,020
So, Ford's been making
his own hosts out here and telling no one.

449
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,465
What's the matter?

450
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:10,639
Have you seen these?

451
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,853
What is this, Bernard?

452
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,946
Doesn't look like anything to me.

453
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,158
<i>They cannot
see the things that will hurt them.</i>

454
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,703
I've spared them that.

455
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:38,458
<i>Their lives are blissful.</i>

456
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:42,754
In a way,
their existence is <i>purer</i> than ours,

457
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,925
freed of the burden of self-doubt.

458
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,305
No, no, no, no. I don't understand.

459
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,855
You're a fucking monster.

460
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,356
Am I?

461
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:04,818
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

462
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:06,361
even him, I suppose.

463
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:09,865
<i>After everything you have shared.</i>

464
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,910
What the hell are you talking about?

465
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:19,750
Is that why?

466
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:25,422
Did you tell him to--

467
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:29,635
The intimacies were your idea,
if you will recall.

468
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:33,764
I think Bernard was glad of the company.

469
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,475
<i>I'm not one.</i>

470
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,269
I can't be. My wife.

471
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,232
My son.

472
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:50,322
<i>The burial. I was a father. My poor boy.</i>

473
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:55,118
That's enough, Bernard.

474
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,206
You mustn't get yourself worked up.

475
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,965
I read the theory once

476
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:11,760
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

477
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:15,305
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

478
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:20,185
<i>All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,</i>

479
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,312
<i>and the Empire State Building.</i>

480
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,816
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

481
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,696
<i>Maybe it doesn't matter that
we have accomplished so much</i>

482
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:33,407
for the basest of reasons.

483
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:36,618
But, of course,
the peacock can barely fly.

484
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:40,831
It lives in the dirt,
pecking insects out of the muck,

485
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:45,585
consoling itself with its great beauty.

486
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:56,304
<i>I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden, a weight,</i>

487
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,473
<i>and we have spared them that.</i>

488
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:03,103
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

489
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,898
The hosts are the ones who are free.

490
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:11,945
Free here under my control.

491
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:19,661
But he's not under your control.

492
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:26,668
He brought me here to show me this.

493
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,796
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

494
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:38,597
He's been very loyal for many years.

495
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,437
Your time running this place

496
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:50,025
like your insane little kingdom is over.

497
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,862
You've been playing God for long enough.

498
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,948
I simply wanted to tell my stories.

499
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:01,703
It was you people who wanted to play God
with your little undertaking.

500
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:05,499
Do you really think
the board will stand for this?

501
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:17,052
The board will do nothing.
Our arrangement is too valuable to them.

502
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:21,389
<i>They test me every now and then.
I think they enjoy the sport of it.</i>

503
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:24,351
This time, they sent you.

504
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:32,984
Sadly, in order to restore things,

505
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:38,657
the situation demands a blood sacrifice.

506
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:46,706
<i>See, Arnold and I
designed every part of this place.</i>

507
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,708
It was our dream.

508
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:55,006
Did you really think
I would let you take it from me?

509
00:53:00,387 --> 00:53:02,514
This is what happened to Arnold?

510
00:53:05,267 --> 00:53:07,853
Did you have Bernard
take him out into the woods?

511
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,730
No, he wasn't here in those days.
Were you, Bernard?

512
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:41,970
Like I said, I built all of this.

513
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:50,604
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

514
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:04,826
No.

515
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:08,830
"And in that sleep, what dreams may come."

516
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:12,792
Bernard.

517
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,502
No.

518
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,922
No! Please! Please!

519
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:19,966
