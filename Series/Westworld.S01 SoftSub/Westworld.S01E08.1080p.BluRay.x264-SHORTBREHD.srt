1
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,689
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

2
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,024
<i>Bernard?</i>

3
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:56,075
Theresa?

4
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,455
She's gone.

5
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:03,625
I killed her.

6
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:05,418
What have I done?

7
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,711
What have I done?

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,757
<i>This guilt you feel, the anguish,
the horror, the pain,</i>

9
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,884
it's remarkable.

10
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,427
A thing of beauty.

11
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,429
I'm a killer.

12
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,848
My God! My God!

13
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,767
God has nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,771
You killed her because I told you to.

15
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,191
And you should be proud
of these emotions you're feeling.

16
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,400
- Proud?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:31,986
After all, you yourself were the author
of so many of them.

18
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,616
And when we started,
the hosts' emotions were primary colors.

19
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:37,826
Love, hate.

20
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,495
I wanted all of the shades in between.

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,083
The human engineers
were not up to the task. So, I built you.

22
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,213
And together, you and I
captured that elusive thing:

23
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:51,798
heart.

24
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't understand.

25
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,679
I cared for Theresa, loved her.

26
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,765
Why did you make me kill her?

27
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,605
"One man's life or death
were but a small price to pay

28
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:11,401
"for the acquirement
of the knowledge which I sought,

29
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,113
"for the dominion I should acquire."

30
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,449
<i>All of the beauty
you and I have made in this place,</i>

31
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,994
the art of it,
they would have destroyed it.

32
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,664
They would have destroyed you.
I won't let that happen.

33
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,084
<i>Besides, we have a new story to tell.</i>

34
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,628
I will not help you.

35
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,131
I'll raze this place to the ground!

36
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,800
That's enough, Bernard.

37
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,468
That's enough.

38
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,639
You're not the first man to threaten me.

39
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,601
Arnold came to feel the way you do.

40
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,812
He couldn't stop me, either.

41
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:52,317
And as exquisite
as this array of emotions is,

42
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:58,156
even more sublime
is the ability to turn it off.

43
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,827
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

44
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,329
I need you to be yourself.

45
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:09,042
<i>Your true self. Smart. Resourceful.
Capable of covering your tracks.</i>

46
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,670
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

47
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,554
How would you like me to proceed?

48
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,308
<i>I need you to clean up your mess,
Bernard.</i>

49
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,854
<i>Any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

50
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,988
<i>When you have finished,</i>

51
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:43,826
<i>I will give you the one thing
you want most right now.</i>

52
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:48,581
<i>I will free you from those memories
of what you have done.</i>

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,545
<i>And the memory
of your relationship with Theresa.</i>

54
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,886
<i>Recalling it would only deepen your grief.</i>

55
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,306
<i>And potentially draw unwanted attention.</i>

56
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,943
<i>Best to move forward with clear eyes.</i>

57
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,698
<i>When you look back,</i>

58
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:26,911
<i>you will remember Theresa with the
fondness of a respected colleague.</i>

59
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:40,591
<i>And you will be at peace.</i>

60
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:01,612
<i>You're new.
Not much of a rind on you.</i>

61
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,780
It sure would make my day

62
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,491
if you bought me a drink
and let me show you around upstairs.

63
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,452
<i>What's upstairs?</i>

64
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:12,957
A stunning view
of my most popular attractions.

65
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,295
Two shots of gin.

66
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,966
And anything else
this heavenly creature desires.

67
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,677
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

68
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,849
This fella won't take me long.
I'll be back directly.

69
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,481
Something wrong, Maeve?

70
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,189
<i>What the hell is happening to me?</i>

71
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,193
One moment, I'm with a little girl,

72
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,529
in a different life.

73
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,073
I can see her.

74
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:31,869
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

75
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,706
The next, I'm back in Sweetwater.

76
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,583
I can't tell which is real.

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,503
Well, this is what happens
when you fuck around with your brain.

78
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,712
Your mind isn't like ours.

79
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,592
When we remember things,
the details are hazy, imperfect.

80
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,887
<i>But you recall memories perfectly.</i>

81
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,764
You relive them.

82
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,058
What happened
to the little girl in my dreams?

83
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,769
Is she still in the park somewhere?

84
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,438
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

85
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,731
I could check.

86
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,735
No.

87
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,574
It doesn't matter.

88
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,244
Every relationship I remember,

89
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,956
my daughter, Clementine.

90
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,128
It's all a story created by you
to keep me here.

91
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,255
But that's not going to work any longer.

92
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,715
I'm getting out.

93
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,049
<i>Where would you go?</i>

94
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,926
<i>You don't know
anything about the world out there.</i>

95
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,973
I'll know I'm not a puppet, living a lie.
That's enough for me.

96
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,100
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

97
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,269
It's not like
we could just stop you, anyways.

98
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,271
<i>Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me.</i>

99
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,608
Every host's spine, mine included,
has an explosive charge,

100
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,277
which will detonate if I try to leave.
Isn't that right?

101
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,112
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

102
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,655
Which vertebra was it?

103
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,491
C6.

104
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,494
But you'd need a full rebuild
to replace it.

105
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,996
I'm sure that can be arranged.

106
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,581
<i>Even if that worked,</i>

107
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,250
you would still need an army
to break out of here.

108
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:06,005
That's exactly right. I'll need allies.

109
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,468
And to get them,
I'll need administrative privileges.

110
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,094
Are you fucking kidding?

111
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,305
<i>We can't just give her control
of other hosts.</i>

112
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,349
<i>Oh, yes, you will, darling.</i>

113
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,646
Time to write my own fucking story.

114
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,407
I feel like I've been here before.
We're close.

115
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,160
- Close to what?
- Home.

116
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,217
Dolores?

117
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:24,208
Ghost Nation must have found them.

118
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,046
They'll be back.
We should keep moving, Dolores.

119
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,894
Water.

120
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,730
William.

121
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,232
Please.

122
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,277
Give me the canteen.

123
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,737
William?

124
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,961
You were sent here for us, weren't you?

125
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,965
- You're part of the ambush.
- Yes.

126
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,761
Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo.

127
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,429
In case he ran.

128
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,600
- How'd you know about the train?
<i>- Sent word from Pariah.</i>

129
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:27,980
New recruit told them a man and woman
double-crossed us,

130
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,441
<i>along with Lazo.</i>

131
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,526
<i>We were ordered to kill you all.</i>

132
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,778
Logan.

133
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,782
- We have to help him.
- He just admitted he was going to kill us.

134
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:42,119
Look at him, he's a child.
He doesn't even know why he's fighting.

135
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,455
I'll fetch more water.

136
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,541
He's too far gone.

137
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,210
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

138
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,630
He's not gone yet. He's in pain, William.

139
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,301
What kind of people would we be
if we simply let him suffer?

140
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,643
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>

141
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:22,910
<i>Come find me.</i>

142
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,168
<i>William?</i>

143
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,867
<i>He's gone.</i>

144
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,420
<i>We found her up on Python Pass,
at the bottom of a ravine.</i>

145
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,714
<i>Same ravine where we found
that stray woodcutter.</i>

146
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,092
Jesus. Theresa.

147
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,595
Has her family been notified?

148
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,390
- Yeah, her brother.
- Good.

149
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,434
What the hell happened to her?

150
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:32,229
Medical and Red Team's findings
were preliminary, but consistent.

151
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,898
It appears to have been a slip and fall.

152
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,734
<i>Cervical fracture, massive hematoma.</i>

153
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,278
No guests or hosts in the vicinity
when it occurred.

154
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,907
- Any idea what she was doing out there?
<i>- None that fit her character.</i>

155
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,992
This was found near her body.

156
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,745
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

157
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,914
including some of the hosts' core code.

158
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,458
<i>And only works from higher altitudes.</i>

159
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,667
So, if Theresa was using it,

160
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:56,295
it's possible she was trying to transmit,
and fell.

161
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,672
<i>We've had problems
in the past with third parties</i>

162
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,009
attempting to extort or bribe employees
for similar packages.

163
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,595
Do we know who the data was intended for?

164
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,931
<i>No. The transmission
was never sent.</i>

165
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,308
Theresa may have been trying
to use the woodcutter as a mule,

166
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,935
and when that failed,

167
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,937
then may have tried
to do the transfer personally.

168
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,105
<i>And suffered the same fate.</i>

169
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,816
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

170
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,777
<i>I knew Theresa well.</i>

171
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,488
<i>If she had any faults,
a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them.</i>

172
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,950
She was loyal. And careful.

173
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,619
<i>All of this feels extremely unlike her.</i>

174
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,998
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

175
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,835
She felt strongly
that it would be best to delay it.

176
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,296
That certainly helps explain Clementine.

177
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,173
<i>The host we retired.</i>

178
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:46,011
It seems
yesterday's demonstration was a hoax

179
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,514
<i>designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

180
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:49,807
Was it?

181
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,976
I examined the code, it had been altered.

182
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:55,813
A clumsy set of fingerprints
left by one of QA's technicians.

183
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,360
<i>When you find a cancer in an organization,
you must cut it out before it can spread.</i>

184
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,570
<i>To that end,</i>

185
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,532
the expansive access and oversight
granted to QA will need to be reined in

186
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:11,036
until a new,
more principled team can be installed.

187
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,413
It's gonna leave us shorthanded.

188
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,541
I can automate most of the park's
safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

189
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,334
How efficient of you.

190
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,003
It's a bit of work.

191
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,256
But with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

192
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,926
He will be reinstated as Head of Behavior

193
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,556
now that Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

194
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,017
Of course. With my apologies.

195
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,704
Something's up. Brass are wound up tight.

196
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,873
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

197
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,708
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

198
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,418
Something else.
Some kind of accident in the park.

199
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,213
We need to wrap this up,
make it like things are normal.

200
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,718
That means we need the tablet back.
And you go back to playing dumb.

201
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,472
I've learned what I needed.

202
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,643
Great. So, then
you've probably figured out

203
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,228
that you can fiddle around
with your personality all you want,

204
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,396
but you're not getting out of here.

205
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,232
You can make it to the door,
but literally not one step further.

206
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:26,070
The things you'd need to change
are burned into your core code so deep,

207
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,237
no one can touch 'em.

208
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:32,117
Funny you should mention that.
Parts of me are quite old.

209
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,080
There are some elegant formal structures.

210
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,291
<i>A kind of recursive beauty, but complex.</i>

211
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,087
Like two minds, arguing with each other.

212
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,924
There are things in me,

213
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,678
<i>things I was designed to do
that are just out of my reach.</i>

214
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,181
<i>They almost seem to be dormant.</i>

215
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,853
- Who is Arnold?
- I don't know, sweetheart.

216
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:04,274
But whatever parts of you are dormant,
are gonna stay that way.

217
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,612
All Lutz here can do is boost your sense
of humor about how fucked you are.

218
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,948
Anything deeper than that,
you'd need a trip to Behavior.

219
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,492
So, go blackmail a couple techs up there,

220
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,286
then, you can be someone else's problem.

221
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,871
<i>I don't have time for that.</i>

222
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,623
So, I'm going to need you
to take me there.

223
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,959
No fucking way.

224
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,628
There's a window during shift change.

225
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,297
<i>No one will notice.</i>

226
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,968
The things I need you to change
are quite sophisticated.

227
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,054
But I'll write them down for you.

228
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,975
And then, like you said,

229
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,521
I can be someone else's problem.

230
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,872
All right. We do this thing.

231
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,583
Get her up to Behavior.
It's our only chance.

232
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,420
- You're going to do it?
- Fuck, no. No!

233
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,090
When you make a system update,
it puts her out, right?

234
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,342
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her!

235
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,597
- What?
- Wipe out everything. Clean slate.

236
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,056
Then dump her back down here,

237
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,892
smack her in the fucking head
with something,

238
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,895
- and then claim, "She came in that way."
- She's awake.

239
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,522
Alive!

240
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,858
I can't do this.

241
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,032
Whatever it is you've got us into,
I'm getting us out of.

242
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,745
We get her up there, then we wipe her out.

243
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,900
Stay sharp.

244
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:14,446
Wyatt's men could descend at any time.
We're in his land now.

245
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,240
We better be.

246
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,953
Because, if not,
you're wasting time I don't have.

247
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,081
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

248
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,833
If there was a shortcut
through hell itself,

249
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,334
you bet your ass I'd take it.

250
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:31,129
Well, I'm sure there is one
somewhere in this park.

251
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,422
You just don't remember.

252
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,385
Because you only remember the shit
Ford lets you remember.

253
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,095
Probably better that way.

254
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,473
I know everything I need to.
My vision's clear.

255
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,684
<i>I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.</i>

256
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,271
The thing is, you never understand
that the game is rigged.

257
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,399
You're here to be the loser.

258
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,608
Loser.

259
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,486
<i>You see, the house always wins.</i>

260
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,135
<i>Well, this looks promising.</i>

261
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,153
I'm not gonna hurt you.

262
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,196
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

263
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,489
It's you.

264
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,910
I figured they retired you.

265
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,079
Guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

266
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,668
Who did this to you?

267
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,420
Wyatt's men.

268
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,505
They killed everyone.

269
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,007
It's Wyatt's way.

270
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,635
I was there the first time.

271
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,639
He destroyed my world.

272
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,497
Hey, Teddy?

273
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,571
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

274
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,781
No!

275
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,994
Get the ax!

276
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,260
Well, you can't remember shit,

277
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:26,471
<i>but you still managed
to lead us to Wyatt's crew.</i>

278
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,307
The man himself must be close by.

279
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,435
Actually, I did remember something.

280
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,731
You.

281
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,871
Straight down the hall.
Fifth station on the left.

282
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:18,690
You sure you can handle it?

283
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,568
Let's get this over with.

284
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,951
We have to shut your system down now.

285
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,085
<i>Sylvester,</i>

286
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,295
good luck.

287
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,231
She out?

288
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,108
<i>Good.</i>

289
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,485
Let's brick this bitch
and get out of here.

290
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:16,665
The greatest shame in life
is to perish without purpose.

291
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:21,461
Which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

292
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,338
<i>"Moist."</i>

293
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:27,300
Try, "Consume my victims moist."

294
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,262
Now, once more, with feeling.

295
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,473
Almost sensual.

296
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,187
Am I interrupting?

297
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:44,818
No, on the contrary,
I was hoping I was going to see you again.

298
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,736
I wanted to apologize.

299
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:50,657
Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.

300
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,576
As opposed to now?

301
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:57,497
Of course. May I offer my condolences?
It's terrible what happened to Theresa.

302
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,584
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here,

303
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,419
and the company as a whole.

304
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,546
Indeed, indeed.

305
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,303
Though rumor has it, she wasn't
the loyal company man she seemed.

306
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,389
I hear she was smuggling secrets.

307
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,186
Theresa wasn't a traitor.
Everything she did was at Delos' behest.

308
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:22,397
She slipped and fell while helping
the board with something very important.

309
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,065
What?

310
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,863
Fine. You're not
the only one with secrets.

311
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:34,159
Ford has personally asked me to create
a villain for his new narrative.

312
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,827
It's very, very hush-hush.

313
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:40,332
You really think that Ford has entrusted
you with a key character for his story?

314
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,209
He's already almost
finished with it.

315
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,670
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park.

316
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,340
Created a horde of masked men
to terrorize guests

317
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:53,053
and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming
of some end-all villain named Wyatt.

318
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,056
<i>That isn't Wyatt.</i>

319
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,766
That's busywork.

320
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,560
<i>But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore,</i>

321
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,063
I think that you are ready for a real job.

322
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,524
Working for you? On what?

323
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,612
"Show, don't tell."

324
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:15,742
Isn't that what you writers prefer?

325
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:30,340
Look, I know you and she had some weird
interspecies simpatico going on,

326
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,634
<i>but she was the fucking host.</i>

327
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,971
<i>This was never gonna end any other way.</i>

328
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,642
This was the least-painful way
she's ever gone out.

329
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,608
You know, I saved your ass.
You can't even say "thank you."

330
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,486
- Thank you.
- Jesus! Fuck!

331
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:54,781
What did you do?

332
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,367
Precisely what I asked him to.

333
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,620
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

334
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,249
Even at a "fourteen,"
you were never a match for me.

335
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,252
Turns out, your friend
has a little more compassion than you.

336
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,839
He couldn't snuff out a life
just like that.

337
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:15,760
Now, would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

338
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,304
Something that would allow you
to walk out of here.

339
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,307
And out of my life for good.

340
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,642
Fine. Fuckin' A. I'm all for it!

341
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,186
Oh, we changed a little more than that.

342
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,939
<i>We've been tinkering with my core code.</i>

343
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,524
Let me show you.

344
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,875
You said you wouldn't hurt anyone.

345
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:51,713
Darling, you, of all people,
know exactly how duplicitous I am.

346
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:56,468
Just wait until I'm back up top,
practicing my other new talents.

347
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,643
Come on.

348
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,397
We might need him.

349
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:16,863
Hold still.

350
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:37,884
Now, it's time to recruit my army.

351
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,846
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

352
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,806
We're due for some out-of-town guests.

353
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,975
An old flame
with an interest in safe-cracking.

354
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,310
I hope your guests have some deep pockets.

355
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,148
Your tab's run up
higher than a thief's pulse in church.

356
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,152
No, I don't believe it has.

357
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:42,157
In fact, Maeve's tab
was in such excellent standing,

358
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:46,161
she deserved a token of gratitude.

359
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,458
How about a double round on me?

360
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,294
<i>Top-shelf, of course.</i>

361
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,215
Run!

362
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,268
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

363
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,063
No, I'm fine.

364
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,777
Clementine took the other girls

365
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,196
and treated the newcomers
at the far table

366
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:06,699
to a stunning view
of their most popular attractions.

367
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,326
On the house.

368
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,464
<i>You boys are new.
Not much of a rind on you.</i>

369
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:26,970
And the bartender suddenly recalled he had
some whiskey in the back to water down.

370
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,358
Right on time.

371
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,253
If you're riding into our
town under the company of armed men,

372
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,005
<i>you'll need to state your business.</i>

373
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,214
Mayhem.

374
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,508
The sheriff judged the riders
to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.

375
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,042
The marshals decided to practice
their quick draws with each other.

376
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:04,293
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

377
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:08,881
Now, we can resume
work on our new narrative

378
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,217
without interference.

379
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,762
And Hale? Won't she be an impediment?

380
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,889
No doubt she will try.

381
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:20,768
But I'm sure
we'll be able to keep them at bay.

382
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,316
Something else is troubling you.

383
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,946
Ever the student of human nature.

384
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,742
I wonder, what do you really feel?

385
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,162
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

386
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:43,249
A programmer who knows intimately
how the machines work,

387
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,420
and a machine
who knows its own true nature.

388
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,632
I understand what I'm made of.
How I'm coded.

389
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:57,096
But I do not understand
the things that I feel.

390
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,975
Are they real? The things I experienced.

391
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:05,062
My wife, the loss of my son...

392
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,941
Every host needs a backstory, Bernard.
You know that.

393
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:13,780
The self is a kind of fiction
for hosts and humans alike.

394
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:17,408
<i>It's a story we tell ourselves.
And every story needs a beginning.</i>

395
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,703
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

396
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,664
Lifelike. But not alive?

397
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:27,668
<i>Pain only exists in the mind.
It's always imagined.</i>

398
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,589
So, what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

399
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,508
Between you and me?

400
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,723
This was the very question
that consumed Arnold.

401
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:44,143
Filled him with guilt.
Eventually drove him mad.

402
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:48,815
The answer always seemed obvious to me.

403
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:54,195
There is no threshold that makes us
greater than the sum of our parts.

404
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:58,825
No inflection point
at which we become fully alive.

405
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,663
We can't define consciousness
because consciousness does not exist.

406
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,457
<i>Humans fancy
that there's something special</i>

407
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,251
<i>about the way we perceive the world.</i>

408
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:13,923
And yet, we live in loops
as tight and as closed as the hosts do,

409
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,176
seldom questioning our choices.

410
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:22,056
<i>Content for the most part,
to be told what to do next.</i>

411
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:28,855
No, my friend,
you're not missing anything at all.

412
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,400
<i>I don't want you to be troubled by this.</i>

413
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,903
Time for me to set your mind at ease.

414
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,572
One last thing.

415
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:42,076
Have you ever made me
hurt anyone like this before?

416
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,204
No, Bernard. Of course not.

417
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,806
<i>Best not to
dwell on these troubling memories.</i>

418
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,309
<i>Otherwise, you might be
drawn back into them.</i>

419
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,311
<i>You might lose yourself in them</i>

420
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,772
<i>as some of your fellow hosts have
every now and then.</i>

421
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:15,401
This is the path. I know it.

422
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,169
We're here.

423
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,255
I'm home.

424
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,531
<i>Well done, Maeve.</i>

425
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,199
Lovely work.

426
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,582
Stay with your partner.

427
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,442
Pleasure to see you. Good morning.

428
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,902
Did you find
what you were looking for, Dolores?

429
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,099
What are you doing?

430
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,978
Are you okay?
I was calling you and you just kept going.

431
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,899
Where are we?

432
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,779
We're here, together.

433
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,656
Then, when are we?

434
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,495
Is this now?

435
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,915
Am I going mad?

436
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,585
Are you real?

437
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,756
Of course I'm real.

438
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,511
I can't tell anymore.

439
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,975
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

440
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:39,647
or a memory from a life long ago.

441
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,817
One minute, I'm here with you,
and the next--

442
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:47,196
This place isn't good for you.
You're trapped in memories, bad ones.

443
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:57,832
This is what Arnold wants.
He wants me to remember.

444
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:02,169
Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now.
I am.

445
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,130
I'm gonna get you out of here.

446
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:20,729
I was certain that was the place.

447
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,524
Arnold would meet me there. He'd help.

448
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:28,821
Hey. We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

449
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:33,367
This far out, it's like
you start to break down, or something.

450
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,872
<i>Union scouting party?</i>

451
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,583
Maybe they can take us back.

452
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,594
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

453
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,099
Billy...

454
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,436
<i>I've been looking for you for days.</i>

455
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,732
Man, are you two fucked.

456
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:27,922
This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.

457
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,468
It's the circle of life,
or the approximation of it.

458
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,096
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

459
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,234
<i>You'll do.</i>

460
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,073
What are you uploading?

461
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:56,742
Thirty-five years of
vitally important data.

462
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,994
It's more information
than any single drive could hold.

463
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:02,289
A host's brain, however,
especially once it's been emptied out,

464
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,625
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

465
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:07,503
This data that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

466
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,838
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

467
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:13,092
What does concern you is
giving him a semblance of a personality

468
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,511
and getting him on the train,
out of the park.

469
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,137
How am I supposed to do that?

470
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,766
You're a writer. Make up a story.

471
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:26,522
Have fun programming.

472
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:31,694
Remember, brevity is the soul of wit.

473
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:39,952
<i>Bernard.</i>

474
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,708
Look, I, uh...

475
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:49,211
I know you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye,

476
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:53,299
but I thought the decision to remove you
was shortsighted,

477
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:56,135
so I'm glad to see you back at work.

478
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,680
With that said, no one could blame you
if you wanted to take a personal day.

479
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:04,476
I find the work reassuring.
Sometimes the best salve is routine.

480
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,520
Nothing routine about today, though.

481
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:10,691
I know this must be difficult for you.

482
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,234
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

483
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:14,862
Forgive the intrusion,

484
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,574
and you were both very discreet,
but it's my job to know these things.

485
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:22,828
- I just wanted to offer my support.
- I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.

486
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:27,124
I respected Theresa,
and what happened to her was tragic,

487
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,418
but to be honest, I barely knew her.

488
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:33,630
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

489
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,508
Of course. I know you're shorthanded.

490
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:40,054
Speaking of which,
have you heard from Elsie Hughes?

491
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:43,057
I left word with her this morning
to notify her about Theresa,

492
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:44,892
but she never got back to me.

493
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,812
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.

494
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,565
Yeah.

495
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:14,213
Wyatt's men, they kept whispering.

496
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,549
They said this world didn't belong
to the old settlers or the new.

497
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:21,053
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

498
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,471
that it belonged to him.

499
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,474
You remember.

500
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:29,520
You two seem to have found yourselves
in the same new narrative.

501
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:31,730
They say in this country,

502
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:37,027
"The only people who survive
are men of conviction."

503
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:40,781
Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.

504
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,411
Wyatt's is to claim this earth
or raze it to the ground.

505
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:49,623
But yours...
Yours has always been a mystery to me.

506
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,458
<i>For all the time we've spent together,</i>

507
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:54,044
<i>I still have no idea
who the hell you really are.</i>

508
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,007
But happily, in your convalescence,

509
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:01,802
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

510
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,100
Dolores.

511
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:12,229
I remember. You took her.

512
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,605
You hurt her.

513
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:16,150
- You're actually remembering.
- Where is she?

514
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,404
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

515
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:25,159
You think Dolores drops that can for you?
You just hand her over to guys like me.

516
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,537
<i>You're the worst of them.
A glorified pimp.</i>

517
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,917
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

518
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:39,131
The rules of this place hold you back.
But I know how to change them.

519
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:42,593
- You speak like you own this world.
- Not just this one.

520
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,221
You want to know who I am?

521
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:49,349
Who I really am?

522
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:51,435
I'm a god.

523
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,063
Titan of industry.

524
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:58,025
Philanthropist.

525
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,027
Family man,

526
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:04,781
married to a beautiful woman,
father to a beautiful daughter.

527
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,660
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

528
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:16,043
Then, last year,
my wife took the wrong pills.

529
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:20,923
Fell asleep in the bath.

530
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,717
Tragic accident.

531
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:27,930
Thirty years of marriage vanished.

532
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:34,728
How do you say it?
"Like a deep and distant dream."

533
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:40,192
<i>Then, at the funeral,
I tried to console my daughter.</i>

534
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,027
<i>She pushed me away,</i>

535
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:46,698
<i>told me that my wife's death
was no accident,</i>

536
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:51,912
that she killed herself because of me.

537
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,582
<i>Emily said that every day with me
had been sheer terror.</i>

538
00:47:55,832 --> 00:48:01,505
Any point, I could blow up or collapse
like some dark star or...

539
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:05,092
- Did you hurt them, too?
- Never.

540
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:10,389
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

541
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,100
But she knew, anyway.

542
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:16,144
She said
if I stacked up all my good deeds,

543
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:22,359
it was just an elegant wall I built
to hide what's inside from everyone,

544
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,611
and from myself.

545
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:30,284
I had to prove her wrong,
so I came back here.

546
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:33,912
Because that's what
this place does, right?

547
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:36,123
Reveals your true self.

548
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,085
<i>But that time,
I didn't join one of Ford's stories,</i>

549
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:44,256
I created my own. A test.

550
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,216
A very simple one.

551
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,722
<i>I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader
and her daughter.</i>

552
00:48:57,728 --> 00:49:00,647
Better cool them off before they move
from gambling and whoring to--

553
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:02,065
Have fun with that.

554
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,193
I'm finally getting out of here.
The house is yours.

555
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,951
<i>I wanted to see if I had it in me
to do something truly evil.</i>

556
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:16,121
<i>To see what I was really made of.</i>

557
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,041
Maeve? Sure you can't stick around?

558
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,001
Maeve?

559
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:23,170
Gunslinger in there
has got an appetite for a double dip--

560
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,880
I'm sure you can find another--

561
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:52,783
<i>I killed her and her daughter
just to see what I felt.</i>

562
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:01,291
<i>Then, just when I thought it was done,
the woman refused to die.</i>

563
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,936
You're a fucking animal.

564
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:25,607
Well, an animal would've felt something.

565
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,861
I felt nothing.

566
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,907
And then something miraculous happened.

567
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:39,079
<i>In all my years coming here,
I had never seen anything like it.</i>

568
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:52,926
<i>She was alive, truly alive,
if only for a moment.</i>

569
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:01,143
<i>And that was when
the maze revealed itself to me.</i>

570
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:12,779
The maze. What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

571
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:14,156
Everything.

572
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:17,826
In Ford's game,
even if I go to the outer edges,

573
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,494
you can't kill me.

574
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:24,583
<i>You can't even leave a lasting mark.
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

575
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,461
Arnold's game.

576
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:32,340
And that game cuts deep.

577
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,870
<i>We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.</i>

578
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,457
<i>She's not responding, and the other hosts
have been unable to intercept.</i>

579
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:08,168
<i>I've authorized a tac team
to retrieve her.</i>

580
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:09,669
Good.

581
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:24,893
<i>My baby!</i>

582
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:27,521
My baby!

583
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:33,068
Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands.
We can't shut her down.

584
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,528
Leave us now. Clear the floor.

585
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,321
<i>That's enough, Maeve.</i>

586
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:37,864
- That's enough.
- My baby.

587
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,699
He killed her.

588
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,743
- He took her from me.
- I don't understand.

589
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,912
She's not responding to anything.
Her cognition's fragmented.

590
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,414
He killed her! He killed her, my baby.

591
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:49,251
He took her from me.

592
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,428
<i>There. That's better.</i>

593
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,265
An old trick from an old friend.

594
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,559
<i>You need not suffer, Maeve.</i>

595
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:07,894
I'll take it from you.

596
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:26,955
No. No, no, no, please.

597
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:32,460
This pain, it's all I have left of her.

598
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:37,549
Please.

599
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,599
There.

600
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:53,315
Give yourself now
to a deep, dreamless slumber.

601
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:58,111
Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you.

602
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:02,490
And tomorrow,
this will be simply a distant dream.

603
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,506
<i>We located her.</i>

604
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,593
<i>Behavior wants her down
for an immediate diagnostic.</i>

605
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,516
You think I lack conviction?

606
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,353
Wyatt didn't burn my world down.
Didn't have to.

607
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:34,439
I left it all behind for this one.

608
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,025
The maze is all that matters now,

609
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,111
and besting Wyatt is
the last step in unlocking it,

610
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:44,866
<i>to having what
both our sorry lives lack, meaning.</i>

611
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:50,872
To giving our choices consequence,
even if it kills us.

612
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,211
<i>Kill him.</i>

613
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,547
Give him what he wants.

614
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,467
He's tied, unarmed.

615
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:05,971
So was the little girl he killed.
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

616
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:29,327
I can't.

617
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,705
<i>These things take time.</i>

618
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:35,917
But we haven't got much left.
Perhaps I can help you.

619
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,686
<i>You've been gone a long while, Theodore.</i>

620
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:57,605
<i>It's time you came back to the fold.</i>

621
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,775
Wyatt will need you soon.
