1
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,153
<i>You got any stories, friend?</i>

2
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,701
Yeah, I suppose I do.

3
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,499
You want to know
the saddest thing I ever saw?

4
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,836
When I was a boy,
my brother and I wanted a dog.

5
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,424
So, our father took in an old greyhound.

6
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,594
- Never seen a greyhound, have you?
- No.

7
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,972
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

8
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,436
A greyhound is a racing dog.

9
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,647
It spends its life running in circles,

10
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,609
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

11
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,821
One day, we took it to the park.

12
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,783
Now, Dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

13
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,952
but we couldn't resist.

14
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,120
So, my brother took off the leash.

15
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:46,584
And in that instant,
the dog spotted a cat.

16
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,963
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

17
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,258
He ran.

18
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,225
Never saw a thing as beautiful
as that old dog running.

19
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:07,522
<i>Until at last, he finally caught it.</i>

20
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,570
And to the horror of everyone,
he killed that little cat.

21
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,822
Tore it to pieces.

22
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,868
Then he just sat there, confused.

23
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:29,460
That dog had spent its whole life
trying to catch that thing.

24
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,716
Now it had no idea what to do.

25
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:41,848
That is one humdinger of a story, partner.

26
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:46,060
Shall we drink
to the lady with the white shoes?

27
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,011
<i>Find me.</i>

28
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:22,889
<i>Show me how.</i>

29
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,354
There she is. Pariah.

30
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:34,400
City of outcasts, delinquents,
thieves, whores, and murderers.

31
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,693
Once we cross the gates,

32
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:40,031
you will reap the full benefits
of El Lazo's gratitude for my safe return.

33
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,541
Are you all right?

34
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,460
Of course.

35
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,421
Did I do something wrong?

36
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,841
Just earlier, I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

37
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,886
Must have been the wind.

38
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,029
Come on.

39
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,408
<i>This way.</i>

40
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,261
<i>The farther up we get
from Sweetwater,</i>

41
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:47,015
the more grandiose, the bigger
the narratives become.

42
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,685
It's beautiful in its own way.

43
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,104
For once, I agree.

44
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,565
Some of the park feels like
it was designed by committee,

45
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,902
market-tested,
but everything out here is more raw.

46
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,905
<i>But it doesn't come cheap.</i>

47
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,199
<i>Rumor is, they are hemorrhaging cash.</i>

48
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,535
<i>We're considering buying them out.</i>

49
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,164
Supposedly, this place was all started
by a partnership,

50
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:15,209
and then right before the park opened,
one of the partners killed himself.

51
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,545
<i>It sent the park into a free fall.</i>

52
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,882
I mean, I don't know any of the details.
I don't even know his name.

53
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,009
You must have a team of lawyers
looking at this place.

54
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,887
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

55
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,639
<i>He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.</i>

56
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,933
<i>Well,
whoever designed this place,</i>

57
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,062
you get the feeling
they don't think very much of people.

58
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,316
Who are they?

59
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,278
They call themselves
the Army of New Virginia.

60
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,906
<i>Everyone else calls them the Confederados.</i>

61
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,658
My father told me about them.

62
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:51,412
Ex-Confederate soldiers
that refused to surrender after the war.

63
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,498
<i>Now they work as mercenaries
below the border.</i>

64
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,999
<i>They are the key to this game.</i>

65
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,918
What game?

66
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,586
The biggest game there is.

67
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,004
War.

68
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,672
Supposedly, it's at the far reaches
of the park.

69
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,468
Now, I've never made it that far,
but this could be our chance.

70
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,598
<i>I've known plenty of
truly fucked-up individuals in my time.</i>

71
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,810
Few that'd hold a candle to you, sure.
But this one?

72
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,522
<i>Theodore Flood? He was Wyatt's friend.</i>

73
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,819
You know, his former associations
are exactly why we need him.

74
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,489
He's gonna lead me
straight to the big bad wolf.

75
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,865
I wouldn't count on that.

76
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,536
Aw, shit.

77
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:46,384
Didn't take you
for the charitable type.

78
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,886
You should have left him
on that tree to die.

79
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,349
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

80
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,226
<i>If the bitch exists,</i>

81
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,395
I'd like to kick her in the teeth
about now.

82
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:00,982
Don't be so glib.
You'll hurt my feelings.

83
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,402
As another old friend of mine
likes to say,

84
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:09,073
"There's a path for everyone.
Your path leads you back to me."

85
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,910
Do you ever wonder why I've kept you
with me this whole journey?

86
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,581
Maybe you like the pleasure of my company,
you sadistic fuck.

87
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,418
Maybe I do.

88
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:25,214
There's not a man in the world
who would take the tone with me you do.

89
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,050
In a past life, perhaps.

90
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:33,055
Teddy here is not looking long
for this world.

91
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:35,433
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

92
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,102
But ain't no way
he's gonna make it that far.

93
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,188
He's lost too much blood.

94
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,564
<i>Are you lost?</i>

95
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,573
Our friend here
is a little worse for the wear.

96
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,285
Any water nearby, son?

97
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,205
There's a creek
on the other side of the canyon.

98
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,415
Fetch us some, would you?

99
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,919
Now, hurry.

100
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,214
Our friend here needs some
if he's going to make it.

101
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:07,798
Get.

102
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,637
Eh.

103
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,764
Too small.

104
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,099
What does that mean?

105
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,644
And what are you
sending him for water for?

106
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,313
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

107
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,491
<i>A shame, really.</i>

108
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,620
I always enjoy
our time together, Lawrence.

109
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,121
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

110
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,417
It means I was wrong.

111
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,588
The path that brought you here,
it wasn't for me.

112
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,007
It was for him.

113
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,023
Sorry, Lawrence.
Guess I'll see you on the other side.

114
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,169
Uh-oh.

115
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,546
Not looking good for you.

116
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,797
Closing.

117
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,632
Forget it. I win.

118
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,050
I always win!

119
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,178
Not fair.

120
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:39,473
All you had was a smashed cheekbone
and an ear.

121
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,310
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

122
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,313
You had to, what,
plug and patch a couple bullet holes?

123
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,023
And a knife wound.

124
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,401
<i>It was a contained incision.</i>

125
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,403
Almost like they were
looking for something.

126
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,659
Are you fucking kidding me?

127
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,872
You really think this little fuck puppet's
coming to get you? Huh?

128
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,749
It got off the table and ran.

129
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,917
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

130
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,045
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep.

131
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,589
You know, that's the thing
about forgetting.

132
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,258
You think you remembered, but you didn't.

133
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,095
- Break time.
<i>- Yeah!</i>

134
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,098
I've got a ham sandwich

135
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,268
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

136
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,771
awaiting instruction.

137
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,524
<i>Yeah.</i>

138
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,479
Welcome back.

139
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,817
Looks like a couple gallons of Lawrence
swirling around in you did you good.

140
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,112
Ready to get back on the road?

141
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,324
Merciful thing
would be to put a bullet in me.

142
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,160
Whoever said I was merciful?

143
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,413
And it's not my fault you're suffering.

144
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,582
You used to be beautiful.

145
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,503
When this place started,
I opened one of you up once.

146
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,631
Million little perfect pieces.

147
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,925
And then they changed you.

148
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,929
Made you this sad, real mess.

149
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,849
Flesh and bone, just like us.

150
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,352
They said it would improve
the park experience.

151
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,021
But you know why they really did it?

152
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,023
It was cheaper.

153
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,777
Your humanity is cost-effective.

154
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,529
So was your suffering.

155
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,615
Whatever it is you want from me, mister,

156
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,869
I ain't gonna be worth a damn
to you like this.

157
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,912
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

158
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,041
After your misadventure,
Wyatt killed a settler family.

159
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,877
Made off with their daughter.

160
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,713
Girl, I think you know,

161
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,173
name of Dolores.

162
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,888
They have Dolores?

163
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,515
There it is.

164
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,603
The magic word. Come on.

165
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,904
Hey! Much obliged there, son.

166
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,117
Don't worry about him.

167
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,620
Someone'll be along for him shortly.

168
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,688
Mommy!

169
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,108
Are you all right?

170
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,120
When I ran from home,
I told myself it was the only way.

171
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:37,962
Lately, I've wondered if in every moment
there aren't many paths.

172
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,755
Choices.

173
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,799
Hanging in the air like ghosts.

174
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:46,095
And if you could just see them,
you could change your whole life.

175
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,140
Is that what you want?
You want to change your life?

176
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,850
Doesn't everybody want that?

177
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,521
I guess they do.

178
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,315
Maybe that's why they come here.

179
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,486
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

180
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,822
There's no rules or restrictions.

181
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,701
You can change the story of your life.
You can become someone else.

182
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,371
No one will judge you.
No one in the real world will even know.

183
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,206
The only thing
holding you back is yourself.

184
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,374
What do you mean by that?

185
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,503
You said,
"No one in the real world will know."

186
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,299
I thought you weren't
supposed to notice things like that.

187
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,010
Why wouldn't I?

188
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:30,848
Recently, it seems like the whole world

189
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,810
is calling to me
in a way it hasn't before.

190
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,494
Billy, where the hell
have you been? Come on.

191
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,707
El Lazo's agreed to have
an audience with y'all tomorrow.

192
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,501
In the meantime,
there's a brothel I recommend.

193
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,253
<i>Ooh. They have a contortionist.</i>

194
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,173
Oh, I don't think Dolores
would find that very interesting.

195
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,009
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

196
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,427
She's a goddamn doll!

197
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,596
Can you not say that around her?

198
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:14,516
I swear, I feel like she understands.

199
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,561
Of course you do.

200
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,354
<i>May you rest
in a deep and dreamless slumber.</i>

201
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:09,988
<i>Hello, Dolores.</i>

202
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,452
Do you know where you are?

203
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,790
- I'm in a dream.
<i>- Yes, Dolores.</i>

204
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,959
You're in my dream.

205
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:26,797
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

206
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,467
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

207
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,094
They don't mean anything.

208
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,180
No. Dreams mean everything.

209
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,768
They are the stories
we tell ourselves of what could be,

210
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,311
who we could become.

211
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,859
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

212
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:51,363
Imagining yourself breaking out
of your modest little loop?

213
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,158
<i>Taking on a bigger role?</i>

214
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,288
Well, I suppose I can't begrudge you that.

215
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:07,296
My father told me to be satisfied
with my lot in life.

216
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:11,008
That the world owed me nothing.

217
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:17,473
And so, I made my own world.

218
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,686
<i>Tell me, Dolores,</i>

219
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,024
do you remember the man I used to be?

220
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,362
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,573
I'm forgetful, sometimes.

222
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,742
Hardly your fault.

223
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,495
But I'm sure you remember him.

224
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:41,997
Arnold.

225
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,875
<i>The person who created you.</i>

226
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,168
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,337
I don't think I recall
anyone by that name.

228
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,005
<i>And yet, you can.</i>

229
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:56,011
Somewhere, under all those updates,
he is still there.

230
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,722
Perfectly preserved.

231
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,392
Your mind is a walled garden.

232
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,064
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

233
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,405
<i>Have you been hearing voices?
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?</i>

234
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,741
No.

235
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:20,994
You're...

236
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,081
You're hurting me.

237
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,290
Analysis.

238
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,254
When was your last contact with Arnold?

239
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:36,844
Last contact,
34 years, 42 days, seven hours ago.

240
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,263
<i>Yes, Dolores.</i>

241
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,308
The day Arnold died.

242
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,440
And you have no records
of any contact with him since?

243
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,442
No.

244
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,487
What was the last thing he said to you?

245
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,116
He told me I was going to help him.

246
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,285
Help him do what?

247
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,830
To destroy this place.

248
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,209
But you didn't, did you?

249
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,798
You've been content in your little loop.

250
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,342
<i>For the most part.</i>

251
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,137
I wonder...

252
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,308
If you did take on
that bigger role for yourself,

253
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:29,730
would you have been
the hero or the villain?

254
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,657
That's enough, Dolores.

255
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,622
I'm sorry for bothering you,

256
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,836
but there's no one else left
who was there.

257
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,049
No one who understands, as we understand.

258
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:05,265
Are we very old friends?

259
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,309
<i>No.</i>

260
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,229
I wouldn't say "friends," Dolores.

261
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,693
I wouldn't say that at all.

262
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,555
He doesn't know.

263
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,350
I didn't tell him anything.

264
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,857
That's it.

265
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,027
Come on, little one.

266
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,907
<i>Come on.</i>

267
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,682
Oh.

268
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,017
What the fuck?

269
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,268
Grab it!

270
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,899
Ah! God!

271
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,485
Damn it, you little shit!

272
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,241
Jesus! Tell me you're not this stupid.

273
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,953
You stole a bird
and a fucking behavior tablet?

274
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,206
I wasn't stealing. I was borrowing.

275
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,543
I haven't got the code right yet,
but with practice...

276
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,462
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

277
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,964
Is that your ace plan?

278
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,384
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

279
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,763
You're not a fucking ornithologist.

280
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,806
And you're sure as hell not a coder.

281
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,933
You are a butcher.

282
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,144
<i>That is all you will ever be.</i>

283
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,064
<i>So, unless you wanna score yourself
a one-way ticket out of here</i>

284
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,776
for misappropriating corporate property...

285
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,445
You better destroy that fucking shit.

286
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,698
Now, come on, we got another body.

287
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,162
<i>What?</i>

288
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,789
It's her.

289
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,374
Again.

290
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,001
Jesus.

291
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,921
How the hell did you get this job
if you're scared shitless of these things?

292
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,009
Personality testing should have
weeded you out in the embryo.

293
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,096
Now, come on,
let's get this thing back in rotation.

294
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,355
Yesterday
you seemed out of sorts.

295
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,024
Feeling better this morning?

296
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,194
I had troubled dreams.

297
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,822
But I feel more myself now.

298
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,615
Guys, come on.

299
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,326
El Lazo awaits.

300
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,382
I present to you El Lazo.

301
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,389
<i>You're a hard man to find.</i>

302
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,141
Most wanted men are.

303
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,477
We saved your man, Slim, here,
from quite a predicament.

304
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,813
In recompense,

305
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,983
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

306
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,651
It's only fair.

307
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,611
There's no such thing as "fair" here.

308
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,073
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

309
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,241
she's crooked.

310
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,952
Bitch's scales are always tipped.

311
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,328
If you don't see how,

312
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,289
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

313
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,374
Still, by way of gratitude,

314
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:04,171
I can supply you a night
with some very amenable women.

315
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,006
I've fucked enough whores.

316
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,718
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

317
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,933
How about I sweeten it
by killing you quickly?

318
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,278
There's something you're seeking,
isn't there?

319
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,865
I know what that feels like.
I'm seeking something, too.

320
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:37,454
If you let us, I know we can help you.

321
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,335
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

322
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,590
Then again, the Confederados are missing
a few bullets in their barrels, too.

323
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,552
You folks just might get along.

324
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:58,975
A Union convoy is transporting a shipment
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

325
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,770
The Confederados would like
to divest them of said shipment,

326
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,147
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

327
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,692
A trio of travelers
such as yourselves, however...

328
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,071
You want us to help the Confederados
steal from the Union?

329
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,489
They're just going to use that nitro

330
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,241
<i>to slaughter your people
below the border.</i>

331
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:18,036
Personal grudges hold no sway
where profit is concerned.

332
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,205
<i>Oh, we understand.</i>

333
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,540
We're businessmen, too.

334
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,252
<i>Very well, then.</i>

335
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:29,214
But blondie here, she's gonna need
a change of clothes for the occasion.

336
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:31,675
Mmm.

337
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,306
My, my, look who's packing.

338
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,349
I don't aim to use this.

339
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,979
Those men are Union soldiers,
like my father was.

340
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,982
I know. We won't hurt them.
We're gonna stick to the plan.

341
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,026
We'll take the nitro and go.

342
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,490
All right.

343
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,702
It's showtime.

344
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,344
Halt!

345
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,766
Howdy.

346
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,227
My associates and I
are here to relieve you of your ride.

347
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,357
Someone's been telling you boys tales.
Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

348
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,233
The story I heard is one bullet from us,

349
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,152
and that "nothing"
blows you all to kingdom come.

350
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,031
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

351
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,034
We're sworn to protect
the people of this young republic

352
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,370
from reckless, halfwits like you.

353
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,790
Call me halfwit again.

354
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,291
<i>Please.</i>

355
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,919
Do as he says. We don't want to hurt you.

356
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:32,170
Yeah, I'd listen to her.

357
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,588
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

358
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:35,673
Hand them over.

359
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,217
Come on.

360
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,678
Hey. Come on down,
give me your guns. Everybody lives.

361
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,516
Nice and easy.

362
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,310
Right over here.
A little further, please.

363
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,604
Much obliged.

364
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,980
Here you go.

365
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:07,997
That's for lying.

366
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,207
Stop!

367
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,796
And that was for "halfwit."

368
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,469
And this...

369
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,025
No!

370
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:42,824
Stop! Please!

371
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,349
Whoo!

372
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,186
That's the spirit!

373
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,481
I knew you would get into this place.

374
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,773
Yes!

375
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:21,529
<i>Yup.</i>

376
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,282
<i>Not bad for a day's work.</i>

377
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,826
<i>Vámonos.</i>

378
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,331
We told them everyone would live.

379
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,383
Guys, looks like Slim didn't make it.

380
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,440
Whoa.

381
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,111
They put up a fight.

382
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,823
We made them pay for it, though.

383
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,746
Price of doing business. Slim knew that.

384
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,765
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

385
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,477
But you came through.

386
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:42,986
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters
back to the dirt holes they crawled from.

387
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,821
Let's get it down to the station.

388
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,489
No time to waste.

389
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:47,991
If I may, Captain,

390
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,994
your men are weary,
with a long road ahead.

391
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,205
You have secured a great victory
for your cause today.

392
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,333
Perhaps an evening of celebration
is in order.

393
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,877
Anything you desire.

394
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,173
<i>What do you say, Captain?</i>

395
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,758
There's another train in the morning.

396
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,640
You will be a true asset to our ranks.

397
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,402
All right, Bart.
Let's try this again.

398
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,074
God damn it, man.

399
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,372
You're still miscalibrating
by four centimeters to the right.

400
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,249
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

401
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,501
I'm gonna have to reassign you
to a narrative

402
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:45,048
where your talents
will go tragically unappreciated.

403
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,226
Hey, that's the host
that tried to kill me.

404
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,313
- Where are you taking that?
<i>- Livestock.</i>

405
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,190
And then the incinerator.

406
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,864
Fuck this.

407
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:25,630
<i>Fuck.</i>

408
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,007
Isn't she from Behavior?

409
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,467
You think they found something?

410
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,178
- All right. Be cool, dickhead.
- Okay.

411
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,638
No one's looking at us.

412
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,641
Hi.

413
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,436
You're Destin, right?

414
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,480
That's correct.

415
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,317
I almost didn't recognize you
with your pants on. Here.

416
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,202
What the fuck?

417
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,625
There's a common misconception
that the hosts don't log sexual encounters

418
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,086
when they're underground for reprocessing.

419
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:07,380
But, like I said, misconception.

420
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,590
Oh, fuck.

421
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:10,967
<i>I need something.</i>

422
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,303
QA sent a body down here,
the woodcutter from Sector 14.

423
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,555
- I want to see it.
<i>- No.</i>

424
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,849
I can't.

425
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,809
I need this job.

426
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,813
<i>Look, Destin,</i>

427
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,732
in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here,

428
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,151
and your friends are going to wonder
what this was all about.

429
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,447
Now, your answer can either be,
"I'm helping Behavior track a problem,"

430
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:35,867
or, "I'm a creepy necro-perv."

431
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,744
Up to you.

432
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,837
Five minutes,
then it's going in the incinerator.

433
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,633
Huh. You took a little more time than that
for your examination, didn't you?

434
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,639
All right, big guy.

435
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,018
What were you doing up there?

436
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,861
What the fuck?

437
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:04,330
You've been
holding out on me, Maurice.

438
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,386
Oh, shit.

439
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,681
We've got a big problem.

440
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,067
Turns out our big, dumb friend
had some hidden depths.

441
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,988
That is a laser-based satellite uplink.

442
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,158
This was in the body of the host?

443
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:45,121
Mmm-hmm. You were right.
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

444
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:49,041
<i>Our friend wasn't drawing stars.
He was drawing a target.</i>

445
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,379
Someone has been using our host
to smuggle data out of the park.

446
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:43,763
Now this... This I could get used to.

447
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,478
You're not going to indulge?

448
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:58,611
My flesh has tasted a greater pleasure
than any offered here.

449
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,780
War.

450
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,074
It's that good, huh?

451
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,244
Another round? On the house.

452
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,582
There's a place in glory
for a brown man who knows his rank.

453
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,675
<i>You're two able-bodied men
of strong stock.</i>

454
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:25,846
The road to glory could use more warriors
in its fight for our divine provenance.

455
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,015
That is just what we were thinking.

456
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,102
Come here, come here.

457
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,189
I know you want to play the war game,

458
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,566
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

459
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,151
If you don't like 'em,
once we get to the front,

460
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,029
you can just kill them
and join the revolutionaries.

461
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:45,366
No, Logan. Enough is enough.
I'm not doing this.

462
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:49,662
You actually let loose for once,
you shoot an unarmed man,

463
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:53,374
and now you feel bad
because you can't call yourself the hero.

464
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,501
Don't you get it yet?

465
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,421
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

466
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,424
It's just a giant circle jerk.

467
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,593
I think that philosophy says way more
about you than it does about the world.

468
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,727
And you, you see the world so clearly?

469
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,856
You probably think you're on this trip
because you're some kind of contender,

470
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,315
some threat to me?

471
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:26,240
I picked you precisely because
you will never be a threat to anyone.

472
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,618
My sister probably picked you
for the same reason.

473
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,372
I earned my place. Nobody handed it to me.

474
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:37,626
Right. A lifetime of working hard,
following the rules,

475
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,714
and you finally reach the pinnacle
of your career trajectory...

476
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,674
Executive Vice President.

477
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,217
Upper middle management.

478
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:50,473
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

479
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,016
EVP.

480
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,311
You walked into my office
in that cheap black suit of yours,

481
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,648
and you shook my hand
and you thanked me for the opportunity.

482
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,487
That was the best day of your life.

483
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:22,880
Right, buddy.

484
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,509
That's what I thought.

485
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,236
What does it mean?

486
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,907
The maze.

487
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,161
You must follow the maze.

488
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,746
What's wrong with me?

489
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,791
Perhaps, you are unraveling.

490
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,923
Right here.

491
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,345
<i>Easy pumping that nitro into him.</i>

492
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:39,808
<i>Fill the empties with tequila
and seal them up.</i>

493
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,318
Your work for the revolution
is not quite done yet, my friend.

494
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:01,497
Careful.

495
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:04,458
Slim always had a bad temper.

496
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,804
William, we have to go now.

497
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,722
Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

498
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:21,475
He was never going to give the nitro
to the Confederados. We have to run!

499
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,645
Of course we do.

500
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,563
That's how this place works, right?

501
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,817
<i>They create an urgency
and a sense of danger,</i>

502
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:36,490
<i>so they can strip us down
to something raw, animalistic, primal.</i>

503
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,036
It's a sick game,
and I don't want to be a part of it.

504
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:43,580
This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

505
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,545
But together,
I know we can find a way out.

506
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:51,547
How can you be sure?

507
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:58,887
There's a voice inside me,
telling me what I have to do.

508
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,890
And it's telling me I need you.

509
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,494
Shit.

510
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,386
They have Logan.

511
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:44,516
Help me.

512
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,352
Help me.

513
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:50,814
No.

514
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:56,904
No more pretending.

515
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:12,419
I thought you had no appetite
for war, boy.

516
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,465
This is a declaration of war.

517
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,720
El Lazo set us up.

518
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,305
We can find him for you.

519
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:26,600
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

520
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:31,688
Dolores, run!

521
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:46,912
Dolores?

522
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:02,177
How did you do that?

523
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:07,141
You said people come here
to change the story of their lives.

524
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:13,730
I imagined a story
where I didn't have to be the damsel.

525
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,612
Now that train is our only chance
of making it out of here alive.

526
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,147
Motherfuckers.

527
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:12,998
You pull that trigger,
we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

528
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,417
So, why don't you loosen your grip a mite?

529
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:24,468
It's okay.

530
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,262
I don't trust him.

531
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,973
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

532
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,768
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

533
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,653
Now that we're all friends,
you can call me Lawrence.

534
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,698
Now, why don't we settle in.
It's a long ride to the front.

535
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,045
<i>You want a sip of this swill?</i>

536
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,885
<i>Don't worry, it ain't nitro.</i>

537
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,520
I'm coming.

538
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,668
The girls are a little worn out,
but I can rouse one.

539
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,378
You boys want some company?

540
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,005
No. Just whiskey.

541
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,849
Lawrence's donation must be running low.

542
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,602
But we're short on time.

543
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,604
You need to buck up, Teddy.

544
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:04,359
<i>I told you, no company.</i>

545
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:11,533
Thought I might join you, anyway,
as I never like to drink alone.

546
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:16,913
Well, isn't this a rare honor?

547
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,709
Teddy, you know who this is?

548
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,630
Can't say that I do.

549
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,716
Everything good
that has ever happened in your life,

550
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:32,304
and everything rotten,
this is the man you have to thank.

551
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,434
How am I doing, Robert?

552
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:40,646
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

553
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,106
And what is that, exactly?

554
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,234
<i>We're looking for a man named Wyatt.</i>

555
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:50,072
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater,
took his daughter.

556
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,785
That last part doesn't sound familiar.

557
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,372
Figured your stories
could use a little embellishment.

558
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:03,251
You know, I always felt this place
was missing a real villain,

559
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:06,421
hence my humble contribution.

560
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:12,636
I admit, I lack the imagination
to even conceive of someone like you.

561
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:16,848
The urgency, however,
doesn't quite fit the character.

562
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,976
It betrays a certain anxiety.

563
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:27,442
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,
that's something new.

564
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:31,279
Is he just another stooge for the tourists
to mount on their wall at home,

565
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,282
or have you finally made
a worthy adversary?

566
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:40,455
Someone to stop me
from finding the center of the maze.

567
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,793
And what is it
you're hoping to find there?

568
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:49,965
You know why you exist, Teddy?

569
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,803
The world out there,
the one you'll never see,

570
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,389
is one of plenty.

571
00:50:57,848 --> 00:51:00,976
A fat, soft teat
people cling to their entire life.

572
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,396
Every need taken care of,

573
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:05,814
except one.

574
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,316
Purpose.

575
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:10,652
Meaning.

576
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,321
So, they come here.

577
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:16,074
They can be a little scared,
a little thrilled,

578
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,326
enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

579
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:21,538
and then they take a fucking picture
and they go back home.

580
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:26,209
But I think there's a deeper meaning

581
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,503
hiding under all that.

582
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:33,216
Something that the person
who created it wanted to express.

583
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,138
Something true.

584
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,851
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

585
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,311
you could quite simply ask.

586
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,022
I'd need a shovel.

587
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:50,233
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

588
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:52,402
Almost took this place with him.

589
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:56,198
Almost, but not quite. Thanks to me.

590
00:51:56,865 --> 00:52:00,035
Well, maybe he left something behind.

591
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:07,083
I wonder what I would find
if I opened you up.

592
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,888
Even at death's door,
you're still a loyal pet.

593
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,980
Is that why you came here, Robert?

594
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:32,067
To try to talk me out of it?

595
00:52:32,484 --> 00:52:34,402
On the contrary.

596
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:39,407
Far be it from me to get in the way
of a voyage of self-discovery.

597
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:52,212
Mr. Flood.

598
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:57,801
We must look back and smile
at perils past, mustn't we?

599
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:13,900
We should get back on the road.
Time's a-wasting.

600
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:08,556
<i>Hello, Felix.</i>

601
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:14,604
It's time you and I had a chat.
