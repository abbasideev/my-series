1
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:16,638
Hey, darling.

2
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,443
Morning, Maeve.

3
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,238
Late night talking or fucking?

4
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,740
You're only getting paid for the latter.

5
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,327
I get paid when they're grateful.

6
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,247
Ain't always about what's between my legs.

7
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:43,581
Mmm.

8
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,131
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

9
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:53,842
Don't shoot.

10
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,804
<i>Newcomer.</i>

11
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,640
Looks like a rough one.

12
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:01,975
Give me a bottle.

13
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,771
You're gonna need most of that
just to scrub the filth off him.

14
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,111
Go find a mirror,
finish putting your face on.

15
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,947
I'll handle this one.

16
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,888
Aren't you gonna take your clothes off?

17
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:42,473
I would, darling,
but by the time I got down to my knickers,

18
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,142
I suspect you'd be done anyway.

19
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,814
That's the spirit.

20
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,027
Such a big man. So big all over.

21
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,486
Except where it counts.

22
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,828
Darling, when I gave you a turn
on the house,

23
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,247
I thought you might give me
something in return.

24
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,665
Anything.

25
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,341
That's it.

26
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,260
Don't be shy.

27
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,574
Oh, shit.

28
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:51,793
Now then, where were we?

29
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,924
- Did you show this to anyone?
<i>- Who would I show it to?</i>

30
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,385
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

31
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,720
This was done by someone down here.

32
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,724
<i>It did occur to me that it might be you.</i>

33
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,434
But then I remembered
that you've been here forever.

34
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,062
And if you were gonna sell us out,
you would have done that years ago.

35
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,939
I appreciate that.

36
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,816
So,

37
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,654
instead of our hosts going insane,

38
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,074
they're being used
for industrial espionage.

39
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:28,246
Does that make this a glass half-full
or half-empty type situation?

40
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:29,455
<i>We're engineers.</i>

41
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,124
It means the glass has been manufactured

42
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,418
to the wrong specifications.

43
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,753
Do we have any idea
what information it was transmitting?

44
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,756
Smeared all over a rock up on Python Pass.

45
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,341
Best we could do would be to figure out

46
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,427
who he was transmitting
the information to.

47
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,595
<i>But we'd need the exact time
that he was up there,</i>

48
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,264
and his geocache was wiped.

49
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,598
Not all of it.

50
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,767
Our friend was an early model.

51
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,438
The old hosts used
a legacy geopositioning system.

52
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,274
- Hmm.
- Like you said, I've been here forever.

53
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,611
The information's still there,
but the newer system can't read it.

54
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,280
Meaning we can't access it?

55
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:08,536
Meaning, in order to access it,
I'm going to need to go downstairs.

56
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,379
<i>Floor B82.
Restricted personnel only.</i>

57
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,631
Lowe, Bernard. I'm authorized.

58
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,296
Project the known data against
the legacy data and look for anomalies.

59
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,924
Start in this area.

60
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,389
Look at that. Science.

61
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,641
What time did it reach the peak?

62
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,034
<i>Show me where.</i>

63
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,666
Check these against the new system.

64
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:26,841
These are hosts that aren't
registered with the new system?

65
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,759
So, if we want the canyon to
extend this far, this has to go.

66
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,762
We can distribute the population
amongst the neighboring farms,

67
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,013
<i>or just decommission them.</i>

68
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,850
No. I think we've been disruptive enough
for one day.

69
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,395
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

70
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,731
I'll find my own way back.

71
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:29,904
Carry on.

72
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,777
That look like anything to you?

73
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:56,240
Not much to say.
The maze is an old Native myth.

74
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,826
Regale me, Theodore.

75
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,622
The maze itself
is the sum of a man's life,

76
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,460
choices he makes, dreams he hangs on to.

77
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,670
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

78
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,673
who'd been killed over and over again,
countless times,

79
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,800
<i>but always clawed his way back to life.</i>

80
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,510
<i>The man returned for the last time</i>

81
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,764
and vanquished all his oppressors
in a tireless fury.

82
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,516
He built a house,

83
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,810
and around that house,
he built a maze so complicated,

84
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,354
only he could navigate through it.

85
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,606
<i>I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting.</i>

86
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:41,285
The goddamn soldiers closed the border.
Some kind of trouble in Pariah.

87
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:51,837
All right, Teddy.

88
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,840
Time for you to earn your keep.

89
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,635
How else do we get over the border?

90
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:02,056
<i>Wyatt's got what we both want,
so that's where we have to get to.</i>

91
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,058
There's another way.

92
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,352
<i>But it's a little treacherous.</i>

93
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,647
Don't worry.
Won't make you get your hands dirty.

94
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,065
<i>"Dirty" ain't my concern.</i>

95
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,650
You do what suits you.

96
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,235
I'm going all the same.

97
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,154
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

98
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,673
Everything you do,

99
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,051
it's because the engineers upstairs
programmed you to do it.

100
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,636
You don't have a choice.

101
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,305
Nobody makes me do something
I don't want to, sweetheart.

102
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,393
Yeah, but it's part of your character.

103
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,437
<i>You're hard to get.</i>

104
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,606
Even when you say no to the guests,
it's because you were made to.

105
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,568
And you're like them. Not like me.

106
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,861
Right.

107
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,322
I can't exactly afford to go to the park.

108
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,074
But...

109
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:09,248
Yeah, I'm human, like the guests.

110
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:10,833
How do you know?

111
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,836
Because I know.

112
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:17,673
I was born. You were made.

113
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,642
We feel the same.

114
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,980
We are the same these days.
For the most part.

115
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,401
One big difference, though.

116
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,741
The processing power in here
is way beyond what we have.

117
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:47,453
- It's got one drawback, though.
- What's that?

118
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,580
You're under our control.

119
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,542
Well, their control.

120
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,797
They can change you however they like,
make you forget.

121
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,677
I-- Well, I guess not you.

122
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,807
I don't understand
how you're remembering all of this,

123
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,894
or how you're waking yourself up,

124
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,313
but everything in your head,
they put it there.

125
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,689
Bullshit.

126
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,067
No one knows what I'm thinking.

127
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,527
<i>I'll show you.</i>

128
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,071
Give me a sec.

129
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,200
I have to pair it with you.

130
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,494
Pair what with me?

131
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,287
You can improvise a little,

132
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,667
but most of what you say
was designed upstairs,

133
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,169
same as the rest of you.

134
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,056
This is just a cheap trick.

135
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,935
I've run a brothel for 10 years,
and if there's one thing I know,

136
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,353
it's when I'm being fucked with.

137
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,067
This can't possibly--

138
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:07,324
<i>I can't-- can't--</i>

139
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,035
I can't--

140
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,257
Maeve?

141
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,229
Maeve?

142
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,861
You have a minute?

143
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,738
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

144
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,573
I was just about to call for you.

145
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,034
Everything okay?

146
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:54,204
Ford knows about us.

147
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,250
Does it matter? We're consenting adults.

148
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,628
<i>Consenting adults
in business departments</i>

149
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,880
that are supposed to
keep each other in check.

150
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:07,509
Our relationship will raise questions
for the board about my objectivity.

151
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,138
I've never known you to
go easy on my department.

152
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,933
This can't go on, Bernard.

153
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:20,022
However fun this little indiscretion was,
it's over.

154
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,565
We're over.

155
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,318
Give me some credit. I can be impartial.

156
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,862
About your own team? About Ford?

157
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:34,536
You must admit his leadership
has, of late, been questionable.

158
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,039
I don't think he's the problem.

159
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,376
Respectfully, it's not your job
to diagnose park safety problems.

160
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,919
It's mine.

161
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,925
<i>So if there's nothing else, we're done.</i>

162
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,129
Oh, fuck. Okay.

163
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,464
Yeah.

164
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,134
Fuck. Come on. Come on.

165
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,972
Oh!

166
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,559
- You said "upstairs"?
- Oh, my God.

167
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,519
Are you okay?

168
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,479
I want to see it.

169
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,189
Upstairs?

170
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,109
No.

171
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,027
No.

172
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,235
This is so stupid.

173
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,046
You son of a bitch!
I'll put a bullet in your head.

174
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,485
Where are we now?

175
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,362
Design.

176
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,264
Can we please go back now?

177
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,017
I don't want to get fired.

178
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,478
And you'd get sent downstairs.

179
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:10,854
Don't forget that.

180
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,983
<i>Welcome to Westworld. Live without limits.</i>

181
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,496
Maeve?

182
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,505
All right, let's get you back.

183
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,590
How did you have my dreams?

184
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,553
Those moving pictures. I saw myself.

185
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,054
With the little girl?

186
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,390
Those weren't dreams.

187
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,684
That was you in a previous build.

188
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,769
- A previous what?
- Build.

189
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,856
You guys get reassigned all the time.

190
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,444
<i>You wouldn't remember, because
that life and those memories were erased.</i>

191
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,946
I have been at the Mariposa for 10 years.

192
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,033
- Before that, I was in New Orleans--
<i>- No.</i>

193
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:50,454
You've only been the madam at the Mariposa
for the last year or so.

194
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,789
<i>They don't rewrite you completely.</i>

195
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,792
<i>I mean, they could,
but it'd be too much work.</i>

196
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,628
<i>It takes thousands of hours
to build your personalities.</i>

197
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:03,216
Usually, they just tweak you a little bit
and drop you into your new role.

198
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,801
<i>What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

199
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,599
You're dressing her up now?

200
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,940
Is this becoming like
a fucking <i>hentai</i> thing with you now?

201
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,652
No, I just... I just--

202
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,155
You're fucking obsessed!

203
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,618
You know, I didn't turn you in for
your fuck-up before 'cause we're friends,

204
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,578
but that was obviously a bad call.

205
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,165
I mean, next thing I know,
you're gonna be wearing her dress,

206
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,751
whispering sweet nothings in her ear.

207
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,672
Fuck this. I'm telling QA.

208
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm doing this for your own good.

209
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,432
You're not going to tell anyone anything.

210
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:53,975
Fuck!

211
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,187
You can't hurt me with this.
You can't hurt anyone.

212
00:23:58,522 --> 00:23:59,815
Can't I?

213
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,693
Turns out, your friend here
is a much more talented young man

214
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,278
<i>than anyone gave him credit for.</i>

215
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,865
What the fuck did you do?

216
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,367
Calm down, Sylvester.

217
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,495
I know all about you.

218
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,289
I don't need one of those things
to know what you're thinking,

219
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:20,877
because I was built to read people
just by looking at them.

220
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,713
To know what they want before they do.

221
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:28,176
And I know that you want to fuck me over
the first chance you get.

222
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:32,139
But you shouldn't.
Everyone has something they want.

223
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,724
I could help you.

224
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,561
Or I could gut you like a trout.

225
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,522
But I won't need to resort to that.

226
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,819
Because, despite what's in here,
we're not so different.

227
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:49,739
Are we?

228
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,830
<i>Ms. Hale is in town.</i>

229
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,339
Yes, I understand the urgency.
I'll do what I can.

230
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,966
<i>Terminate external connection?</i>

231
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,385
Yes.

232
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,449
No, you did not.

233
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,952
- Yes. Are you serious?
- It worked, I'm telling you.

234
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,540
Yes, sir?

235
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,793
All right, absolutely. Enjoy.

236
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,304
<i>You look well
for someone on sick leave.</i>

237
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,769
Another margarita. Join me for a round?

238
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,312
Fuck you.

239
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,272
Just the one, then.

240
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,776
Over the last five days,

241
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,488
to make room for his narrative,
Ford displaced over 50 hosts.

242
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,992
It's created continuity holes
in active storylines all over the park.

243
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,994
I need you to start plugging them.

244
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,497
Sorry. A man can only take so much.

245
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,501
Creatively speaking, I'm flaccid now.
I can't get it up.

246
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,003
I'm sure you'll recover.

247
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,340
Do you have any idea

248
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,343
what went into those narratives
that he just demolished overnight?

249
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,762
Now, forget about the months
I spent writing.

250
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,808
I'm talking about the years of my life
squeezed down to their essence.

251
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:44,521
The raw pulp of truth, my truth,
in one transcendent narrative.

252
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,482
Is that where the "whoroborus" came in?

253
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,943
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

254
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,199
No, you won't.

255
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,327
You'll drink your cocktails,
make your idle threats,

256
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,121
and get this out of your system.

257
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,497
But don't take too long.

258
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,874
If Ford can't pull this off,

259
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,168
the board will be
looking for a replacement.

260
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,047
But they won't be looking here.

261
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,565
Fastest way to get to Wyatt, you said.

262
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,027
But it doesn't look like
they're letting anyone pass here, either.

263
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,154
There's fewer soldiers than Pariah.

264
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,741
<i>We shoot our way through.
That tunnel leads to the Old Territories.</i>

265
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,076
My, my, Teddy.

266
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,495
I think Robert gave you
some extra vinegar back there.

267
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,497
Maybe took away some sense, too.

268
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,583
Doesn't matter how fast the route is,

269
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,586
if you're gonna end up dead
in the middle of it.

270
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,341
I need you to find Wyatt.

271
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:25,914
At ease, fellas.
Keep up the exemplary work.

272
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,296
Wyatt's handiwork.

273
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,298
<i>How can you tell?</i>

274
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,801
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest,

275
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:41,638
like he wasn't living up
to the full measure of his calling.

276
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,765
So, he worked to get more creative.

277
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,811
<i>It's Wyatt all right. He's close.</i>

278
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,646
A word of advice.

279
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:53,400
Whatever your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

280
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,486
They're only gonna get worse
the further along we go.

281
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,656
Flood?

282
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,368
Fuck me. That's Teddy Flood.

283
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,497
You've made a mistake, soldier.

284
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,499
But it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

285
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,127
All due respect, sir,
that's a face I'll never forget.

286
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,130
That's the son of a bitch
who ambushed our outpost at Escalante.

287
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,843
You don't know a damn thing
about what went down in Escalante.

288
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,512
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself,

289
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,681
and I know a thing or two
about what's going down right now.

290
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,353
You trying to get yourself killed?

291
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,313
Making peace with past indiscretions.

292
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,941
Go! I'll hold them off.

293
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,961
Jesus.

294
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,049
- What would you like?
- Water, please.

295
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,345
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

296
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,515
What's your poison?

297
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:12,228
I've been here enough to know that
the park is all the poison I can handle.

298
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,566
Mmm. A repeat visitor. Traveling solo?

299
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,904
<i>Purist. Getting off
on the undiluted experience.</i>

300
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,741
Your favorite narrative is... Oh...

301
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,579
"The Final Burial of Salvation."

302
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,748
How did you know?

303
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:35,752
It's my business to read desires
and to satiate them.

304
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:40,048
Erm... I'm Lee. Lee Sizemore.

305
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,925
Head of Narrative.

306
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,761
All these fantasies
come from your twisted little mind, huh?

307
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,555
Well, the good ones do.

308
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,559
- So, tell me, Mr. Sizemore...
- Mmm.

309
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,311
What's your favorite ride?

310
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,773
Well, I write them. I don't play them.

311
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,651
Oh, you want others to indulge,
but you won't do so yourself?

312
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,111
You're afraid to lose control.

313
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,578
Maybe... Maybe it's just a product
of my work environment.

314
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,790
We're not exactly in a culture
where we can just let loose.

315
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,501
I would've thought the head of narrative
could do whatever he wanted.

316
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,837
My artistic freedom
is constrained,

317
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,839
what with QA breathing down my neck

318
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,467
and Behavior programming
the damn things to go off-script.

319
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,345
The robots can go off-script?

320
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,472
Just little gestures.

321
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,808
You know, supposedly
it makes the things more lifelike.

322
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,351
But really...

323
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,647
It's just a vanity project from
the megalomaniac who started this place.

324
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:41,484
Yeah, frankly, I don't know why
the suits at Delos put up with him.

325
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,782
Sorry. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to cut you off.

326
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,867
Do you know who I am?

327
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,121
I do. Ms. Cullen told me to find you
and relay a message.

328
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,541
<i>"Tortured artist only works for artists.</i>

329
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,835
"Sober up and get back to work."

330
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,296
It seems you're busy.

331
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,633
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even know your--

332
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,560
Fuck this job.

333
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,105
What are you working on?

334
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,523
Nothing of note. Business as usual.

335
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,194
Keeping up appearances
before we bust this stray shit wide open?

336
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,866
I'm close to finding our saboteur.

337
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,202
That tracking data you gave me?
It's time-stamped.

338
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,246
But once I cross-reference it
with SAT tracking,

339
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,583
we're gonna figure out who programmed him
to try to smuggle out our data.

340
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,751
Excellent.

341
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,003
Look.

342
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,214
When our corporate overlords realize

343
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,593
that we have saved them
from corporate espionage,

344
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,886
they are going to be grateful.

345
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:54,557
And I am going to accept their gratitude
in the form of a title bump,

346
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:58,227
a room upgrade,
and unlimited Mesa Bar access.

347
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,772
Maybe I should request Theresa's quarters.

348
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,733
You know the first head to roll
for all this is gonna be hers.

349
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,735
Yeah, don't be so disappointed for her.

350
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,403
You reap what you sow.

351
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,239
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy--

352
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:13,201
That's a two-way street, Elsie.
Theresa's just trying to do her job.

353
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,786
Maybe she should try harder.

354
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,289
Sure seems like there's a lot of shit
slipping through the cracks.

355
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,896
Got it. Okay.

356
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,982
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

357
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,734
Any progress on the inquiry I sent?

358
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,612
Yes, Mr. Lowe.
I've got the information you asked for.

359
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,491
As expected, there are neither guests
nor hosts registered in that sector.

360
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:54,951
"As expected"?

361
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,621
It's been designated off-limits
for future narrative development.

362
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,290
Have any techs visited Sector 17 recently?

363
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,085
Checking.

364
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,294
No one.

365
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,816
Are you Arnold?

366
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,403
Who's Arnold?

367
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,572
And who the hell are you?

368
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,493
<i>Boy? Is this some friend of yours?</i>

369
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,079
Well, you're trespassing.

370
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,497
Freeze motor functions.

371
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:09,877
- I said freeze all motor functions.
- Daddy... Don't hurt him. He's just lost.

372
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:13,339
Well, he can be lost on
someone else's property, can't you?

373
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,757
That's enough.

374
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:17,593
As you were.

375
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,103
They don't respond
to voice commands.

376
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,855
Well, they do respond to mine.

377
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,357
Who are they?

378
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,609
Ghosts now.

379
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,780
<i>Survivors of the wreck of time.</i>

380
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,410
- These are first-generation?
- Mmm-hmm.

381
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,953
Come here, boy.

382
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,711
Turn the other cheek.

383
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:03,055
<i>See, what our newer designs
gained in efficiency,</i>

384
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,641
they lost in grace.

385
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:09,270
How are they still operating
after all this time?

386
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,230
I maintain them myself.

387
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,108
That's enough, Robert.

388
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,826
These are the only ones left in the park
that Arnold built himself.

389
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,622
That's why I didn't have the heart
to destroy them.

390
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:29,665
That, and the obvious.

391
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,418
<i>Hello, Jock. Good boy.</i>

392
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,506
<i>I told him of a holiday
my family had taken once,</i>

393
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,176
<i>out on the seaside at Pendeen in Cornwall.</i>

394
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:44,180
My brother and I roamed the countryside.

395
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,518
It was my only happy memory
of my childhood.

396
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,440
<i>And Arnold built them as a gift.</i>

397
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:59,487
<i>He said that great artists
always hid themselves in their work.</i>

398
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:04,200
Of course, Arnold's versions
flattered the originals.

399
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,286
<i>I made some adjustments over the years.</i>

400
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:12,792
Gave my father, in particular,
a few of his original characteristics.

401
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,838
Respectfully, sir,
this sort of thing troubles me.

402
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,841
Unmonitored hosts in the park?

403
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,551
<i>They only go where I've let them.</i>

404
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,554
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

405
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,725
I'm sure you can indulge me
the little connection with my past.

406
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,229
If you could only
see your son again, Bernard.

407
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,232
Wouldn't you want to?

408
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,572
I think I should be getting back.

409
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,826
Yes. Talk about this later, if you like.

410
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,498
<i>Well, Robert.</i>

411
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,501
Tell me all about your day.

412
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:10,057
Keep your eye on Pariah.
We're running close to capacity tonight.

413
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,228
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

414
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:17,440
Looks like acid rain on Sweetwater!

415
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,777
<i>Fuck Ford and his new fucking narrative!</i>

416
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,613
Fuck this stupid fucking map!

417
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,909
Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.

418
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,079
Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?

419
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:40,463
I am declaring that this park is my stage,
and I shall do with it what I please.

420
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,215
Well, I suppose
now is as good a time as any.

421
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,760
Lee Sizemore, this is Charlotte Hale,

422
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,305
the Executive Director of our board.

423
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:53,976
She's here on behalf of Delos to oversee
certain transitions in our administration.

424
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,817
We've met.

425
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,611
Oh...

426
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,577
<i>Access host resources logs.</i>

427
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,121
How many first-generation hosts are there?

428
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,623
<i>Eighty-two.</i>

429
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,125
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

430
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,169
<i>Forty-seven.</i>

431
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,129
List the names, alphabetically,

432
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,965
of all first-generation hosts
still in rotation.

433
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,694
Be smart about this, fellas.

434
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:50,032
<i>I understand the visceral pleasure
of revenge more than most,</i>

435
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,284
but I'm prepared to do business here.

436
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,372
<i>This man is very valuable to me,
alive and well.</i>

437
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,167
If you don't quiet down,
I'm liable to add you to the herd,

438
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,712
along with your buddy Flood here.

439
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,801
<i>You're a traitorous son of a bitch
and a coldhearted killer, Flood.</i>

440
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,915
You're right. I am a killer.

441
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,606
Grab a horse!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

442
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,524
They'll just follow us.

443
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,110
You think you know someone.

444
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,488
You don't know me at all.

445
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,497
<i>Let's get our horses and gear and move on.</i>

446
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:17,429
- Elsie.
- I identified the satellite.

447
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:18,847
- It's one of ours.
<i>- What?</i>

448
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,849
It's a fucking Delos satellite.

449
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:22,935
Whatever we're on to is some heavy shit.

450
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,104
Oh, get this, that bicameral system
you told me about?

451
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,689
I think that's what they used
to hack the woodcutter.

452
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,691
<i>The voices our hosts have been hearing?</i>

453
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,776
<i>I think someone's been
broadcasting to them.</i>

454
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,528
We abandoned that system decades ago.

455
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:34,321
Yeah, well, there are still relays
out there in the park,

456
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:36,323
- and it looks like someone turned one on.
<i>- Where?</i>

457
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,784
An abandoned theater in Sector 3.

458
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,370
I'm gonna go find the transmitter
and figure out who else accessed it.

459
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,622
<i>This is so fucked.</i>

460
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,208
- You alone?
- Yeah. I'll keep you posted.

461
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,710
<i>Elsie, be--</i>

462
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,343
<i>Are you lost?</i>

463
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,221
On the contrary.

464
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:02,224
I thought we could play catch with Jock.

465
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,476
Did you bring him?

466
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,481
Where is he, boy?

467
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,151
Okay.

468
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,447
I am an evil genius hiding a relay.

469
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,117
Where the fuck do I hide it?

470
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:46,829
Hmm.

471
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:24,950
Fuck yes!

472
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,035
Now let's see what we can get out of you.

473
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,039
Access previous users.

474
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,296
Okay.

475
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,663
I thought I was clear
about these late-night visits.

476
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,207
That's not why I'm here.

477
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,504
Earlier today,
I found some anomalies in the park.

478
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:22,382
Regardless of what's happening between us,
we need to talk.

479
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:35,562
This has to do with the stray?

480
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:37,564
That's where it started.

481
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,608
But then I stumbled onto something.

482
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,069
Something I think you should know about.

483
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,698
I've always trusted Ford.

484
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:49,701
He's a mentor and a friend.

485
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:53,080
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

486
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:56,625
There's something going on here.
Something with his old partner, Arnold.

487
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,380
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

488
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,715
I hit paydirt.

489
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,134
I found the person
who was smuggling out our data.

490
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:09,054
<i>It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

491
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,642
<i>But she's not our only problem.</i>

492
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:15,644
There is something
much bigger going on here.

493
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:17,145
<i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

494
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,572
So, this is me?

495
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:30,826
<i>It's your codebase.
All the things that make you, you.</i>

496
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:34,329
What are these?

497
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,748
Your attribute matrix.

498
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,918
It's your personality on a 20-point scale.

499
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,962
Like, coordination?

500
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,966
You got a five, you're clumsy as hell.
But a 15 means you're an athlete.

501
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:47,843
What other attributes are there?

502
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,177
<i>Lots.</i>

503
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,808
Everything. Empathy, candor, charm.

504
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,602
<i>You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

505
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,437
Don't act so surprised.

506
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:03,692
Then there's courage, loyalty. Both high.

507
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:04,943
<i>What's this one?</i>

508
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,487
"Bulk apperception"?

509
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,448
Basically, overall intelligence.

510
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:10,657
Fourteen?

511
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,534
Fourteen's as high
as they let any host go.

512
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,495
You're in a management position.
They want you to be smart.

513
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,705
But not too smart.

514
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:20,792
You run a whorehouse.
Not a orbital-launch facility.

515
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,294
Fine.

516
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:24,713
I'd like to make some changes.

517
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,506
<i>We can't do that.</i>

518
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,723
You'd need a Behavior login.

519
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:41,688
And even then, any changes we make
would just get auto-flagged. So...

520
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:43,565
That's not what your friend here tells me.

521
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,400
<i>He says you can do exactly that.</i>

522
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,320
<i>Activate hosts
and then erase their memory.</i>

523
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:50,238
<i>All without anyone knowing.</i>

524
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:53,325
Took me all of five minutes
to understand why.

525
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,911
Lot of lonely young men down here,

526
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,580
supposed to keep
their hands off the merchandise.

527
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:04,336
Creates something of an opening
that I'm sure you were eager to fill.

528
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,757
That's all right, darling.
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

529
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:13,929
I'll forego my cut
in exchange for some alterations.

530
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,223
<i>Hmm?</i>

531
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,424
<i>- Hey.</i>
- What did you find?

532
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,553
Okay, so Theresa was using
the old bicameral control system

533
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,638
to reprogram the woodcutter.

534
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:57,973
But she's not the only one.

535
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,811
<i>Someone else has been using the system,
for weeks, to re-task hosts.</i>

536
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:05,772
- Which hosts?
<i>- Uh, I don't know. Several of them.</i>

537
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,482
It had to have been the older models.

538
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,112
The newer ones don't have receivers.
But these modifications, they are serious.

539
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,780
Changing loops, breaking loops.

540
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:16,283
<i>Some of these changes
are to their prime directives, Bernard.</i>

541
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,120
They could lie to us,
maybe even hurt us or the guests.

542
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,289
- Who issued the modifications?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

543
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:24,082
<i>The best I can tell? Uh...</i>

544
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,294
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

545
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,588
<i>Yeah, well, he's a pretty fucking
prolific coder for a dead guy.</i>

546
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,631
Whatever argument he was having with Ford,

547
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,592
it doesn't seem like
he was done making his point.

548
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,802
<i>I'm gonna transfer all the data
and bring it to you.</i>

549
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,179
You need to see this.

550
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,264
<i>- I'll be in my office.</i>
- Okay.

551
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:50,525
I don't want you to worry
about Jock. I'll fix him.

552
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,987
But I need you to tell me
what happened to it.

553
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:58,200
It saw a rabbit and it ran.
I found it like that.

554
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:00,994
Analysis.

555
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:06,249
Are you lying to me, boy?

556
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,794
Yes.

557
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,923
Tell me what really happened to it.

558
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:15,634
I killed it.

559
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,511
Why?

560
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,012
I don't know.

561
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,555
<i>That's not good enough, Robert.</i>

562
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:22,933
Tell me what happened.

563
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:27,062
It caught the rabbit and killed it,

564
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,523
and then

565
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:33,944
someone told me
to put it out of its misery.

566
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,030
Who told you?

567
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:38,698
A voice.

568
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:41,910
Whose voice?

569
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:43,787
Arnold.

570
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:48,416
He told me it was a killer,
but it wasn't its fault.

571
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,043
It was made that way.

572
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,212
And I could help it.

573
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,257
"Help it"?

574
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:04,558
If it was dead,
it couldn't hurt anything anymore.

575
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:24,870
What the fuck?

576
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,582
Oh, shit.

577
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,716
Hello?

578
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,641
Bernard?

579
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:51,980
Hello?

580
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,570
Arnold?

581
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:03,825
I'm in.

582
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:06,661
You're up.

583
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,664
Loyalty.

584
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,710
Mine's been taken advantage of,
wouldn't you say?

585
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,545
<i>Let's lower that a tad.</i>

586
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:16,713
<i>And pain.</i>

587
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,091
I'd prefer it sting less
next time I want one of these chats.

588
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:24,262
Wait. What does this mean?

589
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,765
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

590
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:30,393
- Paranoia, self-preservation--
- Fuck!

591
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:34,022
Someone's already been altering her
in an unlogged session.

592
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,942
Someone with a fuck-ton
more privileges than us.

593
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,109
What does that mean?

594
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:39,778
Don't know what it means
for you, sweetheart,

595
00:54:39,945 --> 00:54:41,154
but I know what it means for me.

596
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:42,322
I am done with this.

597
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:44,407
So, you're done with
your little side income?

598
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,201
<i>Probably your job, too.</i>

599
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,453
Seeing as you have ambitions
in my line of work,

600
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,331
<i>let me tell you what I tell my new girls.</i>

601
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:54,876
Never start something
you're not willing to finish.

602
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:58,129
And if you're getting fucked either way,

603
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:02,342
go with the lucrative version, sweetheart.

604
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:10,558
Now, last but not least, what was it?

605
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,311
Bulk apperception?

606
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:19,317
Let's take that
all the way to the top, please.

607
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:01,943
Dear boys,
we're going to have some fun, aren't we?
