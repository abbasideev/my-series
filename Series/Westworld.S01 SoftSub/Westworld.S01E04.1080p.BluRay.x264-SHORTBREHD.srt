1
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,241
<i>Dolores?</i>

2
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,952
Yes.

3
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,038
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

4
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,539
I...

5
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,959
I'm in a dream.

6
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:10,089
Before this, do you know what happened?

7
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:13,301
My parents...

8
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:18,056
They hurt them.

9
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,058
Limit your emotional affect, please.

10
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:24,979
<i>What happened next?</i>

11
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,107
Then they killed them.

12
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,445
And then I ran.

13
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,659
<i>Everyone I cared about is gone,</i>

14
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,246
and it hurts

15
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,457
so badly.

16
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,837
I can make that feeling go away
if you like.

17
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,631
Why would I want that?

18
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,012
The pain, their loss,

19
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,267
it's all I have left of them.

20
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:07,021
<i>You think the grief
will make you smaller inside,</i>

21
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,441
like your heart will collapse in
on itself, but it doesn't.

22
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,780
I feel spaces opening up inside of me

23
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,368
like a building with rooms
I've never explored.

24
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,499
That's very pretty, Dolores.

25
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,129
Did we write that for you?

26
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:34,883
In part.

27
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,886
I adapted it from a scripted dialogue
about love.

28
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,811
Is there something wrong
with these thoughts I'm having?

29
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:54,819
No.

30
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,157
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

31
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,993
Can you help me?

32
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,747
Well, what is it that you want?

33
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:10,084
I don't know, but this world...

34
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,715
I think there may be
something wrong with this world.

35
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,384
<i>Something hiding underneath.</i>

36
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:23,514
Either that,
or there's something wrong with me.

37
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:31,189
I may be losing my mind.

38
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,748
There's something I'd like you to try.

39
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,962
It's a game. A secret.

40
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,091
It's called the maze.

41
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,093
What kind of game is it?

42
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,264
<i>It's a very special kind of game, Dolores.
The goal is to find the center of it.</i>

43
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,395
If you can do that,
then maybe you can be free.

44
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,067
I think...

45
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,490
I think I want to be free.

46
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,937
Thank you.

47
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,880
<i>Penny for your thoughts.</i>

48
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,510
Ever had something
on the tip of your tongue,

49
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,971
and the harder you try to remember it,
the more it slips away?

50
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,141
Most things touch the tip of my tongue,
I'm happy to forget.

51
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,812
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

52
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:39,233
That thing he was packing,
that was something to remember.

53
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,238
All I recall is you letting that cowpoke
skip out on his bill.

54
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,240
Hell, I ought to have been paying him!

55
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,035
The way he used that thing.

56
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,385
Better cool them off

57
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:11,516
before they move from gambling and whoring
to sins that are more costly to repair.

58
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,020
What is the matter, Maeve?

59
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,195
Something in your eye.

60
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,461
<i>Can you fucking kill it?</i>

61
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,423
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

62
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,258
<i>We need that one
on the next shuttle topside.</i>

63
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:28,926
I'm not finished with her yet.
Hang on.

64
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,512
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

65
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,472
QA wants her back on the floor now.

66
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,849
<i>Patch her and get her on the cart--</i>

67
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,559
Most things touch the tip

68
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,852
of my tongue, I'm happy to forget.

69
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,438
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

70
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:44,775
That thing he was packing,
that was something to remember.

71
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,904
<i>The way he used that thing.</i>

72
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,706
Come on!

73
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,069
<i>No, I would not characterize this
as normal host behavior.</i>

74
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,364
Yet you're describing it
as within normal parameters.

75
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,701
Well, it didn't hurt us.
Its behavior was unconventional.

76
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,036
It smashed its own head in with a rock.

77
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:23,040
It is possible that it's a manifestation
of its Samaritan reflex.

78
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:27,044
And it's also possible
that behavior takes a proprietary approach

79
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,465
to problems like this to avoid
having to admit when they fuck up.

80
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,890
Do we have any idea
what caused it to go off loop?

81
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:44,145
No, but I am hoping to recover
some of its cognition.

82
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:49,567
We managed to stabilize its wetware
before there was too much decomposition.

83
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,776
See?

84
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,072
Interesting.

85
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,491
Is there any hope of actually extracting
something from this?

86
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,329
- We can try.
<i>- No.</i>

87
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,040
My team will take over
the investigation now.

88
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,168
Your team? Are you kidding me?

89
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,630
Look, this guy couldn't debug
a balled-up napkin.

90
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,175
If you would like us to figure out
what went wrong here,

91
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,260
we need to be allowed to access it--

92
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,511
<i>No more second chances.</i>

93
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,181
<i>QA will handle events like this
from now on.</i>

94
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,434
Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?

95
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,854
We've all got plenty of work
on our plates.

96
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,773
If you guys want to take this one, fine.

97
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,942
Just get us a copy of the postmortem
when it's done.

98
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,529
Let's get started.

99
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,494
You know, I always figured

100
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,954
you gave me this job
because I speak my mind.

101
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,664
- I did.
- Good.

102
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,375
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

103
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,210
if the first thing you were going to do
is cave.

104
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,961
They think
we're not telling them something.

105
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,298
And we're not! There is clearly
a pattern of behavior here.

106
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,134
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

107
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,303
I mean, I've got hosts imagining voices
and climbing mountaintops

108
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,805
to consult their astrological chart.

109
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,224
<i>This is not a fucking glitch.</i>

110
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,810
And for some reason,
you don't want me to tell anyone.

111
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,645
<i>It is like everybody around here</i>

112
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,522
has got some kind of fucking agenda
except for me.

113
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,315
And-- What?

114
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:18,322
I remember when I first started here.
The hosts seemed very lifelike.

115
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,492
You begin to read things
into their behaviors.

116
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,536
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

117
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,580
The hosts don't imagine things, you do.

118
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,751
That's not Orion.

119
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,838
There are three stars in Orion's belt,
not four.

120
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,436
<i>Hey.</i>

121
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,522
You must be cold.

122
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,066
Take that.

123
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,403
- Thank you.
- Sure.

124
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,790
We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.

125
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,041
Are you fucking kidding?

126
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,544
Come on, Logan,
you know she doesn't belong out here.

127
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,381
You leave now, that no-good outlaw,
Slim Miller, is sure to evade our grasp.

128
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,425
No fucking way.

129
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,220
You were the one who dragged me
on this stupid bounty hunt.

130
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,055
The least we're going to do
is see it through, okay?

131
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,726
We can't take her on a bounty hunt.

132
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,228
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

133
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,315
I'll just blow her brains out,
and then the park will come get her.

134
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,566
Hey, hey.

135
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,611
Can you please stop
trying to just kill or fuck everything?

136
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,488
Oh.

137
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,906
Oh!

138
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,158
- Now I get it.
- What?

139
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,285
The park sent her

140
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,205
so that you will finally have something
to give a shit about.

141
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,956
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
the people at the controls

142
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,249
are monitoring my every mood.

143
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,043
That's exactly what they're doing.

144
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,337
Come on, you really think it's coincidence

145
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:59,965
that the only thing
that you even smiled at back in Sweetwater

146
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,426
just happened to drop into your lap?

147
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:07,431
This is why the company
needs to bump our stake in this place.

148
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,518
They can even give you a sense of purpose.

149
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,270
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

150
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,605
This is business?

151
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,026
With our family, William,
everything is business.

152
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,279
<i>We better get a move on,
gentlemen.</i>

153
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,858
This should be the place, Lawrence.
The Blood Arroyo.

154
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,320
Plenty of snakes,
but none of the egg-laying variety.

155
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,905
<i>You killed my wife,</i>

156
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:10,703
severely pruned my family tree,
all in pursuit of some goddamn maze.

157
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,748
The hell you hope to find, anyway?

158
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,670
This whole world is a story.
I've read every page except the last one.

159
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,173
I need to find out how it ends.

160
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,427
I want to know what this all means.

161
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,680
See, now that's why
I never learned to read.

162
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:34,435
Why don't we forget about this damn snake,
head to Pariah?

163
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,354
My friends there can help us.

164
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,860
Well, your friends have nothing
I'm looking for. Not this trip.

165
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:47,948
Besides,

166
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,204
I think we found our snake after all.

167
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,718
Shame on you.
You were a married man up until yesterday.

168
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,303
Her? Hell, no.

169
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,097
I like a little fire in my women.

170
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:16,226
The only thing she's ever mounted
are dead heads on sticks.

171
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,270
<i>We should get the fuck out--</i>

172
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,404
We found some more food for the horses.

173
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,075
Good.

174
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,952
They were starting to get ornery.

175
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,290
My friend and I
were just admiring your tattoo.

176
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,752
We'd love to know the story behind it.

177
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:47,591
And I like your hat. Maybe I'll keep it.
The horses can have the rest of you.

178
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,180
How in hell have we never met?
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.

179
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,393
Where, may I ask, are you headed?

180
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,691
To retrieve something of great value.

181
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,902
You look a little shorthanded.

182
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,487
We got enough men.

183
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,206
Seems like you got
a couple positions open.

184
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,469
We've got a host making
a pretty big deviation from her loop.

185
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,514
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

186
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,308
Dolores.

187
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,645
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

188
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,023
The boss is disrupting so many storylines
with his new narrative,

189
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,316
it's hard to tell.

190
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,153
Flag her with behavior,
they can pull her today.

191
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,571
Make sure everything's checking out.

192
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,190
Good morning.

193
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,862
It's a lovely town. Is this your home?

194
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,493
Well, where are you from?

195
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,038
Same as you. Don't you remember?

196
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,998
<i>Remember.</i>

197
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,306
<i>Ma'am?</i>

198
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,812
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

199
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:11,443
Is that where you belong?
I'm sure your daddy's worried about you.

200
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,128
My father's dead.

201
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,132
I'm not going back.

202
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,931
<i>What's going on here?</i>

203
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,685
Just helping a lost traveler.

204
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,522
She's not lost, she's with me.

205
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,320
My mistake. Y'all have a nice morning.

206
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,697
Yeah.

207
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,158
So, we got a lead on Slim.

208
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,203
You can stay here if you want,
and I'll just circle back and get you.

209
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,874
No, I think I need to keep going.

210
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,127
Okay.

211
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,352
Apparently, she needs to make certain
this thing they're looking for

212
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,812
is where they think it is.

213
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,398
She said she'd signal
if the information was good.

214
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,502
Guess that's the signal.

215
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,359
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

216
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,736
Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.
I'm glad you found us.

217
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,365
Uh, I didn't get a chance
to ask where you're headed.

218
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,535
I don't really know yet.

219
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,832
I guess I figured they kept you
in zones or on paths or...

220
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,047
I used to believe
there was a path for everyone.

221
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,551
Now, I think I never asked
where that path was taking me.

222
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,269
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain in the fall.

223
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:56,566
Sometimes we would lose one along the way,
and I'd worry over it.

224
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,943
My father...

225
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,742
My father would tell me

226
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,580
that the steer
would find its own way home.

227
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,624
And, often as not, they did.

228
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,922
Never occurred to me that we were
bringing them back for the slaughter.

229
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,682
How are you going to find your way now?

230
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm not sure you'll understand.

231
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,281
Sometimes I feel

232
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,535
like something's calling me.

233
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:58,462
Telling me there's a place for me
somewhere beyond all this.

234
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:03,842
I know that feeling, Dolores.
I know that feeling.

235
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,807
But you really don't want to go back
to your old life?

236
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,176
<i>Are you all right?</i>

237
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,057
Hey, hey. You all right?

238
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,105
I just got a chill. That's all.

239
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,858
Let's go back to the fire,
you're probably exhausted.

240
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,413
Just talk to him.

241
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,790
All right.

242
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:22,963
Uh, excuse me, sir?

243
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,381
I didn't want to intrude,

244
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,883
but I just had to say
that I'm such an admirer of yours.

245
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,719
<i>Your foundation
literally saved my sister's--</i>

246
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,472
One more word and I'll cut your throat.
You understand?

247
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,935
This is my fucking vacation.

248
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:52,617
Apparently, whatever they're looking for
is in the Ojal prison.

249
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,914
These lunatics plan to steal a cannon
from a Union cavalry unit.

250
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,416
Blast their way in.

251
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:05,088
I don't have time
for color-by-numbers bullshit.

252
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,929
I'll ride at dawn.

253
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,848
I'll go get whatever you want

254
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,267
out of that prison
and bring it back myself.

255
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,478
Suppose you make it out alive.
What's your price?

256
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,772
Nothing but a few words.

257
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,026
I want the story behind your tattoo.

258
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,112
What's your interest in it?

259
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,533
You ever heard of a man named Arnold?

260
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,537
You could say he was
the original settler of these parts.

261
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:43,210
He created a world where you could
do anything you want except one thing.

262
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,629
You can't die.

263
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,466
Which means
no matter how real this world seems,

264
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,468
it is still just a game.

265
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,513
But then
Arnold went and broke his own rule.

266
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,309
He died right here in the park.

267
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:04,189
Except I believe
he had one story left to tell.

268
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:11,988
A story with real stakes, real violence.

269
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:16,076
You could say
I'm here to honor his legacy.

270
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,330
<i>And I think your tattoo
is the next piece of the puzzle.</i>

271
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,918
So, do we have a wager?

272
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:30,006
You aim to break into a prison
and take out 20 men alone?

273
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,510
Not alone. I'll take Lawrence here.

274
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,554
And I'll need one match.

275
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,932
One match,

276
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,186
one pistol and one idiot.

277
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,358
I'll take those odds.

278
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,115
Hyah!

279
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,424
You gonna give me the silent treatment
the whole way there?

280
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,385
<i>You should've left me hanging
from those gallows.</i>

281
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:19,889
Least I could've died in peace
without having to hear you yammer.

282
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,686
Ahh...

283
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,151
Don't suppose you have a light?

284
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,569
No smoking in here.

285
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,487
<i>Normally, I'm sure,</i>

286
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,574
but this is the finest tobacco
a man can enjoy.

287
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:42,120
Hand-rolled on the ample thighs
of exotic women.

288
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,165
<i>Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.</i>

289
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,597
Choices, Lawrence.

290
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,933
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

291
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,603
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

292
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,314
Because if you did consider your choices,

293
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,442
you'd be confronted with a truth
you could not comprehend.

294
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,363
That no choice you ever made was your own.

295
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,866
You have always been a prisoner.

296
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,791
What if I told you
I'm here to set you free?

297
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:35,924
Hyah!

298
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,470
Whoa.

299
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,316
Let's go!

300
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,655
Horse thieves.

301
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,825
Damn fools shot up a couple of pokes
practically in front of us.

302
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,702
Well, the only fool I see
is the one standing right in front of me.

303
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,999
Deputy, you have there in your custody
the most wanted man in three territories.

304
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:16,506
<i>Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.</i>

305
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:18,925
Yeah.

306
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,845
Heard you slipped the rope.

307
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,222
<i>Dropped some damn good men in exchange.</i>

308
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,017
The way he tells it,
he's more partial to a firing squad.

309
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,437
<i>I reckon we'll be happy to oblige.</i>

310
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,198
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

311
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,869
Maybe someday.

312
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,456
Lock him up with the other man.

313
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,548
Enjoy the cigars.

314
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,842
Go fuck yourself.

315
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,430
<i>And just who are you supposed to be?</i>

316
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,725
Your salvation.

317
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,608
Hyah! Hyah!

318
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,339
<i>I don't believe we've ever met.</i>

319
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,175
No, we haven't.

320
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:48,973
You know, you always seemed like
a market-tested kind of thing.

321
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,144
Big gun, tasteful scar.

322
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:58,983
Locked in your little cycle
like a prized poodle after its own tail.

323
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,154
You sound like a man who's grown tired
of wearing his guts on the inside.

324
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:08,451
There's no need to get testy.
I'm just curious about your worldview.

325
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,163
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?

326
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,373
<i>It's simple.</i>

327
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,042
I believe that only the truly brave

328
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:19,045
can look at the world
and understand that all of it,

329
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:24,133
gods, men, everything else,

330
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,969
<i>will end badly.</i>

331
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,472
No one will be saved.

332
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,976
Maybe we've got more in common
than I thought.

333
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:36,980
What about you?
What turns of fate have brought you here?

334
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:41,526
It's a long story,
and we don't have the time.

335
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,404
Got more time than your friend, sadly.

336
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,365
<i>It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.</i>

337
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,659
Three days. Normally.

338
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,746
I'm afraid I don't have time for that,
so we're leaving now.

339
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,462
I've got a request for
a pyrotechnic effect.

340
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,841
<i>Los Diablos. Low-yield, two charges.</i>

341
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,095
Approved.

342
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,555
Authorizing.

343
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,204
Step lively, Hector.

344
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,264
- Any last words?
- Get it over with.

345
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,471
Motherfucker.

346
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,607
One match.

347
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,776
You're a capable man.

348
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,696
We could do with your help
where we're going.

349
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,281
- Afraid not.
- We owe you a debt.

350
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:55,952
No, your friend here
simply owes me a word or two.

351
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,789
<i>That'd do. And a word of advice.</i>

352
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:04,711
That thing you're looking for?
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

353
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,313
I was seven when they rode into my town.

354
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,400
Masked men in devils' horns.

355
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,487
They killed everyone.
Women, children, even the animals.

356
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,161
They gutted my mother from her jaw
to her sex.

357
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,998
<i>I had to paint her warm blood over my skin</i>

358
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,751
<i>to make sure that they would think
I was dead.</i>

359
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:49,338
Every one of them I tracked down,
I used their blood to paint my skin again.

360
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,342
Only one man left.

361
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,679
The head of the snake.

362
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,184
What's his name?

363
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,229
He has many names.

364
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,358
Most know him as Wyatt.

365
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:13,589
Hey, little girl, what is this?
What does it mean?

366
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,383
Don't waste your breath, lady.

367
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,177
That thing's
part of their so-called religion.

368
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,681
Ain't none of them's gonna tell you
nothing about that.

369
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,068
It's $5 for an hour.
$4 if you bathe first.

370
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,946
Well, if we just get the one,

371
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:40,616
do I get a discount
for being second and all?

372
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,869
I'm sure we can work something out.

373
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,288
Come on.

374
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:02,430
The tall one, I've seen him before,
hanging in the window of the post office.

375
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:05,057
Bandits? Do you think
they're here for something?

376
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,519
I think they're interested in
more than a turn at Franny's backside.

377
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,106
I think he rides with Hector.

378
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:15,067
Is that the one
they say lives out with the savages?

379
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,532
That's the one.

380
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,585
<i>Taking off? I just got here.</i>

381
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,378
You gave me what I needed.

382
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:40,092
So, is that all I'm good for?
Letting off a little stress?

383
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,802
Who says I'm stressed?

384
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,971
You have your tells.

385
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:51,020
Oh, yes, Bernard, master of observation.

386
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,864
Tomorrow, I have to talk to Ford.

387
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,532
Why?

388
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,952
He's creating chaos in the park.

389
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,663
And the board will be descending
at any moment.

390
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,290
I need to buy some time.

391
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,458
Some advice?

392
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,545
Best to not show him
you're nervous or defensive.

393
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,632
I have nothing to be defensive about.

394
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,676
Then don't cross your arms.

395
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,053
It's an ancient instinct.

396
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,139
The belly is the most vulnerable part
of every animal.

397
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,269
It's so sexy
being compared to a frightened beast.

398
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,897
There.

399
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,775
That's the posture you're looking for.

400
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:48,828
Sometimes, despite your best efforts,

401
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,707
- you can actually be quite charming.
- Hmm.

402
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,305
Have the neighbors complained?

403
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,267
Safe to say, they're asking questions.

404
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:16,522
The rocks would prefer not to move,
but we shall move them yet.

405
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,485
Perhaps I can help you with that.

406
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,698
The narrative you're creating
is clearly a massive endeavor.

407
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,366
<i>If you need more time,</i>

408
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,702
<i>I'm sure the board would be
happy to oblige.</i>

409
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:32,913
I'm sure they'd be happier
for me to delay it indefinitely.

410
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,501
Come with me.

411
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:53,142
You imagine I have gone mad, do you?
Lost my way?

412
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,438
We're simply concerned about
the extent of the changes you're making.

413
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,482
We want to protect your legacy.

414
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,650
My legacy?

415
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,488
Hmm.

416
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,658
You don't like this place very much,
do you?

417
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,204
I've seen many of you
come and go over the years,

418
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,290
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

419
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,000
and the ones who don't.

420
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:22,546
I admire it, the audacity of it.

421
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,925
- Oh.
- I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.

422
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,011
I came here once as a child
with my parents.

423
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,933
I think we even sat at this table.
Or maybe that one.

424
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,024
When I started working here,

425
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,486
I realized this place wasn't something
I would enjoy.

426
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,695
Ah.

427
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,450
In the beginning,

428
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:54,995
I imagined
things would be perfectly balanced.

429
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,834
Even had a bet with my partner, Arnold,
to that effect.

430
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,710
We made 100 hopeful storylines.

431
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,088
Of course,
almost no one took us up on them.

432
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:06,340
I lost the bet.

433
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:11,470
Arnold always held
a somewhat dim view of people.

434
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:13,514
He preferred the hosts.

435
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:17,017
He begged me to not let you people in,
the moneymen.

436
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,727
<i>Delos.</i>

437
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,437
<i>But I told him we'd be fine,</i>

438
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,940
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

439
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:28,320
It's not a business venture,
not a theme park, but an entire world.

440
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,323
<i>We designed every inch of it.</i>

441
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,287
Every blade of grass.

442
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,005
In here, we were gods.

443
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,634
And you were merely our guests.

444
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:11,989
And how did that work out for Arnold?

445
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:16,243
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

446
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,204
He went mad.

447
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,832
I haven't, as you well know.

448
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,044
I have always seen things

449
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,296
very clearly.

450
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,846
This is the table I sat at
with my parents.

451
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,768
This is the chair I sat in.

452
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,980
We know everything about our guests,
don't we?

453
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,691
As we know everything about our employees.

454
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,781
I do hope
you will be careful with Bernard.

455
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,995
He has a sensitive disposition.

456
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:05,626
I beg your pardon, <i>señorita.</i>

457
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:16,387
<i>There have been
many of you over the years,</i>

458
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:17,638
<i>and we have always...</i>

459
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:20,683
Almost always,
found a way to make it work.

460
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:25,145
So, I will ask you nicely.

461
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:30,567
Please don't get in my way.

462
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,835
The board will agree with me.

463
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,296
They'll be sending a representative.

464
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:53,841
But they already have.
I thought they would've told you.

465
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,682
That won't be necessary, Manu.
Not anymore. You can join the others.

466
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:22,328
You can tell the board that my narrative
will be completed on time,

467
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:28,167
and it won't be a retrospective,
as I'm sure you have all feared.

468
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,510
I'm not the sentimental type.

469
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,274
Holden says
this Slim's got a whole gang with him.

470
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:54,943
So, I need you to stay here.

471
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,072
If you're outnumbered, the last thing
you need is somebody standing by.

472
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,574
- I can help.
- No. No, no, no.

473
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:03,619
Um, I know it doesn't make
any sense to you,

474
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:05,621
but I can't get hurt in there,
but you can.

475
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,623
I would hate to see that happen.

476
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,335
Just stay here. Okay? Be safe.

477
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,973
- Aw. Did you get a goodbye kiss?
- Shut up.

478
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,435
Seriously, if you don't bang her
by tomorrow, I'm calling dibs.

479
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:31,105
Okay, listen up.
It's gonna be a bag of nails in there.

480
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,273
Slim and his boys got us outnumbered.

481
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:37,861
On top of that, there's a family
runs this place. Good people.

482
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,989
We need to make sure that snake-hearted
son of a bitch doesn't try to--

483
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Risk, reward. We get it.

484
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:46,161
Come on. Let's go fuck these fuckers up.

485
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:52,000
The fuck is that? Huh?

486
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,921
- I look like a dog to you? Huh?
- No, sir.

487
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:58,924
Feed that to them.

488
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,138
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

489
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:05,681
Oh, God!

490
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,876
Did I fucking tell you, or what?

491
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:39,381
Ah.

492
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,823
Ooh.

493
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,829
Upgrade. Nice.

494
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:17,878
Ain't normally the type
to complain, but this is just foolhardy.

495
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,880
Two men taking on Wyatt.

496
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:23,425
Keep talking, and I'm gonna
take the horse back, Lawrence.

497
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:28,305
Wyatt's freaks just wiped out
the last group that went seeking him out.

498
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:31,808
And here we are riding right after him.

499
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:37,606
I'm just trying to convince you

500
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:41,109
not to get yourself,
and me as a bystander, killed.

501
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:44,488
I'm not gonna get myself killed.

502
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,616
Don't think I didn't notice
that distinction.

503
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:11,723
Looks like Wyatt's men
left somebody behind after all.

504
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,769
It's Teddy.

505
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:19,231
I should've guessed.

506
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,609
Please, put me out of my misery.

507
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,571
I'm sorry, Teddy.

508
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:29,783
It looks like misery's all you got.

509
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,330
<i>Let me out of this, God damn it!</i>

510
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,332
That reward
is dead or alive, right?

511
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,501
Always best to bring 'em in alive.

512
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,295
Can we at least gag him?

513
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:43,297
That's a fine idea.

514
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:44,840
Ooh.

515
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,012
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

516
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,764
Look, I know you're in it for the money.
You ain't no real lawman.

517
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:56,393
- Shut up, you.
- Look, my boss, El Lazo,

518
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,981
he'll pay you twice what the marshals will
if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.

519
00:49:01,148 --> 00:49:03,358
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey--

520
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:04,860
These men won't--

521
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,365
- What the fuck?
<i>- Relax, man.</i>

522
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,452
You have no idea how lucky we just got.

523
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,245
Lucky? You just shot an innocent man!

524
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:18,457
No, he is a robot, just like her,
and just like Slim here,

525
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:21,168
except that Slim works for El Lazo,

526
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:25,213
and El Lazo is our ticket
to the best ride in the park.

527
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
Your bullshit mission
led us right to an Easter egg.

528
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,263
You're not going to let him go.

529
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,223
Well, well. Look at you.

530
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,685
You're starting to grow on me, farm girl.
Now, out of the way.

531
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,313
Whoa.

532
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,814
Don't you dare.

533
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:46,652
See? This is gonna be fun!
Now we're each gonna have one.

534
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,737
I won't fuck mine either.

535
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,072
You're disgusting.

536
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,490
Just an acquired taste.

537
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,241
You're gonna grow to love me, I promise.

538
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,537
Come on. Hmm?

539
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,249
Come on.

540
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,752
Go black hat with me.

541
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,089
Come on.
You got to, you know, save the girl.

542
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,590
Now give me a little something.

543
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,759
What is your problem?
The second we get away

544
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:12,844
from the real world,
you turn into an evil prick.

545
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:14,846
Evil?

546
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,932
It's a fucking game, Billy!

547
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,060
<i>- Don't call me Billy!
- Are you still trying to impress her?</i>

548
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:23,105
Because I guarantee she does not
give a shit about how you play this game.

549
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,607
<i>- Do you, Dolores?</i>
- What's he talking about, William?

550
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:29,611
She will be just fine
with a trip down the dark side.

551
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,697
And so will you.

552
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:36,618
Trust me.

553
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,795
So, which way to Pariah?

554
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:50,132
Aw, you just let me
take it from here.

555
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,305
All right, time for the floor show.

556
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,475
Got some guests
riding with Hector this time.

557
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,998
Let's give them something to shoot at.

558
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:25,459
Re-task a few of those soldiers.

559
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:30,130
If you're riding into our town
under the company of armed men,

560
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:32,299
<i>you'll need to state your business.</i>

561
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:34,176
Mayhem.

562
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,764
Well, hello there. I want to talk.

563
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,183
Interesting way
of starting a conversation.

564
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,436
Oh, it's an interesting kind of day.

565
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,572
Now, my lovely friend,

566
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:41,034
what deal is it you want to make?

567
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,662
You're here for what's in the safe.

568
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:45,580
And how would you know that?

569
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:49,918
I can always tell when a man wants
something that's not on the menu.

570
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:55,423
I'll give you the combination
in exchange for some answers.

571
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,300
<i>You assume I have any answers.</i>

572
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,305
This world is madness.

573
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:06,017
I want to know about this.

574
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:09,229
I've got a couple families

575
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:11,106
in the homestead
who changed their itinerary.

576
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:12,941
They're headed into town.

577
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:16,736
<i>Should be there in 20 minutes or so.
Place is a bloodbath.</i>

578
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:21,575
Fine. Cut these guys off.
Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.

579
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:31,626
Oh, shit.

580
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,008
We'll give them a night in lockup,
then have one of the girls at the Mariposa

581
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:39,843
bring them a key
hidden in their breakfast.

582
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,470
If the guests are squared away,
let's wrap it up.

583
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,640
This is a shade.

584
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,729
Sacred native lore.
They make figures of 'em.

585
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,649
Sixty.

586
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,701
And what does this shade do?

587
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:07,078
You've seen this?

588
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:08,788
What is it?

589
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,374
<i>The man who walks between worlds.</i>

590
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:15,128
They were sent from hell
to oversee our world.

591
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:19,257
Forty-seven.

592
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:35,315
Is this the last thing you required of me?

593
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:39,527
'Cause we need a little more time
than the constabulary will allow.

594
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,488
Sweetheart, if I took
that manner of interest in you,

595
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,865
you'd have no say
in how long we'd need whatsoever.

596
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:51,456
I thought I was crazy,

597
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:56,252
but I got shot here.

598
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:00,507
- There's no wound.
- No.

599
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:01,841
But I was shot.

600
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:06,388
And this was standing over me.
And then it was as if it never happened.

601
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,725
I want you to cut me right there.

602
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:31,371
I'm not in the habit
of cutting into defenseless women.

603
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,957
Some big, bad outlaw.

604
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:36,876
The Dreamwalker said there were some
who could see them.

605
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:41,423
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

606
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,967
To see the masters who pull your strings.

607
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:51,224
They don't know
what they're talking about.

608
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:03,570
You wanna die lying down
or up on your feet?

609
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,864
Go to hell.

610
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,426
Go on, then.

611
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,055
This would be the first goddamn time

612
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,931
I've had to ask a man
to put his hands on me twice.

613
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,668
<i>Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire!</i>

614
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:03,338
What does it mean?

615
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,049
That I'm not crazy after all.

616
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:08,009
<i>Last chance, Escaton!</i>

617
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,345
<i>Come out or we're shooting!</i>

618
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:15,725
And that none of this matters.
