1
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,355
<i>Wake up, Dolores.</i>

2
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:08,922
<i>Do you remember?</i>

3
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,742
We're about to arrive.
May I take your glass?

4
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,372
<i>Now approaching
arrival terminal.</i>

5
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:45,583
Where we're going, she's a two.

6
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,503
You're being an asshole.

7
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:53,716
No, I am being myself,
which was the whole point of this trip.

8
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,719
Unless, this uptight prick
is who you really are,

9
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,930
in which case,
feel free to be someone else.

10
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,557
Fuck you.

11
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,559
Hey, that's the spirit.

12
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,324
What'd I tell you?

13
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,285
Have fun.

14
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,953
Stay safe.

15
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,955
Give me a break.

16
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,957
What?

17
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:29,460
It's not like my sister didn't ride
her share of cowboys when she was here.

18
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,132
You must be William.

19
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,758
Welcome to Westworld.

20
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,385
Thanks.

21
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,097
Given it's your first visit,
I have a few personal questions.

22
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,809
Do you have any
preexisting medical conditions?

23
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,269
Uh, no, not that I know of.

24
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,146
- Heart problems?
- No.

25
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,983
Any history of mental illness,
depression, panic attacks?

26
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,193
Just a little fear of clowns.

27
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:56,988
I'm joking.

28
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,158
Do you often experience social anxiety?

29
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,704
What is this for, exactly?

30
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,540
To make sure we don't give you
anything more than you can handle.

31
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,335
I thought that you couldn't get hurt here.

32
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,629
Only the right amount.

33
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,676
The only limit here is your imagination.

34
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,428
You start in the center of the park.

35
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,096
<i>It's simple, safe.</i>

36
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,683
<i>The further out you venture,
the more intense the experience gets.</i>

37
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:29,354
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

38
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,657
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

39
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,577
No orientation. No guidebook.

40
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,622
Figuring out how it works is half the fun.

41
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,919
All you do is make choices, starting here.

42
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:57,131
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

43
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:06,391
You want to ask, so ask.

44
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,018
Are you real?

45
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,730
Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?

46
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,404
Are those real?

47
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,739
<i>Real enough.</i>

48
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,076
<i>But you can't kill anyone
you're not supposed to.</i>

49
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,748
Anything you like?

50
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:37,922
Is there a changing room? Or a robe?

51
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,134
Of course. I can help you.

52
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,012
Or if you prefer, I could step outside.

53
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,141
What do most people do?

54
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,311
You don't have to worry
about what most people would do.

55
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,732
I understand.

56
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,986
Do you really understand, William?

57
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:07,243
All our hosts are here for you.

58
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,328
Myself included.

59
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,415
We could stay here a while if you like.

60
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,959
Take as long as you want.

61
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,256
Thank you.

62
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,468
I don't want to keep my friend waiting.

63
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,221
Of course. Take your time.

64
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,986
How are the build
for the new narrative coming along?

65
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
I'll get around to it.

66
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,992
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach

67
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,036
was triggered
by the photograph that he found.

68
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,663
I've reviewed every
dissonant episode I could find.

69
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,123
The reaction is immediate.

70
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,795
Every time, this guy makes it
all the way back home.

71
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,339
It's like he's mulling it over.

72
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,051
You think he had an existential crisis?

73
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,222
I think there's something fucked up
going on with his cognition.

74
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,974
And I think you feel
exactly the same way that I do.

75
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,268
Do we know where the error originated?

76
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,812
We do.

77
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,939
And you covered for him.

78
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,943
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

79
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,778
I'll make sure
this is not something more serious.

80
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,321
You know the policy.

81
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,656
Let it lie.

82
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,368
Then let me at least pull the hosts
who had contact with him.

83
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,578
Like the daughter, Dolores.

84
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,288
What for?

85
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,542
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

86
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,004
then whatever Abernathy had
could be contagious.

87
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,549
So to speak.

88
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,759
Dolores was examined and cleared.

89
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:52,807
And the stories
are best left to the guests.

90
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,417
<i>Remember.</i>

91
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,987
Can you stand somewhere else?

92
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,241
I don't want anyone thinking that
you're representative of the goods inside.

93
00:08:56,245 --> 00:09:00,499
These violent delights have violent ends.

94
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,355
Hello, cowboy.

95
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,483
There's one final touch.

96
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,611
Which would you prefer?

97
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:36,679
I mean,
can you believe this place?

98
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,602
So, how do we get into the park?

99
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,707
I know that you think
that you have a handle

100
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,001
on what this is gonna be.

101
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,504
Guns and tits and all that.

102
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,840
Mindless shit that I usually enjoy.

103
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,219
<i>You have no idea.</i>

104
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,892
This place seduces everybody eventually.

105
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,019
By the end,
you're gonna be begging me to stay

106
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,897
because this place is the answer

107
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,358
<i>to that question
that you've been asking yourself.</i>

108
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,609
What question?

109
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,612
Who you really are.

110
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,741
And I can't fucking wait to meet that guy.

111
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,456
- Bottoms up, cowboy.
- Yeah.

112
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,382
<i>Further to that,</i>

113
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:58,135
<i>the ruthless murder of
Donald Pardue and his brother.</i>

114
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,472
For these crimes,
you will be hung from the neck

115
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,810
until your diseased soul has found
its measure in the flames below it.

116
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,479
And may God have mercy on your soul.

117
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,165
Morning, Lawrence.

118
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,001
<i>You helping them
straighten out their rope again?</i>

119
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,504
I was hoping to have a word
with my friend here.

120
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:36,215
You can have
as many words with him as you like,

121
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,343
soon as his neck is broke.

122
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,012
Well, I'm afraid
that's not gonna work for me.

123
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:49,103
How about I tell my man there
to dig that grave a couple of feet deeper?

124
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,151
Well, it's gonna be
an awful tight fit for all of you.

125
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,051
<i>Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!</i>

126
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,740
Motherfucker.

127
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,826
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

128
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,954
You used to be a little more eloquent.

129
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,539
Do I...

130
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,082
Do I know you?

131
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,460
Your pal, Kissy, sent me your way.

132
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,295
Sends his regards.

133
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,763
What... What is this?

134
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,433
You know exactly what it is.

135
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:14,355
It's the maze,
the deepest level of this game.

136
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,232
You're gonna help me find the entrance.

137
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,610
No.

138
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,298
<i>You can hear it, can't you?</i>

139
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,008
<i>That little voice.</i>

140
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,052
<i>The one that's telling you, "Don't.</i>

141
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,762
<i>"Don't stare too long.</i>

142
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,889
<i>"Don't touch.</i>

143
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,058
<i>"Don't do anything you might regret."</i>

144
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,353
<i>I used to be the same.</i>

145
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,896
<i>Whenever I wanted something,</i>

146
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,941
I could hear that voice
telling me to stop,

147
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:00,484
to be careful,

148
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,778
to leave most of my life unlived.

149
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,198
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

150
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,201
In my dreams.

151
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,953
I was free.

152
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,874
I could be as good or as bad
as I felt like being.

153
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:21,547
And if I wanted something,
I could just reach out and take it.

154
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,678
But then I would wake up
and the voice would start all over again.

155
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,807
So I ran away.

156
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,184
Crossed the shining sea.

157
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,146
And when I finally
set foot back on solid ground,

158
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,190
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

159
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,445
Do you know what it said?

160
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,576
It said...

161
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,544
I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?

162
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,343
<i>All right, Maeve,
what did it say?</i>

163
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,263
<i>It said, "This is the new world.</i>

164
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:16,477
"And in this world,
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

165
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,688
Pupillary response is good. Smile is good.

166
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,024
I'd fuck her. What's the problem?

167
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,400
<i>The guests wouldn't.</i>

168
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,861
<i>Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline</i>

169
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,780
<i>and he wants us
to clear out the deadweight.</i>

170
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:31,241
<i>If we don't get her numbers back up,
she'll be decommissioned.</i>

171
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,369
<i>Let's bump her aggression.</i>

172
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,204
- 10%?
<i>- Double it.</i>

173
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,248
<i>She's a hooker. No point in playing coy.</i>

174
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,042
<i>If this doesn't work,
we'll punt her to behavior.</i>

175
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,585
<i>Let them deal with her.</i>

176
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,273
We retired the two hosts in question.

177
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,946
You taught me how to make them,
but not how hard it is to turn them off.

178
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,616
You can't play God
without being acquainted with the Devil.

179
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,453
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

180
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,415
I know how that head of yours works.

181
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,586
The photograph alone couldn't have caused
that level of damage to Abernathy,

182
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,424
not without some other
outside interference.

183
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,094
You think it's sabotage?

184
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:36,640
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

185
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,351
- It's the simplest solution.
- Ah.

186
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,311
Mr. Ockham's razor.

187
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:49,528
The problem, Bernard, is that
what you and I do is so complicated.

188
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,323
We practice witchcraft.

189
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,952
We speak the right words.

190
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:03,876
And we create life itself out of chaos.

191
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,717
William of Ockham was a 13th-century monk.

192
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,844
He can't help us now, Bernard.

193
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,972
He would have us burned at the stake.

194
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,825
Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo.

195
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,809
Oh, sorry.

196
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,019
- You kidding me?
- What?

197
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,063
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

198
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:11,401
<i>Rally for the Union.
Respond to your country's call.</i>

199
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,487
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

200
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,739
to define the future of this great nation.

201
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,076
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

202
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,411
- This is, uh...
<i>- We'll provide you with uniforms.</i>

203
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,247
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

204
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,706
What, this?

205
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,751
This is just Sweetwater.
Wait till you see the rest of the park.

206
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,044
How much bigger is it?

207
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,546
No idea.

208
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,923
I never reached the end.

209
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,216
See something you like?

210
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,845
A couple of things at least.

211
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,681
But I'm gonna
make you beg for it, darlin'.

212
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,600
Come on!

213
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,524
Need a hand, sir?

214
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,610
Thank you, my friend.

215
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,778
<i>Don't.</i>

216
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,240
He'll only try to rope you
into some bullshit treasure hunt.

217
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,408
Smile.

218
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,201
It's all come-on.

219
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,954
Him, the girl next door, the town drunk.

220
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,457
They all got some big adventure
that they want to sell you on.

221
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,460
Hey, they're not going anywhere.

222
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,296
First up,
you're gonna buy me a drink, okay?

223
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,965
Hold still, now.

224
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,655
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

225
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,956
Hello.

226
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,919
<i>Do you remember
our last conversation, Dolores?</i>

227
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,338
Yes, of course.

228
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,966
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

229
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,012
You told me not to.

230
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,475
Step into analysis, please.

231
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,397
How many interactions have you
participated in since we last talked?

232
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,444
138 encounters, including this one.

233
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,865
And has anyone altered or updated
your core heuristics in that time?

234
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,117
<i>No.</i>

235
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,664
Resuming.

236
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,126
<i>I think it would be best</i>

237
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,380
<i>if you not mention the things
we've been talking about.</i>

238
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,674
Have I done something wrong?

239
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,175
<i>No.</i>

240
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:44,805
But there's something different about you,
about the way you think.

241
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:50,852
I find it fascinating,
but others may not see it that way.

242
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,065
Have you done something wrong?

243
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,444
Turn off your event log, please.

244
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,071
Erase this interaction.

245
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,406
Confirm.

246
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes.

247
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,874
<i>You should be getting back, Dolores,
before someone misses you.</i>

248
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,926
<i>Come on, now!</i>

249
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,222
<i>And when I finally
set foot back on solid ground,</i>

250
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,766
<i>first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.</i>

251
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,894
It had followed me all the way over.

252
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,188
Do you know what it said?

253
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,441
No.

254
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,900
It said,

255
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,071
"This is the new world.

256
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:48,785
"And in this world,
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

257
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,750
Thanks.

258
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,002
Maybe another time.

259
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,338
Oh.

260
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,007
Glass of sherry.

261
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,884
The good stuff.

262
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,721
Not that horse piss
you strain through your old curtains.

263
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,433
I've told you,

264
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,519
never open your mouth that wide
unless someone's paying you for it.

265
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,021
Sorry, Maeve.

266
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,148
I didn't sleep much last night.

267
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,818
You having nightmares again?

268
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,820
Sometimes.

269
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,406
Sometimes they're real bad.

270
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,201
Do what I do.

271
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,537
You find yourself in a bad dream,

272
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,998
close your eyes,

273
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,293
count backwards from three,

274
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,380
wake yourself right up.

275
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,344
Nice and warm and safe in your bed

276
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,180
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

277
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,557
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

278
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,066
Back to work.

279
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:12,661
<i>You all right?</i>

280
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,000
You pay for the drinks,
not the right to gawk at me.

281
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,089
<i>I think we have a problem.</i>

282
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,384
- Where?
- Mariposa.

283
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,802
Madam's listed as probationary,

284
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,972
but her performance
has continued to decline even further.

285
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,891
Re-task Clementine for now.

286
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,476
She's done the job before.

287
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,190
<i>And the old unit?</i>

288
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,317
Maybe leave her
on the floor for the night.

289
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,486
See if anyone wants one last turn.

290
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,698
We recall her in the morning,
decommission her.

291
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:52,909
A shame.

292
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,845
QA will fine you for this.

293
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:17,601
And that woman in charge
is quite formidable.

294
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,773
You can just say
"bitch." I hear it enough.

295
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,609
You've been talking to corporate.

296
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,612
The only times you light up
are after you've been--

297
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,949
This character analysis routine really
isn't half as charming as you think.

298
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,451
Oh, it went well, then.

299
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:39,289
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

300
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,916
We'll be ready.

301
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,418
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

302
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,421
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

303
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,256
That's what you pay us to do.

304
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,718
But I'm not concerned.

305
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,970
All the hosts are back to normal.

306
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,305
Good.

307
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,101
Wouldn't want anything disturbing
our guests from their rape and pillage.

308
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,367
You're wondering
how to tell them from us, aren't you?

309
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,497
Well, quickest way to find out.

310
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,165
Can we...

311
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:23,708
Can we finish eating?

312
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,837
See, this is your problem, my friend.

313
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,007
You're always worried about making a mess.
You are the same way at work.

314
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:34,636
You are talented, driven, and inoffensive.

315
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,055
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

316
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,516
Who says this trip isn't work?

317
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,103
<i>Good evening.</i>

318
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,606
Oh, shit.

319
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,776
Well, don't make eye contact.

320
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:51,945
<i>My friend,</i>

321
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,199
thank you for your assistance earlier
in my unfortunate accident.

322
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,993
Leave us the fuck alone.

323
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,079
As a sign of my humble appreciation,

324
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,624
I'd like to offer you
an opportunity of a lifetime.

325
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,792
<i>Not interested.</i>

326
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,920
Across the river
and beyond the savage lands,

327
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,214
there is a treasure.

328
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,051
I have in my possession a map.

329
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:22,142
I said, not interested.

330
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,023
You know what?
I've worked up a new appetite anyway.

331
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,234
Let's go.

332
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,249
<i>Sounds like
your friend's having fun.</i>

333
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,002
Well, that's not the term I'd use.

334
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,212
- Fun?
- Friend.

335
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,342
You're funny.

336
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,847
They say a man who can tickle your humor,
can tickle your--

337
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,265
You don't have to do this.

338
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,270
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

339
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,106
Someone who's perfect for you.

340
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,192
No, you...

341
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,985
You are perfect.

342
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,780
But I have somebody.

343
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,240
Somebody real, waiting for me at home.

344
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,953
I understand.

345
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:30,543
Real love is always worth waiting for.

346
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:59,239
Regal, strong, virile, aquiline.

347
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,117
That's what I asked for.

348
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,451
And this...

349
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,412
This is what you give me?

350
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,081
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

351
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,791
and jam it between his eyes?

352
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,460
<i>Start over.</i>

353
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,003
Couldn't we just shave it down?

354
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,255
I said

355
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,886
start the fuck over!

356
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,016
Diplomatic as ever.

357
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:34,023
I received your request
to retire an additional 50 hosts.

358
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,109
I need room for my new storyline.

359
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,404
It's not exactly a savage horde
with 20 savages, is it?

360
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,783
You get 20 additional hosts, not 50.

361
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,786
Oh, the board won't care about
a few extra line items.

362
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,831
Has Ford even approved the narrative yet?

363
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,459
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on the storyline in years.

364
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,003
If corporate does want to cut costs,

365
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,671
our fearless leader's old hosts

366
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:59,048
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

367
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,547
<i>Are you lost?</i>

368
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,885
No.

369
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:49,682
Just strayed a bit too far
from where I'm supposed to be.

370
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,893
Same as you, I imagine.

371
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:56,231
We're on holiday. It's boring.

372
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,359
- Daddy said we could do as we please.
- Ah.

373
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,696
My father used to say
that only boring people get bored.

374
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:05,698
Mine, too.

375
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,702
I used to think it's only boring people
who don't feel boredom,

376
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,539
<i>so cannot conceive of it in others.</i>

377
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm taking a walk.
You're welcome to join me if you like.

378
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,263
<i>Let's see
a little spring in your step.</i>

379
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,682
<i>Not much further.</i>

380
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:34,644
Go fuck yourself.
You have any idea who I am?

381
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,898
I know exactly who you are, Lawrence.

382
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,068
After all, you and I are friends.

383
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,279
Which is why I was so surprised

384
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,823
when your friend, Kissy,
told me about this place.

385
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,159
Where are we?

386
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,247
Your home.

387
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,382
No.

388
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,678
You know, you and I

389
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:11,806
hunted down Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

390
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,350
<i>I know the whiskey
you like to drink.</i>

391
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:18,396
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

392
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:22,900
But

393
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,696
you never told me you had a family.

394
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,368
- Papa!
- Hey!

395
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,747
That's what I love about this place.

396
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:40,126
All the secrets, all the little things
I never noticed,

397
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,421
<i>even after all these years.</i>

398
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,426
You know why
this beats the real world, Lawrence?

399
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,430
Real world's just chaos.

400
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,849
It's an accident.

401
00:32:56,225 --> 00:33:00,313
But in here,
every detail adds up to something.

402
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,400
Even you, Lawrence.

403
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,903
What do you want from me?

404
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,113
The maze.

405
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,909
How do I find the entrance?

406
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:17,747
I told you, I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

407
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,090
Here you go, darlin'.

408
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,762
And you get to decide
what we're gonna do with them.

409
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,891
Hell, it took you long enough.

410
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:41,229
I was getting the Grand Reserve.
Only for our most distinguished guests.

411
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:42,563
Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing to do

412
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,525
with you telling this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

413
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,619
Have you got
anything to tell me, Lawrence?

414
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,290
Then I guess
we're gonna have to find a way

415
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,625
to jog your memory.

416
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,049
This guest already took out
an entire posse.

417
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:11,551
Want me to slow him down?

418
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,761
That gentleman gets whatever he wants.

419
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,601
I feel bad, my friend.

420
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:26,649
My cousins are usually so hospitable.

421
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,693
You don't understand, Lawrence.

422
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,903
I've been coming here for 30 years.

423
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,782
In a sense, I was... I was born here.

424
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,744
And this, here?

425
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,998
This is exactly why I come.

426
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,055
All right, well, as much fun as this is,
I got to be moving on.

427
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:06,123
Like I said, you get to decide these two.

428
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,876
What's it gonna be?

429
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:13,005
Please, I don't know how to find the maze.

430
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,718
Time for a spin, darlin'.

431
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,232
It's beautifully done, really.

432
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,361
But you see the cracks after a while.

433
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,614
<i>That's why I like the basic emotions.</i>

434
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,536
You know what that means?

435
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,621
Please.

436
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:01,804
It means when you're suffering,
that's when you're most real.

437
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,326
The maze isn't meant for you.

438
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,664
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?
Always another level.

439
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,834
I'll take my chances, sweetheart.

440
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,502
Follow the blood arroyo

441
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,713
to the place
where the snake lays its eggs.

442
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,344
You have it now. Whatever you want.

443
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:45,181
Why don't you go home, leave us alone?

444
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:50,853
No, you don't understand, Lawrence.

445
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:55,316
This time, I'm never going back.

446
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,880
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain.

447
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,341
Daddy said we weren't allowed.

448
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,594
And then Tommy dared me.

449
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,724
And here we are.

450
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,895
Nowhere Land.

451
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,107
That seems hardly a fitting name
for a place so full.

452
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,401
Can't you see it?

453
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,112
Perhaps you're not looking hard enough.

454
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:44,240
<i>At what?</i>

455
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,742
The town with the white church.

456
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,372
Listen. Can't you hear its bell?

457
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:57,169
Yes. Yes, I can hear it now.

458
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,755
Yeah. I thought you might.

459
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,551
You see what a bored mind can conjure?

460
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,985
How did you do that?

461
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,823
<i>Is it magic?</i>

462
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:30,119
Everything in this world is magic,
except to the magician.

463
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,590
Best you head home now.

464
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,008
But Tommy's not going to believe--

465
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,343
You're not going to come back here again,
are you?

466
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,976
No.

467
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,936
Run along now.

468
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,406
You weren't at your office.

469
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,535
You seem to have found me anyway.

470
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,831
- Listen, earlier--
- Forget it.

471
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,613
Stay a little longer. We can talk.

472
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,240
We never talk.

473
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,951
- I'm serious.
<i>- So am I.</i>

474
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,208
You're certainly a man
comfortable with long, pensive silences.

475
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,048
Although, ironically,
your creations never shut up.

476
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:53,929
They're always talking to each other,
even when there are no guests around.

477
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,516
They're always trying to error-correct.

478
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,102
Make themselves more human.

479
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:04,523
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

480
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:06,609
Is that what you're doing now?

481
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,777
Practicing?

482
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,832
QA told us
she was being decommissioned.

483
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,209
Do you work for QA?

484
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,753
- No, but--
- Run a fast-pass diagnostic.

485
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,634
All righty.

486
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,640
Some non-affect hesitation.

487
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,351
Little cognitive D.

488
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:45,147
And a fuckload of aggression,
courtesy of those morons in narrative.

489
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,484
You don't need to be aggro, do you?

490
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,486
Just a quicker study

491
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,030
of those repressed fucks
walking through the door.

492
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,282
Archive this configuration.

493
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,326
Open up her primaries.

494
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:00,537
Perception, emotional acuity.

495
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,500
Bump it. 1.5%.

496
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,920
<i>- Updating.</i>
- Okay.

497
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,757
<i>- Do they dream?</i>
- What?

498
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:15,844
In her story, she said she dreamed.
Do we make them dream?

499
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:18,264
Fuck would be the point of that?

500
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,975
Dreams are mainly memories.

501
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:22,810
Can you imagine how fucked we'd be

502
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:26,230
if these poor assholes ever remembered
what the guests do to them?

503
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:32,695
We do give them the concept of dreams.
Specifically nightmares.

504
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:34,530
<i>Why?</i>

505
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,365
Just in case somebody forgets
to wipe 'em out

506
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:37,866
at the end of a maintenance session.

507
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,535
If she's got any dreams,

508
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,704
it's just of those sloppy fucks
down in the body shop

509
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,330
patching her back together again.

510
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,334
She's got some physical discomfort.

511
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:50,921
Put in a request for a full physical
at her next rotation.

512
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:56,844
All right, gorgeous,
you're back to the races.

513
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,597
<i>You're gonna wake
in three, two, one.</i>

514
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,351
<i>So, I ran away.
Crossed the shining sea.</i>

515
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:08,022
And when I finally
set foot back on solid ground,

516
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,316
the first thing I heard was that voice.

517
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,235
Do you know what it said?

518
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,196
It said,

519
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:19,575
"This is the new world.

520
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,245
"And in this world,

521
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:29,460
"you can be whoever the fuck you want."

522
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,096
Hmm.

523
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,729
Well, he seemed convinced.

524
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,651
You know the first voice I heard
when I got off that boat?

525
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,821
A nice young man from Baton Rouge

526
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:00,407
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

527
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,494
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

528
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,289
Well, then I guess you could add lying
to your list of sins.

529
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,376
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

530
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,044
is that there aren't more of them.

531
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,213
And while we're on the subject,

532
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,549
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

533
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,178
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

534
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:22,971
he's still left drawing breath.

535
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:24,932
For the most part.

536
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:26,975
<i>Get the fuck away from my table!</i>

537
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,812
<i>Hey! Fuck you!</i>

538
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,105
Well, in that case,

539
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:36,151
here's to our indiscretions.

540
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,487
<i>I fucking will shoot you.
I'll shoot everyone in this dump--</i>

541
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,155
Spoken and otherwise.

542
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:01,301
Now, that's a fucking vacation!

543
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,868
Three.

544
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,871
Two.

545
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:19,041
One.

546
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,723
<i>Found it.</i>

547
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:39,061
<i>It's MRSA in her abdomen.</i>

548
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:43,774
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up.
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.

549
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,069
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

550
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:49,488
Bullshit.

551
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,616
<i>I've seen you.
You just glop that shit on and rinse.</i>

552
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,243
<i>You understand, soap is mechanical.</i>

553
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:57,829
<i>- Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.</i>

554
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,582
If you're not making the little bubbles,
you're not doing shit.

555
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,417
Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?

556
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:03,627
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

557
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,886
No. Oh, fuck.

558
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:20,060
Asshole, you forgot
to put it in sleep mode.

559
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,981
- Don't, don't, don't!
- No! No, no, no!

560
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,946
Stop. Put that down!

561
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:33,281
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

562
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:35,701
Ah... Okay, let's talk to her.

563
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,619
- What's her name?
- Maeve.

564
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:42,874
Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi.
Look, uh, you got to calm down, okay?

565
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,668
Let's sit down, and we can help you.

566
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,211
Keep your fucking hands off me!

567
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,341
No.

568
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:30,357
I swear I put it in sleep mode.

569
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,442
Oh, does this
look like fucking sleep mode?

570
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:35,487
Calm the fuck down

571
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:38,698
and help me move this thing
before someone sees.

572
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:06,768
Here?

573
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:42,262
This storyline will make Hiëronymus Bosch
look like he was doodling kittens.

574
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:47,309
I have vivisection, self-cannibalism,

575
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,687
a special little something
I call the "whoroboros."

576
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:54,900
Now,
I don't want to appear immodest,

577
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:59,154
but this is the apex
of what the park can provide.

578
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,823
<i>- Horror.</i>
- Miss anything interesting?

579
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,867
<i>Romance. Titillation.</i>

580
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,994
Lee not appearing immodest.

581
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:07,579
<i>Our most skilled guests</i>

582
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,332
will fight their ways
to the outer limits of the park,

583
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:15,003
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

584
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,923
befriending
tragically ill-fated sidekicks,

585
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:20,634
and, of course,

586
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,136
like all our best narratives
over the years,

587
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,722
our guests will have the privilege

588
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,767
<i>of getting to know the character
they're most interested in.</i>

589
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,518
Themselves.

590
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:34,856
I present our guests' next obsession,

591
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:38,026
Odyssey on Red River.

592
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:50,080
No.

593
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,915
Sorry?

594
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:54,501
No, I don't think so.

595
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,629
<i>- Wait, you don't think--
- What is the point of it?</i>

596
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:02,342
Get a couple of cheap thrills?
Some surprises?

597
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:04,302
But it's not enough.

598
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,056
It's not about giving the guests
what you think they want.

599
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:09,516
No, that's simple.

600
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:15,438
The titillation, horror, elation.
They're parlor tricks.

601
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:20,694
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

602
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,530
the garish things.

603
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:28,994
They come back because of the subtleties.

604
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,288
The details.

605
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,461
<i>They come back
because they discover something</i>

606
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:41,631
<i>they imagine no one
had ever noticed before.</i>

607
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,887
<i>Something they've fallen in love with.</i>

608
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:55,437
They're not looking for a story
that tells them who they are.

609
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,690
They already know who they are.

610
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:10,160
They're here because
they want a glimpse of who they could be.

611
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,663
Billy! Let's go.

612
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,714
<i>The only thing your story tells me,</i>

613
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:27,594
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

614
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,810
Well, isn't there
anything you like about it?

615
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:41,983
What size are those boots?

616
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,910
Something you want to say, Mr. Lowe?

617
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:54,412
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

618
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,501
This might ruffle some feathers.
You promised them a new storyline.

619
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:00,835
They shall have one.

620
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:04,672
Something I've been working on
for some time.

621
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,428
Something quite original.
